**Date:** May 28th - June 1st, 2025
**Location:** REVA Halle Eissport, Robert Kunz-Straße 2b, 4840 Vöcklabruck, Austria

The [European Pinball Championship](https://www.epc2025.at/) (or EPC) is an annual tournament which is usually hosted by a different European country each year. Last year it was held in Warsaw in Poland, but this year it was the turn of Austria, and it proved to be a very different and very special event.

[![The REVA Halle Eissport in Vöcklabruck](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/001-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x678.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/001-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

The REVA Halle Eissport in Vöcklabruck

The EPC was organised by Stefan Riedler, owner of [RS-Pinball](https://www.rs-pinball.at/), a large, proactive pinball dealership handling all the major brands. His long-standing relationships with these pinball companies helped secure their support with machines, prizes and special guests.

[![Stefan Riedler](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/053-european-pinball-championship-2025-577x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/053-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Stefan Riedler

Stefan was determined to make this EPC Austria’s biggest ever pinball event, working with pinball associations and clubs across the country to expand the event far beyond just the EPC tournament. In fact, there were seven official tournaments and a couple of smaller fun tournaments held over the five days.

A large-scale event like this called for a suitably large-scale venue.

RS-Pinball is headquartered in the city of [Vöcklabruck](https://www.voecklabruck.at/) in the Upper Austria region, and Stefan is Chairman of the FlippArena pinball club, also in Vöcklabruck. FlippArena houses around fifty pinballs but isn’t large enough to be able to host the EPC. Fortunately, the city is also home to the 2,000m2 [REVA Halle Eissport](https://www.facebook.com/REVA.Halle/) – an ice skating rink owned by five local municipalities, which closes down and de-ices from February to October, allowing it to host exhibitions, banquets and other indoor events.

A deal was done, making the REVA Halle Eissport the venue for the EPC 2025, with the dates set as Wednesday 28th May to Sunday 1st June.

However, that only provided the bare building. Everything else that goes into a major pinball event had to be brought in. There were the machines, of course, but also all the power distribution, carpeting, a presentation stage with a large LED wall, numerous monitors, stands, computers, a PA system, multiple huge banners, all the signage, a well-stocked bar, catering facilities, a dining/resting area with seating and tables, EPC merchandise and a whole lot more.

That even included digging up the parking area to install Gigabit fibre for the Internet connection. The existing fibre-to-the-cabinet connection only provided 40Mbps download and around a third of that for uploads. With 300+ EPC attendees expected – nearly all of whom would have phones and computers to connect – plus live streaming of the tournaments and seminars, getting full-fibre along with a vastly upgraded cabled and Wi-Fi system was a must. The venue didn’t want to pay towards the upgrade work, so Stefan and his team had to arrange to have it all installed for the EPC, and then taken down afterwards.

So, let’s take a look around the REVA Halle.

[![The view of the REVA Halle from the entrance](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/002-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/002-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

The view of the REVA Halle from the entrance

The venue was split into three main zones.

At the front was the bar and seating area where guests could relax, enjoy the food and drinks for sale, and watch the big screen showing the live streaming of the tournaments provided by [JDL Pinball](https://www.twitch.tv/jdl_pinball). This area also included the registration desk for pre-registered players to sign-in and collect their badges, or for on-the-day visitors to purchase their free play entry.

In the centre of the hall is where we find the free play machines. There were two long rows of back-to-back pinballs, with more on either side wall. The ten machines for the Jersey Jack High Score Tournament were on the left side wall, while a selection of custom games were positioned against the opposite side wall.

The back is where the bulk of the tournament machines were found. This area was sub-divided, with the modern main EPC machines in front, and the Classic Tournament games right at the back of the hall in their own section.

**Front Area**

So, on the left side as you enter the hall was the bar which also served pre-made and made-to-order hot food.

[![Some of the food items available to purchase](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/003-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x689.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/003-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Some of the food items available to purchase

At the far end of the bar, frozen pizzas and pizza breads were cooked-to-order in a bank of pizza ovens. In between, a row of fridges ensured bottled drinks kept their cool, even if one or two of the tournament players might lose theirs from time to time.

The seating area

If a greater choice of refreshments was desired, next door to the REVA Halle is a large Maximarkt supermarket operated by Spar, although it was closed on the Thursday (which was a public holiday) and on the Sunday too.

On the right side as they entered, EPC attendees could sign-in for the tournaments and collect their registration packs which included posters, flyers, keychains, pin badges and, if purchased in advance, a special commemorative EPC T-shirt.

Further EPC merchandise was also available, including a printed microfibre cloth, posters and lanyards. Other assorted pinball T-shirts could be purchased here too.

T-shirts and cloths

Behind the registration desk was a lobby area where the event’s seminars were held. More on that a little later.

A little further into the hall, [Fine Designs](https://finedesigns.com/) had a stand where they could print customised clothing and other apparel. Customers picked the logos they wanted from a selection, and those designs were then heat transferred onto the clothing or fabric bags.

[![The Fine Designs printing stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/020-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/020-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

**Free Play Area**

In the middle we have the free play machines. Stefan’s association with both manufacturers and collectors allowed him to put together a display of machines unlike any other event we can recall.

His desire was to have the entire range of titles from several manufacturers, and he achieved it. Where else could you find all the Spooky Pinball titles, ranging from *America’s Most Haunted*, through *Domino’s Pizza* and *The Jetsons*, to *Scooby-Doo*, *Texas Chainsaw Massacre* and the latest, *Evil Dead*?

[![The complete range of Spooky Pinball titles](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/022-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/022-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Then, there were all the Chicago Gaming titles, from *Vacation America* to *Pulp Fiction*.

[![All the Chicago Gaming machines (Attack from Mars was there too, but was in the tournaments area)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/026-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x673.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/026-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

There were plenty of newer Stern Pinball titles here too. In fact, all the Spike 2 games – with the sole exception of the *Jurassic Park Home Edition* which isn’t available in Europe – were present and connected to the Insider Connected system, including all three models of the company’s latest release, *King Kong: Myth of Terror Island*.

In addition, both titles from Bitronic – *Super Hoop* and *Tokyo Perfect Drift* – were at the EPC in the free play area.

The one major manufacturer not mentioned so far is Jersey Jack Pinball. Their line-up of all ten machines, from *The Wizard of Oz* to *Avatar: The Battle for Pandora* formed the Jersey Jack High Score Tournament.

Amongst the mix in the Free Play area were a number of unusual machines, including several custom games.

We’ll begin with this two-player *Joust* pinball which was built from scratch by Tom Altenbach. Tom would later give a seminar where he detailed the origins of the game and the challenges he faced building it.

[![Tom's home-built Joust pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/027-european-pinball-championship-2025-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/027-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Wolfgang Grauvogl created a *The Rocky Horror Picture Show* game which is based on the playfield from a Black Rose game he picked up. It started out as dirty and rusty, but it opened the door for Wolfgang to create his first re-theme. He spoke about the game’s development in one of the event’s seminars.

Alessandro Cacciola of [Steel Shot Pinball](https://www.steelshot.it/) had a stand in the free play area showcasing their replacement apron, hinge and shooter rod designs, along with several custom games featuring their products.

The three custom games from Alessandro were all based on an existing playfield design, but with rewritten rules, new artwork throughout, a new display and animations, new sound effects and new music.

Ivan Cicognani of [pinballitaly.com](https://www.pinballitaly.com/) brought several machines he had fully restored, including two *The Addams Family* machines – one playable, the other to show the quality of the internal restoration work.

There was also a non-playable playfield for the 1980 Geiger title, *Wild Schütz*. This was originally part of a conversion kit for Bally’s *Strikes and Spares* game. Only 200 of these kits were produced, and this display playfield was brought to the EPC by Mr Geiger himself.

[![The Wild Schütz playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/051-european-pinball-championship-2025-855x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/051-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

The Wild Schütz playfield

This decorative piece can be fitted with short legs to use as a coffee table, or with full-height legs as a display object. It is one of eight limited-edition pieces produced by Geiger and they will shortly be available to buy from RS-Pinball.

Perhaps the most unusual game at the EPC was a near full-size and fully playable Lego pinball machine built by Rolf Brisberger.

[![The Lego pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/100-european-pinball-championship-2025-463x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/100-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

The flippers were manually operated, but the game included switches, bumpers, targets, LED lighting and mechanical stepper motor reels for score and ball number.

The game is called *Schoko 42*, ‘schoko’ being German for chocolate, and in keeping with the title, at the end of each game a small foil-wrapped chocolate ball is dispensed at the front of the game.

The score reels

A special Lego pinball tournament was played on Friday from 10am until 7pm. Trophies were awarded in the men’s, women’s and youth divisions for achieving the highest score.

In the Men’s Division the top three were: Christian Berkemeier (1st), Bartosz Slomczynski (2nd) & Emil Ed Dreiburg (3rd).

Prizes of Lego were presented by Stefan and game builder, Rolf.

**Tournaments Area**

All the other EPC tournaments took place towards the back of the hall where the main EPC and the Classic Tournament machines were set up.

The main EPC machines

The main EPC tournament’s qualifying machines were divided into six groups of ten machines, nine of which were normally used, with the tenth being a backup in case any of the nine should become unusable.

[![EPC machines group 1](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/032-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/032-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

At the very far end of the hall was an area dedicated to the Classic Tournament. For the purpose of this year’s EPC, ‘Classic’ was loosely defined as any machine from 1991 or earlier. There was one game from 2018 – *The Mafia* – but it has a simple, single-level playfield reminiscent of a solid-state design. Two electromechanical games were included in the line-up, *The Wiggler* and *Wizard!*

**TOURNAMENTS**

We arrived in Vöcklabruck on Thursday afternoon but the previous day there had been a Warm-Up Tournament starting at 3pm.

Qualification for the play-offs consisted on seven rounds of group match play. 239 players competed in groups of four with the so-called Marburg scoring system of 7-4-2-0 points for first to fourth. The top 24 qualified for the best-of-three head-to-head play-offs.

The 24 qualifiers were:

| Position | Name | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Emil ED Dreiborg | 46 pts. |
| 1 | Timber Engelbeen | 46 pts. |
| 3 | Ben Moser | 41 pts. |
| 3 | Nic Stein | 41 pts. |
| 3 | Levente Tregova | 41 pts. |
| 6 | Wilfred Johnsen | 40 pts. |
| 7 | Markus Ramsner | 39 pts. |
| 8 | Jakub Tkacz | 38 pts. |
| 8 | Espen Andresen | 38 pts. |
| 8 | Topi Ahonen | 38 pts. |
| 8 | Thomas Mästerman | 38 pts. |
| 12 | Niklas Ott | 37 pts. |
| 13 | Hervé Pierru | 37 pts. |
| 13 | Bertram Søgaard Haun | 37 pts. |
| 15 | Carlos Teixeira | 36 pts. |
| 15 | Viggo Löwgren | 36 pts. |
| 15 | Vid Kuklec | 36 pts. |
| 18 | Guido Christiansen | 36 pts. |
| 18 | Michiel Arts | 36 pts. |
| 18 | Ralf Lindinger | 36 pts. |

| 21 | Ulf Rokkan | 35 pts. |
| 21 | Luca Fredella | 35 pts. |
| 21 | Markus Virtanen | 35 pts. |

As it got down to the final four, the two semi-finals were Timber Engelbeen vs Levente Tregova and Wilfred Johnsen vs Viggo Löwgren. Timber won his semi-final 2-0, while Viggo made it to the final 2-1.

In that final, Timber Engelbeen beat Viggo Löwgren 2-1 to take the win. In the third place play-off, Wilfred Johnsen beat Levente Tregova 2-0.

Stefan presented the trophies to the top four.

[![Warm-Up Tournament winner, Timber Engelbeen](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/211-european-pinball-championship-2025-716x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/211-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

The top four in the Warm-Up Tournament:
Levente Tregova (4th), Timber Engelbeen (1st), Viggo Löwgren (2nd) & Wilfred Johnsen (3rd)

Qualifying for the main EPC tournament ran in parallel with the Classic Tournament’s qualifying.

Players registered for one of four qualifying groups A, B, C or D.

Group A began their main EPC qualifying on Thursday morning, Group B did the same with the Classic Tournament. Half-way through the day, once all qualifying matches had been played, the groups swapped over, with Group B playing main EPC qualifying and Group A playing Classic Tournament qualifying.

Groups C & D did the same, but on Friday.

Qualifying for the JJP High Score Tournament ran through both days (and right through Saturday too), so those players in groups not playing either the EPC or Classic qualifying still had something to play. In addition, there was the EPC Women’s Championship held on Friday from 8pm, the EPC Country Knockout Tournament run on Saturday from 5pm, and a Company Tournament on Sunday from 10am, which ended up being more of an open team tournament.

**Main EPC**

In qualifying for the main EPC, the players in each qualifying session were split into six groups of approximately sixteen players. Each group was assigned a bank of ten machines on which they played one head-to-head match against every other player in their group. Machines were assigned by the Matchplay software, while the lowest-ranked player in each match got to play as player one.

Each player got to play fifteen matches, but with only ten machines in use some machines were played more than once.

When all matches in a group were concluded, the four players with the most wins moved on to the next round of play-offs, with the top player earning a bye through the first round. So, that’s twenty-four players qualifying from each group with six first places earning a bye.

The qualifiers from each session were as follows:

| Position in Group | GROUP A | Number of Wins |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Jack Slovacek** | **14 pts.** |

In the play-offs, games were head-to-head best-of-seven matches with the first machine chosen by the higher seed, the second by the lower seed and then alternating. The names of all the available machines were pinned to a board. As a machine was chosen the players took the card with the machine name on it, returning it when they had finished. Only machines with cards on the board could be picked by players.

Those who qualified in positions 2nd-4th played in the first round. The winners of those matches then met the top qualifiers who had a bye through the first round.

After that it was straight head-to-head best-of-seven games played in the same way throughout Saturday until 5pm, picking up again on Sunday morning until we got down to the final four.

They were Paul Englert, Arvid Flygare, Johannes Ostermeier and Bart Volman.

In the two semi-finals, Paul Englert beat Bart Volman 4-2, while Johannes Ostermeier beat Arvid Flygare 4-3.

Paul heads towards the final too

The EPC main tournament final was also a best-of-seven. The first game chosen was *The Champion Pub*, which is an unusual tournament game.

[![Paul watches to see if Johannes can beat his score](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/512-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x705.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/512-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Paul watches to see if Johannes can beat his score

It was close, but a good Spittin’ Gallery video mode made the difference as Paul took the win to lead 1-0.

The next game was *No Fear* and it looked as though Johannes’s upper flipper looping would pay dividends, but Paul did even better with his looping technique. With each loop adding 5M bonus after every ball, it proved a valuable bonus for Paul who won this game too, giving him a 2-0 lead.

A win on *Creature from the Black Lagoon* for game 3 gave Paul a 3-0 lead going into the fourth, and possibly decisive game on *High Speed 2: The Getaway*.

Johannes never really got going on this game, scoring 25M on ball 1 and only pushing that up to 32M on his second ball. Paul, meanwhile, hit 312M on his first ball, increasing that to 410M on his second.

[![Paul playing game four](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/513-european-pinball-championship-2025-616x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/513-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

It was a tough ask for Johannes to push his score up that much in one ball, although he is frequently more than capable of doing just that.

[![Johannes with a mountain to climb](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/514-european-pinball-championship-2025-703x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/514-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

In this instance, though, it was not to be. So, Paul won the game without needing to play his third ball, and won this year’s European Pinball Championship by 4-0.

[![Johannes congratulates Paul on his EPC victory](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/515-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x676.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/515-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

So, Paul Englert won, Johannes Ostermeier was second, while Arvid Flygare and Bart Volman shared third place. For winning the EPC main tournament, Paul also collected a brand new *Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge* machine by American Pinball.

Trophies were awarded by Stefan Riedler and EPC tournament head, Arno Nöbl.

The Classic Tournament play-offs

The play-offs in the Classic Tournament were held on Saturday, staring at 3:30pm. The top 12 from the four qualifying groups made it through, with the top four receiving a bye through the first play-off round. Play-offs were held as head-to-head best-of-five

Round one’s 32 players were reduced to 16 before being joined by the 16 with a bye in round two. Those 32 went down to 16 in the next round, then eight, and then the four semi-finalists. They were Theodor Kristensen, Viggo Löwgren, Roy Wils and Johannes Ostermeier.

Both semi-finals were very close affairs, both ending with a 3-2 score. But it was Viggo Löwgren and Johannes Ostermeier who went into the final.

[![Johannes begins the final on Swords of Fury](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/412-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x671.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/412-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Johannes begins the final on Swords of Fury

Viggo won on *Swords of Fury*, but Johannes tied the score at 1-1 with a win on *Funhouse*. Vigo edged ahead again with a win on *Gorgar* only for Johannes to level things with his win on *Diner*.

So, at 2-2, it all came down to the last game of the final which was *Radical!*

Johannes put up a decent score, leaving Viggo to catch and overtake him.

[![Can Viggo take the win?](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/414-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/414-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

[![Theodor takes third place with Roy fourth](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/413-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x711.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/413-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

**Women’s Tournament**

The Women’s Tournament was held on Friday evening once qualifying in the main EPC and Classic tournaments had finished.

While waiting for the machines to become free, a tasting of Austrian wines was organised in front of the stage.

[![A tasting of wines from Austria for competitors in the Women's Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/122-european-pinball-championship-2025-835x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/122-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

As there was a tie for fourth place, a play-off was held between Kate Rothwell-Jackson and Helena Walter Higgins, with Helena winning and taking the last spot in the final.

The final was played on three machines – *Atlantis*, *Congo* and *Star Trek* (Stern) – with 7-5-3-1 scoring for first to fourth places.

[![As the lowest-placed qualifier, Helena started as player 1 on Atlantis](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/133-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x696.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/133-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

As the lowest-placed qualifier, Helena started as player 1 on Atlantis

*Atlantis* was won by Zana Hrastovsek, with Helena Walter Higgins in second, Helen de Haan-Verbeek third and Antonella Iannotta fourth.

The next game was *Congo*.

[![Congo was game two](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/134-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/134-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Congo was game two

This time Helena improved from her previous second place to take the win. She swapped places with Zana who was second, putting both women on 12 points overall. Third and fourth places were the same as on *Atlantis*, giving Helen 6 points and Antonella 2 points.

Going into the last game on *Star Trek*, only Zana or Helena could win.

[![Could Zana win the Women's Tournament?](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/135-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/135-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Could Zana win the Women’s Tournament?

*Star Trek* wasn’t kind to Zana and she ended up in fourth place for a total of 13 points. As a result, Helena didn’t need to win the game but she did anyway, ending on 19 points. Although Helen earned second place, her 5 points only gave her total of 11 for third overall. Antonella improved one place to take third on *Star Trek* for an overall total of 5 points and fourth place.

[![Helena Walter Higgins wins the Women's Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/136-european-pinball-championship-2025-667x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/136-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

**JJP High Score Tournament**

Over in the JJP High Score Tournament, a different format was employed.

With ten Jersey Jack Pinball machines available to play, competitors could play up to forty games over the three days of qualifying. Ten plays were included with registration, with more available to purchase.

[![Banners for all ten JJP titles hung above each machine](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/125-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x664.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/125-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Banners for all ten JJP titles hung above each machine

Each player could record up to two scores on each machine. Those scores were ranked against all the other players’ scores on that machine, with ranking points awarded. The total of a players ranking points of their best two scores on each machine (twenty scores maximum) made up their overall ranking.

The final rounds of the JJP High Score Tournament were the last competitive action of EPC 2025. The play-offs began at 4pm on Sunday when the 32 qualifiers were divided into eight groups of four. Each group played on three JJP machines with 4-2-1-0 scoring for first to fourth places.

After all three games had been played, the top two players in each group moved on to the quarter finals.

The same format then produced the eight semi-finalists, and then finally the last four who would compete in the final.

The first semi-final saw Viggo Löwgren win all three games on *Willy Wonka*, *Toy Story 4* and *Dialed In*!. He was joined in the final by Gabor Solymosi who was second in the semi-final group.

The second semi-final was a crazy three-way tie, with Jack Slovacek, Paul Englert and Lukas Ott all scoring seven points. In a play-off on *Willy Wonka*, Paul Englert and Lukas Ott were the ones to progress to the final.

The tournament was always going to run late with a scheduled end around midnight on Sunday. However, it was clear the games were taking much longer than planned and a 2am or even 3am finish was quite possible. With our alarm set for 5am for the three-hour drive back to Vienna and the flight home, we couldn’t stay for the very end.

However, those who did stay witnessed Lukas wrapping up the win after just two of the three games. His first place on *Elton John* and *Guns N’ Roses* gave him an unassailable 8 points. Viggo and Gabor both had 3 points, so could only get a maximum of 7 even if they won game three on *Dialed In!* Paul’s fourth place in the first two games left him without any points yet.

In that third game, Gabor won, Viggo was second, Paul third and Lukas was fourth.

So, Lukas won overall, Gabor was second, Viggo third and Paul fourth. Apart from his trophy, Lukas also won a brand new *Guns N’ Roses* Limited Edition machine.

**Country Knockout Tournament**

Sixteen teams of four players from countries across Europe competed in the EPC Country Knockout Tournament, held on Saturday from 5pm. Defending champions, Denmark, were joined by Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Norway, Belgium, Romania, Hungary, United Kingdom, Sweden, Slovenia, Poland, Netherlands and Italy. However, because the tournament ran at the same time as the Classic Tournament’s finals, anyone playing in that event was not able to compete in the Country Knockout and had to be substituted.

Country teams were paired up and played a match consisting of three rounds. In the first round, a single two-player, four-ball game was played, with each team member playing one ball for their country. Then two split-flipper games were played with each team member taking one flipper. Finally, four individual head-to-head games were played.

That made seven games in all, with the team winning the most going through to the next round.

After the first round, Hungary, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Belgium progressed to the quarter-finals.

In those quarter-finals, Hungary won all their games against Sweden, Finland beat Norway 5-2, Germany beat Austria by the same score, while Netherlands beat Belgium 4-3.

The semi-finals saw Hungary up against Netherlands, and Finland facing Germany.

After losing the first match, Hungary won four of the next five to beat the Netherlands team. Germany won their first game plus one of the split-flipper games, before continuing with three wins out of the four head-to-head games to beat Finland.

And so to the final. It was a close-run thing, although with wins in the first single-ball game and both split-flipper games, it looked like Hungary would run away with it. But Germany won three of the head-to-head games. Only Hungary’s win of one head-to-head game gave them the win 4-3.

In the play-off for third, the Netherlands started well with wins on the one-ball and one of the split-flipper games, before Finland capitalised on their split-flipper game win with three more in the head-to-head games to win 4-3 as well.

**Company/Team Tournament**

A second team tournament was also held on Sunday at the EPC. Originally intended for local businesses to enter, it was opened up for ad-hoc teams to be formed at the show.

[![Entering the Company Tournament teams](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/532-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/532-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Entering the Company Tournament teams

Sixteen teams were put together and they played the same format as yesterday’s Country Knockout Tournament with a mix of one-ball, split-flipper and head-to-head games in a best-of-seven match.

[![Teams prepare for the Company Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/526-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/526-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

**SEMINARS**

Alongside the tournaments and the free play machines, there were also six presentations given at this year’s EPC. The first of these took place on the main stage on Friday evening, and was given by Abe Flips.

Tom Altenbach

We showed you Tom’s *Joust* pinball machine a little earlier in this report, but in this seminar he talked about how the game came to be built from scratch after he was asked to restore another *Joust* which had suffered flood damage. His ground-up build ended up being one of four such machines built using a combination of NOS and custom built parts.

VIDEO

**4pm: Wolfgang Grauvogl – The Rocky Horror Picture Show Pinball**

[![Wolfgang Grauvogl](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/405-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x722.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/405-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Wolfgang Grauvogl

Wolfgang talked about how he bought a trashed *Black Rose* game and was looking to make a custom machine of his own, using the *Black Rose* as the starting point. He showed the possible choices for a theme and how each one did or didn’t fit with the two rows of four playfield inserts spelling out S-I-N-K S-H-I-P in the centre of the playfield.

**6pm: Lloyd Dortant – How to Bring Pinball to the People with Stern Army & Insider Connected**

![Lloyd Dortant](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/403-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x701.jpg)

**7pm – Martin Ayub – Pinball Quiz**

There was intended to be a seminar at 7pm featuring Spooky Luke and Morgan Emery from Spooky Pinball talking about the evolution of the company from *America’s Most Haunted* to their current title, *Evil Dead*.

[![Morgan, Luke and Stefan](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/202-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x685.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/202-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Morgan, Luke and Stefan

However, due to illness the seminar couldn’t go ahead, so Martin Ayub stepped in to run an impromptu pinball quiz on the main stage, offering prizes for those with the correct answers. Prizes were donated by Lloyd from Stern Pinball, Stefan Rieidler, Spooky Pinball, American Pinball, and Barrels of Fun Pinball. These included game translites, T-shirts, glass mugs, a poster, socks, a keyfob, an EPC cap and microfibre towel, with the grand prize of a *John Wick* playfield.

**7pm – David Van Es – Sand Walking with Barrels of Fun**

[![David Van Es](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/402-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x671.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/402-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

David Van Es

David is Chief Mischief-Maker at Barrels of Fun Pinball. The company had recently released their second title, *Dune*, so David was here to talk about the game’s early concepts and development. He showed how key mechanisms in the game evolved and how key moments and characters in the game are portrayed in the pinball.

VIDEO

David was also on the main stage to sign Barrels of Fun posters, flyers or other items. Posters and flyers for the *Dune* game were available free on the stage.

[![David on the stage signing Barrels of Fun items](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/410-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x710.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/410-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Later, he also hosted a series of ad-hoc Barrel Ball competitions on the *Labyrinth* machine. Players signed up and got in line to play.

[![Signing up to play Barrel Ball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/417-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x522.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/417-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

The line to play Barrel Ball

Barrel Ball is a gameplay mode built into the *Labyrinth* software which gets players to shoot the white shots and avoid the red shots. If a player makes a white shot, they hand over the machine to the next player and join the back of the line. If they make a red shot by mistake, or if they drain the ball, they are out.

This continues until there is only one player remaining, who is the winner.

Although the queue to play looks rather long, with potentially only one shot required before the next player takes over, the line moves fairly quickly.

**CONCLUSION**

Staging an EPC is always a huge undertaking, with 300+ competitors descending on the venue and expecting numerous tournaments along with food, drinks, side events and relaxation areas.

This year’s EPC raised the bar to new heights, with Stefan putting together extraordinary collections of machines in both the competition and free play areas in a way very few others could achieve. Having entire line-ups of all the titles from Jersey Jack, Spooky, American, Chicago Gaming, Barrels of Fun, Haggis and Dutch, plus all the available Spike 2 Stern games was something never seen before. Add in three new King Kong machines and a wide selection of the latest Stern titles, and you have a truly exceptional collection.

[![Stefan did some heavy lifting to put together this year's EPC](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/531-european-pinball-championship-2025-626x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/531-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Stefan did some heavy lifting to put together this year’s EPC

Of course, it takes an entire team of people to make an even like this happen, and it’s a large team too. Many of the overwhelmingly positive comments often repeated by guests related not only to the large number of people working to make the event such a success, but also their happy demeanour throughout the five days.

[![Packing up began once the main EPC finals had concluded](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/524-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/524-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

Packing up began once the main EPC finals had concluded on Sunday

Creating such a large, well-organised event just as a one-off almost seems a shame. But, there is potentially good news. Once all the dust is settled, Stefan is going to consult with the team and the venue about holding another pinball event at the REVA Halle. Nothing is confirmed yet, but there could be a new Austrian Pinball Festival coming in 2026.

[![All the machines had to be moved out over the next couple of days](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/523-european-pinball-championship-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/european-pinball-championship-2025/523-european-pinball-championship-2025.jpg)

All the machines had to be moved out over the next couple of days, but could they be coming back next year?

In the meantime, congratulations to all the winners and top finishers in the many tournaments. Wherever the European Pinball Championship is held next year, 2025’s EPC will be a tough act to follow.
