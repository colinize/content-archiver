**INTRODUCTION**

Nowhere Entertainment Center – a road to nowhere, or a road to fun?

[![Nowhere Entertainment Center - Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/001-nowhere-entertainment-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/001-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Nowhere Entertainment Center – Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota

*(For most of the remainder of this article, we will be referring to Nowhere Entertainment Center simply as ‘Nowhere’. In the interview near the end of this article it will be referred to as ‘NEC’.)*

Though Nowhere hosted a haunted house in October of 2022, the official opening day was September 1st, 2023. This included all the main entertainment aspects: arcade, haunted house, original mini golf layout, and two escape rooms. (*Author’s Note: In the summer of 2023 there was only one escape room*)

Nowhere is continually growing and, as of 2025, has added more arcade equipment and expanded its number of escape rooms to four.

Nowhere is a passion project for all four of the co-owners. Upon visiting the center, you can tell they have put themselves into the business. As one co-owner stated, “*It’s become very personal to us.*”

According to their [website](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/), Nowhere Entertainment was founded with a passion for entertaining. They have a welcoming message of, “*Welcome to Nowhere Entertainment where our love for creating one-of-a-kind experiences is at the heart of everything we do. We’ve always been passionate about bringing people together through unique, immersive entertainment—whether it’s been through our holiday yard displays, themed parties, or haunted house productions. Now, we’re thrilled to invite you to be a part of that magic and excitement.*”

There is copious [entertainment](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/attractions) at Nowhere. They have a full 13-hole [mini golf](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/mini-golf) course, a [haunted house](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/haunted-house), and an [arcade](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/haunted-house) with pinball machines – plus more. The pins are all modern spooky-themed machines. (*Author’s Note: Oddly enough, only one game is from [Spooky Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2020/06/02/pinball-companies/)*)

Nowhere hosts parties and events, such as [birthday parties](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/birthday-parties#birthdayform) and team building via its [escape rooms](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/escape-rooms). They also give back to their community through projects such as “[Camp Nowhere](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/camp-nowhere)”.

[![Nowhere occupies a large section of Salem Square Shopping Center](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/002-nowhere-entertainment-1024x666.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/002-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

**LOCATION**

Nowhere is appropriately located in the Salem Square Shopping Center, near the intersections of the ‘494 loop’ and State Highway 3, in Inver Grove Heights.

Putting Nowhere on the map

**PARKING**

Nowhere has a good amount of free parking. However, as in any good slasher movie, the parking adjacent to Nowhere got split in twain.

[![Not here for a scare? Park elsewhere!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/006-nowhere-entertainment-726x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/006-nowhere-entertainment-726x1024.jpg)

Not here for a scare? Park elsewhere!

The area directly in front of the Escape Rooms/Haunted House is reserved for handicap parking and those who dare to venture into those two venues.

[![Reserved parking](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/007-nowhere-entertainment-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/007-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Reserved parking

The rest of ‘[Salem’s Lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Salem%27s_Lot)‘ is free for those who choose to encroach. With the middle ground being no man’s land.

[![Middle ground](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/008-nowhere-entertainment-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/008-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

**MAIN VENUE**

South Robert Trail was the road ‘No-where’. Once inside we were ‘Now-here’.

[![A spotless entry at the food area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/010-nowhere-entertainment-1024x673.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/010-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

A spotless entry at the food area

Staff worked hard to keep it that way.

[![Tables were kept immaculately clean](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/011-nowhere-entertainment-1024x666.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/011-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Tables were kept immaculately clean

**FOOD**

Nowhere has a fun carnival-style food menu, including but not limited to candy, deep fried cheese curds, hotdogs, and snack bites. Thought somewhat limited, the menu includes several vegetarian options.

[![The menu](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/015-nowhere-entertainment-784x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/015-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

The menu

Straightforward enough, food is ordered in person at the Food Counter. Payment is either by cash or credit card.

When ordering, you are asked things like, “*Ice or no ice?*” (in your drink) and “*Do you want salt?*” (on your fries).

[![Make your food orders here](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/012-nowhere-entertainment-1024x741.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/012-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Make your food orders here

Our first order was the cheese curds. They were hot, fresh, and flavorful. Though not chef-inspired, food is made fresh-‘n-hot in small, screaming hot, convection ovens.
(*Author’s Note: Yes, the ovens actually ‘scream’ as they cook your food fresh-to-order.*)

[![Notice the 'Pepsi' fountain cola and 'Heinz' ketchup ](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/013-nowhere-entertainment-1024x773.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/013-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Notice the ‘Pepsi’ fountain cola and ‘Heinz’ ketchup

As we stayed ‘Nowhere’ for a couple of hours, our second order was a dog-‘n-fries; with another Pepsi.

[![The freshly prepared jumbo dog and french-fries were served too hot to eat at first
(Author’s Note: We know we tried - notice the split end of the dog and partially consumed soda)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/014-nowhere-entertainment-1024x760.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/014-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

(Author’s Note: We know, we tried – notice the split end of the dog and partially consumed soda)

**DRINKS**

Nowhere has sodas, water, and adult beverages. Per adult beverages, during events, wrist bands are worn and drink tickets given out. During regular-ol’-unnerving days, those ordering adult beverages are carded.

[![Alcoholic choices include beer, hard seltzers, mixed drinks, adult slushies, canned cocktails, and wine](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/016-nowhere-entertainment-766x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/016-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

The adult beverages menu

This ‘fun’ drink in a creepy-themed place left us feeling just a bit uneasy. Was this a trap, or trappings for enjoyment?

[![Diz drank is da bomb!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/018-nowhere-entertainment-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/018-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Diz drank is da bomb!

**SEATING**

Besides the seating area near the front door, there is a second smaller seating area near the pinball machines (we’re getting to those). Food and/or drink may be brought to and enjoyed in either area.

[![Front area tables and window counter](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/019-nowhere-entertainment-1024x659.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/019-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

**MAIN COUNTER**

The main counter is where you most probably want to start your visit. It is where patrons get their player’s card and/or check in for mini golf. If not prearranged, this is where you also check in for: escape rooms, parties, team building, and the haunted house. You may pay with cash or a credit card.

[![The main counter](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/021-nowhere-entertainment-1024x743.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/021-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

The main counter

The main counter is also the arcade redemption center. Here, players trade in the tickets won from playing arcade redemption games, in exchange for prizes.

* Player purchases an arcade game card from the kiosk or staff member.
* They play arcade redemption games that reward tickets based on performance.
* The arcade card automatically tracks and stores their tickets won.
* Players can check their points and ticket balance at the kiosk or by asking a staff member.
* Players go to the redemption counter to redeem prizes based on their number of tickets.

[![Smaller prizes at the counter](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/022-nowhere-entertainment-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/022-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

**CARD MACHINE**

This card kiosk is located just to the left of the main counter. It is the only card machine. Nowhere uses [Amusement Connect’s](https://amusementconnect.com/cashless-payment-card-system-hardware/) individually numbered RF card system over cash/coins for game play. Although there is only one card machine, staff can also directly assist with cards. The card machine accepts either cash or credit card.

The price of received credits varied based on the package purchased. The larger the package the greater the number of free ‘bonus credits’.

[![Some common credits purchase rates](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/026-nowhere-entertainment-1024x769.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/026-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Some common credits purchase rates

When we got home, we checked our credit card statement and found no service charges or taxes had been added to our $20 game card purchase.

![No extra charges](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/025-nowhere-entertainment-1024x57.jpg)

No extra charges

General game prices varied from 30 to 60 credits per play, with all arcade machines having card readers. (*Author’s Note: Of course, pinball prices will be specifically covered later in this article*)

**TOUR**

Like a dismembered body, the entertainment center is separated into several different pieces, all part of the original body. Besides the afore mentioned areas are…

One of Nowhere’s main attractions is a full, creepy and carnival themed, thirteen-hole mini golf course. (*Author’s Note: Sorry pinheads, were not quite there yet*!)

* **ESCAPE ROOMS/HAUNTED HOUSE**

Up next, just a foretaste of the Escape Rooms and Haunted House. Both require their own tickets. With the Haunted House sometimes requiring a waiver. (*Author’s Note: Just a little further!*)

All arcade games, including the pinball machines, belong to Nowhere.  The impressive pinball line-up is made up of six newer machines. (*Author’s Note: You made it! Wasn’t that worth the journey?*)

Two more pinball machines are possibly going to be added. However, the area is already nicely laid out to include two ‘SKEE-BALL’ games, which a few of regular Nowhere customers visit for the express purpose of playing.

All pinball machines are priced at 30 card credits per game (typically equivalent to $1.06-$1.36 depending on the number of card credits purchased).

[![30 credits per game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/053-nowhere-entertainment-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/053-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

30 credits per game

All plays are three ball games, and all machines are set up with easy/long ball saves. This is intended to make them fun for players with different skill levels. Several machines have [Stern Insider Connected](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2021/08/26/stern-reveals-online-strategy/) installed and connected. Though Nowhere isn’t currently hosting any pinball leagues, a group of players comes in from Wisconsin most every other Friday.

All pinball machines looked shinny and new. The staff did a great job keeping them clean. They all played well with snappy responsive flippers. Two machines had small problems, one of which was intermittent.

An intermittent up-post on [Jaws](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/01/04/stern-announces-jaws/) stopped gameplay. Automatic ball search via cycling of the game’s solenoids was intermittent on this post. During non-working periods, there was no noticeable movement from the post, so this was possibly an electrical problem, rather than a mechanical one.

Both of these problems were reported to staff. Problems with any game – not just pinballs – can be reported to any of the staff. One of the co-owners is also the onsite jack-of-all-trades, who works on all in-house arcade machines, though a route service from Eau Claire, Wisconsin is sometimes called in to help fix broken arcade games.

[![Only two games in the entire center had OoO signs](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/059-nowhere-entertainment-755x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/nowhere-entertainment/059-nowhere-entertainment.jpg)

Only two games in the entire center had OoO signs

As noticed by one of the pinball regulars and verified by us when we returned four days later, the upkicker on [John Wick](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/05/07/john-wick-revealed/) presented the same problem. The regular reported that problem to staff.

Happily, the previously intermittent post on [Jaws](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/01/04/stern-announces-jaws/) was no longer an issue.

**BEHIND THE SCENES**

We were fortunate enough to get a behind-the-scenes look at just what made parts of Nowhere so creepy.

**CAMP NOWHERE**

[Camp Nowhere](https://www.nowhereentertainmentcenter.com/camp-nowhere) is just one of ways Nowhere gives back to the community. Camp Nowhere is divided into two age groups, children and young people.

Camp goers get to program the electronic magic of animatronics. However, the main focus is on the magical art of learning to act.

To find out more, we interviewed Nicole from Nowhere Entertainment Center about how Nowhere was created, what everyone does, and where they intend to go with the operation.

**Pinball News:** Please introduce yourselves and share what each of you brings to the ghastly table.

**NEC:**[Nicole] *We all bring new ideas to both the haunted house and the center, and share various tasks, but each of us has our specialty areas.*

*I’m Nicole Ross – I paint sets and the mini golf murals, distress costumes, dress sets, etc. I’m also our party planner from kids’ birthdays to private events including company parties, reunions, weddings, receptions, team building etc. I plan and run our summer youth and teen camps, I also create marketing graphics and help with marketing, plus handle the food and kitchen area.*

*Galen Mckay does all the accounting, payroll, licensing, inspections, arcade redemption prizes and game buying, coordinating electricians, repair people, etc., dealing with property management, organizing advertising like billboards and ads, building sets and escape rooms, and the list goes on.*

*Mike Reimer – animatronic buying, maintenance and repair, escape room planning and special effects, safety management, building sets, set planning, teaching animatronics class at our summer camps, and the list goes on.*

*Ian Knutson – planning mini golf holes, creating videos for marketing and for fun, helps with marketing, acting, planning camps, planning and building haunted house sets etc. We all fill in when needed to run the center from concessions to private events, etc.*

**Pinball News:** Kindly tell us how the four of you got together to share one vision.

**NEC:** *We all came together through our love of decorating our yards for Halloween that grew each year (we learned that the industry called us ‘home haunters’), and the guys’ dream of owning a haunted house. Mike and Ian worked at a local haunted house for years as well as being home haunters.*

*They all had to convince me since I’m not a horror lover. I can’t watch scary movies and before we all met, I wouldn’t go through a haunted house. Galen (my husband) had the guys over to discuss this venture and try to win me over. It took a few of these get togethers, but I finally agreed. I still can’t watch horror movies, but I can easily go through a haunted house.*

**Pinball News:** How has that vision changed since its inception?

**NEC:** *There have been some surprises along the way. One being that we had no idea how much fun creating escape rooms would be. Our escape rooms are within the sets of the haunted house so they are definitely very unique. So we keep creating them – I think we have room for about 2 more. Another surprise was how well birthday parties and private events work at the center. People are often looking for unusual venues to hold a party that offer entertainment options and not just a dinner. We partner with local restaurants, primarily Boca Chica, to offer a meal and several entertainment possibilities. Our camps are something we didn’t think about doing until our second year and the feedback from parents and kids is incredibly positive. I think the biggest thing that changed since our planning stages, is how family centered our business has become. It’s really a fun place for families and people of all ages to hang out and spend time together.*

**Pinball News:** How are yourselves and Nowhere evolving?

**NEC:** *Over the past couple of years we are certainly maturing as owners and we are honing in on what will make Nowhere stronger. The phrase we use when something doesn’t quite work out is “Well, we’re always learning.” And it’s true. We learn and adapt and try out other concepts. We would like to offer more options for our customers like karaoke nights, trivia, bingo or specialty nights for groups or clubs.*

**Pinball News:** What are the different levels of actor interaction and age appropriateness at the haunted house?

**NEC:** *1.**No-Scare, Lights On, Behind-the-Scenes Tour:**This is a good introduction to how a haunted house is run. It’s a lights-on guided tour of the sets, costume area, and animatronics with stories and photo ops. No audio or animatronics are on.*

*2. **Low-Scare Walkthrough of the Haunted House**: Dim lighting, audio running, and animatronics are on. It includes everything but the actors. Things look very different in the dark!*

*3. **Regular Haunted House**: all the elements of Low-Scare with the actors. The actors really bring the house to life.*

*4. **18-Plus Nights**: For those that want more intensity. Actors will be able to touch, grab and engage guests in more intense interactions. Must be 18 or older. IDs will be checked and a waiver must be signed.*

**Pinball News:** Please tell us about Camp Nowhere.

**NEC:** *Kids and teens develop their own characters, learn scare acting techniques, learn about makeup, set painting, and animatronics, and on the final day hold a performance in the haunted house for family and friends. The haunted house has everything on and running (lights, audio and animatronics) with the kids in costume and professional makeup as the actors. We really have a great team – we enjoy planning and adapting the camp activities and especially seeing the kids grow and love what they’re doing throughout the week. We engage in fun activities and games with the kids to teach acting and help them acclimate to the haunted house. Some favorites are the Jump Scare Game and Trick or Treating with the Animatronics.  It’s so much fun to see kids gain a sense of confidence, build friendships, and just have a great time.*

**Pinball News:** Please explain the different escape rooms.

**NEC:** *We currently have 4 escape rooms, all with different themes and stories. Our daughter, Riley, develops all of the puzzles, Mike develops all of the special effects, Galen and our friend Cornell build the pieces needed, and I paint everything and add detailed touches. We are all part of the planning process with Riley.*

*These are the descriptions of the rooms:*

**The Lucky Skull:***The Lucky Skull’s pirate crew are ashore swilling rum while their ship’s disgruntled cabin boy stands guard. This famed ship is known far and wide for its priceless treasure hidden onboard. You are approached by the cabin boy with an offer “These scurvy dogs keep me as their bloody swabber, never to be a pirate. Come aboard, find the secret booty, and take the lot! That’ll show those bilge rats!” Beware, the pirates return from their rum party in one hour and if they find you plundering, they’ll make you walk the plank! Godspeed!*

**Eternal Unrest**: *A Victorian era mansion, used by former owners as the Eternal Unrest Funeral Home, is on the housing market. A frustrated realtor and terrified owner are desperately trying to sell the home but there’s a unique issue – the house is haunted! Prospective buyers have seen unexplained figures and shadows, and heard eerie whispers and screams. As a last resort they hired you – a group of freelance ghost hunters. You have one hour to communicate with the spirits and solve their paranormal mystery.*

**Salem Hills Hospital:***A new deadly virus is spreading quickly in Minnesota and fears it could lead to a worldwide pandemic are mounting. Dr. Amy G. Dala, renowned virologist at the University of Nowhere, is missing. Her recent research on ‘zombie’ viruses (ancient frozen viruses brought back to life) sparked controversy in the scientific community. Dala brazenly obtained samples of viruses frozen for millennia in mammals buried in the now melting Siberian permafrost. She refused to heed warnings of reanimating her possibly dangerous zombie virus specimens and was terminated from her position at the university. Epidemiologist and virologists believe Dala inadvertently created the Minnesota epidemic during a secret research process. An anonymous tip left at the Department of Health, spotted Dr. Dala at the abandoned Salem Hills Hospital. Your group, a crew of CDC epidemiologists, was sent to investigate, discover the new virus, find patient zero, and help stop the epidemic.*

**The Enchanted Realm:***Your team of archaeologists are venturing into Nowhere crypt on an expedition to either prove or debunk a long-standing legend. Townspeople believe that due to an anomaly in the earth’s magnetic field the crypt is a source of secret magic and a gateway to an enchanted land. Covered in vines and home to supernatural creatures, the crypt also holds clues to priceless artifacts. But beware! Many who enter Nowhere crypt in search of wealth and power are lost in its depths for eternity!*

**Pinball News:** Do you own or rent the arcade equipment, especially the pinball machines?

**NEC:** *We own all of our arcade equipment*.

**Pinball News:** How quickly can a dead or troublesome pinball machine be brought back to full life?

**NEC:** *Typically, within a day or two unless a part is needed for the repair. We have a staff member who maintains the games and we contract out for bigger issues.*

**Pinball News:** May we ask about the reoccurring theme of gators-n-rats, or is that something you’d like your guests to discover?

**NEC:** *Galen can find anything we need at auction, marketplace, etc. And even things we never thought we needed. Duke, our alligator was one of these. A man was selling him on Craig’s List. He had Duke in his man cave suspended from the ceiling for 50 years! Now he makes Nowhere his home. We’re not sure where he’ll go next since we’re changing over the train to a zombie infested warehouse set.*

*When we were creating the haunted house, I was a new pet rat owner. My daughter wanted pet rats for quite a while and I had no problem with that. We bought 2 from a local breeder and my daughter lost interest quickly. They became my pets. I read a lot about them and realized how intelligent they are and very sweet (the domesticated ones not wild!). Our Nowhere team heard a lot about how misunderstood rats are and what cool animals pets they make.*

*So, artificial rats became part of the haunted house as well. Although, to be fair most haunted houses include fake rats since many people are afraid or disgusted by them. Thus, I painted the circus poster, put Otis the rat in the haunted house atop Duke, and added a rat cage to the pirate ship. Rats have a very short lifespan 2-3 years. Mine lived for 2.5 years and we have not had any more.*

**SUMMARY**

Not everything about Nowhere could be pictured or written about in a single article. Soo many details, personally felt and put in by the owners, are all around Nowhere. Visitors could probably go back more than a dozen times and still not notice all the special little details.

Look out for rats!

Arcade games, including the pinball machines, are on rotation with an emphasis on adding more rather than rotating out. Nowhere is constantly changing and growing.

More events to happen

The owners and staff concentrate on providing customers an enjoyable experience, rather than getting every penny out of them. For instance, fountain sodas have non-stop refills.

More to the point, the entire staff knows its customers personally. They recognize the child who has been in several times trying to win a special prize. And, will give that child said prize, even though the correct number of points to earn it may not have actually quite been reached. With one co-owner stating, “*We’re about making the experience fun.*” And summarized, “*We’re not going to not give you your prize just because you’re five points short. None of us would do that.*“

I think this sort of thing shows that the owners are truly passionate about their business. With no corporate rules, and a handpicked staff who care about their patrons – customers are put first.

With its duality of brightly lit carnival-like arcade and scarry attractions, Nowhere is an interesting place.

The Nowhere Entertainment Center is more affordable that other similar venues. However, there may not be another place quite so eerily diverse. Whether it’s company team-building in the escape rooms or pinheads looking for games in the wild, Nowhere seems to have something for most everyone.
