*Foo Fighters* joins the long list of music-themed pinballs from Stern, including *AC/DC*, *Aerosmith*, *Rush*, *Led Zeppelin* and *The Beatles*.

The latest game is based on the Seattle-based band formed by Dave Grohl who was formerly the drummer for *Nirvana*. Established in 1994, the band has featured several members and was in the public eye last year when drummer Taylor Hawkins died unexpectedly.

That could have been the end of the band, but Grohl recently announced three upcoming appearances by *Foo Fighters* at US festivals in 2023. Hawkins appears to be featured in the Foo Fighters van in the image above, alongside Grohl (driving).

The pinball tease came in the form of a video on YouTube which you can watch below.

It appears as though the pinball will feature an alien invasion theme, with the band saving the Earth, Ghostbusters-style. That theme would be fitting given the term ‘Foo Fighter’ was used by pilots to refer to an unidentified flying object (UFO) during World War Two.

The band hunt for the alien Overlord

The theme appears to be an alien Overlord looking to conquer the planet, with the Foo Fighters travelling across America, playing in major cities to gather fans to help in the fight to save Earth.
