After months (if not years) of speculation, teases and peeks, Jersey Jack Pinball today finally revealed their eleventh title, *Harry Potter*.

Fears the game could be based on only one or a subset of the movies have proved unfounded, as the playfield includes elements, characters and the titles of all seven books and all eight movies:

1. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
2. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
3. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
5. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
6. Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2 movies)

The 4-flippered game comes in three variants. The Collector’s Edition is the top-end version, followed by the Wizard Edition, with a new Arcade Edition aimed more at locations.

The prices of the three models have been announced in advance, with pre-order deposits taken to secure a specific version and a place in the build queue.

* Collector’s Edition: $15,000 ($2,000 deposit)
* Wizard Edition: $12,000 ($1,000 deposit)
* Arcade Edition: $10,000 ($1,000 deposit)

So, here are the three models, starting with the exterior appearance. Remember, all the images on Pinball News can be clicked to give you a larger version.

**Collector’s Edition**

The Collector’s Edition features a special artwork package from design studio, [MinaLima](https://minalima.com/), who worked on the original films and has continued developing multiple Wizarding World products. It comes with the fully interactive topper featuring Hedwig, a flying Harry, a Roving Snitch and a ‘dark mark’ projector, as well as rear and under-cabinet lighting.

The hinges, side rails, lock bar and legs feature a gold sparkle paint, while the shooter knob is also a Golden Snitch, with that gold effect carried inside the cabinet with gold foil art blades and apron decal, as well as gold sparkle in the playfield and plastics artwork.

**Wizard Edition**

The Wizard Edition has a totally different cabinet and backbox art package, being more of a traditional composition of characters and scenes from the movies. It does come with the high gloss RadCals on the cabinet and a real backglass. The backbox topper is a simpler multi-layer illuminated acrylic composition, depicting a Quidditch game. Unusually, the flipper buttons are different colours to match the good vs evil artwork on each side.

The Wizard Edition’s backglass

**Arcade Edition**

The Arcade Edition is deigned to be sold at, or just below, the $10,000 mark, so it eschews some of the more decorative features of the Wizard Edition. As such, it uses a translite rather than a printed backglass, has regular cabinet decals and doesn’t come with a topper or external volume control. However, all the key gameplay elements on the playfield do seem to be included.

The Arcade Edition features the same artwork as the Wizard Edition but uses a translite rather than a backglass

All three models include a player camera for interaction with the game, as well as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth audio, and RGB LED Hotrails along the side of the playfield.

Speaking of the playfield, here are the overviews of all three versions.

**Collector’s Edition**

The Collector’s Edition playfield

The Collector’s Edition has a moulding around the lock bar action button, gold wireforms throughout, a gold sparkle apron decal, and gold sparkle flecks in the playfield artwork and on the playfield plastics.

**Wizard Edition**

As you can see, the Wizard Edition’s playfield looks very similar. The art design is the same, and all the playfield mechanisms seem to be the same.

[![The Wizard Edition's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/206-harry-potter-503x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/206-harry-potter-scaled.jpg)

The Wizard Edition’s playfield

Here are the three playfields side-by-side:

![The Collector's, Wizard and Arcade Editions](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/006-harry-potter-1024x717.jpg)

The Collector’s, Wizard and Arcade Editions

To confirm the similarity between the playfields, we did a ‘difference’ to compare the Collector’s Edition and the Arcade Edition. This removes any elements which are the same, leaving just the differences.

[![The difference map comparing the Collector's Edition and the Arcade Edition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/007-harry-potter-542x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/007-harry-potter-scaled.jpg)

The difference map comparing the Collector’s Edition and the Arcade Edition

As expected, the side rails and apron decals are different, as is the shooter gauge decal. The remaining differences appear to be just the playfield sparkle (click on the image to enlarge it to see the sparkle), a few insert edging effects and the gold wireforms.

We now have a selection of detailed playfield shots which we have added below, but to begin with here are a few closer looks at the playfield features.

In the top-left corner of the game is the Quidditch pitch with multiple paths and a ramp to shoot the Quaffle through the goal and, when lit, score a point.

[![The upper-left corner features an upper playfield with a mini-flipper](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/008-harry-potter-933x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/harry-potter/008-harry-potter.jpg)

The upper-left corner features a Quidditch upper playfield with a mini-flipper

The upper playfield includes a mini-wireform containing two miniature captive rolling balls. Hitting the Beater posts fires the balls round the wireform.

The upper playfield

The flying Ford Anglia is mounted in a silicone Whomping Willow tree on top of a pop bumper, shaking the tree and the car as the bumper fires.

The lenticular changing pictures

The operation of the staircase mechanism isn’t yet clear beyond just rotating, but it does feature multiple paths and positions, and seems to be the centrepiece of the game. The Heart’s Desire insert is printed upside down and is presumably designed to be viewed in a mirror mounted at the back of the game.
