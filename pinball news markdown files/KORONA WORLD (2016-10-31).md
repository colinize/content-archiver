After leaving the Iwakura shopping centre, we proceeded to our second pinball location – Korona World Komaki. It only took around 8 minutes by car.

Korona World

Korona World is a big amusement centre in Komaki. Through a collaboration with the Japan Game Museum, the centre has set up a dedicated area for retro games since early this year.  It is a so-called “mini-JGM”.

There are six pinballs and some vintage video games

* *Gemini (**1978*Gottlieb)
* *Surfing* (1972, Sega Japan)
* *Carnival* (1971, Sega Japan)
* *Playboy* (1978 ,Bally)
* *Rocky & Bullwinkle* (1993, Data East)
* *The Addams Family* (1992, Bally)

Cocktail video games

It was very exciting and amazing for me to see the *Gemini* game. According to the [ipdb.org](http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=995), only 300 units were produced in 1978.  I believe, it is one of the few still functional in the world.

Gottlieb’s Gemini

Again, I could get high score and 3 replay credits on my first play of this game.  (^o^)/

High score!

I believe the *Rocky & Bullwinkle* game might have been acquired from the Mono Mania Shopping Centre, so this is my second time seeing it within four years.

Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends

Another amazing game is the Sea Raider (1969).  As I understand it, the game was totally not functional when it was first delivered to the JGM.  It eventually became functional after JGM spent a lot of hard work and passion on it.
