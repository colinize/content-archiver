**Location:**
187 Rye Lane, Peckham, London, SE15 4TP, UK

The Four Quarters is the closest thing in London to the type of bar arcade found in the US, combining video and pinball games with craft drinks, music and a vibrant atmosphere.

Peckham isn’t perhaps the most salubrious of London’s neighbourhoods, but it is certainly a lively place, and is frequently cited as the [most up-and-coming area](http://metro.co.uk/2014/04/16/9-reasons-peckham-is-the-best-place-to-live-in-london-4693255/) in the capital.

Rye Lane in Peckham

Take a short stroll down Rye Lane from Peckham Rye Station, and you will find The Four Quarters.

Although the temporary sign above the name of its former incarnation gives the outward appearance of being more of a pop-up arcade than a permanent business, The Four Quarters has actually been here since mid-2014.

Inside the main bar area

There are two pinballs set up near the main entrance. They are changed regularly, but on this visit they were Star Trek – The Next Generation and Pirates of the Caribbean.

Star Trek and Pirates

The machines are priced at £1 ($1.45/€1.28) per game or 3 games for £2, and are kept in good condition. On our visit we were able to record some scores for the [London Pinball League’s](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SurreyPinball/) Selfie League which was running throughout May and June at this location and another at bar in Shepherds Bush.

While there are a few counter-top games close to the pinballs, the larger selection of full-size games is found in the bar area, with classics such as Asteroids, Pac-Man and Time Crisis II.

The bar itself offers a nice selection of local craft beers, both on tap and in bottles.

Plenty more drinks behind the bar

There’s also a kitchen which serves assorted hot dogs, burgers, onion rings, french fries and other oh-so-tasty but thoroughly-unhealthy gamer supplies.

But it’s not all games, food and drinks. The Four Quarters also plays host to various DJs. One was entertaining guests near the bar during our visit.

It’s not just drinks mixed in the bar area

That’s what you find on the main floor, but there is also a basement room accessed through the ‘Confession Box’.

Saunter down the stairs and you’ll find a second bar and a chill-out area, while around the corner is another DJ station.

The Four Quarters provides a great mix of pinball, video, beer and music, and seems to draw a young, enthusiastic crowd.

Their south-east London location is easily accessed from the rest of the capital by train or bus, and it’s definitely worth making the journey to check it out.
