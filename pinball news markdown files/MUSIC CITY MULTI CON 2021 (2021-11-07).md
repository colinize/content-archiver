**Date:** 29th-31st October, 2021
**Location:** Farm Bureau Expo Center, 945 East Baddour Parkway, Lebanon, TN 37087, USA

After 3 years of hosting the Grand Ole Gameroom Expo at the Millennium Maxwell House hotel and convention center located in Nashville, TN, it was announced that the 2020 show would be held at the Farm Bureau Exposition Center in Lebanon TN which is a short drive east of Nashville. The new location was selected because of the larger square footage of the main event and exposition hall and also dedicated parking for the show without the need to share the parking area with the hotel.

The Farm Bureau Expo Center in Lebanon

I’m certain everyone reading this is aware that nearly all pinball, gaming and similar events were shut down in 2020 and the first part of 2021 due to government guidance and health concerns with large gatherings. This led to the cancellation of the Grand Ole Gameroom Expo for 2020.

In spite of these obstacles, it did not stop Expo organizer David Corrigan and his intrepid staff of expo volunteers.

David & Co. came up with the brilliant idea of combining the gameroom and gaming elements with allied pastimes and collectibles such as board games, comic books, sci-fi collectibles, cosplay, figure building and other activities drawing from today’s literary and pop culture.

The result is the 2021 Music City Multi Con, which was designed to appeal to a large and diverse group of attendees.

Music City Multi Con

The three day Multi Con took place October 29-31, 2021 in the previously mentioned 79,000 sq. ft. Farm Bureau Expo Center in Lebanon, TN, and the adjacent James E. Ward Agricultural Center.

More console games

In the vast console gaming area, eSports Tournaments were hosted hosted by Kumite (games) in Tennessee (KIT) with the matches shown on large projection screens with theatre-style seating for spectators. There were 472 competitors pre-registered for 12 competitions.

The e-sports tournament stage

Based on the number of people in the KIT area, I am certain that a vast majority of those pre-registered showed up to compete. The KIT 2021 championship games included: *Guilty Gear Strive*, *Tekken 7*, *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*, *Street Fighter 5*, *Dragon Ball FighterZ*, *Mortal Kombat 11*, *Dead or Alive 6*, *Samurai Showdown*, *Mortal Kombat XL*, *Soul Calibur 6*, *BlazBlue* and *Injustice 2*.

Most KIT 2021 tournaments were live streamed and can now be seen on YouTube.

David and his crew are to be congratulated for the exceptional organization for this comeback show for the Nashville area. One of the many laudable features of the pinball and coin-op gaming area was the dedicated ‘help desk’ with well equipped technicians on hand to diagnose and repair any games needing attention.

Of particular interest to Pinball News readers were the four fresh-out-of-the-shipping-crate Stern *Godzilla* games set on free play courtesy of [Tilt Amusements](http://tiltamusements.com/) and [Pins Mechanical Co](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2021/06/12/pins-mechanical-company-nashville/). These were the first *Godzilla* games that I have seen ‘in the wild’ and I have to say that I enjoyed how they play and the flow of the games very much. I can also report that the multiball on these games is truly crazy. If you can manage to keep the balls in play during multiball, a very large number of points can be scored. Needless to say, being the newest games in the show, they were busy with players the vast majority of show prime time.

A unique feature of Multi Con 2021 was the huge outdoor stages with a music lineup of over forty DJ’s and live bands that played all weekend. The organizers assured that rain or shine the entertainment would go on since the artists and the crowd was covered at the stages. Unfortunately the weather did its worst and the weekend of the Multi Con was rainy and cold. Few attendees that I saw ventured out of the warm and dry exposition center to sample the entertainment and food vendors outside.
