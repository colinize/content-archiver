The long-awaited *The Beatles* pinball was finally unveiled by Stern Pinball and Ka-Pow Pinball in a video on YouTube.

The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball backglass

Officially called *The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball*, the game focuses on the band’s early years and continues the trend begun by the earlier Stern/Ka-Pow collaboration, *Batman 66,* of re-versioning an earlier playfield design.  In the case of Batman 66 it was George Gomez’s 2008 release *Batman: The Dark Knight* which was re-visited, but for *The Beatles* we go back to 1980 and the Stern Electronics model, *Seawitch*, designed by Mike Kubin.

The playfield for The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball

Like *Seawitch*, *The Beatles* is a four-flippered single level game featuring three banks of drop targets, but it also adds a number of additional stand-up targets around the playfield and a second spinner to the left of the three pop bumpers.

But the biggest addition is a spinning disc with a magnet in the centre, as seen in various Stern games since *Twister*.

The spinning disc

Whereas *Seawitch* has a star rollover at the top of the orbit shot, *The Beatles* adds a second magnet to grab the ball and drop it into the pops.  A flasher insert has also been placed between the three pop bumpers.

Down at the bottom of the playfield there have been fewer changes.  The number and arrangement of inserts have been redesigned to match the game’s new features, while a one-way gate has been added to the shooter lane to prevent the ball returning to the plunger and to create a fairly simple-looking skill shot.

While a full list of the tracks included in the game hasn’t been released, five of them are shown just above the flippers – *All My Loving*, *Drive My Car*, *I Should Have Known Better*, *Ticket To Ride* and *It Won’t Be Long*.  Collecting all five songs starts a multiball mode.

Five song with their associated features

As with *Batman 66* there are three models of *The Beatles*, and like the first Stern/Ka-Pow collaboration, despite the simplistic playfield design we can expect some top-end collector-level prices when they are announced*.*

There will be 100 Diamond Edition games, 250 Platinum Editions and a maximum of 1,614 Gold Editions.  That gives a total of 1,964 – the year of The Beatles’ first world tour and the release of the movie and album *A Hard Days Night*.

We’ll have more details of Stern Pinball and Ka-Pow Pinball’s new *The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball* as soon as they are announced right here at Pinball News.  In the meantime, here’s the promotional video on YouTube.

VIDEO

**UPDATE**

Stern Pinball have formally announced their new The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball and provided a few more details along with three pictures of the Diamond Edition model.

There will be eight The Beatles songs featured in the game: *A Hard Day’s Night*, *Can’t Buy Me Love*, *Ticket to Ride*, *All My Loving*, *Help*, *Drive My Car*, *It Won’t Be Long* and *I Should Have Known Better*.

Although The Beatles are a British band, the game gives a definite American twist to the theme by featuring the introduction by Ed Sullivan seen in the promotional video above, along with custom speech and call-outs by US disk jockey Cousin Brucie, who introduced the band when they performed at Shea Stadium in New York as part of their 1964 world tour.

One thing obviously missing from the announcement is pricing.  Potential buyers are advised to contact their Stern Pinball distributor, suggesting it could be a contentious issue.  We’ll update this report when actual dealer prices are available.

The new pictures are of the top-end Diamond Edition, showing the backglass, cabinet artwork and the playfield.  The cabinet introduces a new typeface for the band’s name on the cabinet and coin door.  The coin door also features a much larger decal, covering the area usually taken up by the coil slots, suggesting this game will not be able to be operated on coin-play (or at least, not officially!).

We can also read the instruction card to get some details of the gameplay.  It says:
