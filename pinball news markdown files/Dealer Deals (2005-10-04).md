Story  dated
October 4, 2005 , updated October 12, 2005.

With the expectation of a slew of new products coming out later this month, Wayne Gillard has appointed Pinball Heaven as distributors for the UK and much of Western Europe.

Phil Palmer, owner of Pinball Heaven told Pinball News: "Its good to see someone with sense like Wayne Gillard finally making it into the pinball
industry. WMS just couldn't see that smaller companies
who specialized in one sector of the amusement business (pinball) were much
better equipped to deal with customers who didn't really know what part they
wanted or how their machine was supposed to work! Thankfully  that has now

changed with our appointment as UK distributor."

Phil will stock parts and eventually games from The Pinball Factory and will ship them not just to the UK but also to eight European countries - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden - until local distributors are established. The new parts will be added to Pinball Heaven's  on-line catalogue of over a thousand pinball parts.

Phil told us: "We're anxiously waiting for Oct 12th when Wayne officially takes
over and can start selling his products to the World but what are those
products I hear you ask? Well we've all seen the first posted list on
pinball.com bulletin boards but we'll have to wait a bit longer for the
full list. As soon as we know what will be available and at what price, we
will add the products to our already extensive website catalogue."

Regarding shipping outside the UK, Pinball Heaven have already made arrangements.  "We already ship more parts internationally than we do nationally so
when we were also given 8 European countries to look after until
distributors in those countries were found we were delighted. Through some
tough negotiation we secured an excellent deal with ParcelForce Worldwide
enabling us to ship parts to EU countries within 48 hours if the customer
requested such, even next day to Sweden and a few other EU Countries for

just £25 or less!"

But Pinball Heaven are not alone.  The Pinball Factory now has distributors in 20 other countries utilising a mixture of existing and former WMS resellers and some new companies.

One such is PinWest in Canada.  Set up by David Eisner who made the Lord Of The Rings ramp featured here in Pinball News, PinWest have also contracted to sell games produced by The Pinball Factory.

David told Pinball News: "I founded PinWest in the hopes of bring unique pinball-related
items to the pinball community. I contacted Wayne very early in the
development of his line of pinball machines and parts. Wayne has been excellent to deal with and communications
have always gone well. I hope to bring his line of pinball machines

primarily to the Canadian collector at competitive prices."

With a large number of parts already announced and more to come, pinball owners should have easier access through their local distributors than ever before after October 12th.

UPDATE

Now the 12th has arrived and some of those new products have appeared in distributors' parts list.

The parts announced by The Pinball Factory as being newly available are shown below but bear in mind that they couldn't be sold to distributors until the 12th October so may take a while to arrive or to be added to the various companies' web sites.
