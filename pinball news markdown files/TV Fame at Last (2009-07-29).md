Pinball on TV in the UK has been as rare as hen's teeth in recent years, and the few appearances modern games have made is usually accompanied by over-dubbed chime sounds from an electro-mechanical machine.

So it's good to see pinball turning up not as mere set dressing, but starring centre stage.

The set of The Gadget Show

The Gadget Show - a programme where the title tells you all you need to know - will air an episode on Monday August 24th where it will pitch a pinball machine against a table football (or foosball) game for a coveted position on the Wall Of Fame alongside such icons as the iPod, the Segway, Napster and Lego.

Fighting pinball's corner is just about the best machine you could hope for - a pristine refurbished Medieval Madnesss from Phil Palmer at Pinball Heaven.

The machine was brought to the Five studios - where the show is recorded - by Pinball Heaven engineer Phil Docker and Aid Cooper who set it up and then got to meet Gadget Show presenters Suzi Perry, Jason Bradbury and Jon Bentley.

We can't give away the result but we can say that Pinball News readers won't be too unhappy with the eventual winner.
