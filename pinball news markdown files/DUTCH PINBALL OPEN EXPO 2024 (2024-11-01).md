**Date:** 1st - 3rd November 2024
**Location:** NH Congrescentrum, Locht 117,
5504 RM Veldhoven, Netherlands

Welcome back to Veldhoven for the Dutch Pinball Open Expo 2024, held by the Nederlandse Flipper Vereniging or the NFV, or the Dutch Pinball Association.

The logo for the Dutch Pinball Open Expo 2024

This is their 25th annual Dutch Pinball Open Expo. Not all have been ‘Expos’, as that nomenclature reflects a relatively recent expansion of the format [dating back to the 2014 show at De Voorste Venne in Drunen](https://www.pinballnews.com/shows/dpo2014/index.html) when a large number of free play machines were added alongside the core Dutch Pinball Open tournament, and a number of seminars held in the presentation theatre.

This year we probably have the greatest number of seminar speakers ever at a Dutch Pinball Open Expo. For those who remember the appearance of a single special guest speaker from the US being a memorable event will be overwhelmed by this year’s line-up, where representatives from six different manufacturers are all speaking here in Veldhoven.

We have (in alphabetical order) Barrels of Fun, Dutch Pinball Exclusive, Hexa Pinball, Jersey Jack Pinball, Pinball Brothers and Stern Pinball all represented and giving talks in the Baroniezaal (Baronial Hall).

But before all that though, we said at the very start of this report, “Welcome back”. That’s because this year’s Dutch Pinball Open Expo is being held at the same NH Koningshof Convention Centre as last year.

NH Congrescentrum in Veldhoven

Traditionally, the Dutch Pinball Open was held in a different part of the country each year to give all members of the NFV the opportunity to attend, if not this year then the next. However, now it has become a much larger event, the logistics of staging a Dutch Pinball Open Expo mean once a suitable venue has been found the temptation is to return the following year unless that becomes impractical.

Almost everyone agreed that the new venue for [last year’s Dutch Pinball Open Expo](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2023/11/17/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2023/) was very successful, so there was strong support to return for this year’s event.

**Friday**

So, here we are back at the NH Convention Centre in Veldhoven on the outskirts of the city of Eindhoven.

[![The entrance to the hotel part of the complex](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/022-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/022-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The entrance to the hotel part of the complex

In [last year’s report](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2023/11/17/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2023/) we thoroughly described the facilities provided in this huge complex, so we won’t cover that ground again this year. Suffice to say, it provides a large number of hotel rooms alongside numerous meeting rooms and event halls, two of which (Genderzaal and Kempenzaal) are joined together to host the Dutch Pinball Open Expo 2024.

However, this year things have been changed up a little with a third hall added and joined to the previous two to make an even larger single space.

[![The DPO Expo uses the areas in bright green on the left](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/026-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x698.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/026-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

So, what did those rooms look like when we got to the NH Congrescentrum at midday on Friday?

[![The main Dutch Pinball Open Expo show hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/002-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/002-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The other half of the space

For those who remember last year’s arrangement of machines, things have moved around this year. The end of the hall which was home to the rows and rows of free play machines has been extended and is now home to all the tournaments – Open, Classic, Women’s, Youth. The end which previously had the tournament machines is now the free play zone.

[![Machines for the tournaments are amongst the first to be set up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/011-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/011-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Machines for the tournaments are amongst the first to be set up

All machines in the hall have a sticker on their base indicating whether they are for use in the tournaments area, if so which tournament, or if they are destined for the free play area.

The the central part of the halls we have the vendor stands and also the dining area. The Dutch Pinball Open Expo is unusual in having the rest and relaxation area mixed in with the games, meaning you don’t need to leave the hall if you want to sit down and eat a meal or drink a beer.

[![Some of the newer titles on the vendor stands](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/016-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/016-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The entrance to the show isn’t from the NH hotel end of the complex which is nearest the main road, but at entirely the opposite end. Guests trying to enter through the hotel have a useful sign directing them to the real DPO Expo entrance.

Not this way to the DPO Expo

The Beneluxfoyer is where DPO Expo guests enter the complex and either register for the show or collect their pre-registered entry packs. The registration desk doesn’t open until later this afternoon for tournament players and at 10am on Saturday for everyone else.

Also in the entrance foyer is the payment machine for car parking. If you are not a hotel guest, there is a ticket-issuing entry barrier on the way in and a charge to park in the large number of parking spaces.

[![Don't forget to pay as you leave](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/007-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-675x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/007-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Talking to the show organisers, they were keen to mention how helpful the NH hotel had been in working with them to make the DPO Expo a success, with a lot of proactive measures taken to brand the venue. These include the event logo shown on signs all around the building, and even adding coloured lighting to match the DPO Expo logo’s colours of blue, yellow and red.

[![The reception area outside the main hall is suitably branded](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/017-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x643.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/017-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

At 6pm the Team Tournament began on a couple of banks of machines just outside the main tournament area.

![Players in the Team Tournament on Friday evening](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/045-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x675.jpg)

Players in the Team Tournament on Friday evening

Over in the main Dutch Pinball Open area, the players were given a briefing about how the format works and what to do if there are any issues.

There were six groups of 13 players where everyone played a single game against each of the others in their group for a total of 12 games. The two players with the most wins in each group automatically moved on to Sunday’s play-offs. The twenty four third-placed players from each group played a shoot-out single game. The sixteen highest scorers also qualified for Sunday’s play-offs.

![Dutch Pinball Open qualifying players are briefed by the Tournament Director](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/044-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x640.jpg)

To speed things up, the highest-ranked player in each match always played second. That way, if they didn’t need to play their final ball as they had already won, the game could be ended and the next game begun.

[![The first qualifying session gets underway](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/046-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/046-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The first qualifying session gets underway

Qualifying rounds for the Dutch Pinball Open continued all through Saturday with the final rounds starting at 10am on Sunday.

The Team Tournament did finish on Friday night though. The show hall had closed to everyone but the Team Tournament players and their supporters as the final two teams of four played out the final.

Those two teams were Netherlands 4 and The Dan Lewell Experience from the UK. The final was played in the same way as the qualifying and semi-final rounds where there are three stages. In the first, each player plays a single game against a player from the opposing team. That means four two-player games, with the winner getting 1 point. The second stage is split-flipper games, with two players from each team playing a single game against two opposition players, with each player controlling one of the flippers. The winning side gets two points.

By the end of the second stage of the final both sides had 4 points, meaning the third stage would decided the winning team.

The third stage was a combination of the first two stages. Balls 1 and 2 were played by two players from each team. Ball three was played split-flipper by the remaining two team members.

In this third stage, The Dan Lewell Experience triumphed to win the Team Tournament. The Netherlands 4 team were second, while in the play-off for third place it was France 2 who won, beating the Antwerp Pinball Bastards into 4th place.

The trophy presentations brought the first day of this 25th anniversary Dutch Pinball Open Expo to a close.

**Saturday**

While Friday was only open for tournament players, Saturday is the first day the show opens to everyone.

[![It was a damp start to the weekend](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/102-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x695.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/102-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The main hall opened at 10am, but because the second qualifying group for the Dutch Pinball Open tournament also began playing at 10am, those players were allowed in early to collect their player badges and receive their briefing from the Tournament Director.

[![Player badges for both the main Open and Classic tournaments](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/109-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-749x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/109-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Various vendors and free play machines were set up in the corridor leading to the main show hall.

Over in the tournaments area, while qualification rounds in the main Dutch Pinball Open continued with three sessions of six groups each at 10am, 1:15pm and 4:30pm, there were also side tournaments for PinGolf and Flip Frenzy running all day in dedicated areas by the entrance.

[![The PinGolf machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/135-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x691.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/135-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The main focus for Saturday, though, was the Classic Tournament.

[![Awards for the top three in the Classic Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/188-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x790.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/188-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Awards for the top three in the Classic Tournament

Qualification for the Classic Tournament began at 10am and continued until 7pm, after which the play-offs began.

[![Play-offs in the Classic Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/187-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x624.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/187-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Play-offs in the Classic Tournament

The final was a four-player affair with Daniele Celestino Acciari, Nathan Garwood, Roy Wils and Viggo Löwgren.

![The four finalists in the Classic Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/189-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x682.jpg)

The four finalists in the Classic Tournament
Daniele Celestino Acciari, Nathan Garwood, Roy Wils and Viggo Löwgren

The final consisted of three four-player games with 4-2-1-0 scoring. The first of those games was played on a Stern *Magic* and it was won by Daniele, with Roy second, Viggo third and Nathan fourth.

Play then moved on to the second machine, a Williams *Tri Zone*.

[![The second game is played on Tri Zone](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/190-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/190-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

The second game is played on Tri Zone

Tri Zone produced a similar result, with just Roy and Viggo swapping second and third places.

That outcome meant Daniele had a guaranteed win with his 8 points. Roy and Viggo had 3 points each with Nathan yet to score.

The last game was played on Star Gazer, and this time the win went to Viggo, with Roy second, Nathan third and Daniele fourth.

So, Daniele won, Viggo was second, Roy third and Nathan fourth. Prizes were awarded by overall DPO Tournament Director, Victor Stulemeijer.

[![Fourth place, Nathan Garwood](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/191-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x690.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/191-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Although the main Dutch Pinball Open would conclude later today, there were also new PinGolf and Flip Frenzy tournaments to play, while the Classic Tournament area had been given a makeover to become the home of the Youth Tournament.

[![The venue for the Kids Tournaments](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/211-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x644.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/211-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

In the main Dutch Pinball Open tournament, 64 players qualified for Sunday’s play-offs. They were split into 16 groups of 4 to play on 3 machines using the 4-2-1-0 scoring system. The top 2 from each group moved on to the next round.

Those 32 played another round in the same format to reduce the number to 16 for the quarter-finals. Then the same again to determine the semi-final 8 and then again for the final 4.

Those final 4 were Daniele Celestino Acciari and Taco Wouters from the first semi-final, plus Paul Englert and JP Congnard from the second semi-final.

The three games they would play in the final were Elektra, Indianapolis 500 and Deadpool. As the lowest-ranked player, Paul started, with Daniele in the player 2 spot, Taco as player 3 and JP player 4.

[![Paul begins the first game of the final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/218-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024-1024x714.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024/218-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2024.jpg)

Jim and Gene commentating on the final

Going into the third ball, Paul was slightly ahead on 339K with Taco second on 283K, JP third on 224K and Daniele fourth on 115K. However, on his final ball JP had a great Elektra Time bonus period and boosted his score ahead of Paul to take the win with 1.274M. Paul was second on 1.001M, with Taco third and Daniele fourth.

The second game was Indianapolis 500, and it was Taco who took immediate charge of the game, putting up a huge ball 1 score of 838M, something he had doubled by the end of his third ball.

Paul started to close in but drained his last ball on 1.1B and took second place again to stay in contention, with JP third and Daniele fourth.

That put JP and Taco on 5 points going into the last game on Deadpool, with Paul just a point behind. If one of those three won third game, they would win overall.

Unfortunately, with the clock showing 6pm we had to leave the final and the Dutch Pinball Open Expo 2024 for the airport and our flight home to the UK.

Back in the hall, Daniele began on Deadpool but didn’t have much luck with his 5M on ball 1. JP did likewise on 8M, but Paul had a rather better ball for 40M, but Taco only scored 5M. Nobody put up much of a score on their second ball, meaning the third ball began with Paul’s 46M well ahead of Taco’s 18M and JP’s 10M.

Daniele’s luck didn’t improve on his third ball and he ended his game on just 8M for last place. JP needed a decent final ball to overtake Paul’s 46M, and for a while it looked like he might, but he tilted out on 39M.

Paul had a very decent third ball, starting Katana-Rama multiball and boosting his score up to a very creditable 188M. It was a tall order for Taco to catch that score, starting on 18M, and indeed he had a very short third ball with no ball saver to end on 19M, making Paul the winner on 8 points. JP’s 39M earned him second overall on 7 points. Taco took third overall with Daniele fourth.
