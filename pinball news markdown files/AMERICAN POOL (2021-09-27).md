X user Retrogamerewind also sent in an update from [September 2021](#september2021) and another in [May 2024](#may2024), this time with the sad news there are no longer any pinballs. You can find all those updates below.*

While pinball machines in arcades are not uncommon in many countries, they have yet to make much of an impact in the world’s most populous nation. However, Pinball News reader John found one place where you can get to play the silver ball.

**October 2012**

The amusement arcade American Pool (“美國寶” in Chinese) is located at 9 Man Tai Street in Hung Hom of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.

American Pool in Hung Hom

It has 4 pinballs, which are *Tron LE*, *Transformers*, *Batman* and *The Rolling Stones*. Each pinball costs HKD3 (about US$0.40) per 3-ball game.

It is the only site in Hong Kong which has pinballs and is open to general public.  This arcade is operated by a pinball distributor and therefore all pinballs are always kept in good working condition.

In addition to pinballs, it also has many popular video games. It is definitely a good fun place for both adults and children.

**December 2012**

The next day after coming back to Hong Kong from the [Japan Game Museum](https://www.pinballnews.com/sites/japangamemuseum2/index.html), I visited the American Pool arcade again.

I found that my favourite pinball – *Tron LE* – had disappeared and been replaced by another machine – *AC/DC Pro*.  The updated line-up was; *AC/DC Pro*, *Transformers Pro*, *Batman* and *The Rolling Stones Pro*.

The new Transformers Pro

After some substantial efforts, I successfully got the two grand champion records on *Transformers* and *The Rolling Stones*. My flipper skills were probably upgraded significantly after the three-day boot camp at the Japan Game Museum!

In addition, American Pool had also imported new models of video games from Japan.

This could be why it is always full of young people there.

Here’s some additional information:

* Transportation: Take minibus #6A at Austin Road (near the MTR ‘Jordan’ station) and it will reach the bus terminal in 15 minutes. American Pool is just opposite.

* Comments: All pinballs were kept in good condition.

**March 2013**

I visited American Pool again on 2nd March 2013 and found that *The Rolling Stones Pro* had been replaced by a new game – *The Avengers Pro.*  I was very excited indeed.

The Avengers Pro

The updated line-up was; *AC/DC Pro*, *Transformers Pro*, *The Avengers Pro* and *Batman*.

[![The new line-up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/american-pool/116-american-pool.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/american-pool/116-american-pool.jpg)

The new line-up

It seems that *Batman* is the longest-lasting one so far, having been there since 2008. As I know, the *Avengers Pro* pin was only released in November 2012, and yet it was possible for it to be delivered to Hong Kong the following month. Is this because the demand for pinball really is recovering?

I played the *Avengers Pro* pin for more than four hours until my lovely wife called me to come home.   My thoughts about the *Avengers Pro* pin is good, and I love it very much.  My highest score was only around 53M points and so I need to start studying the [game’s rules](https://www.pinballnews.com/games/avengers/index5.html) soon.

According to a staff member at American Pool, a Hong Kong company has ordered a *Avengers Premium* and placed in its office as free entertainment for its staff. I’m quite jealous about it (^\_\*) !

This time, I had a foot and body massage in the [Lucky Foot Massage Centre](http://massage.zoneonezone.com/shop/detail_en/261) (足如飛) during a break from playing pinball.

The Lucky Foot Massage Centre

This shop is nicely decorated with a high quality of service, so I highly recommend it to all of you. It is located at 1/F, 32 Wuhu Street, Hung Hom.

**October 2013**

In early October 2013, the Hong Kong pinball operator informed that a new pinball was available in American Pool. As a result, I visited American Pool on the first Sunday of October.

The four current pins are *Transformers* (Pro), *The Avengers* (Pro), *Star Trek* (Pro) and *Batman*. The *AC/DC* disappeared and would probably have been sold to either a local or overseas buyer.

[![Four pinballs](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/american-pool/125-american-pool.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/american-pool/125-american-pool.jpg)

Four pinballs

I know *Star Trek* was first released in September, so this one should be the first in Hong Kong or even in the whole of Asia. The playfield is very bright compared with other pinballs there.

The cabinet side

The main feature of *Star Trek* is the USS Vengeance spaceship in the upper part of the playfield. It would shake when it was hit during each stage of mission completion.

The upper part of the playfield

It costs HK$4 (about US$0.50) per 3-ball game for Star Trek.  I was not familiar with the rules of this machine since its in-depth review had not been available on Pinball News. Anyway, my feeling was very amazing.

Apart from this new pin, American Pool had also introduced some new video games, such as blackjack.

**October 2014**

The new pinball –*The Walking Dead* Pro – was installed in American Pool on 24th October.  I could not wait to visit it the next day.

The four current pins are *Transformers* Pro, *Star Trek* Pro, *Batman* and*The Walking Dead* Pro.  *Star Trek* and *The Walking Dead* cost HKD4 (USD0.50) per game, while the other two cost HKD3 (USD0.40).

The new line-up at American Pool

The Walking Dead is a very fun game.  Of course, I need some time to be familiar the game rules before getting any high scores.

The *AC/DC* was moved aside to be packed up, and is going to be delivered to its new owner – a new pub in Wan Chai on Hong Kong island.

**September 2021** – Update by [Retrogamerewind](http://x.com/retrogamerewind)

These are the four pinball machines they currently have at American Pool.

Batman: The Dark Knight

In general I would say they were not so well maintained. The *Transformers* had two stuck balls and the others also had smaller issues. *Transformers* was 3HK$ per credit, the others – if I remember right – 4HK$ or 5HK$.

The *Batman* pinball had a very dim playfield. I’m not sure if that is due to the age of the machine or if its meant to be like that, but it felt very dim compared to the other three.

**May 2024** – Update by [Retrogamerewind](http://x.com/retrogamerewind)

Unfortunately, I have to report that they are now half the size and have removed all pinball tables and most of the arcade games. It’s 99% gambling type of games left there now.
