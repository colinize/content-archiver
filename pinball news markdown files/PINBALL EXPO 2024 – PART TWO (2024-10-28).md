**Date:** 15th-19th October 2024

**Location:**
Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel,
1551 N. Thoreau Drive, Schaumburg, IL 60173, USA

Welcome to our continuing coverage of this [40th anniversary Pinball Expo](https://pinballexpo.com/) being held at the [Schaumburg Convention Center](https://www.schaumburgconventioncenter.com/) in the city of Schaumburg, about 25 miles north-west from the centre of Chicago.

Due to the size of our report and the huge number of videos and pictures we’ve included, we had to split our report into two parts.

The first part covered all the action, tours and seminars from Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. If you missed it, [you can catch it here](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/10/15/pinball-expo-2024-2/).

In this second part we look at events on Friday and Saturday, plus the tournament finals on Sunday.

**Friday**

Friday morning began with the tour of the Stern Pinball factory in Elk Grove Village. The familiar yellow school buses were scheduled to depart at 9am, but before that a long line formed inside the Convention Center.

**Saturday**

Saturday is the last official day of Pinball Expo. Although some of the tournaments do continue into Sunday, the main hall is closed to the public while the stands are being dismantled and the machines packed away.

So, Saturday is the last chance to play machines, buy parts and merchandise, and listen to the seminars.

For us, it was our first chance to get into the main hall to take pictures and shoot our video walkaround.

Here’s a gallery showing every stand in the main hall, with the exception of the History of Pinball and the homebrew section which we will be covering separately below.

The Graphic Dimensions stand featured two homebrew machines

One of the most popular features in the exhibit hall is the display of homebrew machines – games made by hobbyists, in various stages of development from concept through to fully finished. This year, Pinball Expo boasted its largest ever display of homebrew machines.

Here’s our gallery of the homebrew machines set up while we were touring the hall.

Towards the back of the main hall was the Tap 91 Game Room, home of the History of Pinball exhibition.

[![Welcome to Tap 91 Game Room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/924-pinball-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/924-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

Welcome to Tap 91 Game Room

Inside were numerous games from around 1930. Many of them are mechanical marvels, including features which would reappear in much later pinball designs.

Most of the games were fully playable, though they usually required a 5c coin in the slot in order to release the balls.

That concludes our coverage of this year’s seminars at Pinball Expo 2024. You can watch, share and comment on all 27 hours of them on our YouTube channel in the [special Pinball Expo 2024 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsqJ4LfOEWVUA7VBujDExLm2wVY6mDkP1).

At 1pm on Saturday, another regular Pinball Expo event took place in the Utopia A/B room, next door to the seminar rooms. That was the Autograph Session, where pinball industry people were available to sign pinball paraphernalia, including translites, playfields, posters, flyers and plastics. If guests didn’t have anything tangible to be signed, a signatures sheet was also available.

[![The Autograph Session](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/516-pinball-expo-2024-1024x602.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/516-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

The Autograph Session

Last year the event took place in the Nirvana C room. However, that was being used for Saturday’s seminar, and it was also deemed too small for the Autograph Session, so the larger Utopia A/B room was employed instead.

There were lines for many of the most popular signatures

The final aspect of our Pinball Expo coverage is the tournaments.

There were multiple competitive events taking place throughout Pinball Expo, both in the main hall and in the tournaments room.

As we have shown you, the main tournaments had a new home this year in a section of the Schaumburg Ballroom. The timings were also adjusted so that the Women’s Tournament and Main Tournament would finish on Saturday, with just the Classic Tournament’s finals taking place on Sunday. At least, that was the plan.

As it transpired, the Women’s Tournament ran late into the night and a a winner wasn’t crowned until around 6am. Needless to say, we weren’t there to witness the final, but will bring you the results as soon as they have been submitted.

The main Flip Out tournament also didn’t finish on Saturday but ran on until Sunday afternoon.

The format involves an initial seeding round run on Wednesday and Thursday which most players can choose to play in or not. Those who do take part play a number 24 games on as many machines as possible to get their best score. Their overall ranking position determines their seeding in the main qualifying rounds.

The top 50% of players from the seeding round make up the A Division and the rest the B Division. If a player doesn’t join the seeding round, they are automatically ranked at the bottom of B Division for the qualifying. Anyone in the top 250 of IFPA rankings has to play in the seeding round and must finish in the top half to qualify for the A division, as they cannot play in the B Division.

That left Friday and Saturday to play the final rounds which began at 10am each day. Initially (phase 1) games were best-of-three head-to-head until there were just 24 players left, when Phase 2 began. Now it was double-elimination with best-of-five head-to-head in the winner bracket and best-of-three in the loser bracket.

It took until 4:20pm on Sunday for the final two to face each other in the grand final. They were Jack Slovacek and Zach McCarthy. Zach got into the final as winner of the Winner Bracket having not lost a match. Jack lost his first match in Phase 2 but won every match since, to win the loser bracket.

In typical double elimination style, Jack had to beat Zach twice in order win overall – one best-of five and one best-of-three – whereas Zach only had to win the one best-of-five match to triumph.As it transpire, Jack best Zach once to make them level, leaving a best-of-three to decide the winner.

After winning one game each, the decider was held on Stranger Things. Whoever won this game would be the Pinball Expo Main Tournament winner for 2024.

[![Jack Slovacek starts the last game of the final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/550-pinball-expo-2024-1024x682.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/550-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

Jack Slovacek starts the last game of the final

Jack began, and by the end of his third ball had a decent score of 178M.

[![Zach McCarthy plays second](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/551-pinball-expo-2024-1024x699.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/551-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

Zach McCarthy plays second

Zach didn’t have much luck on his first two balls, meaning he went into the last ball of the final on just 17M with a target of 178M.

He did improve, but couldn’t catch Jack, finishing on 85M and making Jack the winner.

[![Zach congratulates Jack on his win](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/552-pinball-expo-2024-583x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/552-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

That only left the Classics Tournament to conclude. The last few rounds of this were running alongside the Main Tournament’s final.

[![The Classics Tournament continued into Sunday afternoon](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/569-pinball-expo-2024-1024x553.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/569-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

The Classics Tournament continued into Sunday afternoon

Like the Main Tournament, the Classics went down to the wire, with the two finalists – Josh Sharpe (winner of the loser bracket) and Zach Parks (winner of the winner bracket) facing each other once in a best-of-five, which Josh won, and again in a best of three to decide the overall winner.

We waited as long as we could to catch the final, but eventually had to leave for a dinner engagement before Zach finally defeated Josh to take the win. So, thanks to Jim Schelberg for sticking it out and taking pictures of the top two.

The top two in the Classics Tournament

If we get any more tournament information we’ll bring it to you right here, but while the tournaments were concluding, the last of the stands in the main hall were being dismantled and paced away.

[![The show's over, folks...](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/567-pinball-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/567-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

The show’s over, folks…

[![The final few games get shipped out](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/566-pinball-expo-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/566-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

The final few games get shipped out

But, that concludes our Pinball Expo coverage for this year.

Without doubt, this was the biggest and best Pinball Expo ever, with more show space, more vendor stands, more seminars, more factory tours, more days, more… well, you get the idea. It was certainly wholly fitting for this special fortieth anniversary of the world’s biggest pinball show.

It was evident to everyone just how much planning and organisation had gone into this year’s Pinball Expo, and it certainly all paid off, with masses of plaudits and almost no complaints,

We hope you’ve enjoyed our coverage too. With so much taking place it’s impossible to cover everything, but we hope with our reporting including more than 470 pictures, 43 videos and 19 audio recordings you got a great feel for just how huge Pinball Expo was this year.

We’ll be back next year, when Pinball Expo returns to its regular four day format, starting with the Bumper Blast on Wednesday 15th October and concluding on the Saturday night.
