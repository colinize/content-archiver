Pinball across three different media lead our round up of  more silver ball news, and there's more news from Stern on their home version of Iron Man.

PINHEADS - THE STORY OF THE PACIFIC PINBALL MUSEUM

At last year's Pacific Pinball Exposition there was a production crew from 30 LBS Skunk  who were making a short film about the Pacific Pinball Museum, their mission and some of the people involved in making it happen.

Now that film has been completed and is available to watch on-line. And even better, it's totally free.

Greg Winkler and Uwe Braun produced and shot Pinheads, with Greg directing and editing the 8 minute feature.

It concentrates on the PPE 2009 show and seminar speakers Gordon Hasse Jr, Steve Ritchie and Richard Conger, while taking us inside the Museum's warehouse to speak with Michael Schiess, Larry Zartarian and Chris Nash.

You can view the film at Vimeo and find out more about the team behind it at the 30 LBS Skunk site.

THE PINBALL SCRAPBOOK

Game designer John Popadiuk has created a new pinball history app for the Apple iPad.

Pinball Scrapbook

This first edition of The Pinball Scrapbook takes the reader through pinball's 200-year history, featuring high-quality photographs, examples of pinball art and an exploration of pinball's cultural impact and influences from a designer's viewpoint.

The Pinball Scrapbook is published by John's company Zidware and is available now from the iTunes store for just $2.99. New content is also expected to be added through a number of free updates, starting this December.

MONSTER REVOLT!

One of the regular features of the Pacific Pinball Exposition is the showcasing of the latest custom conversion from the skilled designers, artists and programmers Wade Krauss, 'Dirty' Donny and Tanio Klyce.

'Dirty' Donny Gillies' work has been seen in games such as Hellacopters, Metallica and Rose and now he has released a book  about his career. From creating  designs for album covers and posters to toys, guitar picks and of course, pinball.

His highly-recognisable style is explored in this 160 page Gingko Press publication, with contributions from Metallica and other 'Dirty' Donny aficionados. The book contains over 400 illustrations and will be available later this month from publishers Gingko Press for  $16.99 in hardback form.

IRON MAN LITE

More details have been released by Stern Pinball about the home version of their Iron Man game.

Dubbed Iron Man Classic, the cost-reduced model has a number of changes designed to make the price appeal more to the home buyer than the fully-fledged operator (or 'Pro') version.

We detailed those changes in an earlier article, but Stern have now produced a flyer confirming them and appealing to the home buyer with features such as dual elevated lightening-fast (sic) ramps, multiple game modes and longer game play.
