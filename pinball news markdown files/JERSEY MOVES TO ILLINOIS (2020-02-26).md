Ever since the business was founded, Jersey Jack Pinball has been a two-centre operation, with the design and software programming taking place at the company’s Illinois base – initially in Streamwood but latterly in Bensonville – while purchasing, manufacturing and sales were based at their main headquarters in Lakewood, New Jersey.

Now, the company has decided to ditch its New Jersey operation and moved the whole company to a new facility in Elk Grove Village. And if that name sounds familiar it’s because that’s also the home of their biggest competitor, Stern Pinball.

Keeping control of the two separate locations proved to be far more difficult than expected, with the Streamwood/Bensonville operation without effective management for some time before game designer Pat Lawlor was appointed to manage it and regain that lost control.

Now, the Jersey Jack Pinball’s manufacturing and sales are to be merged with the game and software design in their new Elk Grove Village operation.

This would appear to be a victory for the investors brought in to help finance the company’s ongoing operations and develop a sustainable and profitable future in an increasingly-competitive market.

There is rampant construction taking place in the city, with ProLogis building new factory units at an impressive rate. There is no confirmation of exactly where in Elk Grove Village the company will set up, but Pinball News believes the new Jersey Jack Pinball factory will be in Greenleaf Avenue, just one street over from Stern Pinball on Lunt Avenue.

A press release from Jersey Jack Pinball thanks the Lakewood staff for their hard work, but emphasises the expected cost savings from combining their two operations under a single roof. Whether that will result in reduced prices for current and upcoming titles, or will instead provide a surer financial footing for the company remains to be seen.

There is no news about whether Jersey Jack Pinball’s founder, Jack Guarnieri, or other members of his family employed by the company will be moving to Illinois too, or if this is an indication he will be taking a reduced role in the company’s management now their base has moved 825 miles east. His job title is not referenced in the press release.

Here’s how Jersey Jack Pinball announced their impending relocation through the PRNewswire service.
