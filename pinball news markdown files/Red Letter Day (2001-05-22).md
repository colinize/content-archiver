Story dated 22nd May 2001

Illinois
Pinball has released an open letter to the pinball community designed
to address some of the questions and concerns we have had about the
availability and future prospects of spares.

The
letter follows IPB's acquisition of Williams' spares business last
year but does not address the future (if any) of IPB's proposed new
pinball game Pool Player, shown at last year's AMOA show.

Here
is the text of the letter:

Subject:
An open letter to the pinball community

We
at Illinois Pinball Company would like to take this opportunity to
share

with the members of the pinball community - retailers, distributors,

operators, collectors and players - an update on the status of Illinois

Pinball and our acquisition of the Williams Industries pinball parts

business. Over the past several months there has been increasing

speculation about our activities with and intentions for the pinball
parts

business as well as tremendous frustration due to the lack of information

and, more important, lack of parts in the distribution channel. With
this

letter we hope to be able to end some of this speculation and relieve
some

of the frustration.

As
announced at Pinball Expo 2000, we completed our acquisition of the
WMS

pinball parts business at the end of October. During the subsequent
weeks,

while WMS prepared the remaining parts inventory for shipment, we

established 14,000 square feet of office and warehouse space in Bloomington,

Illinois. In mid December we finally took delivery of over 400 pallets
of

parts inventory and began the arduous task of unpacking, cataloging
and

organizing the vast array of parts we received. These activities consumed

the bulk of our resources during the months of December, January and
into

February. Also during this same time frame we did our best to locate
parts

and information to fill new orders as well as to fill the backlog
of orders

that had been taken by WMS prior to our acquiring the parts business.

Regrettably, some of these orders dated back to August 2000 having
been

stalled while the parts business was being sold.

We
are very pleased to let you know that since January we have been actively

filling distributor orders and backorders. We have completed organizing

most of the significant inventory and have many of the common parts
in stock

as well as game specific parts including plastics, ramps, decals and

translites. At present we are actively reviewing our stock levels
and past

demand to determine which parts we need to produce. We are working
with WMS

original suppliers to provide us with additional inventory as well
as

working to locate new sources for those parts that the original

manufacturers are unable to provide. Last, we are about to complete
the

installation of a computer system to aid us with inventory management,

production control and customer orders. It is our hope that these
actions

will allow us increase the number of items we have available for sale
as

well as improve our order turnaround time.

We
cannot understate how much we have appreciated your patience through
this

difficult transition. We are committed to the future of pinball and
realize

that future depends on your ability to sell, operate, service, collect
and

play the wonderful array of Bally and Williams games that are already
out

there. We are as troubled as you by the 'black market' prices to which
the

scarcity of parts has contributed. It is our hope that over the next
few

months we will be able to provide you with many of the parts that
you are so

actively seeking and earn your business.

While
we continue to get the parts business into full production we would

like to ask for your assistance in the following:

*
Please use the existing distributors to answer your game and parts

questions and to place your parts orders. At this time our limited
resources

are dedicated to picking and filling orders and working to replenish

inventory.

*
Please continue to be patient with any parts backordered due to being
out

of stock. Many parts were listed as NLA (no longer available) by WMS
and

many items were sold out during the final days of the WMS parts business.
As

mentioned above we are actively working to replace inventory through

existing and new suppliers.

*
Please understand that we may need to adjust some of our pricing as
we

incur higher production costs for replacement inventory. We will be

producing parts in hundreds or thousands as opposed to the tens of
thousands

that were produced during the original game production.

*
Last, we realize that intense demand and scarcity of parts have led
some

members of the pinball community to act to fill this demand. We

respectfully request that any companies or persons engaged in the
practice

of manufacturing, distributing or selling 'reproduction' parts or
assemblies

contact us to discuss our plans for manufacturing these items. As
mentioned

above we are seeking alternate producers for many items.

Thank
you for your time in reading this letter and for your continued

interest in and support for pinball. We invite you to mail or fax
your

comments to us at the address below.

Very
sincerely,

Kim
Carter

There's
nothing exceptional or unexpected in the letter, but it does seem
that IPB will be concentrating on the supply of spares for the foreseeable
future and we welcome their commitment to that.

It
is also interesting to note that the name of the company has been
reshaped again from "Illinois Pin Ball Inc" to the "Illinois
Pinball Company".
