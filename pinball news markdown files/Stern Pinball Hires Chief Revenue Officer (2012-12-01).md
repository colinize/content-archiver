Stern Pinball Inc continues with its hiring of new staff as it fills the slightly ominous-sounding post of Chief Revenue Officer.

John Buscaglia is the man to fill the post and he comes to Stern from Topps Trading Cards where he was Vice-President. The job title suggests his key responsibility is to increase the money flowing into Stern's coffers, be it through new sales opportunities or increasing the margins on existing sales.

So expect to see Stern Pinball exploring new ways to sell their products and a wider range of items available for sale through their own website.

Here's the official press release from the company.
