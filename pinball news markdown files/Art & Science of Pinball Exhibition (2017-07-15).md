Report by Scott Horton

We have reported on a number of pinball exhibitions in the past, but a new one has recent opened at the Chabot Space & Science Center in Northern California. Scott Horton tells us about it.

The science, engineering, design, whimsy and style  covering nearly 200 years of the evolution of pinball will be featured in a new  exhibition through September 24, 2017 at Chabot Space & Science Center in  Oakland, CA.

The Art & Science of Pinball Exhibition

Co-curated by Michael  Schiess and Melissa Harmon of  the Pacific Pinball Museum in Alameda, The  Art and Science of Pinball careens from bagatelle boards to the  sophisticated contemporary machines.

Thirty-five pinball machines - the public  can play all but two of them - are featured, from Parlor  Bagatelle and Surf  Queens, early flipperless games, all the way to the Hobbit from 2016. In addition, two  see-through machine, models and diagrams that de-mystify and explain how the  machines work and a full complement of public activities and programs will be  presented through the exhibition run.

Thirty-three pinballs at the exhibition are available to play

During  the exhibition, Chabot Space & Science Center will be energized with the  sounds of bells, buzzers and bumpers as pinball machines old and new fill the  space and the public can enjoy an adrenaline rush learning about science in a  completely new, interactive way. Pinball’s compelling mix of skill and chance  together with increasingly ingenious and complex designs, engineering, science  and art have made it enduringly popular for two centuries.

The Art and  Science of Pinball unpacks the historical roots and the science and art  behind the gravity-defying game using a selection of machines the public can  actually play and learn about.

“Pinball is an amazing American art form, interactive kinetic art that is pay to  play,” says exhibition co-curator Michael Schiess. “Its aesthetics are rooted  in attraction and distraction as an attempt to remove coins from the pockets of  what started out as a predominately male audience.  At first, the bright colors, flashing lights,  bells, chimes and wild action of the ball zipping around the playfield brings  an excitement to the player. Slowly, you realize the thing that enticed you to  put a coin in and try your skill and luck is designed to distract and impede  your abilities. But it does it in such a fun, entertaining way you don't even  care.”

Co-curator Melissa Harmon adds, “The Art and Science of Pinball tells  stories on many levels.   Visitors view  the fun and fantasy shown in the art, leading them to think creatively about  the social situations at the time the machine was made.  They have a scientific vision of how pinball  mechanisms evolved from pins in a board, and complexity grew over the last  century. Then the visitor becomes a player and makes his or her own flashy combinations of silver ball  magic!  The Chabot Space and Science  Center is a great place for this exhibit, extending people’s imaginations from  gaming into the final frontier, outer space.”

The exhibition runs until September 24th
