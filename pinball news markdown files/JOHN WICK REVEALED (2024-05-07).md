Following yesterday’s trailer, Stern Pinball today released full details of their second cornerstone title of 2024 and the first game design by Elliot Eismin, *John Wick*.

Based on the popular quadrilogy of movies starting in 2014 and starring Keanu Reeves, Stern’s *John Wick* is available in the regular Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models, with the LE limited to 1,000 units.

Prices for the three models (plus tax and shipping) are:

* Pro: $6,999
* Premium: $9,699
* Limited Edition: $12,999

For those not familiar with the *John Wick* franchise, Wick is a retired assassin who forced out of retirement to seek revenge on those who have wronged him. Each of the four movies sees him reluctantly waging a one-man war on an underworld crime syndicate, each resulting in a reassuringly high body count (77, 128, 94 & 140 deaths per movie). The fourth *John Wick* movie was released in March 2023, with a fifth currently in development.

Let’s take a look at the three models starting with the cabinet and backglass designs, and while there are plenty of swords on display, rather bizarrely for a John Wick game, the one weapon you won’t find anywhere in the artwork is a gun.

The Limited Edition’s illuminated speakers, or should they be ‘woofers’?

Here are all three side-by-side:

[![The three John Wick models: Pro, Premium and Limited Edition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/003-john-wick-1024x639.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/003-john-wick.jpg)

The three John Wick models: Pro, Premium and Limited Edition

The cabinet enhancements for the higher levels are not as obvious as some earlier models. The Limited Edition does have laser-cut side rails and an exclusive powdercoat finish, alongside special reflective brushed silver foil cabinet artwork by Randy Martinez. Any extras, such as custom shooter rods or toppers will be available to purchase in due course.

The Limited Edition does have a mirrored ‘stained-glass effect’ real backglass though, whereas the Premium and Pro models have translites for their backbox artwork.

OK, let’s move on to the playfield designs and, although Stern aren’t stating it, it looks as though they have the same playfield for all three models with any variations being to the mechanisms. There is no sparkle coat or special paint on either higher model, the artwork is the same across all three models, and even the Red Circle Club centre lane of the Pro model still has a cutout in the playfield for the missing drop target found on the LE and Premium, although for the Pro it is filled with a red plug.

Here’s the Limited Edition playfield, as that has the most on the playfield and in the cabinet sides, followed by the Premium and Pro models.

**Limited Edition**

And here are all three side-by-side:

The three playfield: Pro, Premium and Limited Edition

The Limited Edition model comes with a special addition to the bottom apron in the shape of a small plaque featuring a piece of a John Wick suit. The exact provenance of the suit used isn’t entirely clear – it is vaguely described as coming from the ‘Production Wardrobe’ from one of the four movies, but has to be a collector piece for true *John Wick* movie fans.

[![The suit swatch included with the Limited Edition model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/307-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/307-john-wick.jpg)

Another major addition for the Limited Edition model is the inclusion of the Expression interior cabinet lighting system which consists of embedded RGB LEDs running down both inner sides of the cabinet. as well as providing lighting effects to the backbox speakers This system isn’t included with the Premium and Pro models and has traditionally only been available as an upgrade for the Premium model. *John Wick* differs in allowing Pro model owners to add Expression lighting kits to their games too.

[![The Expression lighting system pre-installed in the Limited Edition model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/310-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/310-john-wick.jpg)

The Expression lighting system pre-installed in the Limited Edition model

The Limited Edition model has the most playfield features so let’s start with that.

*John Wick* takes advantage of edge-lit plastics throughout the game, from slingshot and inlane plastics to the New York city skyline at the top of the playfield.

[![The progress inserts above the flippers](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/308-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/308-john-wick.jpg)

The progress inserts above the flippers with the edge-lit playfield plastics

Above the left outlane is the Blood Oath Marker and associated standup targets. The Limited Edition and Premium models get an animated Marker mechanism where the centre swings open to reveal the fingerprint inserts inside.

[![The Blood Oath Marker feature on the Limited Edition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/309-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/309-john-wick.jpg)

The Blood Oath Marker feature on the Limited Edition

[![The Blood Oath Marker opens](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/319-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/319-john-wick.jpg)

The Blood Oath Marker opens

Above the Marker is a scoop, followed by the left orbit lane which features a spinner.

The left side of the playfield

Next comes the first of three artworked stainless steel ramps. The Akira ramp includes two standup targets on either side of the entrance and feeds back, along a wireform, to the left inlane.

[![The left Akira ramp and the Red Circle lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/312-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/312-john-wick.jpg)

The left Akira ramp and the Red Circle lane

The Red Circle lane is guarded by a controlled drop target and leads to the game’s only pop bumper.

[![The drop target in the Red Circle Club lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/331-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/331-john-wick.jpg)

The drop target in the Red Circle Club lane

It fires the ball into a bank of five standup targets which, when completed, advance the Red Circle level. The pop bumper is aided by a couple of slingshot kickers to the bottom left and bottom right, producing plenty of movement and action in this area.

[![The Red Circle pop bumper area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/313-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/313-john-wick.jpg)

The Red Circle pop bumper area

Further back on the playfield is the New York City skyline, formed from more edge-lit artworked plastics. As part of that, a three ball lock sits above the standup targets ready to start one of the multiball modes.

[![The ball lock above the Red Circle Club area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/327-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/327-john-wick.jpg)

Three balls are locked for multiball

Moving round the playfield, we come to the centre Charon stainless steel ramp which curves around and turns into another wireform which also feeds the left inlane.

[![The Charon centre ramp ](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/315-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/315-john-wick.jpg)

The Charon centre ramp

To the right of the centre ramp is the muscle car bash toy. This sits on a tray which can slide out so that it blocks shots to the New York Continental hotel model to its right. The player can shoot the car and register hits on the front of the car when it is parked in its home position, on its side when it has moved out, and on the front left if the ball is shot around the orbit lane and emerges on the right side of the hotel.

[![The car has slid out to block access to the Continental Hotel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/323-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/323-john-wick.jpg)

The car has slid out to block access to the Continental Hotel

The Continental Hotel itself is a captive ball shot which spells out the name of the manager, Winston, played in the movies by Ian McShane who provides custom callouts for the pinball.

To the right of the hotel is the Katia stainless steel ramp which leads to a 180-degree loop onto a wireform which feeds into the right inlane.

[![The Katia ramp leads to the left inlane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/324-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/324-john-wick.jpg)

The Katia ramp to the right of the Continental Hotel

On the right side of the playfield is an upkicker where various jobs are started. This upkicker sends the ball onto the wireform leading from the right ramp to the right inlane.

Access to this upkicker is normally blocked by John Wick’s weapons chest. This is another animated toy which can be opened by shooting the pair of standup targets above.

[![The two standup targets controlling the chest and access to the upkicker](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/318-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/318-john-wick.jpg)

You can see in the pictures above how the Expression lighting system in conjunction with the RGB general illumination can totally change the colour of the playfield.

[![The Expression lighting turns the playfield red](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/320-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/320-john-wick.jpg)

The Expression lighting turns the playfield red

Of course, the Expression lighting is only included with the Limited Edition model. There are blanking panels on the inner sides of the cabinet for the Premium and Pro models.

The Premium model includes all the same mechanisms as the Limited Edition but doesn’t come with the suit swatch, the shaker motor, the numbered plaque, the foil cabinet artwork, anti-reflection playfield glass, enhanced speakers and the stained-glass real backglass.

**Premium**

The playfield from the Premium model

**Pro**

The base Pro model lacks several of the mechanisms found on the Premium and Limited Edition variants.

[![The bottom apron on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/105-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/105-john-wick.jpg)

The non-animated Blood Oath Marker

The three-ball lock above the Red Circle Club is not included in the Pro model while the bash car doesn’t move to block the Continental Hotel.

[![There is no three ball lock above the Red Circle Club in the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/109-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/109-john-wick.jpg)

There is no three ball lock above the Red Circle Club in the Pro model and the car is static

[![The weapons chest is also a static model in the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/117-john-wick-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/john-wick/117-john-wick.jpg)

The weapons chest is also a static model in the Pro model

However, there are still plenty of RGB LEDs to help set the mood of the game, even without the Expression lighting.

So far are no peeks at the display Animations or any clips from the game’s soundtrack which is created by Charlie Benante of Anthrax and Pantera fame.

Here’s the feature matrix showing what’s included in each of the three models.

Here’s how Stern Pinball announced their latest release.

| --- |
| **CHICAGO, IL – May 7, 2024 –**Stern Pinball, Inc. announces its newest line of pinball games featuring the world’s greatest assassin, [***John Wick***](https://sternpinball.com/game/john-wick/). Created in collaboration with Lionsgate, players will experience the thrilling and action-packed billion-dollar grossing *John Wick* franchise with film-inspired mechanical features and artwork alongside Stern’s all-new dynamic AI combat system. *John Wick* pinball games are available in Pro, Premium, and Limited Edition (LE) models. The *John Wick* film franchise is produced by Thunder Road’s Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, along with franchise director Chad Stahelski through his 87Eleven Entertainment production company.  In Stern’s *John Wick*pinball games*,* players step into the role of the world’s greatest assassin as he fights to escape his past. As the titular character, players can engage in high-speed car chases and fast-action drifting across the playfield, which incorporates models and artwork inspired by iconic locations from the franchise, including the New York Continental Hotel and the Red Circle Club, all set against a dramatically edge lit New York City skyline. Players can also open John Wick’s weapons crate to reveal a hidden shot target path to retrieve an array of weapons. Players must use the sculpted Blood Oath Marker carefully – or risk the consequences. Players need to survive other assassins, complete jobs for the legendary Factions of the High Table, and eventually take on John Wick’s “Special Assignment!”  To raise the stakes, *John Wick*pinball introduces Stern’s all-new dynamic AI combat system, an innovation that brings the frenetic combat of the legendary films to the game. The Stern team has created a primitive video game AI system to control the enemy lights on the playfield, setting the *John Wick*pinball games apart from prior pinball machines, where all lights were controlled by player actions, timers, and random number generations. In this new AI combat system, enemy icons are responsive to player behavior and will illuminate dynamically around the playfield to challenge the player. The enemies move tactically with this dynamic software to counter player objectives, creating a unique challenge in each game session. The system also features a new action video player that dynamically reflects player action – as you defeat three enemies, you’ll see video clips of John Wick doing the same in the films!  Accompanying the high-quality film and audio assets woven into the gameplay, *John Wick* pinball games will include custom narration by critically acclaimed actor Ian McShane as Winston and an original score composed by Charlie Benante of Anthrax and Pantera fame. Additionally, pieces of John Wick’s iconic suits used in connection with the production of the films will be included as a franchise artifact in the LE models, courtesy of Lionsgate. The *John Wick* pinball games will feature original neo-noir style paintings illustrated by acclaimed artist, Randy Martinez.  “Inspired by one of the most iconic and thrilling film franchises of our time, we’re releasing *John Wick* pinball games with the most advanced technology we’ve ever created,” said Seth Davis, President & CEO of Stern Pinball, “We can’t wait for players to try out our new combat system and experience the action.”  *John Wick*pinball games include Stern’s award-winning Insider Connected™ system, which enables players to interact with the game and a global network of players in multiple ways.  Through Insider Connected, players can track progress, earn new game-specific Achievements, take on special *John Wick* Quests and complete Faction Contracts to increase their Assassin ranking.
