Stern Pinball today revealed their third cornerstone title of 2024 with the Jack Danger-designed, *The Uncanny X-Men*.

While Marvel’s *X-Men* brand may be familiar, the name *The Uncanny X-Men* is maybe less well known. In fact, *The Uncanny X-Men* was the original name for the group of superheroes with supernatural power, although the comic book featuring them was first published in 1963 under the *The X-Men* name.

The *The Uncanny X-Men* name has resurfaced several times, including when the franchise split into two different groupings. More recently, Marvel relaunched *The Uncanny X-Men* comic, with the first issue featuring Wolverine, Gambit, Jubilee, Rogue and Nightcrawler published on 7th August, 2024.

The first edition of the relaunched The Uncanny X-Men

Stern Pinball’s latest release is timed to tie-in with this Marvel franchise relaunch, with issue #2 of *The Uncanny X-Men (2024)* being published in two days’ time. Stern’s game uses comic book assets for the artwork and display graphics rather than anything related to the trilogy of X-Men movies or their four prequels.

As usual with Stern Pinball’s cornerstone games, there are three variants of *The Uncanny X-Men* – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition. For this title, the Limited Edition is restricted to 811 units produced, matching Earth-811 which is year in which *The Uncanny X-Men* storyline is set.

Here are the cabinet artwork packages for the three variants. All cabinet, playfield and plastics art is by Jeremy Packer (a.k.a. Zombie Yeti).

The three models of The Uncanny X-Men by Stern Pinball

The Limited Edition features purple metallic powercoat on all metalwork with laser-cut side rails. Both the Limited Edition and Premium incorporate flipper button protection into the side rails. The Limited Edition also includes metallic foil in the cabinet side art and a mirrored backglass.

So, now we come to the playfield designs, and as usual the Premium and Limited Edition share the same feature set when it comes to playfield artwork and mechanical toys, with the Limited Edition adding interior cabinet artwork.

The Pro cuts-out some of the more interesting and expensive mechanical features but appears to retain the same playfield cutouts, inserts and artwork, meaning Stern can use the same playfield base for all three models.

**Pro**

Here’s a comparison between the Pro’s and the Limited Edition’s playfield designs:

**Playfield Features**

To see what’s in the game, we will start with the Limited Edition model and then see which elements have been taken out or redesigned for the Pro model.

The most eye catching feature is the large Sentinel. In the Limited Edition and Premium models it has two positions – lowered and raised. In the lowered position it is a simple bash toy, but when it raises it reveals an articulating jaw which can be either closed or opened to reveal a kicker target in the mouth to fire the ball back at the player.

[![The lowered Sentinel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/309-uncanny-x-men-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/309-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The lowered Sentinel

[![The raised Sentinel with the mouth closed](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/308-uncanny-x-men-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/308-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The raised Sentinel with the mouth closed

The Sentinel isn’t just a head though, as it has two hands on either side of the playfield. One hand can block the ball and hold it temporarily, or flip it back the way it came, while the other can press down on one of the ramp return wireforms and deflect it, disrupting the ball’s progress.

[![One Sentinel hand can block the ball, at least temporarily](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/318-uncanny-x-men-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/318-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

One Sentinel hand can block the ball, at least temporarily

[![With the hand at rest the wireform is complete](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/317-uncanny-x-men-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/317-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

With the hand at rest the wireform is complete

[![With the hand activated, the wireform is dislocated](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/316-uncanny-x-men-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/316-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

With the hand activated, the wireform is dislocated

The Sentinel in the Pro model retains the opening/closing jaw and kicker target behind, but the head is static and the hands are just flat plastics which don’t interact with the ball.

The hand in the Pro is a flat plastic

Another high-profile mechanism is Beast’s Lab.

In the Premium and Limited Edition models this consists of a ball lock area combined with a captive ball. As the playfield has to be the same across all three models and this lock area is missing in the Pro model, Beast’s Lab is raised above the playfield.

[![The Beast's Lab ball lock in the Limited Edition model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/323-uncanny-x-men-1024x681.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/323-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The Beast’s Lab ball lock in the Limited Edition model

The captive ball part is also raised, with the ball being activated by a playfield-level target which links to the captive ball by a link arm.

[![The elevated captive ball is actuated by a connected standup target at playfield level](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/325-uncanny-x-men-658x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/325-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The elevated captive ball is actuated by a connected standup target at playfield level

The Pro model replaces the Beast’s Lab lock area with a leaper standup target where a hit on the flask standup target raises a vapour panel, with the speed of the panel’s movement determined by how hard the standup target is hit.

[![The leaper standup target on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/116-uncanny-x-men-786x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/116-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The vapour panel shoots up when the standup target is hit

Perhaps the most unusual playfield feature is the Danger Room. This section of the playfield sits in the area usually reserved for the left slingshot, inlane and outlane.

[![The Danger Room area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/219-uncanny-x-men-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/219-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The Danger Room area

There is no left slingshot in *The Uncanny X-Men*. Instead, there is a pop bumper, to the left of which is the Danger Room area. The ball can enter this either from above the pop bumper or on a wireform from the right.

There is a mini-flipper at the bottom of the area, a ‘Rogue’ standup target above it, another ‘Abort’ standup target to the right, a loopable mini-orbit with a Danger Room spinner and an exit ramp which feeds to the main left flipper. The pop bumper is also a very active part of the action in the Danger Room.

[![The Danger Room playfield area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/118-uncanny-x-men-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/118-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The Danger Room playfield area

The targets and ramp in the Danger Room

When the ball exits the Danger Room via the ramp, it can be held at the end of the wireform by a rotating arm which prevents the ball dropping back onto the playfield.

[![The ball is held at the end of the wireform from the Danger Room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/117-uncanny-x-men-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/117-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The ball is held at the end of the wireform from the Danger Room

The size of the Danger Room is such that the main flippers are moved over to the right. This results in the right outlane also being the ball shooter lane, with a one-way gate above the shooter rod to make sure the ball doesn’t end up back at the shooter rod instead of draining.

[![The right outlane is shared with the start of the ball shooter lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/220-uncanny-x-men-576x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/220-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The right outlane is shared with the start of the ball shooter lane

There is a corresponding ball hold in the right inlane, although this uses a more conventional up-post.

[![The ball hold in the right inlane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/216-uncanny-x-men-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/216-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The ball hold in the right inlane

Naturally, any game featuring a character named Magneto has to include a magnet. This time though, there are some inserts around the magnet to show when it is active.

[![The Magneto magnet feature](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/120-uncanny-x-men-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/uncanny-x-men/120-uncanny-x-men.jpg)

The Magneto magnet feature

Music for the game comes from Charlie Benante from the bands Anthrax and Pantera, with the sound package co-ordinated by Jerry Thompson. Waison Cheng is the lead on the software for this game.

Here’s how Stern Pinball announced *The Uncanny X-Men* as their latest release:
