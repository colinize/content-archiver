Louisville’s well-known arcade bar, [Recbar](http://www.recbarlouisville.com/), has recently opened a satellite location in Indiana named [Recbar 812](http://www.recbar812.com/).

[Recbar 812](https://www.facebook.com/Recbar812/) is truly massive, and the pictures in this review do not do it justice. The best way to describe it is a Dave and Busters on steroids.

Two floors of games

Recbar’s original location in Jeffersontown, which opened in 2016, is Louisville metro’s biggest arcade bar. I am told that Recbar 812 is twice the square footage of the original, with row after row of classic arcade games (list at the end of this review), colorful decor and a wide selection of food and drinks.

Recbar 812 is ‘all ages’ until it switches to 21+ at 10 pm. Recbar 812 has dining, bars and games on both levels, and about 80 pinball machines.

Some of Recbar 812’s pinballs

Recbar 812 boasts one of the biggest pinball collections available to the public under one roof in North America. One of the highlights is the *Hercules* pinball machine in the restaurant’s front corner. The game, released by Atari in 1979, is the largest pinball machine ever made, and Recbar’s is one of ten known to be in working order for public use.

All games are token operated, and Recbar 812 has commissioned custom tokens for you collectors out there. There are token machines on both levels.

Lots of tokens

The food at Recbar includes pub staples such as hamburgers (including the burger of the month), tacos and sandwiches. Tater Tots (or ‘tots for you *Napoleon Dynamite* fans) are one of the restaurant’s specialties. Recbar 812’s “totchos” are covered with toppings such as queso, pulled pork, and bacon.

The dining area

Something on [the menu](http://www.recbar812.com/grub.html) we found fascinating but not brave enough to order was the *Cougar Bait* (Country Boy Brewing beer-battered) fish tacos. We did try the *Grilled Mac* that is beer cheese Mac topped with Gouda cheese stuffed between Texas toast which was excellent with a side of tots.

The dining area

On the lighter side the *I Was A Roman Emperor And All I Got Was This Salad* is available topped with grilled chicken after being tossed with that familiar dressing. Recbar 812’s restaurant’s general concept is to use stuff you liked as a kid and turn it into an adult menu.

The bar features many craft and local beers, with about twenty beers on tap and another forty-to-fifty can/bottle options. Draft options include Ciderboy’s *First Press*, Sun King Brewery’s *Sunlight Cream Ale* and Against the Grain Brewery ’s *Citra Ass Down*. The complete tap listing can be found [on their website](http://www.recbar812.com/grains.html).

The bar area

Recbar 812 also offers speciality cocktails, and will eventually have Recbar’s famous *Buffalo Trace Bourbon* Slushie when Recbar 812 completes installation of a shiny new slushie machine – ETA late February.

The menu offers sugary ‘Bonus Level’ treats such as breakfast cereals, candies and other sweet treats, including *Oh Cinapp!* ice cream coated with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, or *Saturday Morning Ice Cream Sandwich* which is Fruity Pebbles and ice cream served between mini-waffles.

Some of the cocktails will include garnishes such as the *Sour Patch Kids*, *Scooby Snacks* candies and *Cocoa Puffs*.

The walls are adorned in colorful murals by local artist Braylyn ‘Resko’ Stewart depicting images ranging from *Mario Kart* to 1980s movies such as *Back to the Future*. The plan is for the murals to be an “evolving art piece” with images added over time.

Terri and my time here was limited and our visit was during the ‘adult time’ so we had to rely on the ‘locals’ for information about the crowd that Recbar 812 draws during the daytime.

It would seem as though many adults over fifty are bringing their grandchildren to experience Recbar 812’s [retro gaming experience](http://www.recbar812.com/games.html).
