Following its recent run of super-hero cartoon character-themed games such as Tron, Iron Man, Batman and Spider-Man, Stern Pinball took at stand at last month's Comic-Con convention in San Diego.

The company teamed up with IFPA's Josh Sharpe to run a high score competition on the company's current product, Tron Legacy which had a $500 prize for the top score of the show.  As expected, some fans really got into the theme.

This is not the first time Stern have exhibited their games at Comic-Con.  They showed Batman in 2008 and had Iron-Man there last year, seeing it as a great way to promote both sales and awareness of pinball amongst those fans who are most likely to appreciate the themes.

With a record of over 130,000 visitors to Comic-Con each day, they seem likely to achieve their aims.
