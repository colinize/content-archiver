Regular readers will know we've been following the progress of Zizzle and their range of three-quarter size home pinball games with layouts created by pinball designer John Popadiuk, Jr since before they hit the shops.

Their first two games were Marvel Heroes & Villains and Pirates Of The Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest which they launched in the second half of 2006.

These were followed a year later by an updated and improved G2 version of the same themes which brought the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise in line with  the latest movie - At World's End - and added extra lighting alongside new decals on the playfield plastics.

Now they have added a third model to the range and we have an exclusive series of sneak pictures of the game in development.

Based on a number of classic Atari video games, the new game uses the same playfield design as the earlier two models but has all new artwork, sounds and a new central toy.

The new Zizzle model - Atari Arcade Classics

Atari Arcade Classics combines elements from Centipede, Super Breakout, Asteroids, Missile Command and Pong - games which have enjoyed a resurgence since they have become available on an increased number of new platforms and consoles.

The new game is still in development at the Zizzle offices so there could be any number of changes made before it arrives in the shops in time for the 2009 holiday season.

The final game is expected to include a model asteroid as the central toy to tie-in with the Asteroid Attack wizard mode.
