**Date:**
2nd September, 2020

Stern Pinball today announced their new ‘cornerstone’ game title, *Avengers: Infinity Quest*, designed by Keith Elwin with artwork by Jeremy Packer a.k.a. Zombie Yeti.

A ‘cornerstone’ game is an in-house design which comes in the familiar three variants; Pro, Premium and Limited Edition. In this case the Limited Edition is limited to 500 machines.

This isn’t the first Avengers game from Stern. The George Gomez design was produced at the end of 2012 with the usual Pro/Premium/LE full-size variants – with the LEs available in two versions – followed by a The Pin home model in 2013.

As with *Batman*, *Jurassic Park* and *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*, Stern Pinball have returned to a previous theme for their new game title’s inspiration.

This new *Avengers: Infinity Quest* game is an all-new design, based on the Marvel comic book series rather than any of the popular movies. It is a six-ball, three-flipper game with the third flipper half-way up on the left side of the playfield.

The playfield from the Pro model

There are quite a few design differences between the Pro and the Premium/LE playfields. The major ones are the addition of an extra ramp on the more expensive variants, along with the ability for the spinning disc to rise up to expose an under-playfield ball lock, and an upkicker on the right which replaces the standup target found in the Pro.

The translite in the Premium model

The premium comes with the same black-wrinkle powdercoat on the side rails and the lock bar, but has the full-feature playfield from the Limited Edition.

The Premium model

The Limited Edition come with Infinity Yellow powdercoated metalwork as well as all the usual goodies found on LEs, such as a shaker motor, a mirrired backglass, upgraded speakers and anti-reflective playfield glass.

Here’s a view of the Pro and Premium/LE playfields side-by-side:

The Pro playfield vs the Limited Edition playfield

On the playfield, all three variants include the Avengers tower, which grabs the ball and builds virtual locks for Iron Man Multiball. The description also suggests it uses optos to sense the speed of the ball, acting like a vari-target.

The Avengers Tower

The three models also include drop targets on the left side to light up a bonus feature matrix in front.

The Doctor Strange spinning disc on the Pro acts much like the Tesseract spinner on the original Avengers game, only this one has a single post and no model mounted over the disc.

The Premium and LE’s disc rises up, *Cirqus Voltaire*-style, to reveal a shot under the playfield. This leads to a three-ball lock which can be viewed through a clear window in the playfield rather like the coffin lock in *Metallica*.
