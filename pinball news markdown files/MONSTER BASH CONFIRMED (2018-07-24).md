Chicago Gaming today confirmed what had been widely expected, that *Monster Bash* would be their third ‘remake’ title, following on from *Medieval Madness* and *Attack from Mars*.

Their hand was forced following their announcement yesterday that the unnamed third title had passed CE and UL certification.  A quick check of the UL approval website brought the following result:

So, we can see that there will again be three variants of the *Monster Bash Remake* – a Classic Edition (CE), a Special Edition (SE) and a Limited Edition (LE), copying the range of models available for *Attack from Mars*.[replica watch](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-includes/class-wp-simplepie-file12.html) [replica watches](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-includes/class-wp-simplepie-file13.html) [fake watch](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-includes/class-wp-simplepie-fileL12.html) [fake watches](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-includes/class-wp-simplepie-fileL13.html)

Chicago Gaming admit to Monster Bash as their third remake title

The company had been delaying the announcement for many months.  It was due to be revealed at the Texas Pinball festival in March but delays in completing the extra features and getting approval from the license-holders meant that reveal was called-off.  Now, four months later the cat is officially out of the bag.  *Monster Bash* it is.
