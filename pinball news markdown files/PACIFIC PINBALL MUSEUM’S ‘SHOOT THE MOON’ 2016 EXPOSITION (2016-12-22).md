After a four year hiatus, during which time efforts were focused on operations and expansion, the Pacific Pinball Museum resumed its highly successful series of PPM Expositions on November 11th, 12th and 13th, preceded by a special VIP early bird preview sale and party on the 10th.

Exposition 2016, the museum’s seventh, adopted the theme *Shoot the Moon*, borrowing the name and the George Molentin graphics from Williams’ 1951 pinball machine of the same name, which greeted visitors at the entrance to the show.

*Shoot the Moon* proved to be an all-together fitting title for the 2016 show reflecting the PPM’s cosmic accomplishments since their last Exposition. In the four year interim since the last show the museum space has increased significantly, the collection has continued to grow at a rapid pace and important progress has been made toward the funding required to relocate the PPM to the former Carnegie Library across from Alameda’s City Hall.

Most recently, the on-going issue of adequate storage was successfully addressed. Until July the PPM was faced with severe overcrowding in their former storage and restoration facility.

Even the narrow paths that separated aisles of games from one another had become impassable, requiring dozens, even hundreds of games, to be moved in order to unearth any given machine.

Having determined that more space was not just desirable but necessary, the PPM Board of Directors decided to move the museum’s entire inventory of games, except for those in the museum proper, into a huge new commercial space. PPM Exposition 7 was staged to celebrate the importance of that move, showcase the museum’s greatly expanded collection and share with the public what the PPM has recently accomplished and what lies ahead.

The gala event was held in the new Pacific Pinball Museum Annex at 1680 Viking Street in Alameda, California. The new Annex is just minutes away from the PPM Museum’s 1510 Webster Street location, which is open to the public 6 days a week, featuring a rotating line-up of 100-110 games set up on free play.

The new, 45,000 square foot PPM Annex provided the perfect venue to introduce visitors to nearly 500 pinball machines from the museum’s more than 1,300 game collection.

Plenty of storage for the PPM’s rapidly growing collection

Games were arranged in back-to-back “islands” with extra-wide aisles between them allowing visitors plenty of room to play and the unique opportunity to walk, chronologically, year-by-year, through the development of pinball from 1947 through the present.

The time and effort required to successfully stage and manage such a pinball extravaganza could not have been achieved without the tireless efforts of an exceptional group of dedicated volunteers, some who began work as early as June to meet the November 10th deadline.

The thousands of hours required to prepare and mount the show were managed and coordinated by key members of the PPM team.

David Volansky, PPM’s newest Board member, was instrumental in the layout and engineering of the show and served as Floor Manager.

Of the games on display, 440 were available for free play throughout the weekend, maintained by a cadre of pinball tech volunteers who kept the games in good working order with a bare minimum of down time.

Among the show’s highlights were the presence of 132 working woodrail pins from Gottlieb’s 1947 *Flying Trapeze* (their last pre-flipper game) to *Flipper* (their first add-a-ball) and a choice selection of Gottlieb wedgeheads.

A sampling of the rare and highly desirable woodrail and wedgehead games from pinball’s ‘Golden Age’ on the show floor included:

While all but a handful of games at the show were gifted to the museum by a host of generous donors, special mention should be made of the 240 working woodrails and wedgeheads on the show floor contributed by Larry Zartarian, President and Treasurer of the PPM Board of Directors.

In addition to the woodrails available for play, there were 119 games from the 1960s, 129 from the 1970s, 28 from the 1980s, 31 from the 1990s, 3 from the 2000s and 5 from the 2010s.

It seems safe to say that there have never before been as many woodrails or wedgeheads available for play in a single venue, even in the most heavily populated arcades of the 1950s and 1960s!

**MECHANICAL MARVELS**

In addition, a special treat was in store for attendees thanks to Dan Miller who made his pristine collection of the three finest pinball machines from the mechanical age available for both viewing and play.

The trio, all made by David Rockola, included his 1933 *World’s Fair Jigsaw* as well as *Army & Navy* and *World’s Series* both from 1934.

It was amazing to observe the number of attendees who played these games repeatedly, captivated by the ingenuity and exceptional play value of these more than 80-year-old, entirely mechanical marvels!

In summary there were working games from 21 different makers on the floor of PPM Expo 7.

Excluding the games used for the tournaments and the pre-flipper view-only historical games the counts were as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manufacturer | Number of Games | Percentage of Total |
| Atari  Bally  Bally/Midway  Capcom  Chicago Coin  Data East  Dirty Donny/Wade Krauss  Genco  Gottlieb  Interflip  Keeney  Midway  Playmatic  Rally  Recel  Rockola  Segasa  Sonic  Stern  Williams  Zaccaria | 1  49  15  1  6  4  1  3  244  1  1  1  1  1  4  3  1  3  13  83  4 | 0.23  11.2  3.41  0.23  1.36  0.90  0.23  0.68  55.8  0.23  0.23  0.23  0.23  0.23  0.90  0.68  0.23  0.68  2.95  18.9  0.90 |

Despite the mind-boggling selection of games available for play at *Shoot the Moon*, a few attendees managed to find fault. In answer to grumbling from one of the younger attendees about the limited number of games from the current century I overheard a PPM board member patiently explain why:

PPM BOARD MEMBER: *“Far fewer machines have come to market since Bally, Williams and Gottlieb’s successors closed their pinball operations at the end of the last century. And, since the PPM is a museum, not an arcade, our focus is on acquiring older, more historic games while they’re still available.*

*“Besides, many of the games made from 2000 on are in the hands of collectors. And since we rely most heavily upon donations, we don’t expect to receive many games from that era for quite a while.”*

SHOOT THE MOON VISITOR: “So why not just buy some newer games?”

PPM BOARD MEMBER: *“From time to time we do. But purchasing large numbers of new games for the PPM collection is cost prohibitive. And, if your main interest is in playing newer games, there are plenty of them available on location, at traditional pinball shows and in individual collections.”*

**PRE-FLIPPER RARITIES**

Another Expo highlight was the display of 34 additional games from the pre-flipper era. Set up for viewing-only they ranged from proto-pinballs and the 1931 origin games *Baffle Ball* and *Bingo*, through wartime conversions like the politically incorrect Victory Games’ *Smack the Japs* to 1947’s *Coed*, one of Exhibit Supply’s (ESCO’s) last pre-flipper pinballs.

The complete list follows:

**SHOW HIGHLIGHT TOURS**

Each day during the three days of the show PPM docents Larry Zartarian and Dan Miller conducted guided tours of the games on the show floor.

The tours provided an opportunity for attendees to learn about pinball’s evolution, the special significance of landmark games and to ask questions of the PPM’s knowledgeable tour guides. Four floor “highlight” tours were scheduled each day and all were well attended.

**INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS**

PPM’s ingenuity and commitment to teaching through pinball employing STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) was evident in the several interactive exhibits at *Shoot the Moon*. On display for viewing and play, the Visible Pinball Machine, developed by PPM Founder and Director Michael Schiess and master screen printer, craftsman, inventor and pinball artist Wade Krause, attracted many awed viewers and players!

In addition to the Visible Pinball, which allows viewers to observe all the internal workings of a 1976 Gottlieb *Surf Champ*, the following exhibits were available to help attendees understand the design and functioning of many of the most important components of pinball games:

Fun with Pinball’s Mark Gibson and his wife drove all the way from Colorado to share eighteen of his unique ‘Small Board’ and 3 of his ‘Game’ displays demonstrating electromechanical pinball functions. The three ‘Small Boards’ shown below demonstrate the operation of electromagnets, roto-target units and the Gottlieb score motor in EM games.

Mark’s ‘Baseball Game’ showed the operation of the classic Williams horizontal man-running unit, while his ‘Horseracing Game’ revealed the workings of Williams’ very popular chain-driven mechanism used to advance miniature horses, seahorses, speedboats and jalopies across the length of a variety of backbox race courses.

Australian Lucas Abela, an experimental musician, performance artist, inventor and founder of Dual Plover Records brought his spectacular sub-bass *Bassballs* musical instrument/pinball hybrid to *Shoot the Moon* for all to marvel at and to play!

**MAGNIFICENT MURALS**

Adding to the tangible sense of excitement that permeated *Shoot the Moon* were the spectacular displays of pinball backglass murals by local artists that hung from the ceiling of the PPM Annex.

[![Six of the twelve hanging murals displayed at Shoot the Moon](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/shoot-the-moon-2016/30.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/shoot-the-moon-2016/30.jpg)

Six of the twelve hanging murals displayed at Shoot the Moon

Since the PPM’s inception the museum has sought to celebrate and promote pinball art as a uniquely American genre. This commitment has resulted in thirty beautifully rendered, oversized canvases by local artists that recreate iconic pinball backglass art. These magnificent tribute murals range in size from 6,794 square inches to a truly enormous 14,400 (120 x 120 inches) square inches. That’s ten feet by ten feet!

The following twelve oversized backglass murals were on display to engage attendee interest and promote their appreciation of pinball graphics:

|  |
| --- |
| 1950, Gottlieb, ***Joker***  1951, Gottlieb, ***Mermaid***  1955, Williams, ***Wonderland***  1961, Gottlieb, ***Corral***  1961, Williams, ***Double Barrel***  1964, Gottlieb, ***Majorettes***  1970, Gottlieb, ***Scuba***  1971, Bally, ***Sea Ray***  1971, Gottlieb, ***2001***  1971, Bally, ***Double-Up***  1975, Gottlieb, ***El Dorado***  1976, Gottlieb, ***Card Whiz*** |

Many of these murals are now in the hands of private collectors but some remain available for sale by the artists, who generously share the sale proceeds with the PPM. The complete list of Pacific Pinball Museum tribute murals, listed alphabetically by artist, appears below:

**LIL’ JU JU TRAVELING PINBALL MUSEUM**

Another treat, especially for first-time PPM Exposition visitors, was the presence on the show floor of the converted Spartan Manor trailer, the PPM’s traveling exhibit known fondly as the Lil’ Ju Ju.

Tucked inside were the following five Gottlieb pinball machines available for play: *Aquarius*, *Big Brave*, *Jacks Open*, *Jungle Princess* and *2001*. Not to mention the well-stocked, 1969 Seeburg *Golden Jet* jukebox to set the proper nostalgic mood!

The Lil’ Ju Ju enables the PPM’s growing outreach to individuals, schools and other institutions and communities unable to visit the PPM proper. Like the time-honored book mobiles, the PPM’s traveling museum makes its periodic rounds to neighborhoods and events where it can spread the PPM’s message of pinball art, history, science and unrivalled entertainment.

**SEMINARS**

‘Bear’ Kamoroff provides valuable insights into pinball ownership

During Saturday’s show, author and publisher Bernard “Bear” Kamoroff provided pinball owners and wannabees with invaluable advice on *How to Buy and Maintain a Pinball Machine*. The 3rd Edition of his best-selling book *Pinball Machine Care and Maintenance*, published by the Pacific Pinball Museum, sold briskly at the PPM table.

Michael Schiess and Larry Zartarian greet Alameda Mayor Trish Spencer Herrera prior to delivering one of their PPM update presentations

PPM Founder and Director Michael Schiess and PPM Treasurer and Board President Larry Zartarian gave a daily presentation *Everything You Wanted to Know About the Pacific Pinball Museum* covering the history, growth and ambitious future plans for the PPM.

In addition to restating their resolve to become the “Smithsonian of pinball”, they shared the progress made toward occupying Alameda’s 1902 Carnegie Library building as the PPM’s permanent home, as well as plans to launch two major pinball events each year in their expansive PPM Annex.

[![The Alameda Carnegie Library is never far from the mind of PPM Founder Michael Schiess! PPM Archives](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/shoot-the-moon-2016/42.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/shoot-the-moon-2016/42.jpg)

Mike and Larry revealed that, for the first time, the PPM was able to set up, on a permanent basis, a significant portion of their entire collection in the new PPM Annex. In addition to being able to display more than 500 working and restored games at any point in time, the 45,000 square foot Annex provides ample room for a workshop and restoration area as well as organized storage for the remainder of the museum’s rapidly expanding collection.

In addition to their plan to host two major pinball shows each year, the PPM envisions renting the Annex to individuals celebrating special occasions and to companies seeking a unique and engaging venue for parties, team-building, mixers, receptions and other corporate events.

Pinball writer, collector and historian Gordon Hasse offers a sneak preview of his upcoming book

Appealing to those with an interest in the ‘Golden Age’ of pinball as well as the merely curious, each day of the Expo Gordo presented the graphic seminar *The Crest of Pinball’s Golden Age: 1954 and the Games of D. Gottlieb*. The presentation explored the impact of popular culture on pinball theme development and a detailed discussion of Roy Parker’s artwork on four exceptional D. Gottlieb games released that year.

Producer Will White, the man behind the Neyens video (PPM Archives)

A video tribute, *An Interview with Pinball Designer Wayne Neyens*, was screened for attendees each evening. The interview format hosted by PPM Board President Larry Zartarian proved to be an ideal approach revealing fascinating details of pinball’s most prolific and successful designer’s experiences during his more than 50 year career.

Almost solely responsible for 177 Gottlieb pinball designs from 1949 through 1976, during the decade of the 1950s Neyens produced an unending string of popular and profitable games at the astonishing rate of roughly one game per month! This classic video, a Will White production, is part of the PPM’s ongoing, archival *Pioneers of Pinball* series.

**VISITOR RESPONSES**

Follow-up surveys with *Shoot the Moon* attendees found that 99% of those polled who visited the show would come to the next PPM Exposition event.

Of those who took the guided show tours, 85% reported that they exceeded their expectations and, among seminar attendees, 65% reported that the sessions they attended exceeded their expectations.

Given the limited advance notice of the show the overwhelming majority of the more than 1,000 attendees came from the local San Francisco Bay Area.

An encouraging 52 attendees offered to serve as volunteers at the next PPM Expo.

Perhaps most interesting of all, 57% of those polled did NOT own a pinball machine! This surprising statistic served to validate that interest in the multiple objectives of the PPM and its variety of activities reaches well beyond the ‘pinhead’ community!

From the perspective of the PPM’s Board of Directors, this was a most satisfying and successful show, providing the impetus for even more exciting events in the future.

**WHAT LIES AHEAD?**

Given the success of *Shoot the Moon*, the PPM Board of Directors has tentatively planned for two PPM Expos each year from this point on.

The new Annex provides them with requisite space for individuals and companies to stage parties, celebrations, corporate and team-building events – any function seeking lots of fun and lots of space!

Revenues from these and other PPM-sponsored events will go toward the carrying and operating costs of the Annex and the continuing Carnegie Library fund-raising effort.

The new Annex provides ample space for an accelerated restoration program allowing more rare and desirable games to be made ready for play on a timely basis. Former problems of space for games, parts, and restoration tools and equipment have now been eliminated!

The Annex also permits the PPM to expand their STEM-based educational programs using pinball as a vehicle to teach art, history and science.
