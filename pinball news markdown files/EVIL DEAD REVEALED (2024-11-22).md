After teasing the announcement yesterday, Spooky Pinball today revealed their latest game based on the first two *Evil Dead* movies.

*The Evil Dead* movie began as a low budget project co-created and directed by Sam Raimi in 1979 but not released until 1981. It didn’t get a wider theatrical release until 1983 but quickly gained a cult following, especially in the UK when it was released on VHS where it became the best selling video of the year, outselling *The Shining*.

The lead actor is Bruce Campbell who plays the protagonist Ash Williams in the original *The Evil Dead*, as well as the sequels, *Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn* and *Army of Darkness*. Bruce has recorded custom callouts for the Spooky Pinball game to go alongside the movie voice clips. In addition, professional voice actors Lara Sluyter and Scott Innes have recorded in-game callouts.

The backglass artwork for Evil Dead

*Evil Dead*  is unlike Spooky Pinball’s recent designs in several ways.

For a start, it features a widebody playfield which Spooky haven’t used since their *Scooby-Doo Where Are You!* game from early 2023.

Then, the playfield design by ‘Spooky Luke’ and Corwin ‘Bug’ Emery is also only being used for a single title, unlike *Halloween* and *Ultraman: Kaiju Battle*, and *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* and *Looney Tunes* which used a single playfield design for two titles.

The game will also only have a single Collector’s Edition priced at $9,999 plus tax and shipping, and be limited to 888 units. A separate animated topper for the game is available at $1,399.

Software for *Evil Dead* is by Ben Heck while Matt Montgomery created the music, Matt Riesterer from *Back Alley Creations* produced the sculpted models in the game, with new Spooky-exclusive signing Christopher Franchi designing all the artwork.

Spooky Pinball say *Evil Dead* is their most feature-packed gamed to date with the most mechanisms.

Here’s how they announced the game:

| --- |
| Evil Dead Pinball is a wide body pinball machine set in the the world of the first two films of the iconic franchise, The Evil Dead, and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn.   The players will be guided along by Ashley Williams, voiced by Bruce Campbell, as they battle the relentless forces of evil. Ash’s now evil girlfriend Linda (voiced by Lara Sluyter) and Professor Knowby (Voiced by Scott Innes) will provide an additional level of Deadite trickery and direction to the game.  Evil Dead Pinball is our most ambitious game to date, featuring the highest number of mechs in a Spooky Pinball machine yet. The game also features original clips, speech, and sfx from both films.   Evil Dead Pinball is the 4th game by the designer duo “Spooky Luke” and Corwin “Bug” Emery. Many other Spooky crew members have returned for this release, including Ben Heck on the code, Matt Montgomery providing the score, Back Alley Creations, on the sculpts. This is also the first in a series of many Spooky Pinball games featuring a full art package by Christopher Franchi.   It’s time to officially “Join Us” in what we can confidently say is our most beautiful, most loaded, most impressive world under glass yet. |
