**Date:**
August 2018

**Location:**
Whaley Port, 3rd Floor, Blúport, Hua Hin, 8/89 Soi Moo Baan Nongkae, Nongkae Sub-District, Hua Hin District, Prachuapkhirikhan Province, 77110 Thailand

I visited both Bangkok and Hua Hin in Thailand in August 2018 with my family.

Originally, I had no idea there were any pinball games in Hua Hin, but I accidentally found a pinball location – The Whaley Port amusement centre inside the city of Hua Hin.  It is located on the 3rd floor of the Blúport Hua Hin.

There were 2 games located in the central area of the centre:

* Metallica Pro (Stern, 2013)
* The Avengers Pro (Stern, 2012)

Metallica Pro and The Avengers Pro

As usual, it costs THB20 ($0.61/€0.53/£0.47) for a 3-ball game, and with low replay scores.

Low replay scores

Unfortunately, they were lacking regular maintenance – the playfields were dirty and some of the components were not working.   Anyway, the condition of these two games was of an acceptable level.
