Melbourne-based [Haggis Pinball](https://haggispinball.com/) today announced that their second title will be a remake of the classic Bally title *Fathom*, produced in association with [Planetary Pinball](http://www.planetarypinball.com/).

*Fathom Revisited* will keep the original look, feel and playfield layout but, like the remake titles from [Chicago Gaming](https://www.chicago-gaming.com/), will use modern mechanisms and technology to provide RGB lighting and displays, improved sound quality and an alternative ruleset.

| Haggis Pinball, makers of the *Celts* pinball machine, in collaboration with Planetary Pinball Supply, Inc, introduces the first Haggis Classics machine, *Fathom Revisited*, the original released by Bally in 1981.  Only 3,500 *Fathom* machines were produced making it a highly desirable pinball machine and the obvious first choice for Haggis Pinball to remake as part of their Haggis Classics series.  “There’s just so much to love about the *Fathom* pinball machine it’s hard to pick just one great thing about it,” says Damian Hartin, CEO of Haggis Pinball. “I love the art from Greg Freres and the layout is fantastic with all the drop targets and challenging but rewarding gameplay. Not to mention the amazing sound effects and iconic callouts. It has always been one of my favourite solid-state pinball machines from this era and I cannot wait to show people how we have been able to remake it using modern technology whilst preserving the look and feel of the original game. Plus, we are making a special “Mermaid Edition” that truly enhances the original game with additional cosmetic features, lighting system, enhanced audio, and the ability to choose between the original rules or a completely new 2.0 ruleset.”  Haggis Pinball will be using their enhanced playfield manufacturing process to prevent dimpling from everyday play as well as their extensive testing practices to ensure the game made today has the reliability pinball collectors and fans from around the world expect, so they can enjoy their games for years to come.  Clan Haggis members will be able to exclusively order a *Fathom Revisited* machine for the next 2 days till midnight on the 28th April 2021 AEDT, after which time, we will make the game available for sale via our website: haggispinball.com.  We will only be making 250 Mermaid Edition games, and they will only be available to order for the next four weeks.  Pricing: Mermaid Edition $11,500 AUD (US$8,968/€7,431/£6,457) Classic Edition $9,500 AUD (US$7,408/€6,139/£5,334) Plus Shipping and Taxes where applicable (Mermaid Edition includes free shipping within Australia and free shipping to Planetary Pinball Supply in the USA) |
