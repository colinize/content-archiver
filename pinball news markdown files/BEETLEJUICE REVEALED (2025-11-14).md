**Date:** November 14th, 2025

Spooky Pinball today announced their latest release, *Beetlejuice*, based on the 1988 comedy horror film directed by Tim Burton and staring Michael Keaton.

Spooky have been teasing the game and releasing selected details in the weeks before today’s official launch, but this is the first time we get to see everything in the game.

There is only one version available, priced at $9,999 with a maximum production of 999 units. There are additional options of an animatronic topper instead of the static one included by default, and the ‘butter’ high-gloss cabinet decals which are also available if purchased at the time of ordering.

When the game went on sale today, it was mostly already sold-out at distributors, but Spooky Pinball did have a number for direct sale to customers. These sold out within 15 minutes of orders opening.

Left’s take a look at the cabinet artwork by Christopher Franchi. These pictures feature the upgraded animatronic ‘Beetle Snake’ topper.

So, what’s on the playfield? Well, as the follow-up to *Evil Dead*, Spooky have quite a lot to live up to. While *Evil Dead* was a widebody game, *Beetlejuice* is standard width.

The Beetlejuice playfield

Probably the main toy in the game is the Sandworm.

[![The Sandworm](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/beetlejuice/016-beetlejuice-1024x580.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/beetlejuice/016-beetlejuice.jpg)

The Sandworm

This model can move up, down, left and right, plus it can also swallow the ball. An Attack from Mars style motorised target bank blocks access to the Sandworm and the scoop underneath.

The target bank in front of the Sandworm

The scoop contains two more standup targets which can be shot by the ball entering the subway.

The standup targets under the Sandworm

An area of the playfield at the top represents the waiting room from the movie. It has its own orbit lane, scoop, standup targets and a full-size flipper.

The Waiting Room area

Above the Waiting Room is a couch which can lock ball fed to it on a wireform from the right orbit lane.

Balls locked on the couch

When multiball begins, the couch tips forward to release the locked balls.

On the left is Dante’s Inferno, which features a roulette-style wheel where the player hits the action button to select one of the awards.

On the opposite side is the *Beetlejuice* sculpt. This rises out from behind his gravestone, but also lifts a trapped ball with him, firing it back to the player on the right wireform.

Beetlejuice can raise a ball and shoot it down the right wireform

A launched ball can go straight down the right outlane, in which case it is brought back from the dead by a magnet between the flippers which flings it back up the playfield.
