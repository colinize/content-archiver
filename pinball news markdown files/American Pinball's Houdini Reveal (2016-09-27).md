Report by Tim “Cornelius”  Crowley

Las Vegas  was built on magic. How else can one explain this lush paradise smack dab in  the middle of the desert? And there are magicians everywhere you turn in Vegas;  either performing tricks to a captive audience on stage, or all the magical  ways this town can separate you from your money.

So what  better place than Las Vegas to see the reveal of American Pinball’s Houdini: Master Mystery pinball?

It’s been  one heck of a week for this pinball upstart out of Streamwood, Illinois. They  went from “Who is American Pinball?” to being the hottest gossip in the  pinball industry, all due to their post on Facebook on September 23rd,  proclaiming the end of the Magic Girl fiasco, with the machines being promised  to the rightful owners by the end of the year.

Not only that, but also the announcement  of a brand new Houdini pinball machine!

It all  sounded like slight-of-hand. So in an effort to present the pinball community  with the best, most up-to-date information, I contacted American Pinball to see  if I could check out this brand-spanking-new pin in person.

And much to my  delight, they welcomed me with open arms!

The entire  drive throughout the desert had me worried that this was all going to be a  trick. But I had to know the truth! Was this going to be all smoke and mirrors,  or the real thing?

And then, I  was summoned to the Venetian. They were ready to let me peek behind the  curtain!

After  getting very, very lost in the Venetian / Palazzo (who knew they were connected?),  I finally met with Dhaval Vasani and Scott Goldberg of American Pinball. They  welcomed me warmly, then led me through the maze of hallways leading up to  their suite.

My heart  raced as we walked. Was I about to see magic? Or was I going to leave disappointed…  a nonbeliever?

The door to  the suite opened, and… there it was, at the other end of the room.

Inside the suite at the Venetian; the Houdini pinball

The real  thing! The glowing lights of the unknown made my palms sweaty. I walked closer  and closer, tentatively, like if I got to close, it would disappear. I almost  expected it to shimmer like an oasis as I reached out to touch it. But it was  real! And it is gorgeous. Full-on gorgeous.

Now, I have  good news and bad news for you, gentle readers.

Let’s get the bad news out of  the way: I didn’t get to play the machine. Now, that’s not to say that it  wasn’t playable. It’s just not to the point that American Pinball can  truthfully let anyone play it and say that they’ve seen the finished product.

While the gentlemen of American Pinball insisted on holding their cards close  to their vest, keep in mind that what the pin standing right in front of me was  the product of only three months work. So far, even though I wasn’t able to  play Houdini, what is available to be seen is an incredible effort. This is not  the “box of blinking lights” that the Magic Girl reveal was. This is right  around the bend from being ready to go.

What’s the  good news, you ask?

Here it is: the game is gorgeous. It’s got that John Popadiuk  magical vibe throughout it. The artwork is by a brand new, soon-to-be-named  artist who hasn’t worked in the industry before. To me, it had a real Matt  Wagner-esque feel to it. Very eye-catching, indeed!

Houdini: Master Mystery

I was also told that they  are using a new variety of RGB LEDs in these units, and you could see that they  were warmer to the eye than some of the RGB LEDs you see in other titles.

Another  fascinating thing about the Houdini pin is the display. It’s a full-color LED,  not full sized like a Jersey Jack display, but bigger than your traditional DMD  display – and it’s on the back of the playfield, like Cirqus Voltaire updated  for 2016. I asked if this means there will be a video mode? Again, they didn’t  want to say too much, but I could tell by their sly grins that they might have  something spectacular up their sleeves.

In addition,  the playfield had some really interesting toys on it! There is a catapult –  yes, a catapult – that launches the ball towards a bullseye target. There is  this wild loop-de-loop shot unlike anything I’ve ever seen in pinball before. There  is a bumper that lifts out of the playfield. And there are ramps, both plastic  and steel, flying to and fro. There is a steel ramp with lightning bolts on it,  similar to the crossover ramp on AC/DC, that looks like more than meets the  eye. And magnets? Well, what would a pinball game about Houdini be without  magnets?

And now we  come to the (Jeannie) elephant in the room. What does all this have to do with  Jpop? What happened to Zidware? When are the people that ordered their games  going to get them?

More than  anything at all – even more than their excitement to share their new pin with me –  American Pinball wanted me to share with all of you that they want to be a  straightforward, honest, transparent company with integrity. To that end, they  have announced that they will be fulfilling the Magic Girl orders, with their  first units ready to go by the Chicago Pinball Expo in October, and the  remaining orders shipped by the end of 2016.

“People have  been waiting for the Magic Girl situation to be resolved”, Scott told me.  “These people had given up hope on ever receiving their product. Our plan is to  make them whole, then move towards the future.”

And what  does the future hold for American Pinball? If they actually can make the Magic  Girl fiasco right, they will be super – no, super-duper – heroes to the pinball  community. If Houdini plays as good as it looks, at a retail price of $6995?  Then the pinball industry has a new, serious challenger on their hands. Perhaps  this might stifle the incredible inflation going on in the pinball industry  right now?

They’re also  very keen in bringing new blood into the pinball industry.

As I mentioned  earlier, the person doing the art for Houdini has never worked within the  pinball industry before. If there are any home-brew creators out there, you  might want to send American Pinball your resume!

Finally, I  asked Scott the tough question. The one I had been dreading asking all night.  Why on Earth would this company want to work with John Popadiuk? Scott went on  to tell me that they had worked together at Zizzle, and he was amazed at how  many different ideas John had with. That John didn’t focus on just one aspect  of creating pinball; he was able to work on all the different parts.

But most of  all, Scott told me with a grin: “We’re a brand new company. Who would care  about American Pinball if we didn’t have a big name behind us?”

Or more than  one big name, nudge nudge, say no more…
