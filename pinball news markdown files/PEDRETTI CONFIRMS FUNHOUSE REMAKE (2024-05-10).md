[Pedretti Pinball](https://www.pinballremakes.com/) today confirmed what had been previously discussed in several recent [Pinball Industry News PIN*cast*](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/09/05/pincasts-page/) episodes – that their first full remake title will be of William’s *Funhouse*.

In a teaser video released today they showed a glimpse of their first full pinball machine.

Pedretti Pinball’s upcoming Funhouse Remake

There are no details of the game announced yet, nor how many versions will be made available, but from the view above we can see that this model uses an LCD panel rather than the alphanumeric displays of the original. It also features a reimagined artwork package by [Flyland Designs’ Brian Allen](https://www.flylanddesigns.com/), including speaker panel and inner cabinet art.

The blue powdercoat side rails include flipper button area protection, with the blue theme extended to the legs, backbox hinges and lockbar.

The game appears to include the LCD mystery mirror panel which was part of the *Funhouse 2.0: Rudy’s Nightmare* upgrade kit. It is also expected to run on the [FAST Pinball](https://fastpinball.com/) controller and driver boardset and use playfields made by [Classic Playfield Reproductions](https://classicplayfields.com/) in Nova Scotia, Canada. Building of the game will take place at the [Euro Pinball Corp](https://www.europinball.net/) manufacturing business in Italy established in conjunction with Pinball Brothers.
