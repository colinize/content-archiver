[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:19] Today on Topcast we have a really special guest.

[00:21] Somebody that's been in the pinball industry since the 1970s.

[00:25] He first started working in Atari and then moved to Williams.

[00:29] And then later as design games for Stern.

[00:32] Special guest.

[00:33] Special guest.

[00:35] Special guest.

[00:36] Special guest.

[00:38] So we're about to talk to Steve Richie.

[00:40] Steve's designed some of the best selling pinball games of all times,

[00:44] such as Flash, Firepower, Black Knight, High Speed, F-14 Tomcat,

[00:51] Black Knight 2000, Terminator 2, High Speed 2, The Getaway,

[00:56] Star Trek Next Generation, Terminator 3, Elvis,

[01:00] and of course his latest effort, Spider-Man.

[01:03] Okay, so we're going to give Steve Richie a call right now and have a little chat with him

[01:09] here on Topcast.

[01:16] Hi, Clay.

[01:17] Hi, can you hear me?

[01:18] Yeah, very well actually.

[01:20] Steve, tell me about your first memories of pinball and when you were, you know, first,

[01:24] first started playing.

[01:25] What I remember first in pinball was my dad taking me to play land at the beach in San Francisco.

[01:32] And I guess I was about three or four years old.

[01:37] And you know, he stood me up on this like little bench thing that they had for little kids to stand on

[01:42] so that I could play the pinball.

[01:44] And I do remember the pinball machines were all mounted on like a platform.

[01:49] They didn't have individual legs.

[01:51] They were all mounted up about two and a half feet up.

[01:54] And so you couldn't shake him or anything.

[01:57] You could just play them.

[01:59] After that, I don't know, I would say three or four years went by and my parents started

[02:04] bowling at this bowling yoll called the Seaball.

[02:07] And you know, they would bring us my sister and I.

[02:11] My brother wasn't born yet.

[02:12] And it's like we would play, you know, they'd give us a dollar,

[02:16] which was a lot of money because pinball is only a dime of play.

[02:20] And there were five balls, always five balls in California.

[02:23] Anyway, that's my first memories of pinball.

[02:27] How did you get involved in the pinball industry?

[02:29] You know, what was your first job?

[02:30] My first job in the industry, well, it occurred when I was in a rock and roll band.

[02:36] I got out of the clothes cart.

[02:37] I dropped out of college after a while and I just,

[02:41] I played in bands.

[02:43] I was a guitar player and I was making hard to anything.

[02:45] I had met my wife who was my girlfriend at the time.

[02:48] And basically she was supporting me except for whatever I could,

[02:51] you know, manage to, you know, put together from our band gigs and,

[02:57] you know, other other jobs that I tried to do like spray painting,

[03:01] addresses on curves and stuff like that.

[03:04] Anyway, I just got sick of being broke.

[03:06] So I walked into Atari one day and gave them my resume, which wasn't much.

[03:12] I mean, I had some electronics training.

[03:14] And what an awesome place.

[03:17] I walked in.

[03:18] There were these beautiful young girls all over the place just in the lobby.

[03:21] I couldn't even see.

[03:23] They had really loud rock music playing in stereo.

[03:27] And the receptionist said, receptionist said,

[03:30] hey, it's like that all over the factory.

[03:31] Wherever you stand, you get stereo.

[03:34] That's how the president likes it.

[03:36] So I ended up working in Atari.

[03:39] And my first job there was on the line,

[03:43] making harnesses.

[03:45] I knew how to make harnesses.

[03:46] I knew how to, you know, my new electronics somewhat.

[03:50] I was, I'm not going to say I was an electronics engineer,

[03:53] but I could make things work and fix things and, like a technician.

[03:58] With a little more sense than that.

[03:59] I had quite extensive schooling in the Coast Guard.

[04:03] It's not really what I wanted to do.

[04:05] Anyway, after I was there for a couple years,

[04:09] they decided to open up a pinball division.

[04:12] And I, I was asked if I wanted to be part of it.

[04:16] And I said, sure.

[04:18] I guess I was there only a year.

[04:20] And so they, you know, moved us to a different building.

[04:25] Steve, any good guitar I've been playing guitar since I was in high school myself.

[04:29] I was a pretty good guitar player.

[04:30] I did, you know, I was a rocker when I studied it.

[04:35] You know, I wanted to learn how to play the guitar since I was 13.

[04:39] The day I heard the Beatles in 1963,

[04:41] it was the first, I want to hold your hand.

[04:43] That tune inspired me and it's like, I had to become a guitar player.

[04:47] So I bought a chord book and, you know, my father just sort of,

[04:51] you know, he had a brand new electric guitar.

[04:54] And so he loaned it to me for a year, which is pretty awesome.

[04:58] And I learned how to play about reading books.

[05:00] You know, I had a musical family.

[05:02] I had some training.

[05:03] I mean, I can read music and everything else.

[05:05] And who winds the guitar about five years earlier.

[05:07] But I forgot in all that sense.

[05:10] And, you know, I got in some pretty good bands and I had a lot of fun.

[05:13] I would say that.

[05:14] And yes, I still play.

[05:16] I wrote most of the tunes for Black Knight 2000.

[05:19] I wrote high speed.

[05:21] I didn't write any songs on this,

[05:23] but I did direct the music on Spider-Man.

[05:26] And I'm pretty proud of it.

[05:27] It's like, you know, David Thiel wrote all the tunes.

[05:30] And he did a pretty nice job.

[05:32] So when you were at Atari first, you were just making video games?

[05:35] Yes. Atari was making strictly video games.

[05:37] They had...

[05:39] Paul and a barrel was going down the line.

[05:41] They had done Paul.

[05:42] They were just getting started with a couple of other games.

[05:46] A tank was one of them.

[05:48] I was employee number 50 at Atari.

[05:50] So, you know, I was there after maybe...

[05:54] Probably about six or seven months after they first put a Paul on test

[06:02] at a pub in Los Gatos, California.

[06:05] How did you get to design pinballs at Atari?

[06:08] My first pinball job there was...

[06:12] prototype supervisors.

[06:13] Like, I kind of...

[06:16] I saw two of them.

[06:17] I took the prototypes, got built.

[06:18] And I had to learn how to build them also.

[06:21] Atari hired a couple of guys from Chicago from Valley and from Williams.

[06:27] Actually, they both built themselves as designers.

[06:29] But I found out later that neither one of them were ever game designers.

[06:33] They were both mechanical engineers.

[06:36] And, uh...

[06:38] Anyway, they did the first designs.

[06:40] The first guy's name was Bob Jonasine.

[06:42] He built, uh...

[06:43] um...

[06:45] the Atariens.

[06:47] I made the prototypes for them.

[06:49] But in the process of working with Bob,

[06:51] I did learn how to lay out and construct a pinball machine,

[06:56] you know, professionally.

[06:57] He didn't know how to do that.

[06:59] How was Air Board of Vendor received by Atari?

[07:01] I didn't know they only made like 350.

[07:04] But how was that compared to the other Atari games?

[07:06] After I was working with Bob Jonasine and the other guys there for about six months,

[07:12] I saw their designs and I thought,

[07:15] this doesn't look that hard to me.

[07:16] I would like to try this.

[07:19] So, uh...

[07:20] I...

[07:22] I grabbed a piece of pinball with and taped paper to it.

[07:25] You know, vellum, very strong paper.

[07:28] And, uh...

[07:30] I took it home.

[07:31] And I, uh...

[07:32] I drew a game...

[07:33] on my own time.

[07:34] And it took me about a year.

[07:35] I was still working with, you know, the other guys there, uh...

[07:39] you know, they, they built up,

[07:41] I guess two machines.

[07:44] And, uh...

[07:44] The third one was mine.

[07:45] I, anyway, I made a machine, uh...

[07:48] a drawing and I brought it into my boss and he said,

[07:50] nah, nah, nah.

[07:51] You're not going to design games.

[07:53] I hired a guy with a, you know, a degree in, uh...

[07:56] design, a master's degree in design.

[07:58] And, and he's the one who's going to be designing the pinball machines.

[08:02] And that was, uh...

[08:04] Gary Slater, and he was,

[08:06] he was good, but...

[08:08] he did some totally symmetrical games and asymmetrical games,

[08:11] odd stuff.

[08:13] Well, I have to say, I liked Middle Earth.

[08:15] Anyway...

[08:17] I didn't take no for an answer.

[08:19] I went to the big boss.

[08:20] It took about, I don't know, three or four months

[08:22] to make all this happen, but...

[08:24] I went to Nolan Bushnell,

[08:26] and I asked him if I could build this game.

[08:29] He looked at it and he said,

[08:30] you did this at home and I said, yeah.

[08:32] And he goes, build it up.

[08:34] We'll try it.

[08:35] And from that day on, I was a designer at, uh...

[08:37] Atari.

[08:38] The game that I made was Airborne Avenger.

[08:40] That was my first machine there,

[08:41] which was pretty amateurish,

[08:44] but, you know,

[08:46] everyone's first game is probably a big steaming pile.

[08:50] Airborne Avenger was...

[08:52] it was received pretty well,

[08:53] because it had some pretty cool things on it.

[08:55] It had shots, you know, instead of...

[08:59] Now, the layouts are kind of goofy.

[09:01] These guys...

[09:03] These guys had, you know, they took the wide-body pinball machine

[09:07] and spread everything out, okay?

[09:09] They moved the slingshots far apart.

[09:12] The difference between what they did and what I did is...

[09:15] I tried to keep the pinball machine normal at first,

[09:20] which is 20 and a quarter.

[09:22] I designed a 20 and a quarter-inch pinball machine

[09:25] on the wide board.

[09:27] And then I left the outside shots,

[09:29] you know, P-Hit.

[09:31] They weren't as important.

[09:32] But I never opened up the slingshots.

[09:34] I kept the slingshots the same as other Chicago games.

[09:37] And of course, it played like more like a Chicago game

[09:40] with such a mystery.

[09:42] I mean, oh my god, this...

[09:44] The second Atari game that was called...

[09:47] It had a beautiful, like, butterfly woman

[09:49] painted on the back glass.

[09:51] I can't think of the name of it.

[09:52] Time 2000, there it is.

[09:54] Okay, the big feature was a captured bumper bumper.

[09:58] Wow.

[09:59] You know, a jet with rubber all the way around it.

[10:02] But the most ridiculous thing was...

[10:06] Picture two normal drains with, you know,

[10:09] a left and a right flipper, you know,

[10:11] and a center drain area.

[10:13] Well, this guy, Marty Rosenthal, took two sets of flippers

[10:18] and put like two lower ends of pinball machines side by side.

[10:23] And so they were like, you didn't know what to do.

[10:27] You hit the right flipper and both right flippers would flip.

[10:30] But one right flipper was so far to the left of the game

[10:34] that it confused your brain.

[10:35] The same thing with the left flipper.

[10:37] If the left flipper, one of the left flippers would be

[10:39] on the left side of the game, but the other one was on the right.

[10:42] Then they tried flipping both flippers at the same time with buttons.

[10:47] This is how naive people were there.

[10:50] Anyway, there was no good way.

[10:52] It was a bomb.

[10:53] How did you get your job at Williams?

[10:55] That is, how did you make your move from Atari to Williams?

[10:58] I worked at Atari and did fairly well.

[11:01] Everyone Avenger was interesting.

[11:05] Superman was, you know, that was,

[11:09] well, everyone Avenger was my first game with Eugene Jarvis,

[11:13] who is a great programmer and a good friend.

[11:18] I think he's the best of the video programmers.

[11:21] And also it's like, I probably had the most fun

[11:28] of all time working on pinball machines with Eugene

[11:32] and this one with Lyman and Spider-Man.

[11:34] And so, you know, these guys are like, they're geniuses.

[11:38] And also they're fun to work with.

[11:40] And it's hard to find a relationship with that's give and take, you know.

[11:47] With the programmer and the game designer.

[11:49] Anyway, Eugene and I were working on Superman and, you know,

[11:54] we were experimenting with sound and I kind of fool the round.

[11:56] You know, I'm a musician.

[11:57] I had this thing called the Neckelplex.

[11:59] So I connected that up in the audio and sort of created a background sound

[12:04] and we played the game and experienced it and it was pretty cool.

[12:08] Anyway,

[12:12] at night we used to talk because we'd work really late too,

[12:15] like crazy because we loved it.

[12:17] And I used to say, I wish somebody would call me, you know,

[12:21] so many in Chicago because I want to go to a real pinball company.

[12:23] I didn't want to really leave California, but I did want to go to a real pinball company

[12:29] that made real regular pinball machines.

[12:34] And one day this guy called me.

[12:36] He was the president of William, brand new president, Mike Straw.

[12:40] And he said,

[12:42] well,

[12:44] I'd like to have you out and you can,

[12:48] now we can talk.

[12:51] Anyway, I accepted the job and, you know, it's for like

[12:55] a little more than double my salary at Atari plus moving expenses.

[13:00] Plus this guy was really smart and charismatic and he was,

[13:06] he was definitely motivated and he really loved pinball.

[13:12] And he knew something about it.

[13:14] I could tell, you know, through talking to him.

[13:17] So I took the job and I went from Atari to Williams.

[13:22] So did Williams actually call you or did you call them?

[13:25] I got the call and they asked me to go.

[13:28] I don't know how he heard.

[13:29] I'm not sure how Mike Straw heard that we were messing with things

[13:33] because Superman didn't come out until after.

[13:35] I had finished the game at Williams, which is really interesting.

[13:38] And they took out the background sound.

[13:40] Well, we put it in in Flash and it sold 20,000 machines and smoked about the, you know,

[13:47] the Williams all-time record at the time and for sales.

[13:52] And it did have a background sound that sounded a lot like some of the sound you could make with an echoplex.

[13:57] So Flash really put you on the map, made you the pinball rock star of sorts.

[14:01] How did that feel?

[14:02] Well, it felt great.

[14:06] Now, to go to a new company and blow out their whole record of sales, the first shot was like

[14:13] one in a million.

[14:14] And but I got to tell you, I was motivated on the plane.

[14:19] I drew Flash and it was figure eight with a cross shot.

[14:22] You know, a very simple game, but I had the name.

[14:26] I wanted to make it Flash and I wanted really bright lights on it.

[14:30] And I invented the Flash lamp at that time for this game.

[14:33] I actually, what I did was I go, look, this car, here's this car.

[14:38] Okay, it's got a 12 volt system.

[14:40] Look what happens when I hit the brakes.

[14:43] Holy macro is that light bright.

[14:45] How can we get a light that bright into a pinball machine and, you know, hit it and make it come up instantly.

[14:53] And they figured out that they had to preheat them.

[14:55] They had to have, you know, voltage going through them to keep the filament hot.

[14:59] And then we would hit it with 25 volts, a 24 volts instead of 12.

[15:04] Just for a brief moment.

[15:06] And you got a very nice flash.

[15:08] So, yeah, I mean, after I finished Flash, it was like, I was on top of the world.

[15:15] But I went on right into the next game.

[15:19] I don't think I even waited a week or two when I started working on the next game

[15:23] because I was already talking about it with Eugene.

[15:25] And we were, oh, and Eugene wasn't there for turning Flash.

[15:28] Eugene came about the time I started Firepower, which is wonderful.

[15:32] You know, it's like I asked him to come out the year before.

[15:35] But he just wasn't ready to do that.

[15:38] So, he hung out at Atari, finished up Superman.

[15:43] And then I, you know, I told them, I called them up again.

[15:47] I said, come on, man, I'm having a great time here.

[15:49] You got to come out.

[15:50] So, you know, Flash was a big hit.

[15:53] He had no reason not to come.

[15:55] And I told them I wanted to work with him again.

[15:58] The guy I did Flash with was like, space case.

[16:03] It was really hard to work with.

[16:04] In the end, he hated us all.

[16:07] He turned on all of us at Williams in the group that time.

[16:12] And took off. He was gone.

[16:16] And anyway, that's the story of Flash pretty much.

[16:21] How did the other game designers take you at Williams after Flash?

[16:25] What did you do different in your game designs that gave you the

[16:28] edge at Williams?

[16:29] Well, the other game designers were fine.

[16:31] Now, there were four, I guess.

[16:35] There was, well, five, if you count Steve Kortek.

[16:39] There was Steve Kortek.

[16:40] Chris Otis.

[16:44] There was Tony Kramer.

[16:46] Barry Osler and myself.

[16:50] And the other game designers were always nice about everything.

[16:55] After Flash.

[17:00] I'm a weird guy.

[17:01] I have a lot of ideas.

[17:03] It's one of those things.

[17:07] There's a lot of genes I didn't get.

[17:09] But I got the design imagination thing.

[17:12] I feel lucky that I got it.

[17:16] If I'm happy and I really like what I'm doing,

[17:19] this shit just pours out.

[17:21] And I let it.

[17:23] And then I try to perfect it.

[17:26] And that's where it is for me.

[17:29] It's like I got lucky.

[17:31] Anyway, I was always nice to them when they were nice to me.

[17:34] We joked around cheese.

[17:36] We had a great time.

[17:37] That's another story.

[17:41] What I didn't my design different from the rest of the people

[17:45] was I looked at the ball's motion.

[17:48] And on other pinball machines.

[17:53] And I saw that shots did not start.

[17:59] Not on all games, but on most games.

[18:01] Shots did not start where the ball actually traveled.

[18:06] I know that sounds weird, but the curves on games before Flash and Firepower

[18:16] did not really.

[18:18] They weren't made to intercept the ball on a trajectory gradually.

[18:23] They were not made to do anything smooth and pleasing.

[18:29] I don't know.

[18:30] It's like, and that's not true of all games.

[18:34] I don't want to say that.

[18:35] What do I want to say?

[18:37] Go ahead.

[18:37] You can look at all the got leaves with the five jets in the middle

[18:41] and the rubber and stuff.

[18:43] There were shot games.

[18:44] They were definitely skill games, but they didn't make the ball flow in a pleasing manner

[18:51] where you felt like, whoa, I just made that shot.

[18:55] And this feeling of, whoa, I just made this shot.

[18:58] It's really based on, well, a great way to explain the feeling and how it feels

[19:06] is to put together a nice billiard shot where you line up the cue ball.

[19:13] You put the cue ball's contact point on the ball and it just feels wonderful

[19:18] when the ball you hit goes in the pocket without touching any sides at 50 miles an hour.

[19:26] It's like that.

[19:27] Anyway, that's what I think I brought to pinball.

[19:29] And as many other ideas, as I had, it's a hard thing to describe, but I think that's enough.

[19:40] Who was the programmer for Flash?

[19:42] Programmer for Flash was Randy Pfeiffer.

[19:47] And he was a pretty good programmer, but I don't know.

[19:55] I think he had some problems at the time and one day he just freaked out on all of us,

[20:01] including the president.

[20:02] I just said, you're all scum.

[20:04] I took off.

[20:06] I think he was the scum.

[20:07] Was stellar wars a disappointment in that you only sold 5,500 units compared to Flash?

[20:12] Were the people at Williams disappointing the stellar wars or were they just expecting you

[20:17] to break sales records on every game you made?

[20:20] Stellar Wars wasn't fun for me to make.

[20:26] I had done Flash in like seven months and then this is when games were simpler time,

[20:31] absolutely.

[20:34] Stellar Wars was like, they begged me to do a wide body.

[20:40] So I did it.

[20:43] And as it turned out, I mean, you say sold only 5,500 units.

[20:49] Boy, I'd love to sell 55 units of Spider-Man today.

[20:53] And compared to Flash, well, compared to Flash and compared to a lot of games,

[20:58] 5,500 units was the most sold of a wide body at that point.

[21:04] So nobody was disappointed.

[21:07] Besides that, I think I put it together in six months, which just went.

[21:15] It's really funny.

[21:16] When stellar wars came out, Superman also came out from Atari, another one of my games.

[21:24] And Flash was still in the arcade.

[21:28] These three games, this is the highlight of Crazy Fat Headed.

[21:36] I mean, I could have become a maniac at that point.

[21:38] Maybe I was, I don't know.

[21:40] But it's like my three games are trading places for number one, two, and three at all

[21:46] arcades across the United States.

[21:49] And it was an awesome time for me.

[21:51] I had three games out at once earning top money.

[21:54] And they would trade around.

[21:56] And stellar wars is often number one.

[21:58] They, I don't know why.

[21:59] I didn't love it.

[22:03] Anyway, it kind of did break the sales record for a wide body at the time.

[22:08] Firepower rocks.

[22:09] I mean, you know it.

[22:10] I know it.

[22:10] The world knows it.

[22:12] It was really the first game that had clear flow and clear rules.

[22:16] It was just the ultimate pinball package for the time.

[22:19] How did you do that?

[22:20] Firepower is one of my favorite games myself.

[22:22] I'm not going to lie.

[22:24] I love planet.

[22:25] I mean, if I didn't love planet, you wouldn't love it either.

[22:28] You know, it's like it was, it was so much fun to make.

[22:33] Okay, I had been away from my buddy Eugene.

[22:35] I had to work with this weirdo.

[22:37] Okay, not a weirdo.

[22:39] I don't want to say that about him.

[22:40] I'm going to, I got it with problems.

[22:43] That's fair.

[22:44] And here's Eugene.

[22:46] And I, you know, I knew exactly how he worked.

[22:49] You know, and he worked like me.

[22:51] Same work ethic, same enthusiasm, same like, you know, he was single.

[22:58] He could throw himself totally into it.

[23:02] Anyway, we were both very motivated for Firepower.

[23:08] And I drew a game and he, you know, he, he had input on the play field.

[23:15] No question, you know, and I had input on the, on the software.

[23:19] And this is where magic occurs when, when people allow each other and are also

[23:26] capable of commanding equal respect.

[23:28] It doesn't work if the respect is not equal.

[23:31] But if it's equal, wow.

[23:36] It's, you know, Firepower is like a, let's see.

[23:42] I don't know, I died, I invented lane change on Firepower.

[23:48] I asked Eugene if it was possible to move an unlit insert under the ball.

[23:58] And he said, what?

[23:59] And I go, you know, like, can we cycle through and put an unlit insert under the ball so you,

[24:06] you can get the one you want no matter where the ball is rolling?

[24:11] 20 minutes later, yeah, to work on it.

[24:13] And it was so cool.

[24:17] Eugene, Eugene went absolutely insane with the code.

[24:20] I think there were only like three or four bites left.

[24:23] He, he did the world's first dancing display animation.

[24:27] He did some, well, gee, wave, the sound package.

[24:34] He wrote during the game.

[24:36] And, uh, and he goes, you know, I just wrote this perfect little

[24:40] program to make a sound.

[24:41] It doesn't sound good at all.

[24:43] But here, you type in this and that.

[24:46] I'll let you go ahead, type in some crap.

[24:48] So I typed in some stuff, you know, he goes,

[24:50] pick a letter from one to eight.

[24:51] All right, our number.

[24:52] And then he goes, pick any number after that.

[24:55] And then, uh, and then give me a letter from A to F.

[24:58] Okay, great.

[24:59] So I punch it in and it does this cool, awesome sound.

[25:03] Well, Eugene, you know, that sound program probably went, I would say,

[25:10] eight or nine machines utilized that sound program at once.

[25:14] Maybe more, maybe, maybe ten or twelve.

[25:16] Um, anyway, the relationship between Eugene and I was very synergistic.

[25:23] We were also very motivated.

[25:25] We wanted to be on top.

[25:27] We wanted to make the best games possible.

[25:30] We really respected Valley games because they were hot right then.

[25:33] Williams wasn't, you know, Flash was, you know, a flash in the pan.

[25:38] One good hit.

[25:39] It's gonna happen again.

[25:40] Okay, we had to do that again.

[25:42] And firepower was it.

[25:45] And, uh, that's how it happened.

[25:47] On the lane change, why just one flipper to move the lamp insert and not both?

[25:52] I only wanted one flipper button because I didn't want to confuse people.

[25:58] Okay, even management when they saw it and played it, they liked it.

[26:03] But they were afraid of change.

[26:06] And so was I a bit.

[26:07] I mean, if somebody would say, oh, people don't know how to work that.

[26:11] No one will ever figure that out, they said.

[26:15] So I simplified it and put it on the right flipper button because it was close to the, you know,

[26:20] most people are right handed.

[26:21] Okay, so I put it on the right flipper and it only moved one way.

[26:26] And I didn't really want it to move both ways because it was kind of confusing when you think about it.

[26:32] You're the first person that ever walks the way, walks up to a game with lane change.

[26:37] You roll a ball down one lane.

[26:38] Now you have one light lit.

[26:40] You press the left flipper button and it moves to the left.

[26:42] You press the white flipper button to move to the right.

[26:45] What the hell is that about?

[26:46] When it only moved in one direction, it was clear what it did.

[26:51] And did you work with Larry D'Amara in the early days?

[26:53] How did he compare it to Eugene?

[26:55] I did work with Larry D'Amara and Larry D'Amara and I had some great success.

[27:00] You know, he's another brilliant programmer.

[27:04] How do he compare to Eugene?

[27:06] Well, they're both two of the smartest individuals on the planet.

[27:13] Okay, so how do you compare to Eugene?

[27:16] That's, you know, in what way?

[27:18] We're talking about, okay, I'll tell you some differences.

[27:22] Eugene is like, hey man, what do you think?

[27:28] And Larry would be like,

[27:31] tell me what you want.

[27:35] We're talking about actually working with Larry was me kind of working with me.

[27:43] We're both kind of similar.

[27:46] Let's call us intense.

[27:49] Let's call us, um, committed and also, um, pretty stubborn.

[27:58] Uh, we'll hear things though.

[27:59] I mean, eventually, I, you know, I can't help it.

[28:02] If you can have an open mind, you gotta, gotta listen to everybody.

[28:05] You gotta hear what they have to say and then keep it or dump it as necessary.

[28:09] Well, Larry and I had a lot of fireworks, let's say, during our games, but

[28:16] we were also very successful.

[28:17] The first game was Black Knight and, uh,

[28:22] you know, it was the first, you know, multi-level game.

[28:25] I want to say though that a lot of designers always talked about making a multi-level pinball,

[28:32] but they never did it.

[28:33] I'm the guy that just did it.

[28:35] I think any of them could have done it.

[28:37] Jim Pattlo or Steve Kirk, uh, you know, Steve Kordak, you know,

[28:43] anybody could have done it that wanted to.

[28:46] Larry Williams, they think he could have done it anytime, you know.

[28:50] But nobody ever did it, so I went ahead and did it.

[28:52] And I thought, I don't know what I'm going to gain here.

[28:55] And I really didn't gain much, but,

[28:58] uh, the real big gain from, from, from Black Knight is the use of a ramp.

[29:05] And I think it was the start of, you know, I mean, there were other games that had ramps

[29:10] in the past, but they came and went and they, they didn't really,

[29:14] they weren't in the flow of the ball.

[29:15] It was, uh, kind of a funky thing.

[29:17] And, uh, I don't know why people didn't do more of it, but,

[29:22] you know, I kind of do know why, uh, but that's another story.

[29:25] The management of each company, of Valley, of Gottlieb, of Williams, of Stern,

[29:29] is all different.

[29:30] And so are their philosophies.

[29:31] I mean, they drive these philosophies at you, whether you like it or not.

[29:35] It's me, I'm a wise guy, I'm a wiseass punk when I get to Williams.

[29:40] I'm also polite to everybody and I like them,

[29:43] but I'm going to stick my fingers in there in my ears because I know that what they did

[29:50] almost put them over the prank, in fact, flash,

[29:53] pulled them up by their bootstraps back into the mix, okay?

[29:57] I'm not bragging on myself.

[29:59] I'm just telling you how it was.

[30:01] And, uh, and so, this is how I felt.

[30:04] I felt like, fine, you know, I'll do great games, I'll do whatever I can.

[30:08] I'll work my ass off for you, but we're not going to fool each other

[30:12] about what we do and how it, how it happened or whatever, you know,

[30:17] I'm just, I'm going to work hard, I'm going to give you this,

[30:20] and I'll do the best I can.

[30:21] No, I might not always do, you know,

[30:24] spectacular, but I'm going to try every time.

[30:26] And I did that, I tried every time.

[30:29] Anyway, I got leave, they had a completely different agenda.

[30:32] Ray Tanser tells me that, holy shit, I mean, they would say,

[30:37] you can't have that in the game because so-and-so doesn't like it.

[30:43] Whoa, so-and-so doesn't like it.

[30:45] Let's say it was a great idea, it just didn't matter if so-and-so didn't like it.

[30:51] Oh my god.

[30:52] Okay, so somebody else is doing my job for me, a raised job for him.

[30:57] You know, that's how to sink a company in.

[30:59] Hey, godly, my buddies, the class act, the Cadillac of the business, okay?

[31:05] Blub, blah, blah, blah, blah, sunk to the bottom of the ocean because you didn't listen.

[31:10] You didn't change at the time.

[31:12] You didn't move on stuff because you saw what competition was doing and you didn't do anything about it.

[31:20] Anyway, that's another story.

[31:22] On your statement about godly, it was like you had some issue with them.

[31:26] Can you explain a little more?

[31:27] I never had an issue with godly at all.

[31:30] I mean, my issue with them was, how could they let such a fine product die?

[31:36] They were magnificent once.

[31:40] They made the best and most reliable machine in the industry.

[31:45] It was called the Cadillac of the industry.

[31:47] And I'll tell you, some of the early games at godly, you know, I'm not talking about early.

[31:53] I'm talking about early for me, which is like when I got started.

[31:56] 1974, 2005, and from there on.

[32:00] You know, I knew about the old godleaves.

[32:02] They didn't appeal to me because there wasn't anything special about the dynamics of play, okay?

[32:08] Later on, a few guys did come up with dynamic play,

[32:12] but they didn't impellish.

[32:13] They didn't try to compete with us.

[32:16] I don't have any issue with anybody at godly, but in fact, some of those guys,

[32:22] I love talking to Gil Pollock.

[32:24] I could talk to him for hours, okay?

[32:26] Ray Tanzer is a sweetheart of a guy.

[32:28] Just a great guy that I really like working with.

[32:32] He's just and very talented.

[32:35] You know, in fact, I almost want to work for them at one point.

[32:40] We talked about a deal, but it just wasn't, you know, I'm really glad I didn't make the deal

[32:45] because I would have called management stodgy all through.

[32:50] Management is what caused godly to die, not the designers.

[32:55] On the game themes in the early days, did you pick themes,

[32:58] or in how were they implemented in the game, or were they just applied at the end and sort of tacked on?

[33:03] In terms of game themes, I picked everyone.

[33:07] In fact, they expected me to come up with a theme,

[33:10] to layout what the game, an idea for the rules, some ideas.

[33:17] They expected sound development, and they expected some art direction, but not entirely.

[33:29] This was a tough time.

[33:33] I'll go into the art at another time.

[33:38] Yes, we always pick the theme for our game, and usually the name.

[33:48] Let's see.

[33:49] Well, you're asking me if a name ever got applied at the end and sort of tacked on.

[33:55] Actually, that's probably not true of any game because it has to have a name and a theme

[34:00] before it even starts to get drawn.

[34:02] So that was always a requirement at Williams.

[34:06] That's darned, too. Gary's adamant about it.

[34:08] He wants it to be clear exactly what the title of the game is before I even start drawing.

[34:15] I tell him, I don't have to know that immediately.

[34:18] I have some ideas I want to do, and I can make them apply to anything pretty much,

[34:23] which is really true.

[34:24] It's like, it just works that way. That's how it is.

[34:31] Another big hit, of course, was Black Knight.

[34:33] Why that theme? Why multi-level?

[34:36] Black Knight was a hit, and it would have been a bigger hit, but there's a big story here.

[34:44] It's a long story.

[34:47] But you asked me why that theme.

[34:49] Why that theme? Because I think that the best pinball machines have a personality or several.

[34:59] When they have a personality, they speak to you.

[35:01] They call out and they say, come and kick my ass.

[35:05] If you're so bad, let's see you do it.

[35:09] You know, this kind of thing, I like adversary pinball.

[35:13] There are other kinds of pinball I like, too, but that's probably my favorite one.

[35:17] Anyway, the Black Knight was obviously someone bad, and it sort of made the player the white knight,

[35:23] the good guy. The good guy would defeat the bad guy.

[35:28] Multi-level was an opportunity to, I don't know, just another avenue of entertainment.

[35:38] It certainly stood out from any other pinball machine prior, and I think people really like

[35:44] shooting up the ramps, and I made the ramps so that they fed into shots very nicely,

[35:51] where they were smooth. The only thing I would say that was a disappointment about Black Knight is

[35:58] we still have these low powered flippers, 25 volts, or something, or 35 volts. I don't know.

[36:05] We desperately wanted 50 volt flippers like they had a valley, you know, and it's like

[36:09] they wouldn't do it for Black Knight, but later on, you know, Mike Strauss saw the light, and he,

[36:17] you know, we went to 50 volt flippers. I got along good with management, you know, at Williams.

[36:27] And they were good to us, like, okay, Larry Eugene, myself, all the designers,

[36:32] everyone in engineering, you know, every once in a while Mike would take us all out, you know,

[36:36] like to strip club or something. There I said it, strip club. Okay, anyway, or just out on the

[36:42] town, you know, I take everybody out to dinner, and he was a great fun guy, and we had a good time.

[36:49] We're all young punks, too. He was a little older than us, you know, and we had a lot of fun,

[36:55] and he made sure that we had fun. It was a big, happy family at Williams, and it grew from there,

[37:03] but the core group was, I don't know, we were working to the same goal, absolutely, to try and

[37:15] make the best games we could, to try and be the number one pinball company, and damned if we

[37:20] didn't do that. Are you saying that Black Knight could have been a much bigger sales hit?

[37:25] Please explain. Also explain how the Magna save came about. Black Knight could have had double

[37:31] the sales nearly, and I'll tell you why. Okay, while I was working at Atari, I really did not

[37:41] have a draw or a draft. I learned from this guy, Claude Fernandez, who was an excellent draftman.

[37:48] He also, you know, he had a affinity for mechanicals, because he had drawn so many of them,

[37:54] so many mechanical parts. He was a handy guy to have around, and after I went to Williams,

[38:06] he called one day, and he said, is there any room for draftsman? And I said, I don't know Claude,

[38:11] but I'll find out. Anyway, I talked to Mike for a few minutes, and he said, is he good? And I said,

[38:17] he's very good. And so he said, all right, I'll hire him. So he hired Claude Fernandez,

[38:24] Mike Stroll, two Williams, moved him. I let Claude stay at my house until he could find an apartment.

[38:29] I think it took like two and a half months. My wife wasn't really happy about it, but, you know,

[38:37] he was a friend. He helped me out. Anyway, he started working as a draftman at Williams,

[38:44] and did fine. This is, I guess, around the end of Firepower. At the very beginning,

[38:52] he started making a drawing of a game on his own time. I don't remember the name of it.

[39:01] It might have been blackout. And actually, he was there before that. He was there a year before

[39:06] that, so he came first. He came before Eugene even came. I would say at the end of black.

[39:12] Anyway, while I was drawing Black Knight, he was being a draftman and working on his own game,

[39:19] it was called Blackout. And it happened. It did okay. Well, one day Claude came in into the office,

[39:30] and he said, I'm quitting today. Goodbye, Steve. He said, goodbye to Mike Stroll and walk down the

[39:35] stairs and never said another word to us. Okay. Well, he went to Valley. Valley hired him,

[39:42] and I didn't know this until we got to the AMOA show. On Vale Black Knight, the world's first

[39:49] two-level pinball machine. And across the way is Valley Booth. Okay. And they're unveiling the

[39:56] world's second multi-level pinball machine. And the whole left side is virtually identical to

[40:04] everything I had on my drawing at the time that Claude left, unfortunately. So, basically, he

[40:11] copied the design and sold it. And they sold about 8,000 machines. I think we sold 11. I don't know.

[40:19] It could have gone to like 20,000 machines. Magnusave was a... I'm not going to call it,

[40:30] but I knew they had magnets at Stern, but I didn't like how they used them just to freeze the ball

[40:37] and stuff like this and for the doodle bug assembly. So, I wanted to try a magnet to try and

[40:45] help the player save a ball before it could get down the train. And so, I kind of invented

[40:54] Magnusave. I put a big pancake magnet right over the pre-turn lanes and activated at the right time.

[41:00] It would actually suck a ball over to it, freeze the ball, and let it drop and flip a return lanes.

[41:07] How it came about is... I told you. I mean, I can't help it. I don't know.

[41:13] Just happened and I'm glad ideas happen like that to me.

[41:18] Why hyperball? What was the thinking there? Had a shooting gun game. And how did you feel about

[41:23] the Valley Rapid Fire, which was nearly the same game at about the same time? Hyperball was a game

[41:30] that a guy makes, okay, when he's like totally enamored with

[41:39] a space invaders and this huge on-rush of video games, okay, that I enjoyed playing, okay. I'm

[41:48] not just a pinball game throughout my career, even right now, okay? Right now, not right now,

[41:56] but last night I played Fear, F-E-A-R, a video shooter. That's awesome, okay.

[42:03] I have a PlayStation 2. I've got an Xbox. I've got everything, okay, because I love video games.

[42:12] I've got a lot of PC games. I play them. Hyperball was a frustrated pinball guy

[42:19] seeing the market taper off because video was taking over. There was space invaders

[42:32] followed by a lot of, I mean, hey, I lost Eugene to video. Video was, you know,

[42:37] Mike Stroll separated us. He was smart to do so. I did Black Knight. Eugene did Defender.

[42:44] And they were done in the same time, frame, and it's just Williams was making a fortune.

[42:52] Anyway, I was a frustrated video game designer. I wanted to make a video game, but they wouldn't

[42:57] let me produce it. Wouldn't let me work on it. I'm not a programmer, and I'm also not a video artist,

[43:04] so I couldn't have helped them directly, but I have produced video games. And, you know,

[43:10] as long as you're very communicative, I think anybody could carry through and make a game

[43:19] based on a vision with good communication skills. Hyperball is a machine gun game, too. I mean,

[43:28] come on. I think most kids, most men, most guys, I'm not talking about

[43:38] that Virginia attack. Okay. I never wanted to shoot anybody, but I did get to shoot machine guns,

[43:44] while I was in the Coast Guard. And it is fun. I don't care what anybody says. It wouldn't be fun.

[43:48] It kills somebody, but it was fun to shoot machine guns. So six balls a second. At part,

[43:54] I definitely was excited about getting it out to work. And anyway, you asked about, uh,

[44:01] about Valley Rapid Fire. I learned from a friend that the project's name was

[44:08] Project Xerox at Valley. That's what they called it. And basically, they had seen, you know,

[44:15] hyperball at the AMOI show. And the truth was, it was very much a prototype. It needed four or

[44:23] five more months work before we could release it. And so we went ahead and did that. Well,

[44:27] in those four or five months, Valley had produced, uh, Rapid Fire.

[44:36] It didn't play in the same way. I'm not sure it was as much fun. And I think they had as much,

[44:42] they had more trouble than us making it work. How do I feel about it? Let's see. I feel like,

[44:49] yeah, you know, it's our fault for delaying so long to get it to market.

[44:54] Uh, it's their fault for not doing something original. So everybody talks about hyperball as being

[45:01] a failure. Did you consider it a failure, even though you sold 4,500 units? I don't think it was a

[45:06] failure. Um, the last hundred were hard to sell. But then I think, you know, Williams lost some

[45:15] money at that point on the last hundred. No doubt. But I think they made, uh, these broke

[45:21] even. Now they made money on the 4,500 units. So, uh, I don't know. It was an experiment. I don't

[45:28] consider it a failure. I think it was pretty fun. It really did great at, uh, you know, at Big

[45:35] R.K. It's Big Family Fund Centers, especially on the Jersey Shore. Um, most of the Southern states

[45:46] it did good on the West Coast. It could earn a lot of money. Most guys replaced the motor with a,

[45:51] a really nice boating motor that, uh, that's a brand boating. It would last forever and, and really

[45:58] make the thing pretty solid. We did sell a lot of plungers though. They would mushroom, you know,

[46:02] that fat, rapid firing, huge coil, uh, driven plunger that actually struck the ball with

[46:09] mushroom after a time. I don't think it was a failure. I'm sorry. So, space shuttle came out about

[46:14] 1984 and it's not your game. It was a berry game, very Osler. And a lot of people consider space shuttle

[46:22] the game that saved Williams pinball. And then you came out of course with high speed. Tell me

[46:27] about high speed in the story behind it. I, I don't consider space shuttle the savior of Williams

[46:35] pinball. I'm sorry. I don't. Uh, that story is built on hype by a few people who would like to

[46:45] turn things that way. The factory was dark after it was done. Um, it was a decent game and I'm not

[46:54] taking anything away from that. As far as saving Williams pinball, I don't think so. Um, Sorcerer

[47:02] did very well. Uh, good enough. I mean, at that time, again, you saw me make rapid firing.

[47:07] You saw me make a video like pinball machine. Well, video trounced us, okay. Video killed us.

[47:15] And, uh, there were a couple of games that we had made at the same time that it just didn't cut it.

[47:21] But operators wanted video games. They wanted them so bad. And in 1982, okay, pinball was a tough

[47:29] self, no doubt. And it became very tough until 1984. Uh, in 1984, the entire bottom fell out of

[47:39] the video market. And pinball was still dead. Now you're talking about the factory being dark,

[47:45] okay. And it was dark after space shuttle. Um, that's my thoughts about it. Also, it's disputed

[47:54] about humanly made the game. And I give credit to Barry Osler. Um, he's responsible. He

[48:01] drew the game, okay. Other people, you know, barged in and tried to take it over and through the

[48:07] theme on, which was Andy. It's a game, though, to make a game a designer has to work on the game,

[48:13] okay. A designer has to draw the game. Okay. The game can't belong to somebody who talks about

[48:19] the game, okay. It doesn't belong to anybody who talks about the game. It belongs to people

[48:24] who work on the game, who live the game, who is the father of the game and the, you know,

[48:29] the programmer of the game. I mean, it's, I have trouble with any other, uh, any other definition

[48:37] of who owns the game or how the game came about. I went back to California to start a video game

[48:43] company called, uh, King Video Design. And, uh, Mike Stroll, you know, financed it. I wanted to

[48:53] make a video game because video games were, were king. And in 82, they really were. They were,

[48:57] you know, that was the pinnacle, unfortunately. Two years later, I had finished a game called

[49:02] Devastator, which was the first 68,000 microprocessor, uh, video game. And it was 3D. It was a space flying

[49:12] game. It had a, uh, an object oriented system. We were the first people to use digitized camera

[49:21] images and color, um, and applied them into the game. Uh, it didn't matter. When we finished our game,

[49:30] it was 1984. Hardware didn't work correctly when we first brought it back to Williams. And it was

[49:38] very tough to demonstrate the game working when it kept resetting. And I was bugging

[49:42] my partner constantly. Please fix the hardware, make it not bug out. And, uh, it didn't happen until

[49:50] three months later, unfortunately, when he found the bug. The problem in the hardware, which was

[49:55] really too late. By then, Williams had lost, I don't know, $18 million, I think it was. They had

[50:03] games, uh, laying around like, uh, I can't remember the exact name of the game. It was a laser-based

[50:10] game, uh, it was called space something. Anyway, the video business fell through the floor.

[50:20] Mike Stroll didn't buy my game. He couldn't. He just lost all this money. And,

[50:25] and nobody had any confidence in any video game at the time. And I'm not going to say that

[50:30] Devastator was a bad game. I'm just going to say that it's, uh, it came out at the very worst

[50:37] possible time. It's, you know, a fact of life. Anyway,

[50:48] high speed came about, while I was, you know, working on this Devastator game,

[50:57] um, I bought a Porsche 928, which is, uh, aluminum P8 powered sports car. Very nice. A lot of

[51:09] people didn't like it, proud. I loved it. And it was, uh, it was a great handling car.

[51:16] And a great, uh, good, nice engine. Very quick. You could do like,

[51:21] 146 miles an hour at top speed. I was driving it one day, uh, one morning. I have to

[51:28] ride out for about four to five months. And, uh, my partner, Doug and I, the guy that screwed up

[51:33] to hardware, uh, we're going to make a trip from where I lived near Sacramento down to San

[51:38] Jose. On highway, I five, starting at six o'clock in the morning when they get there,

[51:43] buy our parts, get back, you know, have dinner with our families. Quite a long drive. Anyway,

[51:50] I, uh, I had wanted to try the car out, trying the car out means how fast will it go, Steve? So,

[51:56] that's what I do. I open up the throttle. I mean, I stop it. And, uh, and I do this because,

[52:05] it seems irresponsible, but at the time it wasn't, uh, my,

[52:13] very little traffic on i5, four lanes in each direction, some tomato trucks, okay? And the far

[52:18] right line that I passed. And it wasn't very traveled because it was brand new. And it went between

[52:26] Sacramento and San Jose and at six o'clock in the morning, there just wasn't much traffic. So,

[52:31] I opened it up with no problems like, there weren't any obstacles. I didn't endanger anyone. That's

[52:39] what I'm saying here. Anyway, uh, I went over this, uh, this hill and then back down and I see a highway

[52:48] patrolman coming the other way. No, and then it was like, uh, a Mustang with a, with a black

[52:53] side, you know, a white top, white door. Crystal clear, it was a highway, California Highway

[52:58] patrolman. And, um, yeah, he didn't, I slowed way down like to 70 miles an hour. And then I went

[53:06] over another hill and went down and I figured, okay, well, if he was going to come after me,

[53:12] would have been after me by now. And he could have turned around on the median, but he didn't. And I

[53:17] thought, okay, fine, I'm just going to go again. Well, it turns out he did turn around on the median.

[53:21] And he called for, uh, you know, for backup. I guess he got me on radar or something and,

[53:27] and probably saw a piece of that, you know, that speed, probably saw 80s or something. Yeah, I

[53:32] thought at the time. So anyway, I didn't know all this, so I just hauled ass again. And, uh, I

[53:38] got it up to 146 miles an hour and we were kind of thinking, wow, this is, uh, this is really

[53:43] fast. It was easy to do. And the car was super smooth at any speed. It just didn't matter.

[53:49] Anyway, like a fool, I just kept doing it. And, uh, I probably drove 20 miles like that. Well,

[53:58] all of a sudden from the opposite direction on the other side of the median, you know, a

[54:02] sheriff's car comes, you know, roaring up and he's probably going 100 miles an hour with his red light

[54:09] on. The incident he sees my car, he makes a U-turn in the median and, uh, he pulls up behind me.

[54:17] He's not really behind me. He's just in the same lane, you know, a long way back. So,

[54:23] I knew it was for me. And we're talking about the Sacramento Valley, which is flat at the pancake,

[54:29] okay? There's no place to hide, no side treats to get on. There's nothing. You're not going to

[54:33] get away from anybody out there, you know, in the city you could get away from a cop, uh, or,

[54:38] in a healthy country you could pull over and, or take any side, bro, just no such thing in the

[54:43] Sacramento Valley. It's flat and you can see for miles. And so I decided to pull over.

[54:50] And the guy told me, wait in the car. And I, I said, uh, what's going to happen? And then he goes,

[54:57] it's just waiting the car. So I just sat there and waited about three minutes. And then up

[55:03] roars the highway patrolman, you know, slams on the brakes, big cloud of dust, of course, because

[55:09] it's the, you know, the side of the road is gravel and dust and dirt. So he makes this big, you

[55:15] know, dramatic cloud of dust jumps out of the car, comes running over and tries to pull me out the

[55:22] window of the car. And I just said, you know, after he tried to pull me out of the car, I go, look,

[55:28] I'm not a bad man. I'm willing to cooperate with you. Can I just open the door and get out?

[55:34] I don't have any guns, no drugs, nothing. Okay. Uh, finally he calmed down and he said, sir,

[55:42] get out of the car, sir. So I got out of the car. He thrown me on the hood. Put his hand

[55:46] on me and sticks me in the front seat of his car. There's more to this story, but this is high

[55:55] speed. This is the story of high speed, exactly. You know, run the red light, get away from the cops,

[56:02] or don't. I don't know. I was totally motivated. I asked Mike if I could come back to Williams and

[56:11] make pinballs and he said, sure, no problem. Show up. So I did. And, uh, you know, it was all

[56:18] there for us. Red light on the top, uh, you know, siren excitement. Um, it was just awesome.

[56:28] Great team. Larry was into it. Larry did a spectacular job on high speed also.

[56:33] All right, we're going to take a break from talking with Steve Richie, the famous pinball designer,

[56:38] and we will be right back after this message. The pin game journal is a proud sponsor of Topcast.

[56:44] It covers pinball like no other publication can. The pin game journal is America's only pinball

[56:49] publication. Whether you're looking for new games or the classics, reports on industry shows or

[56:53] collector expos, insights on a game you want or features to help you fix the game you've got,

[56:59] pin game journals for you. Their website is at pingamejournal.com.

[57:04] All right, we're back with Steve Richie, the pinball designer, talked to him some more about

[57:08] the games that he's worked on. So why didn't they have a Porsche 928 on the high speed back glass?

[57:13] It looks more like a Lamborghini. Also, please tell me more about the high speed story.

[57:19] Whatever happened with the cops on that. The reason why 928 didn't appear on the high speed

[57:24] back glass is because it wasn't as cool looking as a Lamborghini. So we used a Lamborghini.

[57:33] I don't know. I think it was a smart move. All right, you want to know what happened to cops.

[57:37] G's going to make me tell the whole story. I don't know if you know this first of all, but

[57:40] speedometer is in those days only 1 to 85 miles an hour. The way we figured out, there's always

[57:45] a way to figure out how fast you're going. And top here if you know the gear ratio.

[57:49] Okay, the final gear ratio of the car, you can figure out how fast you're going. Actually,

[57:55] you don't even need that. Okay, if at 3,000 RPM you're doing 60 miles an hour and 6,000 RPM,

[58:02] you're doing 120 miles an hour. This is no question about it. Okay, as long as you're in the same gear.

[58:08] So we were able to figure out that we were going 146 miles an hour. Okay, the cops were all

[58:14] cracking up because the speedometer only went up to 85. They searched the car, thoroughly.

[58:20] Nine cop cars showed up at the scene. Okay, and not just highway patrolmen. The sheriff's

[58:26] low die, city police. They had to come out and see what was going on and see the guy,

[58:32] you know, that was going 146 miles an hour and pulled over for the cops to take him away.

[58:38] Okay, it was like a circus. And I was, I spent the whole time in the front seat of the car,

[58:46] strapped in with seatbelt with handcuffs behind my back, trying to, you know, look,

[58:50] I, well, no problem. I looked in the review mirror. I saw what they were doing. The guy left me

[58:55] in the car. Actually, I probably could have, you know, I could have stolen his car. I think he

[58:59] left the keys in it. You know, this was another error though. Anyway, I don't know how I would have

[59:05] driven come to think of it with my hand, standing up on my back. Never mind that.

[59:12] Finally, it's over. The car started pulling away and here comes Mr. Highway Patrolman. I think

[59:17] his name was Ted something. He comes back to the car, you know, he's already talked to my partner.

[59:22] Now my partner is driving my car. Okay, because, you know, he had nothing to do with it.

[59:28] They questioned him. They searched him. They searched me. We just weren't doing anything except

[59:37] for trying out a car on a freeway in the safest manner we could. But he really didn't have

[59:44] anything to do with it. I had all the guilt. So the cop car, the cop, comes walking back to the,

[59:50] I should say, the California Highway Patrolman that put me in the car came back to his car,

[59:57] sat down next to me and he goes, what was that about anyway? Something like that. And I go,

[01:00:04] I got the car about three or four months ago. I wanted to try it out. I told him the truth.

[01:00:08] I told him, you know, I don't know if you ever had a car like this, but I think if you had a

[01:00:14] car like this, being that you're a cop and you drive, you get to drive pretty nice stuff, you know,

[01:00:19] that eventually you would try it out somehow, some way. And he goes, the truth is, I would. That

[01:00:26] thing is awesome. And I said, well, it really is. And I wanted to try it out. And I thought I

[01:00:33] would pick the safest place and the best time to do it. And I didn't endanger anyone else's life.

[01:00:41] And when I finally, when I knew that you were after me or somebody was after me, I did pull over.

[01:00:47] I hesitated for a moment because I wasn't sure if it was for me, but I did that. And I knew it

[01:00:53] was for me because I was going too fast. And what I'm going to tell you that the car was great and

[01:00:58] handled well, was safe to drive even at that speed. The brakes are magnificent. The car handles

[01:01:03] perfectly. My tires are brand new. They're Pirelli P7s. I mean, everything was right. The weather was

[01:01:09] good. The pavement was great. No rain. No nothing. It was just the right day. So he goes, yeah, I

[01:01:17] guess if you're going to do that, it was the right day. And then he takes the handcuffs off me.

[01:01:21] And he goes, you want a cigarette? And I go, actually, I would. That'd be great. He starts talking

[01:01:25] to me. And I'm talking to him. And he's like, he starts telling me about his Corvette. Okay. And now

[01:01:32] he had it up to you. 150 something. Okay. Not at the drag strip either. He wouldn't say where he

[01:01:39] did it. But anyway, we got to talk. And he goes, tell you what, when I get you to the courtroom,

[01:01:44] and you're going to go straight into court. I mean, if you don't, you're going to go to jail. So

[01:01:49] it's actually your lucky day. You're just going to go right into court. There's an opportunity for

[01:01:54] you to possibly walk out of here today. There's also a possibility of going to jail. So we're just

[01:02:04] going to go to court. And I'll see what I can do for you. And I'm thinking, shit, this guy's

[01:02:09] going to see what he can do for me. But the truth is, I wasn't running from him and he knew that.

[01:02:15] Because I, you know, I'm still in the truth. It was obvious.

[01:02:20] So we go to court. And the judge, you know, when it finally comes time for Mike to come up,

[01:02:26] he goes, oh, Mr. Richie, wow, 146 miles an hour. How do you plead? And I said,

[01:02:33] well, I was guilty, your honor. I was very polite, always. I'm guilty. I did it. And he goes,

[01:02:41] why sir on earth would you do such a dangerous thing like this? And I said, sir, it was not

[01:02:47] dangerous. I, I, this is a great car made to do it. Great breaks, great tires. It was early in the

[01:02:54] morning. And he goes, how did you like it? And I said, I thought it was great, your honor.

[01:03:03] But I won't do it again. And the whole courtroom cracked up. Okay. They were laughing out loud.

[01:03:09] And that saved me. I was able to walk out of that courtroom with a $250 fine

[01:03:19] drier, restricted driving for business only. And with a bad part, reckless driving on my record

[01:03:25] for seven years. But he knew that there was no alcohol or drugs involved. He said that. He said,

[01:03:32] you can go, sir. I want you to slow down. And I said, sir, I'll never do that again,

[01:03:38] which is the biggest lie I ever told in my life. Okay. And it's like, they let me go. That was it.

[01:03:45] I paid the money. And it was a company car. And anytime I was in the company car, well,

[01:03:50] that was company business. So all driving I did was for business. That wasn't a restriction.

[01:03:55] So F14 was your next game. Another adversary type thing. Good versus bad. You sold like 14,000 of

[01:04:03] these. Again, Williams must have been loving you with those sales numbers. F14 was another adversary.

[01:04:09] Again, Ken will yag off. Of course, was the bad guy.

[01:04:16] You know, the player was a good guy. And you were battling this, this mick pilot as an American.

[01:04:22] And in an F14 Tomcat, you know, in the Navy. A fun game to do. My first, actually,

[01:04:35] we hired Ed Boone who went on to do Mortal Kombat and lots of other games and become, you know,

[01:04:43] one of the great video game designers of all time. And Ed was on our project and he

[01:04:52] was a gifted programmer from the first day. And he really loved working with Eugene because Eugene

[01:04:57] showed him, you know, how things go together in a game. He had his own ideas too.

[01:05:02] But he learned a lot from Eugene. And he was a really quick study and

[01:05:08] I ended up doing the game with Ed later on too. But anyway, that's what I remember about F14.

[01:05:12] Eugene, Eugene and I got along great during the game. We thought if, you know, hey, if one

[01:05:19] rotating beacon on the top of the game is good, then three must be better. So we did the red

[01:05:24] white and blue, you know, patriotic, all American thing. I got my brother's voice in there as

[01:05:31] another American pilot so that we could have a rapport between two pilots fighting, you know,

[01:05:38] Russian guys. It did pretty well. That was the first, the first, and the I call it a ball popper.

[01:05:48] I guess other people had kicked the ball straight up, but I made a staple device called the ball

[01:05:54] popper and you could put it on any game and it would kick the ball straight up in the air.

[01:05:59] And I used it on almost every game since then. It's a great device, not every game, but lots.

[01:06:08] That's all I have about F14 except for. I do remember going to New Orleans. That was a year of

[01:06:12] the New Orleans show and having a lot of fun. We partied hard in New Orleans and we sold a lot

[01:06:21] of games. 14,400 or so I think. Black night 2000. Why did you do a remake of an older game

[01:06:29] or a recycled theme? Great game. Sold pretty well, but why don't go down that path? Well, Black night

[01:06:36] 2000. It's not really a remake. I wanted to go back to two level again, but I also,

[01:06:47] I had a design in my head and when you got down to it, the best theme for it was the Black night

[01:06:54] again. Plus speech and our ability to play music had improved so much that I wanted to, wow,

[01:07:03] I wanted to make the music for the game. I just felt it. I heard it all the time. I heard the,

[01:07:12] I didn't hear the bass line, but I wrote the chords for the main tune. I mean, maybe two years

[01:07:19] before we actually did the game. And then I started fooling around with some of the lead lines and

[01:07:25] and other tunes in it. There are very few tunes that I didn't write, but I want to say this.

[01:07:34] I wrote them. I played them on my guitar for Dan Ford and for Brian Schmidt. And Brian Schmidt

[01:07:40] came up with a completely original and spectacular bass line for the main tune. The bass line

[01:07:49] really made my tune much better. It was nothing before the bass line.

[01:07:56] And then the great Dan Ford, wow. I asked him to, I did give him my tunes and he did them faithfully,

[01:08:07] but he also, he just made some great leads and stuff and his voicing.

[01:08:17] The actual instruments were outstanding. And then we all went to the studio and started singing.

[01:08:28] You got the power, you got the mic. I was the voice of Black Knight. I loved this character.

[01:08:36] I had heard so much of the Black Knight and it was also kind of frustrated. I only sold like

[01:08:43] 12,000. You should have been 20 of the original Black Knight. That's what I think. That's what I feel in my

[01:08:48] art. It would have been 20 if Claude hadn't stolen it from us. So I didn't think it was a bad idea.

[01:08:58] Plus we had plenty of new ideas. But I wanted to, they had done a motor five bank for Pinbot.

[01:09:06] You hit five targets and the whole thing drops down. Well, I wanted a motor to free bank to block

[01:09:12] a smaller area. And so they made one for me. And so I have the first motor three bank of any game.

[01:09:20] And that's up on the top to go to a third level, which is another thing that I want to do with Black

[01:09:24] Knight 2000. I wanted to go one more hour Amps go to 11. Okay. Well, it's like I wanted this to go

[01:09:31] to three, three levels. I don't know. I think it's the greatest musical collaboration

[01:09:43] of any Pinball machine of all time. I know it sounds like I'm bragging, but the truth is I'm bragging

[01:09:50] on a bunch of people, mostly Prime Smith and the Great Town Ford and both of those guys are

[01:09:55] spectacular composers. And I really miss working with them. Also Black Knight 2000 kind of pushed

[01:10:04] the envelope. The upper play field lifts off. Lifts up so that you can clean the whole

[01:10:12] underside with a rag and it's quite easy. And you know, Black Knight 2000 is a special game to me

[01:10:21] because Joe Joe helped me an awful lot with it. He really taught me some things about

[01:10:28] drafting and design. And he was a good game designer and also a very good friend. I miss him so much.

[01:10:36] I love Joe. And I cherish the memories of working with him on that game. And he was pretty

[01:10:49] much of a mechanic engineer on the game while he was also the mechanical engineering boss.

[01:10:55] So it was an awesome thing that he still made time to make devices for my game and also run

[01:11:04] mechanical engineering at the same time. Tell me about Joe Dylan. Joe Dylan's a good guy. He was

[01:11:09] a good guy. He was a lot older than me. He was also a smart guy. Much smarter than he came off to be.

[01:11:28] He was a great salesman and the biggest clown on earth. He would put on anything and do

[01:11:37] anything. And including being the pulp ones at some cool distributor, distributor only show at

[01:11:47] the AMO Air ASI. He was funny. He was a great guy. A good friend. I asked the VN Mike AM as the

[01:11:57] cop in high speed. I miss him. I miss Joe Dylan.

[01:12:02] Roller games aside from the theme and game show disaster where actually the show was cancelled from

[01:12:09] TV before your game came out. How did you feel about the game? Well after I finished Roller games,

[01:12:18] I didn't really like it. Because it turned out to be a trashy TV show that went off the air.

[01:12:28] Now my game was affiliated with it. But when I actually played it, I had fun. I think it's okay.

[01:12:37] I think it's a pretty good game. It was a pretty game too. I like how it looked. I like the

[01:12:44] golf team magnet. Some interesting rules. It was fun to do the voice and the singing. I don't know.

[01:12:54] I used to hate it a lot more than I do now. I don't hate it anymore. Because I've gone back to play

[01:13:00] it a few times at friends house. It wasn't really a bad game. It actually played pretty good.

[01:13:06] So what about the theme? If you weren't on the team, you did not experience the heartbreak

[01:13:14] that we did. So if you enjoy Roller games, certainly your entitled to. It's the stigma that's

[01:13:23] attached to the game for me that ever caused me problems. And like I said, it doesn't bother me

[01:13:28] anymore. I think it was a good game. Terminator 2 was an absolute amazing game that you did.

[01:13:34] How fun was that to make? T2 was a riot to make. We were both excited. That was Dwight Nighin.

[01:13:39] When we found out that when I found out that there was going to be a Terminator 2, I freaked out.

[01:13:48] I begged for it. Because I thought that Terminator, the first one, was the best B movie ever made.

[01:13:58] 300 and something guys could kill by the Terminator. It's awesome. It was like a landmark movie.

[01:14:05] For me, science fiction, you know, violence. Pretty cool. A good story. Anyway, when T2 happened,

[01:14:16] we asked for it and we got it and we got, let's see, the artist and Dwight and I got to go to

[01:14:26] Jim Cameron Studios. It was a light storm production. That's it. And we got to sit and talk with

[01:14:34] James Cameron for three hours. And he had pinball ideas. And it was awesome. He showed us

[01:14:43] everything he was doing on Terminator at that point. T2, I'm sorry, gave us a script.

[01:14:50] At the same time, we were making a video game and so he sent dailies. Everything that was filmed

[01:14:56] that day and it would arrive the next day. And we would see it the next day. We all decided,

[01:15:02] you know, having on his closure agreements, but it worked out great. He sent us artifacts like

[01:15:08] the actual chip that they used in the movie. A couple of Terminator skulls. Stan Winston, you know,

[01:15:17] sculpted stuff. We had a great connection. It was just a great license. And we gave

[01:15:25] us the maximum freedom and it was great to talk to James Cameron and get his take. And just

[01:15:33] to meet him was kind of throwing. He wasn't the king of the world then, but he was definitely a

[01:15:39] talented guy. And he talked about writing the first Terminator script in his car. He had no money,

[01:15:47] he had nothing. And here we are, this palace of an office, which he's a little ashamed of actually,

[01:15:54] somebody else, jettic for him. And all these things are around him. These things from

[01:16:03] alien and, you know, like the, you know, the, the four-cliff kind of thing that a person stood in.

[01:16:14] Now, he had the model of that and a model of the original Terminator, you know,

[01:16:18] and chrome metal on his desk. And, you know, these things are staring us in the face and we are in

[01:16:25] awe. Okay, so T2 was, well, we had heard that somebody was producing a big display, you know,

[01:16:36] a top matrix display and that it would be perfect for pinball. And I started asking the guys,

[01:16:41] could this be put into a pinball machine? And they said, yes. So I wanted that in the game. And I

[01:16:48] wanted it to be, I wanted it to play a part of the game where the player got to play like a video

[01:16:55] game on the screen too. That was from the very beginning. I wanted to do that. And I wanted

[01:17:00] best of all to communicate to the player. All the things that we wanted to say, okay, without

[01:17:07] really saying them because of things we want to say through the speakers are different. They have

[01:17:11] to be entertaining. But if we want to dump data, information on the player and get his attention,

[01:17:17] get him to look up at the dot matrix display. Okay, this is a great venue of communication again.

[01:17:25] And so, you know, well, T2 was a lot of fun to do. I was very happy with the kinetics of the game.

[01:17:36] The left right left right ramp stop. Actually, Dwight came up with that rule. Dwight came up with

[01:17:42] many rules. Dwight was, you know, he was just as much in love with the game as I was. And it sold

[01:17:48] a 15,252 machines. And I got the last one off the line. I made a point. I said, dude, I want to get

[01:17:56] the last one, please. So how did the, how did the vulgar roms come about, those home roms?

[01:18:03] We never asked for them. He just, you know, he was like Arnold Schwarzenegger did the speech. And I

[01:18:09] don't know if he was happier sad, but the list was relatively short compared to today. But,

[01:18:16] you know, I think he was actually kind of being a wiseass to the, to, I forget who was sound

[01:18:25] man on this guy. Oh, Chris Granner. He was a wiseass, the Chris Granner. Chris Granner was sitting on

[01:18:30] the outside coaching him, you know, and it's like, here's this intimidating dude. And he was a wiseass

[01:18:36] and he said it himself. He said, fuck you out, hold to Chris. He said it to him. And it's like,

[01:18:42] you know, he's, you know, he had his middle finger up and everything. Chris didn't take it seriously.

[01:18:49] This is how I remember it. And we decided to offer that as an adult, you know, an adult

[01:18:56] tradition of the game to some people. We really, at first it was very difficult to catch, but then

[01:19:04] there's more and more people got to game at home. They wanted this, so we let them have it.

[01:19:08] High speed too, the getaway. A great game. I mean, with amazing fall, that terrible thing. But it's,

[01:19:15] you know, kind of like the Black Knight versus Black Knight 2000 thing, it's kind of a recycle of

[01:19:21] an older, older and very popular theme. It seems like that's, you know, you've been down that road

[01:19:27] before. It was it like you liked the sales results and the, and the results or what, what brought

[01:19:32] that about? People ask me to do it. Why, when are you going to make another high speed game?

[01:19:37] Right? You know, when are you going to make another Black Knight camp? You know, they ask me.

[01:19:42] But it's like, I don't think I'm going to do that anymore because, you know, I guess someone

[01:19:48] always thinks I have an ulterior motive, but I really don't. You know, people, people loved high speed.

[01:19:54] They look at high speed too. And you know, it's like it's another story. Parts of it are the same,

[01:19:59] but the shots aren't the same at all. You know, and there's red, green and yellow lights and I,

[01:20:09] there is a cross shot, but it stays on the play field. Almost the up-down ramp is up,

[01:20:16] but down. You know, and it has this huge watching machine thing on it. You know, it's really not

[01:20:22] very similar to high speed, but I don't know. I got asked and sucked in and I did it. And actually

[01:20:28] was actually in both cases, all three cases. It wasn't a stupid thing to do. We did pretty well.

[01:20:35] People ask you, are you saying that people in the industry ask you, or you get like fan mail?

[01:20:39] No, not fan mail. It's about, you know, well, sometimes. Sometimes that'll influence me. It's like,

[01:20:47] you know, enough guys say, once you do high speed too, because the story from where left off and

[01:20:53] and go. So, it's why he had a lot to do with that too. You know, he thought it was a good idea.

[01:21:00] And I did too, and I also wanted to, you know, look range in there.

[01:21:04] And now, what about Star Trek Next Gen? How was that working with that theme compared to,

[01:21:10] like, state terminator? I was lucky again, not in the beginning though. In terms of Star Trek,

[01:21:16] Star Trek Next Generation, I went to get the license, okay. I told Ken Fadasna,

[01:21:23] Neil McCastrow, that that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to try and get it, and they said, okay.

[01:21:28] So, you know, Roger Sharp and I and Dwight and Greg, I think, Greg Feras, went to, you know, Paramount

[01:21:37] Studios, only to find that there are three women there. And there's nothing wrong with women.

[01:21:45] I didn't want to make that sound like three women are unusual, but these were unusual women. They were

[01:21:53] trying to protect the license to the point of, well, we don't want any shooting in the game. No,

[01:22:00] no, you know, we don't want you to fire phasers, you know, no violence, no photon torpedoes, and I'm going,

[01:22:10] wow, is that hypocritical, you know, and the other guys, you know, on our team are like,

[01:22:16] looking to meet funny, but, you know, I did say that at a lunch, okay, in the, in the commissary at,

[01:22:25] at Paramount, it's just, you know, they were asking me to back off on everything that makes

[01:22:30] the show really cool. Dave themselves did not know the Prime Directive where I grew up on Star Trek.

[01:22:38] I saw every episode of the old Star Trek and the new Star Trek, and I know how it works,

[01:22:43] and I wasn't about to violate, you know, the Prime Directive or anything else. They didn't even know

[01:22:48] about the Prime Directive themselves. You know, it's like, anyway, we got into trouble. I said,

[01:22:55] I can't make a Nambi Pambi game here. I need this. I need the ability to shoot, when provoked,

[01:23:02] and Captain McCard would, you know, would act a certain way, and that's, I want to be true to that,

[01:23:09] and it's a ridiculous task, me not to. So, the meeting did not go well to start with. So,

[01:23:17] that's the understatement of the year. It didn't go well at all, but I wasn't about to just cave in

[01:23:24] and agree to them, because it was worth so much more, and it was worth the chance, you know, to go

[01:23:29] ahead and try to get everything. So, Roger Sharp, who is very much a diplomat, called them up the

[01:23:37] next day, while we were up already back in Chicago, and he said, what can we do to salvage this?

[01:23:46] And, you know, they were going to lose a substantial amount of licensing money,

[01:23:52] and we were going to lose a great theme. So, they came around, these three girls, actually a new girl

[01:24:00] headed up the thing, her name was Susie Dominick, and she knew the show and was a smart lady,

[01:24:08] and had, you know, a much better rapport with us, and she was there. I guess she was their boss,

[01:24:17] and then it became clear cut that we could do that, we could shoot, we could use everything

[01:24:22] that was in the show, as long as we obeyed the rules about the prime directive, and we did.

[01:24:26] We stuck to our word, and it was easy to do. I mean, to do anything else would not have been

[01:24:31] faithful to the show, wouldn't have been correct. So, even if we wanted to make space faruits from

[01:24:37] fucking hell, okay, we wouldn't have done it because it wouldn't have been a popular thing to do.

[01:24:44] Anyway, to me, Star Trek's next generation was the greatest collaboration of talent, you know,

[01:24:53] on any game I ever did. What I mean by that is more good people, more spectacularly talented

[01:25:00] people were involved in Star Trek than any other game I ever did. Greg Ferris did this fantastic

[01:25:07] package, you know, for artwork, and I'll tell you what, he's not just an artist, the guy's

[01:25:14] a brilliant script man. He's also a damn good drummer and a musician, he's a showman from the

[01:25:21] first day. He knows how to make people laugh, he's a comedian, he's a smart guy that you

[01:25:26] love to have on your team. He came up with lots and lots of stuff that, you know, he's just not going

[01:25:31] to, you know, I mean, the scripting guys were myself to write Greg and Dan Fordon, but Dan,

[01:25:39] I don't think was, you know, and he liked the show, but not as much as we did, we watched all of it,

[01:25:44] and we loved it. And, you know, it's like just a great experience. Dan wrote, you know,

[01:25:53] seven or eight different tunes for the game, I didn't write anything for it. But he wrote a tune

[01:25:59] for each mode and everyone is good, and I don't know, there's like thousands of speech calls

[01:26:07] to choose from, and I loved all building up the little scenarios between, you know, Captain Picard

[01:26:14] and Jordy or, you know, a war for whatever, you know, it's just, you didn't just play the game,

[01:26:25] you played the show, and it felt like the show, and I had a lot of fun making the mechanicals.

[01:26:31] The only thing I regret is the side-drands, but as soon as I made the decision to put the cannons

[01:26:38] on the slingshots, there was no way out after that. I loved where the shots were out of the cannon.

[01:26:45] I mean, they swept the whole game pretty much, and they were in a position where they could make

[01:26:49] the shots angularly, correctly. That's a weird thing to say, but it's true. Unfortunately,

[01:26:59] the slingshots had to grow, and I never could figure out how to make the transfigure, but I didn't

[01:27:03] consider that it was going to be that big of a problem and not just like, but it was just like,

[01:27:09] but in a way, Star Trek is kind of like, it's a very tough game to play and win,

[01:27:18] and if nothing else, it has a reputation for that. The players can do very well, they just want

[01:27:24] to keep the ball away from the drain. How was your relationship with your brother, where you're both

[01:27:27] in the pinball department? You're almost, you know, competitive teams, I guess, in some degree,

[01:27:33] I mean, did that cause any problems between you two? I don't think it caused a problem at all,

[01:27:38] and he was there way before that. He never left, okay. He got in about 19. I'm trying to think

[01:27:46] it was his first game was Thunderball, right? Yeah, with a programmer that was very green, and

[01:27:54] I don't know, not very gifted, great guy though. Anyway, you can get a fair shake on that. After that,

[01:28:01] I'm not sure what his next game would have been. Firepower too. He called me up one day and

[01:28:07] said, can I make the two version of it? And I go, sure. You know, I was already back in King

[01:28:12] Video and working on Tevis later. So I said, yeah, after that, I'm not sure what, I don't know

[01:28:20] what technology is. You know better than me, probably. But he had been there for a long time. Anyway,

[01:28:25] our relationship was good. The only thing I remember arguing with him about was,

[01:28:30] you know, I had a street bike, and he talked to me one day, and he goes, you know what?

[01:28:42] I'm going to get a dirt bike, and I go, what are you going to get a dirt bike for? I have a street

[01:28:47] bike. We can ride together. I can't believe you're doing this. Now you're going to get a dirt bike,

[01:28:51] you know. Anyway, we never did ride together much in the street, but I ended up getting a dirt bike

[01:28:59] also. I had a dirt bike before. Anyway, that's what we argued about. We didn't argue about games.

[01:29:05] I used to do this to him, though. I got to tell you, it was funny to tell him and I would do it

[01:29:09] to each other. I'd go into his game, would be, you know, Indiana Jones, and actually played great,

[01:29:17] but I was thinking, what can I do to make one of his psychos? That's what I would do.

[01:29:32] A mean childish thing to do. You know, one day I'm totally involved in everything I'm doing on

[01:29:39] Star Trek, and he comes in, you know, and he's got a granner with him. I don't know,

[01:29:44] somebody else, and he goes, he goes, does that? No, no. No, he didn't. He went, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:29:58] Developing No Fear, I heard that vicious rumors, but I heard that you basically had kind of one

[01:30:05] foot out the door because you were going across the street to midway to work on some driving

[01:30:10] games was that you know did that impact the the no fear game at all it's not

[01:30:15] true at all

[01:30:18] i didn't work on the driving games at midway

[01:30:23] it was like

[01:30:25] i i wanted to make a driving game but

[01:30:28] i i didn't get to i i will

[01:30:30] i was going across the street to midway

[01:30:33] to see my friends because that's how they move all video group

[01:30:36] um...

[01:30:39] it wasn't about uh... any kind of you know

[01:30:42] split thing i

[01:30:43] i didn't know fear well before

[01:30:45] i left and produced

[01:30:47] uh... california speed

[01:30:49] at a tary again

[01:30:52] video game interference

[01:30:54] uh... with the development of no fair at all

[01:30:56] and how did you feel about no fear and and how it how it ultimately turned out

[01:31:00] you look at pinball

[01:31:01] and how many games were sold

[01:31:04] you'll see a big tapering off starting with

[01:31:07] twilight sound

[01:31:09] about that sound

[01:31:11] uh... and from that time

[01:31:14] you will see the games gradually you know the best you could do

[01:31:18] would sell a certain level and a two years later

[01:31:22] the best you could do it be less than that level

[01:31:25] no matter what we made it didn't matter there was some games there

[01:31:29] they should have made

[01:31:31] we should have sold many more

[01:31:33] but we didn't because pinball was going through another negative period

[01:31:38] and as it turns out it was the final one

[01:31:41] the one that broke the strut the the camels back

[01:31:43] so how did you get back into pinball back to stern i mean was that

[01:31:47] your idea or their idea

[01:31:49] kind of a mutual idea i called gary one day and i go

[01:31:52] look i want to make a pinball machine are you interested

[01:31:55] and he goes i don't know maybe

[01:31:57] caused me back you know

[01:31:59] a month later something to go

[01:32:01] yeah yeah come in and talk

[01:32:04] i went in and talked

[01:32:06] did that go easy or did it go well

[01:32:09] i would say very well we you know

[01:32:13] good guy about

[01:32:15] about uh... that sort of stuff it's like

[01:32:19] i don't even think we have a written contract right now we don't need one

[01:32:23] he says he's gonna pay me he's gonna pay me if i say i'm gonna do a game

[01:32:26] i'm gonna do a game

[01:32:29] or what

[01:32:30] how did you feel about the licenses that you've gotten uh... you know it's

[01:32:33] stern you know that terminator the elvis the world poker and spider-man

[01:32:38] t3 i asked for and it was probably a mistake

[01:32:42] honest or something or two old to be the terminator but you can't really see

[01:32:45] it into the movie and of course it's only game by that time

[01:32:49] uh...

[01:32:51] t3 i hadn't done a pinball machine in seven years

[01:32:58] i'm not gonna say that

[01:33:01] i hate it i don't hate it i like it actually

[01:33:03] i really like the game in the back box but

[01:33:06] the required uh... couple of posts and i i think still to this this day

[01:33:11] some people have t3s operating with the cannon

[01:33:15] it doesn't swing through its whole stroke because these

[01:33:19] removable shipping post were never taken out

[01:33:23] on sam

[01:33:24] yeah that's interesting i've never heard that before

[01:33:26] truth and when you when you read about people

[01:33:29] saying all i have to bounce it off the floor to get the top target crap like

[01:33:33] that means that the cannon isn't sweeping the full five targets

[01:33:37] you know

[01:33:38] vertically which means that the post are still in the in the back panel

[01:33:42] and you know

[01:33:43] dummies didn't look at the

[01:33:45] the material that we should put the game or maybe the stuff got lost

[01:33:49] the second owner they don't know

[01:33:52] it's like so the post probably are still in there that was an unfortunate

[01:33:55] decision

[01:33:56] and that's that's something that i i hate it because

[01:33:59] i said put a rubber band around it that way if the game works you know

[01:34:03] it's fine that uh... uh... it won't swing around while we're shipping it

[01:34:07] and

[01:34:08] we won't have to ask somebody to take the post around you know

[01:34:13] and the truth is it's a rubber band broke it wouldn't have mattered

[01:34:16] game still would have

[01:34:17] raised the more the cannon because it worked off a gravity fat camp

[01:34:21] what about what about elvis how did you feel about elvis

[01:34:23] i hated the theme at first i'm

[01:34:28] i hated it i didn't want to do well but i didn't

[01:34:31] it's not steve richi it's not uh... you know

[01:34:34] it doesn't

[01:34:35] there's no

[01:34:36] i don't know in the end

[01:34:39] i did see that elvis had marketing power

[01:34:43] and i decided to do it because the alternatives

[01:34:46] the alternative games

[01:34:48] did not have the marketing power of elvis

[01:34:51] as it turns out it was a very good decision we sold a lot

[01:34:55] and he's built uh...

[01:34:58] i don't know and i i hesitate to say how many but

[01:35:01] we've gone back to build them every christmas sense and

[01:35:06] you know there's been some nice runs of elvis i'm happy guy

[01:35:10] on world poker tour

[01:35:12] they called me in the office and

[01:35:15] told me over and over again that i need to make this game for them

[01:35:20] and i resisted heavily

[01:35:24] and they all the me some more

[01:35:27] and ray worked on me and uh...

[01:35:30] the final uh... the final thing was my codon on gary

[01:35:33] gary stern both screaming in my face you have to do it

[01:35:36] well

[01:35:39] i can see that i wasn't going to get the gick

[01:35:42] at that point i was not prepared not to get the gick

[01:35:45] i could have made a redemption game but it would have been cool

[01:35:48] started six months before

[01:35:50] if i had known this was going to happen

[01:35:52] so i kind of had to say yeah

[01:35:54] if i wanted to uh... make a game at stern

[01:35:57] i kind of had to say yeah

[01:35:59] if i was going to continue to have an income

[01:36:02] but i hated it from the first moment i want to make that clear

[01:36:05] uh...

[01:36:07] on the other hand

[01:36:12] i have no remorse

[01:36:14] nor do i feel the slightest bit of guilt okay

[01:36:18] nor do i feel that it is inferior in any way

[01:36:21] in terms of the playfield design

[01:36:26] i'm not ashamed of it it's one is held a battle on the ball in the upper

[01:36:29] playfield

[01:36:30] it's a best little playfield that ever was

[01:36:32] i would say until pat

[01:36:35] did

[01:36:36] family guy and i think that playfield

[01:36:39] nicer

[01:36:40] no doubt

[01:36:41] well of course it is it's much bigger

[01:36:43] use a small ball

[01:36:44] it's much more detailed because it can be

[01:36:48] i i continue to use the same size ball

[01:36:50] which means everything is bigger

[01:36:52] can't put as much stuff on it

[01:36:54] and um...

[01:36:57] you know the real estate used was uh...

[01:37:02] i don't know

[01:37:03] pretty clever i don't block a view of anything

[01:37:06] you don't lose a damn thing on moral poker chart even though this is a

[01:37:10] second level

[01:37:11] you do lose some territory

[01:37:13] on black night black night two thousand okay

[01:37:16] any two level level game you know you sacrifice some space

[01:37:20] on the bottom playfield to have an upper playfield

[01:37:23] now let's talk about spider-man which was like

[01:37:26] the obviously this is a license that you probably went after right

[01:37:31] yeah after world poker tour

[01:37:34] and and what happened i was kind of like

[01:37:37] i don't give a hell i don't give a damn

[01:37:39] what happens i want to do spider-man or i don't want to do anything

[01:37:43] and uh... you know not in pinball i would go back to redemption games

[01:37:48] and

[01:37:48] and carry said okay

[01:37:50] great we're gonna get spider-man

[01:37:52] up to that point

[01:37:54] carry thought that spider-man was to juvenile

[01:37:58] along with harry potter and we were telling him hey dude there's been two movies

[01:38:03] everybody see in it

[01:38:04] everybody loves it

[01:38:06] for crowd say it's both movies are in the all-time box office top ten

[01:38:12] he finally sees the light

[01:38:14] and he says okay

[01:38:16] also i think he realizes that when you make somebody do something they don't

[01:38:20] want to

[01:38:22] make them design a pinball machine that their heart is not in

[01:38:27] it's about thing

[01:38:29] bad all the way around so on spider-man

[01:38:32] was there anything i know that the game is now in red at this time and

[01:38:37] you probably

[01:38:38] can't talk a lot about it but what can you say about the game at this

[01:38:42] point i love it

[01:38:44] i love the game

[01:38:46] i think i think most people are going to love it because

[01:38:48] it was a very elegant set of rules

[01:38:55] refined all the shots to be smooth and

[01:38:57] and flow everywhere

[01:39:00] it's totally back to flow

[01:39:02] uh... you know i was kind of bummed out when people didn't

[01:39:05] didn't really like where a poker to our stops and we didn't make too many

[01:39:09] and it's funny

[01:39:10] pat could get away pat wall or could get away with making

[01:39:13] that many stops and more but if i do it i'm not allowed to

[01:39:17] because i'm thinking of low-right yes you know that's what they say

[01:39:21] anyway

[01:39:23] those people that say that are right i uh...

[01:39:27] part of my heart

[01:39:29] is to make a nice kinetic package with a ball

[01:39:32] flows around the game where it's fun to play

[01:39:35] when you know it's coming back this is you know a steve game and it's going to

[01:39:39] do this i know what's going to do this and it does do it

[01:39:43] as well as a lot of new things that i haven't done before

[01:39:46] and

[01:39:47] uh... it's just turned out really nice

[01:39:50] it's fun working with lineman's uh...

[01:39:54] a very good experience just as good as working with you gene

[01:39:58] we got along very well he's like a you know

[01:40:01] a give-and-take kind of guy where we you know

[01:40:05] i don't know the relationship was totally synergistic that's it

[01:40:09] we didn't argue about anything

[01:40:12] by say something he this is carefully and thinks about it

[01:40:16] and makes a decision based on what will make the game better

[01:40:20] instead of being stubborn about our egos are something that

[01:40:24] we'd like or something that you know

[01:40:27] that we made and so it can't be bad can it yes it can be bad

[01:40:31] yes we all make bad things and uh...

[01:40:34] you know smart man takes out his bad work and leaves all his good work and

[01:40:39] and sometimes it takes another smart man to combine say

[01:40:42] dude you got a dump this or dude this is great

[01:40:46] why should try that all are you giving me that idea

[01:40:49] yes i am

[01:40:51] my friend i will take that idea and thank you very much

[01:40:55] that's making a great pindmull machine is about

[01:40:58] having an open mind being willing to accept ideas from other people

[01:41:02] uh... you know if they're good they go in the game

[01:41:06] if they're bad they don't

[01:41:08] and um...

[01:41:10] i kind of do reserve the right

[01:41:12] to make that decision on my case but

[01:41:14] i also

[01:41:16] i mean if it's somebody like one new gene larry tomorrow

[01:41:19] a few other people you know where

[01:41:21] where i really respect you know everything they've done

[01:41:25] uh... and also respect their intelligence

[01:41:29] respect their insights

[01:41:31] they probably have something to say to me that's important

[01:41:34] if they're gonna bring it up

[01:41:36] i probably have a problem with whatever it isn't

[01:41:39] and the same with me if i told you gene or or lineman hey

[01:41:43] i'm not getting extra ball dude you're the best in ball player in the world

[01:41:46] and he is

[01:41:48] you know the only reason he's not the best in ball in the player in the world

[01:41:51] this year

[01:41:52] is because he didn't play because he worked on spider-man

[01:41:55] he is the baddest in ball player ball time i think

[01:41:59] anyway

[01:42:01] if i'm having a hard time getting extra ball and i tell him look

[01:42:05] i'm not getting extra ball and i'm just an average player maybe a little

[01:42:08] better than average

[01:42:09] you know he pays attention to me and he says

[01:42:13] yeah well if you're not getting that then really bad players aren't gonna get it

[01:42:16] that's not a very nice compliment to me but

[01:42:19] it is the truth i don't i don't want myself about things like that

[01:42:23] on spider-man are you using leds now for all the computer control lights or

[01:42:28] any of the lighting instead of you know the normal fifty five five five's or

[01:42:32] a number forty seven lights it was a consideration early on in the game but

[01:42:38] it turned out to be way too expensive for us to do that

[01:42:41] and uh...

[01:42:44] you know in order for sure to keep

[01:42:46] keep on keeping on

[01:42:48] we have to be profitable

[01:42:51] i don't want to be the guy that

[01:42:53] you know that causes us to be two hundred dollars over the bill materials or

[01:42:58] you know

[01:42:59] i don't want to make a game is responsible for

[01:43:02] laying off a bunch of people or not having the company function at all

[01:43:08] i try to cooperate with people once in a while you get

[01:43:11] involved in a group of guys that now just want to cut it to the phone that

[01:43:14] happened to valley

[01:43:16] valley

[01:43:16] told everybody

[01:43:18] take a hundred dollars out of the game

[01:43:21] and uh... they struggled but they did take

[01:43:23] one hundred dollars out of our even more machine they made

[01:43:28] then management came back and said

[01:43:30] take out another hundred dollars

[01:43:34] and valley was dead and we bought them about

[01:43:39] nine months after that happened

[01:43:42] take away the fun

[01:43:44] not gonna sell games you're not gonna sell games and aren't fun

[01:43:47] players aren't stupid

[01:43:49] and uh...

[01:43:50] there's a level where you have to you know

[01:43:53] you have to stay

[01:43:56] it's a fine line

[01:43:57] i heard that every couple years you have like a major house cleaning

[01:44:02] where you

[01:44:03] back a dumpster up to your office and just

[01:44:05] throughout all your you know all drawings and old knick-knacks and

[01:44:10] old pinball paraphernalia and that

[01:44:13] people just go nuts they want to go dumpster diving

[01:44:17] after all your all the stuff that you're discarding

[01:44:19] is that is that true to those stories really true

[01:44:23] yep they're true

[01:44:24] uh... every year not

[01:44:26] you know i mean that actually every game however long game takes okay

[01:44:30] when when we're working on games most of us are slaps and fact all of us are

[01:44:35] i'm thinking of tennis nordman's office or

[01:44:39] uh...

[01:44:40] john chuteau

[01:44:43] very out there

[01:44:46] Colonel nutty no Colonel nutty is

[01:44:49] that was an internal name for Tony crammer

[01:44:53] uh...

[01:44:53] anyway uh...

[01:44:55] yeah my office was a mess while i was making a game

[01:45:00] everybody's was and and so after a year

[01:45:03] or however long the came takes you know

[01:45:05] just piles up pretty soon you get pissed off in the ass

[01:45:08] we just threw away everything it didn't mean anything to us what do we care

[01:45:11] we just moved on

[01:45:13] there's probably like some pretty cool stuff and

[01:45:15] farce collectors go

[01:45:17] i try not to do that anymore

[01:45:23] they try to keep the stuff that i can

[01:45:26] then it's a lot of it doesn't belong to me

[01:45:29] you know like there are any whitewoods of stern

[01:45:32] uh... stern cams they they you know they do they strip all the parts off

[01:45:37] put them back in a bin and we build build the game again

[01:45:44] yes it's true play

[01:45:45] i also heard that you

[01:45:47] unlike a lot of other designers

[01:45:50] you spend a lot of time on the production floor

[01:45:53] watching your game be assembled and making sure that

[01:45:57] all the you know the small details are watched is that also true

[01:46:03] yeah sure i probably do that more than any other game designer ever did

[01:46:07] i don't mind doing it

[01:46:09] if i've got the time usually

[01:46:11] well after you're done with the pinball machine

[01:46:14] it's on the line you got good earnings reports

[01:46:17] people are generally happy

[01:46:19] uh... you got some kind of sales

[01:46:22] the second or third week you know what you have after the games and release

[01:46:26] and if it's good

[01:46:28] they didn't give a damn what i did okay

[01:46:30] they weren't harping at me to make the next game they just wouldn't give a

[01:46:34] damn

[01:46:36] all along i would look at it but i tried to always remain

[01:46:40] and friendly

[01:46:41] well this goes for all people on our okay

[01:46:44] i try to be friendly and i try to be respectful

[01:46:48] uh... and so when i go to the line

[01:46:52] ice i speak to everyone i talk to them they are my friends

[01:46:56] maybe not close friends but they're my friends i

[01:46:59] i make friends with them i don't give them any reason i hate me

[01:47:02] i don't give them any reason to

[01:47:04] to uh... you know

[01:47:06] i'm just a human being like they are that's it right there

[01:47:09] and i think a lot of people on the line

[01:47:12] just need to uh... to know that

[01:47:16] you know that's not the best job on our you know being in the summer

[01:47:20] i used to feel sorry for people because i have to do the same job all day long

[01:47:24] over and over again but

[01:47:25] you know after well

[01:47:27] things change in manufacturing they started moving people around so they

[01:47:30] didn't get support

[01:47:31] anyway

[01:47:32] i would stay after i like the people i am making friends

[01:47:36] with the foreman with the guys on the line

[01:47:39] and i had a nice report that i'm going to find some for something they would

[01:47:42] give it to me

[01:47:43] if i asked them please put a little bit

[01:47:45] of lubricate

[01:47:46] you know uh... lubricate grease

[01:47:49] just a tiny dot put on with it with it with a toothpick

[01:47:52] and i would show them

[01:47:53] on each end of the spinner and then

[01:47:55] move it back and forth so the whole wire is greased so

[01:47:58] whenever it spins it spins nice

[01:48:01] and you get ten more spins ten more revolutions out of the spinner there was

[01:48:04] grease

[01:48:05] versus one that was dry

[01:48:08] so i i like that i enjoyed work you know

[01:48:12] i still do i still go out on the line now

[01:48:14] only i didn't have much of a chance on on uh... spider-man

[01:48:18] became really didn't go into production until after i had left
