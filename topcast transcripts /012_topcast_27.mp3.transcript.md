[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:20] Right now on Topcast we're going to be talking to somebody that's involved with the Dutch pinball scene

[00:25] over in the Netherlands. He also has some experiences with the Big Bang Bar project as he currently

[00:31] owns a Big Bang Bar. Yes, that's right, he has in his possession right now a Big Bang Bar,

[00:37] a head of, nearly a year ahead of all the North American people that ordered him.

[00:41] So we're going to be talking about him and his Big Bang Bar and how it's held up over the last year.

[00:46] And also he was involved with building and assembling the Big Bang Bar's. So we're going to give him a

[00:53] call right now. Special guest. Special guest. Special guest. Okay so I'm talking with Jonathan

[01:02] Joaston. He's a part of the Dutch Pinball Association and editor for the Spinner magazine

[01:09] which goes out to the members of the Dutch Pinball Association. He also started up a pinball

[01:14] donation fund in 2004 which we're going to talk about and he also was part of the Big Bang Bar

[01:21] project and helped actually gene cutting him with some assembly and we're going to talk about that.

[01:27] So Jonathan how are you doing today? I'm fine thank you. Let's talk about your Dutch Pinball

[01:32] Association and the Spinner magazine and how you got involved with those and what your responsibilities

[01:38] are in there. Okay basically the Pinball Association was founded in 1992 if I'm correct.

[01:48] So this year we have our 15th anniversary. I joined the association in December 2000

[01:59] and after I got my first Spinner magazine in the mail I read it and I was like okay I think

[02:06] the quality good go up. I really was like like okay this is such an

[02:12] well everybody is doing it for the level of pinball obviously but not everybody's a journalist

[02:18] or something like that. Not that I am but I figured the left good go up so what I did was I

[02:24] send in my own reports of trade fairs that were going on or competitions or big events and so on

[02:35] and basically in five year time I managed to become a chief editor of the magazine

[02:43] previous editor quit over a year ago because he did over 30 issues and he figured it was time to

[02:51] to leave to someone else and basically everybody was looking at me hopefully that I would take the

[03:00] job so. Do you have any experience in that in that in that field before or was this all just brand

[03:06] new to you? I had no experience in actually making magazines that was new but I used to already

[03:15] wrote for the magazine for five years and I had my ideas of how to improve and that's also one of

[03:23] the reasons I think I was asked to take what kind of ideas did you have for improvements?

[03:31] Well we have the pinball association and there is the magazine a lot of people become member of

[03:39] the association but they see it as they subscribe to the magazine and they see the association as

[03:45] something else so we have over a thousand members but if we have a big event

[03:50] and better have only 300 will show up because there's about 700 people just

[03:57] receiving a magazine reading it and not actually going to shows or whatever you know so.

[04:07] And basically okay when I took over I figured we have the magazine we have a website I figured we

[04:14] can try to integrate these more. What is the website? The website is www.nfepinball.com

[04:28] okay it's in Dutch though so there's a forum which is quite popular and basically it explains

[04:37] everything we do within the Dutch pinball association but what I found very strange was

[04:48] it's an organization run by volunteers and you would read in the Spinner magazine for example

[04:54] a few years ago that there was a new pinball game and you could read it on the forum on the website

[04:59] but there was no news item on the website which I found strange because I figured if you're a

[05:05] pinball association then if there is a new game coming out you want to mention that to everybody

[05:11] who visits your website so there are ideas to integrate the website and the magazine more

[05:19] recently we started a Wiki thanks to the webmasters basically to share our technical knowledge

[05:29] in that Wiki basically articles from previous Spinner magazines will be published and people can

[05:36] contribute their own experiences into one or if they have suggestions or if they think something

[05:43] is done wrong. We started that up two weeks ago actually I have to say it was our webmasters

[05:49] we did so all credit to go to him but as the association I'm talking about we so. Right now you

[05:55] so you're not you're just the editor you don't do the webmaster you know the

[06:00] possibilities. No I do some of the editorial work on the website if there is a news item or a new

[06:07] event coming up I can put it on the agenda but it's not my main priority basically or

[06:15] okay now what what's now used in 2004 you came up with this pinball donation fund what was

[06:22] what what's the purpose behind that and how did that go. Okay well basically every year the Dutch

[06:30] PIMMOL association organizes the Dutch PIMMOL open which is actually one of the biggest PIMMOL

[06:38] events in Europe. There's many people from abroad coming over I think even trained Augustine

[06:47] from America. Yeah Trent was the Dutch PIMMOL champion back maybe in 2004 back I can't remember

[06:54] three or two times four. Yeah it wasn't my place very nice guy. Oh yeah great guy great guy.

[07:03] Okay we used to do that every year and every year usually we had a sponsor

[07:10] supplying us with PIMMOL machines. At a certain point the sponsor

[07:17] chose to go into a different direction selling these games or whatever I don't know what happened

[07:21] because I wasn't that involved at that time so but it left the organization without a

[07:27] proper sponsor so we tried to organize events by asking our members to bring games so we could

[07:33] organize something and I brought a couple of games and that went well we had great events but

[07:38] we felt the need to build our own collection and several ideas were suggested how to get games

[07:49] basically and I was like okay we can buy games that's that's sure an option and we bought them

[08:00] actually from all of the over the place in Europe at that time prices were in some countries still

[08:06] very reasonable but I figured there's plenty of people who have a PIMMOL machine standing at home

[08:14] maybe it's broken or it doesn't work or nobody has played it for over a year or whatever

[08:20] it's being used for a table or a wardrobe or whatever sooner or later they want to get rid of it

[08:28] now some people will put it on eBay or some sort of equal website.

[08:35] Right I was just trying to sell it or something yeah well they will sell it or they will throw it away

[08:41] so a lot of people throw away games in Europe. I'm afraid so. Really? Yeah well

[08:51] basically when I suggested okay why don't we advertise that we are a PIMMOL

[08:55] association and that we if people have a game and they want to get rid of it we come over we

[09:02] collect it we pick it up when we do an event we we make sure we have the games restored

[09:09] and people are welcome to attend the event for free and they can play their own game basically

[09:16] but then it's working again and basically everybody was looking at me like nobody's going to give a

[09:24] PIMMOL machine away. So in three months time we had 40 donations. 40 machines and 30 machines

[09:31] in three months. Wait wait wait how did you advertise this? I mean how did you get the word out

[09:37] to let me because you're not just asking people in the association you were asking you know

[09:42] the whole world in in in in Holland in Belgium or whatever to donate machines right.

[09:50] That's correct actually most games were the natives from people who didn't even know there was an

[09:54] association because the members of our association know the value of a PIMMOL machine some of them

[10:01] are very how do you call it involves in the organization of events and so on and they donated

[10:12] games but that that's just a few. Most people who donated a game had no idea where to go or whatever

[10:20] their value was and we got really very decent games and titles that you really will surprise you

[10:28] well like what what kind of titles did you get? We got a Batman forever we got an Elvira

[10:36] what the scared stiff or the first one the first one the party monsters okay yeah

[10:41] Elvira in the party monsters let me think we got a centaur

[10:49] I've been looking for a centaur for years and I've been able to find one yeah maybe I should

[10:53] try this angle well what I always wondered since I noticed the success it had over here in Holland

[11:02] I figured this good work world wide basically because I know there's many countries where people

[11:09] okay for us collectors PIMMOL machine has some value and for one it has more than for the other

[11:17] but for people who just have one in in their home usually it's the wife that says sooner or later

[11:23] that machine goes out because I'm sick and tired of it and that's basically the angle that we use

[11:31] to to get the attention and but I mean how did you advertise this how did you get the word out

[11:37] what did you newspapers or something or internet or what okay well the newspapers came in the

[11:42] later stage the first thing we did was we put an advertisement on a website which is a sort of

[11:50] eBay but you can also a place add if you are looking for something okay and that website is far

[11:57] more popular over here than eBay actually eBay bought it a few years later and what's what's

[12:05] that website called it's called translate it's called marketplace mark market place or mark

[12:12] place well translate this marketplace and if you spell it basically like it's spelled it's

[12:19] ma rk tpl a ts dot nl okay and we put the ad there not everybody was too happy with that because

[12:34] there were also a lot of people who get their business from picking up free games and they

[12:40] weren't too happy with the idea oh I bet I mean so you had some vendors that were pretty mad at

[12:46] you yeah but then okay so that led to a discussion and basically I said okay I'm not forcing anybody

[12:55] to give their game to us but if people see what we do to the games and they decide to

[13:03] send an email and tell us that we can come over and pick up pick up their game then that's their

[13:09] choice so don't be mad at me right now that's that's a good way to do it and it's interesting so

[13:16] the when you get a game when you collect a game who does the restoration and repair work on it

[13:23] we do that as the association we tried to do it within a group of technicians I have to admit

[13:30] we started in 2004 and right now we really have a wall full of games that we still need to work on

[13:37] because it really was not we couldn't keep up basically because we had the first three months 40

[13:43] games coming in and everything needed work everything needed tweaking so it takes time because after

[13:50] three months we had to stop advertising because we had no more room to store the games so how many

[13:55] machines did you collect in three months first three months 40 games you got 43 pinball machines

[14:04] in three months yeah no 40 pinball machines in three months and right now after three months we

[14:09] stopped advertising but we had an article in the papers people saved the article they cut it from

[14:16] the papers and up till now every month we still have one two sometimes three donations we don't

[14:24] advertise at all there is a page on the on the website of the pinball association but that's it

[14:28] and people still remember from a few years ago that we used to collect pinball machines

[14:35] and by now we have 93 donations and total collection of 118 games oh my god so 118 games that you've

[14:46] gotten using this method no we bought the other 25 with 93 were donated 93 donated you bought 25

[14:55] so now when you guys have a show or something you basically you're all set you've got you've got

[15:01] a whole bunch of machines for everybody to play we got over 50 machines up and running and we are

[15:08] working on many others basically we try to you to do that in the weekends and not every weekend but

[15:16] usually every two or three months we try to pick a date then a bunch of technicians come in

[15:23] and we try to do as much as possible in a day because it's very difficult to get everybody in there

[15:28] and it's a country so people have to travel you know right difficult to get everybody's agenda

[15:36] said that everybody will be there at the same time now the I mean how many members are in the

[15:42] the Dutch pinball association and we have over a thousand family members you're over a thousand

[15:48] that's unbelievable because I mean like over here if we were going to try and have a pinball

[15:54] association just say you know in a in a state or two or five or whatever the size of your country

[16:02] I think it would be difficult to get a thousand people you know that's that's incredible that's

[16:07] a lot of members so out of that a thousand members how many technicians do you have that actually come

[16:13] and work on the machines okay in total say about 20 wow and they have their own specialties

[16:23] some people prefer to work on electron mechanical others on just a solid state

[16:29] wow okay so in the new you got 50 of these games all restored so now do you guys have

[16:34] on tournaments or shows in that are you you know every year or every month or how often do you do

[16:39] that what we recently started is basically we have I think 90% of all the games is stored in one

[16:48] location which we call the funhouse of the Dutch pinball association and over there over 50 games

[16:56] are set up and the rest is basically waiting to be fixed now what now where is this your clubhouse

[17:05] or your funhouse with the games in it I mean do you guys actually own this or do you rent it or

[17:11] we rent it you rent it okay so how much does it cost to join the Dutch pinball association

[17:16] and in your house it's 30 euros a year so 30 euros it's like probably $20 US I would say

[17:27] I think the what the US dollar being very low at the moment I think it's about 40 oh right

[17:33] right I'm sorry I went the wrong way yeah I went the wrong way sorry so that's 40 dollars so

[17:37] that means you got 40 dollars you know from each member times a thousand member yeah that's

[17:44] enough to pay rent isn't it yeah that's pretty good yeah okay but then we also try to organize

[17:49] events basically what we are looking for now is organizing the events actually in the same building

[17:56] as where we have the games stored because the most difficult part of organizing events is the logistics

[18:04] getting the games in the place you rented for the event all right we we used to rent a sports center

[18:14] where we set up 100 games and then we would have the Dutch pinball open every year we used to do

[18:20] smaller events which were on several locations throughout the country but it's more and more

[18:30] become difficult to organize these events actually the events itself it's quite easy once the games

[18:37] are there the difficult part is getting the games there and shipping them afterwards because

[18:45] when we played the finals and there usually we have also some sort of sponsoring raffle

[18:52] when that is over most people go home and then you're there with 20 people and you have 100

[19:00] games and they need to be moved all right and the the venue owner is like okay we close at midnight

[19:10] and it's 6 a 6 p.m so you have six hours to get 100 games out of there and not only out of there but

[19:18] you have to locate bring them somewhere you know basically back to our funhouse or wherever but you

[19:25] also have to unload the truck so that means people are busy to 3 4 a.m. in the night and there's not

[19:32] many people who are willing to do that so that's the biggest problem in our association right now

[19:38] right right well it's so the funhouse isn't big enough to really hold you know the actual

[19:44] event in no no too bad it's not actually we're looking for a new venue bigger because we want to set up

[19:53] more games and we also actually are looking for a location where we actually can have our

[20:01] Dutch people open where we can have at least 200 300 people that's difficult to find right that's

[20:11] the biggest problem over here such locations are very rare to find on the on the market basically

[20:19] hmm now when you when you got when you get these machines all all when you get this clubhouse

[20:27] thing all figured out and when you have the machines already and you've got all your 100 plus

[20:32] machines set up in your new venue then are you going to have like a monthly thing or you're

[20:38] going to do a yearly show or what do you think you'll do then? Well we tried the monthly thing

[20:44] already actually we started with that this year so we had three so far the fourth one is

[20:53] not this week or this month this month we're having a party called the early spring

[21:01] a pimple party which is two days usually the monthly opening was at Friday night and we used to

[21:09] do it at the third Friday night of the month that happens to be the Friday night before the weekend

[21:17] so you figured it makes no sense if we're open two days the next Friday so we're not doing it this

[21:22] Friday or this third Friday of the month because we're open that whole weekend and actually it will

[21:29] be a very interesting event to go to because we will have for the first time in years and

[21:35] uh electoral mechanical competition on the Sunday and there will also be a team competition

[21:45] on the Saturday and both days we also will have a family guy available to play on

[21:52] by courtesy of JVH gaming products which is our main sponsor at the moment. Now when you how did

[22:00] the sponsors do they just provide games when you when you have your events or do they actually

[22:07] provide money too? So far as I'm not into the sponsoring part at all as far as I know most of them

[22:16] provide games okay and we used to work together with Silverstone Pimple Magic which is a sort of Pimple

[22:27] Museum they have about 35 Pimple machines over there we used that location several times for

[22:35] several events including the European Pimple Championship in 2005 and the Dutch Pimple Open in

[22:42] 2006 so we paid the location for a certain uh for for renting the location I think I'm not sure

[22:53] it's not my department but there's also some sort of sponsoring involved I guess. Now of your

[22:59] 100 plus machines are they mostly solid state or they mostly the lecture mechanical?

[23:05] trying to look up the the website I think it's about 50 50 right now I think it's 50 percent about

[23:14] lecture mechanical and 50 percent solid states there's a lot of the elder belly machines

[23:21] and the the solid state once I mean from from the late 70s and the early 80s and then there is a

[23:31] collection of dot matrix games which most of which we bought basically. Now when you were buying

[23:38] games what country were you mostly buying them from? I'm not sure if that's a good thing to mention

[23:44] oh really why is that? We tend to get more games. Oh okay you don't want to you don't want to cut

[23:51] your own throats sort of speak. Well basically most European the the people who really

[24:00] trading big amounts of games already discovered that market and I think it's I suppose

[24:08] to a friend of mine a few weeks ago he told me that in the past two years prices really went

[24:14] up they tripled basically. Right right yeah because there's a lot of guys over here that by containers

[24:22] of games from you know countries in Europe and and bring them in over here you know 70

[24:28] 70 games at a time in a container and you know they're you know they're and I've seen some of the

[24:34] prices they're paying and I was kind of shocked how much how much container games have gone up

[24:40] and and then the stuff coming in too on these containers boy oh man lately some of it hasn't

[24:46] looked that good it's been pretty poor poor condition you know so yeah lots changed in the

[24:52] last few years as far as that stuff goes. I remember when we picked up a bunch of 10 games and

[25:00] and if you would look at their condition I doubt if anybody would have bought them basically.

[25:09] Right right we left a few we had a budget for 10 games and we left out a couple which really were

[25:19] in in 2 bad shape I remember I remember a doctor who with basically the entire mini play field

[25:27] as a a a place in the bag as a puzzle figure out how it works because somebody took it apart

[25:35] and never put it back together so and then you had to hope everything was there so basically

[25:41] there was a game that we left there because we figured like we're not gonna risk that it's incomplete

[25:45] and then how the hell are you going to get your game working. Right right now the when you set up

[25:54] the the the Dutch pinball association is this um I mean how did you do it I mean that say the

[26:01] the Dutch pinball association association for some reason um closed or whatever who would get

[26:07] these hundred games I mean how would you how would you work that is there like do you have some sort

[26:12] of charter set up so that like you know you know the members are like almost like stockholders of

[26:19] the games I mean how how you know or do you guys just don't worry about that um some people

[26:26] worry about that um first I have to mention I'm not one of the founders of the association um it

[26:33] was already there when I got involved but I was involved in in the uh how do you call it

[26:41] the buying of the games basically we have a special commission who goes uh who is about buying

[26:47] games and restoring games and so on and I'm in that commission I see okay um if the association

[26:56] should stop for whatever reason which I don't hope then we really have a problem yeah I'd say

[27:05] yeah and then there's probably people that say that that will say that okay the games are basically

[27:11] um either donated and fixed with money from the association or bought with money from the association

[27:21] so everybody owns them right right yeah and um I think everything would have to be sold and

[27:31] um there would be a refund for for for the members if that would happen right yeah that would

[27:37] probably be fair all right we're going to take a break from our interview with Jonathan

[27:42] Joeston and we'll be right back after this message the pin game journal is a proud sponsor of

[27:48] Topcast it covers pinball like no other publication can the pin game journal is America's only pinball

[27:54] publication whether you're looking for new games or the classics reports on industry shows or

[27:59] collector expos insights on a game you want or features to help you fix the game you've got pin

[28:04] game journals for you their website is at pingamejournal.com all right we're back with Jonathan

[28:11] Joeston now let's talk about the big bang bar um you own a big bang bar right I sure do okay now

[28:19] how did you find out about the big bang bar project I mean because you did not go to pinball

[28:24] expo or yeah I'm sure you didn't go to the Texas pinball festival either which were the two places

[28:30] that that Jean Cunningham announced the availability of big bang bar and there was only I want to say

[28:37] a two month window where you could actually put your deposit in and get the machine how did you

[28:42] find out about it and get involved with that um I think I read it about it on the internet the

[28:48] Dutch forum which we have on the website of the pinball association someone mentioned it or I

[28:54] read it on pinball news could also be I think when I read it on pinball news I already knew and

[29:02] at the when I find out there was only 111 games supposed to be made and I've I knew about

[29:13] big bang bar I read the story and it really was something that I was like if this is ever going to

[29:19] be made then I really want one without even ever playing it or you know um so basically you would

[29:28] never played one before right no okay um I think I tried it once in pin main or what's it called

[29:36] right pin main yeah sure um basically what I did was I I called Jean Cunningham

[29:44] and I talked to him and I got an impression that he was really serious about this and he told me

[29:49] that there was a chance that he had so many requests then he would see if he would make more than

[29:58] 111 and when it turned out he did I signed up right away and I had no problem in paying half

[30:09] upfront so I as soon as possible I sending my check basically now the the European games of course

[30:19] were delivered uh I'll turn the summer of 2006 because they needed they needed to be delivered

[30:26] to be the the led the led solder law or the led I forget what the name of the law is you were you

[30:33] probably know arrow hs right right and so you got your machine you've had your machine almost a

[30:41] year now right yes and um I'm proud to say I was the first one to actually have it were you

[30:49] surprised I mean was there any the gene contact you ahead of time or anything or is it just like

[30:54] the shipping company knocked on your door and said hey we got a package for you um that's what

[30:59] happened with most members or buyers who bought one um actually I was uh I heard uh earlier I had

[31:08] email contact with uh Kim Carter um gene's daughter and um right at Illinois Pitball yes and she sent

[31:18] me uh um she sent me an email and she asked if my address still was correct and I was like why

[31:25] what are you going to send me and then I got an email back saying that it's strictly confidential

[31:33] that the Big Bang bars were already on their way to Europe but nobody was supposed to know because

[31:38] we uh or they didn't want to uh have they could foresee a flame war on on news groups and so on

[31:47] for delivering the Big Bang bars to Europe and well the Americans one were not made I guess it was

[31:53] something like that but they had a very good reason um because uh after July 1st it would be very

[31:59] difficult to get the games into Europe so um I was uh I think I was one of the first to know um basically

[32:10] I tried to um organize shipping for um once the games were delivered in Holland because I was

[32:23] fit I was to figure out are they going to uh somewhere in a warehouse in the in in the harbor where

[32:30] they would arrive or are they being transported somewhere can we pick them up whatever I was trying

[32:35] to figure that out and I think two weeks later I got a call from a um company who is uh was supposed

[32:44] to deliver the uh game at my doorstep and I was like okay can I come over and pick it up

[32:50] and that was okay too as long as I paid for the transport um while picking it up um so we picked

[32:57] it up the next day and now when you got the game home um how was it well packaged did they do a nice

[33:05] job they did an excellent job really okay and they had it they had a you know a custom box made

[33:11] and everything huh yeah okay and when you set the game up I mean have you ever set up a new stern

[33:18] no okay I was kind of curious if how like a new stern was packaged compared to you know

[33:25] jeans big bang bar I was kind of curious you know if they were used the same you know I don't

[33:30] know same packaging technique or whatever um but so how has you been playing the game for almost a

[33:36] year now how do you like it um I think I still think it's a great game really um fun part is

[33:44] when the game arrived I was um having I had a deadline for my spin our magazine and so when the

[33:53] game arrived I didn't even unpack it because I continued with my magazine because it had to go to

[33:59] the printer and I think I I impacted a day later or something like that it was standing in the middle

[34:06] of my living room um but okay at the end I was like okay let's let unpack this thing you know

[34:13] so um but the the strange thing was I wasn't supposed to share it with anyone because

[34:22] everybody who got their big bang bar got the the request to keep it silent because um

[34:28] um a little bit pimble um didn't want any negative reactions and so on you know you can understand

[34:36] probably sure yeah um yeah because we're still waiting for ours over here in the in the United

[34:42] States no one got one yeah okay and you don't have to wait much longer I have this feeling so um

[34:48] because what I understood is um I think most games are ready and some people already got their

[34:55] letter to come over and pick it up or something like that I'm not sure I'm trying to follow it but

[35:02] I don't have the time to to look at it daily so right um sorry where was I well the how was the

[35:12] game held up over the last year I mean how much have you played it how many plays have you put on

[35:17] it and you know is it holding up like you would would hope it is yes absolutely yeah first of all

[35:24] first thing I have to say um when I picked it up um we had to I was with another buyer we went

[35:33] together um we had eight games located in that warehouse for Belgium and the Netherlands no seven

[35:44] sorry um we had to pick up two and some extra parts um and we had a problem

[35:52] uh fitting them into the van so we had to unpack one of the games else we couldn't take both

[35:58] with us um so we unpacked the game outside it was uh clear sunny weather and when you unpack the game

[36:09] like that really everybody it's just uh it tracks some it tracks some attention uh it's drop

[36:17] that gorgeous especially in in bright sunlight it's like whoa you know um I mean artwork and

[36:25] and so on I I had seen Big Bang Bar when I was at Illinois Pimble and because jeans machine was

[36:31] over there but it just looks like like so amazing um so brand new based and I know jeans quality

[36:40] control and he really didn't let me down he really delivered a class games can't say anything else

[36:48] um and my game is holding up very well I had a few minor issues um basically tweaking issues

[36:57] um so you set up the game and you have to tweak uh some some things I think there was one connector

[37:04] which was uh saw that the wrong way um but I wasn't able to uh to fix that myself and basically

[37:11] that's it um I checked last month and I think I put about 300 games on it right now that's not much

[37:20] um and Big Bang Bar has the option to buy in extra balls um I think I played over

[37:27] 1200 balls in total now you also um went to Illinois Pimble at some point and helped make

[37:37] the Big Bang bars right correct now tell me about that and how you got involved with that and what

[37:42] you did there and give me the whole story um well basically when I called Gene um and asked if I

[37:50] could buy a Big Bang bar I said I also wanted to be part of the production if possible and

[37:56] and so we talked about it and he said well if you want to come on over

[38:00] that's okay so we uh agreed on some some terms for that and uh he arranged for me a place where

[38:09] I could stay and um I was like building that game would be such an adventure so basically I took off

[38:18] one month and I went over for a month um at that time they were supposed to be building

[38:25] the games already um when I got there turned out um they weren't they had to wait on the play

[38:32] fields and cabinets weren't there yet and there were a lot of issues with um material that was

[38:37] produced in the wrong way or whatever so what I did was um pre-production basically um so you have

[38:44] to think of um putting the right skirts on the pop bumpers and um all that kind of stuff um

[38:52] um yeah make the assemblies yes exactly also keep in mind uh all switches are handmade so uh these

[39:01] have to be made um oh you mean the switches have to be have to actually be physically mounted to

[39:06] like a mounting bracket and then in I don't know did the diodes have to be added to the switches

[39:11] and stuff like that yeah okay so you were doing all that kind of work yeah yeah that's great

[39:17] as the grunt work okay well still um I was happy I was there because gene has amazing stories to tell

[39:26] and um when you know the um of course I check the news groups and it's very easy to to um

[39:37] I've read a lot of flame stories uh towards gene and so on um but when you hear his side then you

[39:44] completely understand why it takes sometimes so much time before something is uh produced

[39:51] so um for me I was very happy to um to have that experience um gene Georgiana came the whole family

[39:59] there's such a bunch of really nice people I think probably the nicest people I ever met ever

[40:07] and um I really wish them well you know um I had no idea what to expect

[40:14] I was already happy that it could come over um and then you're um basically when when you

[40:20] you're working that a first day in that warehouse it's like uh you're just a kid in a in a

[40:25] candy factory basically wow so were you working in Chicago or were you working at genes actual

[40:34] genes on genes property no genes property genes property and he has a he had a big warehouse

[40:39] setup with all the parts and like a little assembly line and everything yeah well the assembly line

[40:44] wasn't there yet uh they actually they were setting that up um so I saw the progress in that and um

[40:52] people have no idea how much time uh has been put into that project um working 12 hours a day is

[41:02] normal for those people over there and uh over here in Holland eight hours is regular I'm not sure

[41:07] what it is in in the US but yeah eight hours is a standard work day here okay people over there

[41:13] work 12 days an hour I'm not sure if they still do that but when I was there everybody was working

[41:19] 12 days an hour you know so they started eight and they finished at eight right right and uh

[41:28] and so when you were doing this um you know when you go home at night were you just like

[41:34] wore out no no no no no it was great fun being there um uh it's such a warm family and um

[41:47] I spent a lot of time with uh Kim who is uh uh uh gene's daughter uh with uh lots of fun you know um

[41:56] so how many other people did anybody else go with you um someone else went with me I'm not sure if I

[42:02] can reveal who it was because and nobody else knows okay uh but it was uh one other guy but he

[42:10] didn't order a big bang bar oh he just wanted to go over and do this yes that's crazy man

[42:17] well but you guys man you take a month off work to go build pinball machine parts okay well think

[42:24] of well okay uh when we uh I had no idea it was just a parts first of all but it wasn't a wonderful

[42:31] experience and I uh if I wouldn't know any uh what I do it again right away what do you think now

[42:40] gene's talking about making kingpin you know the other Capcom game what what what what do you think

[42:46] about that um what I understood is I use not actually making it himself um but there is a third party

[42:54] involved and they want to build it um if the game gets produced I think that's uh good basically

[43:03] are are you gonna buy one down it yeah my my problem with the kingpin is it's a lot more expensive

[43:12] you know it's it's um you know the big bang bar was $4,500 to me that that seemed really

[43:18] reasonable um but the kingpin is like seven thousand I want to say or seventy five hundred it's

[43:25] it's a lot more expensive um you know and it gets uh it's it's priced me out of the market it

[43:33] I'm not comfortable spending that much money you know on a pinball on a pinball game it just seems

[43:39] like a lot of money it is a lot of money um in the end it's probably worth it yeah maybe there's a

[43:46] lot of risk though um especially with the kingpin because uh you know with big bang bar you know gene

[43:53] had all these extra parts um you know that he bought surplus from Capcom but he used them all up

[44:02] but you know I mean he didn't have everything obviously but he but he he did have a lot and he

[44:06] used them all up uh you know I'm the big bang bar so now with kingpin he's gonna be starting from

[44:12] basically from nothing um you know he's got to make everything I don't think he has any boards

[44:17] any board sets I think the board said is the main problem the rest is yeah he's not a problem the

[44:22] rest is gonna have to have the board sets all all remade um and it just seems like it's gonna be

[44:29] uh a lot more of a time commitment um on the kingpin than it would be on the big bang bar that's

[44:35] just the way it appears to me I whether that's true or not I don't know but that's just the way it looks

[44:40] you know um I and what I understood the the company that is uh supposed to be doing kingpin already

[44:48] did some work for big bang bar um so I'm pretty confident that they can do it once they have the board

[44:54] set so the board set probably is the the um the big issue um and I know what the problem is with

[45:03] the board set because it all depends on on one chip basically if they can't produce that chip then

[45:09] they have a problem or they need to find a workaround you mean it's a custom chip yes right right

[45:15] and that's on the CPU board right um I have no idea where it is actually okay yeah yeah I think

[45:23] that is uh I think that is a major problem but um it'll be interesting to see yeah everything can

[45:29] be solved and everything the the the should art is a workaround but um obviously it will cost money to

[45:35] create such a workaround and you can uh obviously money can buy everything but

[45:41] general release it's spent so much money on big bang bar um it would be great if the games would be made

[45:52] I'm just not buying one because I'm not for me big bang bar was really uh almost a magical game

[45:59] uh game the the whole myth around it you know that was a great story I don't have that with kingpin

[46:06] right right and is did did owning the big bang bar is it met all your expectations

[46:15] yeah it has yes so the myths the myths are true the stories are true

[46:22] um well depends on the stories you heard of course um basically I was told by people who

[46:28] played big bang bar and they said well um

[46:34] uh game wise it's a nice game but it's not that difficult right yeah that's what I've heard too

[46:42] okay which is not a problem because not I'm not a good player so um it will take me at least 10

[46:49] balls to get to to the final uh mode basically right you mean you keep buying in yeah

[46:57] and uh or uh well pinball all you need is one good ball basically so you um sure you can do it in one

[47:05] ball and if you if you're really good several times probably um I'm just not that good

[47:11] right I checked on my big bang bar I think I have an average ball time of one minute and 13 seconds

[47:18] and that's not only uh not not uh all my games alone but also from the other people who played it

[47:26] it's a very fast game I can't say anything else and um but it's it's still fun um uh I don't get

[47:34] tired of it and um I can name you plenty of tippinball machines I grew tired on pretty fast

[47:41] so um but I'm not going to do that haha good for you all right what do you have any other

[47:47] any other little interesting uh tidbits to kind of or you know any other stories to add um

[47:54] well um stories probably plenty but um come think of anything uh right now basically what I

[48:00] already said um very uh grateful to Jean for giving me the the opportunity to at least be in

[48:08] some way be a part of big bang bar story even though it was a very tiny part but still um I

[48:16] enjoyed being there and it was a great experience was also my first time uh going to America

[48:22] so um I enjoyed it very much now for the time now where did you stay when you when you were there

[48:31] where where where did where did you live um jeans arranged housing for me okay did that did that

[48:39] cost you money or did you know did jean do that free or um no I didn't have to pay for staying

[48:49] okay okay so so it wasn't too bad then I mean it so this trip wasn't too expensive or was

[48:56] pretty expensive um that depends on your definition of expensive probably yeah um no I think in total

[49:06] traveling and and so on I think for me I could afford it basically and so it wasn't that

[49:13] expensive I feel couldn't afford it then it would be expensive because you need the money

[49:17] for for other purposes so looking back on it what are you glad that you did it

[49:22] absolutely yes it was uh something that I'm uh wouldn't want to have missed basically

[49:30] wow is that um um it's time to bid romantic now but um I really had a great time

[49:38] and um it um I've been thinking of um looking into the possibilities of starting a European

[49:46] pinball factory um one of the reasons to go to jean was also to see how much work is involved

[49:51] in producing pinballs um and it helped me to to get an idea how much work is needed and

[50:02] everything probably that can go wrong will go wrong uh if you don't have the proper people to work with

[50:10] and I've seen that happen too um so I'm still thinking about the possibilities for a European pinball

[50:22] factory but now what would you make your own uh custom games you know your own games or would

[50:28] you like remake something no I um I think if it would ever get to that point um I think we would

[50:38] build new games new designs um um based on our own uh hardware system everything everything new

[50:48] right right okay well cool Jonathan I really appreciate the time and I appreciate you let me

[50:55] call you up and not talk about this stuff no you're very welcome um uh perhaps to explain to the

[51:01] people why I am are we calling in the first place um I heard a few um uh top cast from the past

[51:10] and big one was a recurrent item every time uh or in the podcast that I listen to so um

[51:19] tinshure so curious about that I figured okay I have one I can tell you some stories if you want to

[51:24] hear them uh it's great I appreciate the urine from yana and and I think you know I I think it

[51:31] was I think it's really good too because there are people who are over here are waiting very

[51:36] patiently to get theirs and you know the uh it was kind of a big tease that the people in Europe

[51:42] got theirs first it was almost like you know you wish you know that we had that led law too

[51:49] yeah okay but then there really would be a problem yeah I know I know no trust me you don't want that

[51:56] law um but um for me okay um I still follow the the the the big bang bar forum um I can understand

[52:06] people getting impatient because they are waiting so long trust me folks it's worth weight the wild

[52:13] right oh that's cool yeah I mean it's it's you know it's uh you know supposed to be available

[52:21] either sometimes this month or sometime next you know in in April or May you know I think uh you

[52:27] know we'll all have ours and then you know we'll be telling stories you know so um basically I

[52:35] am what happened over here um I don't want to spoil it for anybody over there but basically what

[52:41] happened over here was like there was a bunch of people who uh were saying the game would never be

[52:48] made um I couldn't tell anyone the game already arrived and I even had people asking so how's the

[52:55] big bang bar project coming on you know uh any news no you could say anything I wouldn't

[53:00] sit in your living room no actually I had it um at that time before um it was leaked that the

[53:09] games were delivered to Europe there was um I think it was uh two weeks in between and I had people

[53:16] over and I stored it in in in my bedroom um and people were in my living room which is next to my

[53:22] bedroom asking so how's big bang bar coming along and I'm like well it's pretty okay I'm very

[53:26] confident that the game people get here you know not not able to tell that it already arrived you know

[53:34] so who was the person that got the word out that the games were in fact in Europe um I don't know

[53:41] who it was I heard a story from Martin Weast um some uh there was one game uh going to Austria I

[53:51] believe I'm not sure uh anyways it was one of the German or Austrian games one of those people

[54:01] everybody got a notification that they were not supposed to tell anyone that the games had arrived

[54:07] and one of the guys just threw a party and one of his visitors basically put on a forum that

[54:16] the big bang bar games had arrived okay and it took two weeks uh it took two weeks before the

[54:24] word got out on the internet yes and actually it took two weeks after I picked up my game but it

[54:33] took a full week before the games were delivered to uh Germany I believe and from then it was

[54:39] just one week well okay yeah people can't keep quiet about it I guess um well I don't know I wasn't

[54:47] there I um I don't know what people motivated um because they tried to blame it on Martin Weast at

[54:55] the first place um I heard some stories about it I don't know how that happened okay so finally

[55:01] the word got out and uh I had contact with uh Kim and she said okay we're not gonna lie about this

[55:08] we're just gonna be upfront people okay this is uh we did it and this is why we did it and

[55:15] um as I expected um there was nothing but um how do you call it people understood the situation

[55:24] yeah I think people were we're just glad that you know it was a sign of things to come

[55:30] yeah absolutely and in a way I think it's even even is good for the project um because of

[55:37] the games being delivered okay imagine they were not the uh delivered and

[55:44] people waiting for their games um two years um you can't keep them happy with just a few photos

[55:51] every now and then you know so uh when the European games got delivered people really had something

[55:57] to look out for because the games were made they really played excellence still still do by the way

[56:03] and um everybody basically was um um uh who got their games were very very enthusiastic

[56:12] so that that really uh gave people something to look forward to and um I know it's taken another year

[56:20] basically um but what's a year in a lifetime anyway you know and besides that if you go on vacation

[56:31] the most fun usually is the fun you have up front because when you get there the food is not good

[56:38] or uh you have loud neighbors yeah the anticipation as they call it yeah okay exactly sorry for my

[56:44] English I'm trying to know no you do great with your English yes anticipation that's more fun than the

[56:50] actual deliver well okay well with Big Bang Bar my um uh I think I think that the people will

[56:58] miss their anticipation they will be happy that they get their games um but um they will miss it

[57:04] because in a way it is um looking out for something good you know that that's also a good feeling

[57:13] right um I understand sometimes people want to know more and I study communication so I can

[57:21] understand that very well um it's uh it will save a lot of trouble if people take the time to

[57:27] inform everybody um but I also understand how busy people are at Illinois Pimble to produce those

[57:35] games um so they're not uh uh rather than um uh check the forum every five minutes to see if

[57:44] someone he has a uh a question they rather build the games right right and I hope people can

[57:52] understand it no I I did they do I did they do all right Jonathan hey thanks again I appreciate

[57:57] it I appreciate it I appreciate the update on the on the Big Bang Bar is great yeah okay and

[58:02] hey and good luck with uh the Dutch Pimble Association too it sounds like you're sounds like you're

[58:07] really moving wrong well with that you know that's great with us especially with those donation

[58:12] games man that's yeah well we still have a lot of work to do because there's over 50 games waiting

[58:17] to be restored you know right right and um if there's one thing that we don't like to do is some

[58:24] people say just put them on fire or chop them up or whatever you know and that's like no because I

[58:32] still have the feeling if I look at such an old game you know like like um even a honey which is

[58:38] not considered a very valuable game it still has a some sort of history in it you know sure sure

[58:44] so I um yeah I mean you got them I mean you you know like you said you got a lot of members you

[58:50] got you got time you know just take your time and you know get them done what you can get them done

[58:55] uh basically that's what we're doing and uh we appreciate all the help from the technicians that

[59:00] we get right and we're very very grateful to them as well because without them it would be even

[59:06] harder to get all the games working you know so um so I want to say a big thank you to to all those

[59:12] people involved in the project um also people involved in the in the Dutch Bimble Association

[59:19] because it's a small group of people making a lot of fun for a lot of other people possible

[59:26] again I'd like to thank Jonathan Joseph and for coming on to Topcast to talk into us today

[59:30] about the Big Bang Bar Project and uh and his Dutch Bimble Association in Devers thank you again Jonathan
