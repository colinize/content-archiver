[00:00] You pass through this door into the realm of Shaggy and Norton.

[00:07] Beyond it is another dimension.

[00:09] You're moving into their world, a pinball and arcade games.

[00:14] Both EM and Solid State.

[00:16] You have just crossed over into the Topcast Zone.

[00:20] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinball's online radio.

[00:30] Flash Topcast.

[00:41] Welcome to Topcast tonight.

[00:43] We're going to be speaking with a guy that's a pinball book author from Australia.

[00:48] He's written three books called the Pinball Compendiums Volume 1, which is a pinball game

[00:55] from 1930s to 1960s.

[00:58] Volume 2 from 1970 to 1981.

[01:01] Volume 3 from 1982 to 2005.

[01:04] So we're going to give him a call right now.

[01:14] Give Michael Shaloop from Australia a call on the phone right now.

[01:21] Michael, can you hear me okay?

[01:35] Michael, I can hear you.

[01:37] So we got Michael Shaloop on the line.

[01:40] Michael, what part of Australia are you from?

[01:43] Sydney.

[01:44] You're in Sydney.

[01:45] Probably 20 minutes south of Sydney.

[01:48] Okay.

[01:49] And you've done the three volumes of the pinball compendium, what the 1930s to 1960s, the 1970s

[01:58] to 1981 and then 1982 to 2005.

[02:02] That's right.

[02:04] Those are your babies right?

[02:06] They're my babies' babies' babies.

[02:07] Yeah.

[02:08] Tell me about those books.

[02:09] What made you decide to do this?

[02:12] You've been in pinball for a long time, right?

[02:15] You were born in 1962.

[02:17] You're like the same age as me.

[02:19] And you got into pinball pretty early, right?

[02:22] Well, I started playing, you know, the first recollection of pinball machine was back

[02:28] when I was probably six years old.

[02:30] And the first machine I played was cupidol.

[02:32] And that's when my fascination started for the syllable.

[02:38] You asked about the books and why I wrote them.

[02:42] The one thing that I think was lacking in a lot of books is not many pay tribute to the

[02:48] people behind the scenes like the designers and the artists.

[02:52] The only book that really come close was a book, probably one of my favorites by Roger

[02:56] Sharp called Pinball.

[02:58] And I just saw with my books, I'll just take it one step further and actually interview

[03:04] everyone that I can that has worked and been involved in the industry.

[03:08] Yeah, we just had Roger Sharp on the show.

[03:12] We interviewed him just a couple days ago.

[03:15] And yeah, that book is incredible, but it's really hard to find.

[03:20] Well, what he done, and I just wish I was around when he was around, because I think

[03:25] that was just, his book just, well, I have enough a lot of doaways for me, because it

[03:30] just really inspired me to do what I ended up doing by with you all this people play.

[03:34] So you've got like 300 games in your collection?

[03:37] Yeah, it's close to 300, but the men that's got the biggest collections, probably my friend

[03:43] Alan's, hey, he's got close to 2000.

[03:45] Yeah, we talked to Lee Fedwick, of course, whose help in Alan, open up the Australian

[03:54] down under Pinball Museum, right?

[03:55] Yes, that's correct.

[03:57] And you're working with him too?

[03:59] Oh, it's like I'm helping cohort mate, it leaves the person that does all the restorations

[04:05] in that.

[04:06] Lee and Alan are under, yeah, we're the ones that picked the games out.

[04:11] So it's a big thing, we've been, there's been something that's been in the planning for

[04:16] many years, and slowly it's all coming together.

[04:20] Is, yeah, you guys have property purchased, right?

[04:23] Well, he's bought the property, but I think he's trying to look now, actually getting

[04:28] somewhere that's more, a bit closer to where the theme parks are.

[04:32] I'm not really sure, he's had that, as we speak now, he's having meetings with different

[04:40] people to try and get a better location.

[04:42] And once that's established, well then the building will go up and hopefully the dream

[04:48] will become a reality.

[04:49] And now are there going to be some of your machines in there too, or just all Alan's?

[04:53] Yeah, yeah, it'll be, yeah, but at the end of the day, quite even, when I went to your

[04:57] house, you've probably got a mini museum in your basement.

[05:02] But at the end of the day, how many machines can you really set up and enjoy?

[05:06] So I've come to the conclusion that look, I can have maybe 20 machines set up at my

[05:12] house.

[05:13] Now the unfortunate thing with in Australia is we don't have tornadoes and cyclones,

[05:17] and that's where we don't have any basement.

[05:19] So there's no houses here that have got basement.

[05:22] So we're very limited to where, and how many machines we can actually put in our houses.

[05:27] Is that because the water level is too high and you dig down, you hit water or why no

[05:32] basement?

[05:33] Yeah, we get nothing, but it's like we have to get in, you're right there in Sydney,

[05:36] but we don't get snow, we don't get anything.

[05:38] So all you listen to is the beautiful part of the world come down and visit this one,

[05:42] but you know, fantastic.

[05:43] I'm going to come visit and knock on your door.

[05:45] Because that you might say welcome, buddy.

[05:47] Yeah.

[05:48] The thing is, it's for him.

[05:49] So a few years ago, when I met Alan, I've met Alan for many years, but my guy had

[05:55] mischrains.

[05:56] I remember one of my babies was a 1952 cyclist, with the animated background for the baseball

[06:02] one, and I loved that machine.

[06:04] And look, I even mornocked out.

[06:07] A minigame.

[06:08] A lot of machines that Alan didn't have, and I think it looked, and these are machines

[06:13] really that you should go to a museum.

[06:14] They should be free for them to enjoy.

[06:16] So you're talking about the 1952 Williams pinball slug fast.

[06:20] Yeah.

[06:21] It's a pinball machine.

[06:22] Yeah, but it's got the running man unit.

[06:25] Yeah.

[06:26] With the guys going around the bases.

[06:27] One of my favorite games.

[06:28] How popular?

[06:29] And another one of my favorites in that area was the Silver Skates.

[06:32] The Williams 53 Silver Skates.

[06:34] Right.

[06:35] How popular is baseball, though American baseball, in Australia?

[06:40] Well, what makes it popular is the, well, it was a machine that never looked, that's

[06:46] a machine that I'd go out from the States.

[06:48] Oh, okay.

[06:49] That machine, that could be the only one here.

[06:52] I don't know of any other slight person, Australia.

[06:56] Gotcha.

[06:57] Yeah, and baseball, baseball as a sport is not big in Sydney or in Australia.

[07:03] But the fact that he's a pinball machine that's got back-line animation, especially baseball.

[07:11] Yeah, baseball's were popular in the 60s and the 70s and we said them, but we're talking

[07:18] about more of the 60s, more like a grand slam, 64 grand slam.

[07:21] And that was a few of those around.

[07:23] But none of the early machines ever come to Australia.

[07:29] There wasn't like good distributors there that would bring in stuff in at that, you know,

[07:33] in the 50s and 60s.

[07:34] Not in the early days.

[07:35] So, Godly, Godly, but even late 60s, it was all Godly.

[07:40] Sydney and Australia was all Godly.

[07:43] But distributors, I think Godly had the whole world market and they had distributors

[07:49] alive at the place.

[07:50] But most of the machines in Australia were Godly machines.

[07:53] Okay.

[07:54] So, now, most of your machines then you bought in the States and then you had to import

[07:59] them into Australia?

[08:00] Yes.

[08:01] Now, what are you going to do about the voltage conversion, you know, the 120 volts versus

[08:07] 220 volts?

[08:09] Okay.

[08:10] What we do is we use a, it's called a step down transformer.

[08:16] That steps the voltage from 240 to 110.

[08:22] And that's what the engine machines worked on in the States at 110.

[08:28] All machines up until I think 60, 64, but Bailey had a multi transformer that could be

[08:36] tapped for 240 end 110.

[08:37] Now, I think machines from 65, 66, I think Bandwagon was one of the first to use this transformer.

[08:45] All four was another one that we can just tap into it.

[08:49] But Godly's up until the sevens, we've got to put down a step down transformer.

[08:53] I got you.

[08:54] Okay.

[08:55] Cool.

[08:56] Well, let's talk about your books some more.

[08:57] Like, I noticed most of the pictures in, I got in front of me, I have the 1930s and

[09:03] 1960s one.

[09:04] Great book too.

[09:05] I mean, all color, 100% color.

[09:09] And great pictures.

[09:10] But it seems like most of the pictures are your games and Allens games, right?

[09:15] Yes.

[09:16] Yes, all the games, those games, probably three collectors in Australia, Alan Tate, myself

[09:23] and another gentleman, Jason Douglas.

[09:26] I didn't want to, there's I think only two machines of memory that I had to get fired

[09:32] is because the machines were actually buried, we couldn't get fired.

[09:35] I think that was Minstrel Mann and instrument, it may be knockout.

[09:40] Okay.

[09:41] So how long did it take you to put this book together?

[09:44] Well, all the, initially, when I started writing the book, I was just going to write

[09:53] one book on pin more machines and depending on the information I'd gathered, I thought

[09:59] I can't take the, the published, I said, look, we, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

[10:03] maybe going to be two volumes and then we had to do it again into three volumes.

[10:07] So the overall things, probably, and five, six years in my life.

[10:12] Really?

[10:13] Wow.

[10:14] And I noticed that I, I believe the, the distributor, the, what, the Schaefer publishing

[10:20] or whatever, they were kind of required you to put prices on everything.

[10:23] Is that, is that why there's prices on everything?

[10:26] Yes, quite yes.

[10:28] They, they like that.

[10:29] They like to turn everything kind of into a pseudo price guy, right?

[10:32] Well, they, look, I was, look, that was just, look, that's an area that I think looked,

[10:37] and at the end of the day, and this is something that I wrote about this in every three

[10:40] book, what it is a pin more machine work.

[10:42] And so many of pin more machines work what someone's ruined the pay for it.

[10:46] Right.

[10:47] Yeah, of course.

[10:48] You might, you might have a knockout.

[10:49] Well, what's that work?

[10:50] You might look at a, a prize guy to, what a Larry's or, or, they in a particular prize

[10:57] guy, well, they might only put, it's only worth a thousand dollars.

[10:59] But then you might want four thousand for you.

[11:02] So it's probably only give you four thousand.

[11:05] Well, that's what it's worth.

[11:06] Right, right, right.

[11:08] Yeah, it's a great book.

[11:09] I mean, because you also have a lot of factory photos in there and a lot of, like a lot

[11:13] of pictures of the designers.

[11:16] You know, I mean, it's, it's really, really a nice book.

[11:19] I mean, you really did, really did a great job on it.

[11:23] You know, I mean, did you have fun making it?

[11:26] Well, a lot of fun, quite.

[11:28] But the most fun was actually meeting the people at the time.

[11:32] And that's why I've, yeah, for the last, you know, I've been going to the States since

[11:35] 2000.

[11:36] And I go to meet the people that's like, you know, I tend to pimp or expel over a year,

[11:41] it's like a family get together.

[11:43] And over the years, and maybe a year, quite a lot of time over the years.

[11:46] And I think you're doing a fantastic job, even with your videos and your talks.

[11:51] And, and now this is just fantastic.

[11:54] I hope you come back to Pimple Dream a lot because you bring in regenerating an interest

[11:59] in this fantastic game that I know billions of people around the world have enjoyed.

[12:05] I hope you come back and visit me in the fall again for the next expo because I should

[12:09] have things a little more jelled.

[12:12] You know, I got like 100 machines in my basement, but I didn't have, you know, when you guys

[12:16] came, it was a little bit of an disarray.

[12:20] Disarray, I would like to, you know, when next time you guys come, you're, are you going

[12:23] to expel again in the fall?

[12:24] Yes, yes, I look, yes.

[12:25] Are you going to be taking it and becoming a little more emboggling walking into your

[12:31] basement?

[12:32] I couldn't believe some of that maintenance.

[12:34] If ever you want to donate any of those pleases to the museum, they're clever.

[12:38] It would be more than ever to take them off your hands.

[12:40] I love it, how you see that.

[12:42] Yeah, I'm sure you can.

[12:44] And those bowling games are fantastic.

[12:48] Yeah, I get America's the place, so that's where Pimple's here.

[12:52] Pimple Capital, the world Chicago, and it's just been a dream, even as a kid, I remember

[13:02] playing a Pimple machine called Target, pulled it with a 69.

[13:07] Yeah, got me, got me.

[13:09] Right.

[13:10] I remember playing it, I remember coming home and I got, and my uncle was a carpenter,

[13:15] so we had all this bits of timber at home, so I got a bit of a board, and I remember

[13:19] getting the nails, like I put them, and I set it out, and I put them in the middle,

[13:24] where the target's well, I actually put little nails in, I got two little pegs, and then

[13:28] as I was playing it, this thought, what you had come to me, I wonder who designed this

[13:33] game.

[13:34] I must have only been maybe 10 years old, and well, when I done this, when I made this

[13:40] little Pimple machine at home, and who would have thought that many years later I'd have

[13:46] been privileged to get to know the disorder of that machine at Khrinsky, and I mean,

[13:51] over the years, I've really got to know Lina, who's house, and her family, and it was

[13:58] just an honor, and it's like a dream come true, and people often say to me, what's your

[14:04] highlight?

[14:05] What's your highlight?

[14:06] I do it all these books, I often say, one of them was reading play Harrel, of course.

[14:10] Oh, yeah, of course.

[14:12] But the one that really, I really feel most honored in doing, and something that's very,

[14:21] you know, someone's getting emotional about it, the one thing is seeing, actually I was

[14:26] the one that inducted at Khrinsky in the Pimple Hall of Fame.

[14:29] Oh, you convinced Peasack and Burke that that was the right thing to do?

[14:33] Well, this man worked, actually I've got to get on to Dena, and to all you, the

[14:38] listeners of the Australia, Ed Khrinsky designed a lot of games, he still doesn't get credit

[14:43] for.

[14:44] I don't know if people are aware that he worked at Keeney in the 58 to 64.

[14:50] He was at Keeney, so all the machines that were manufactured by Keeney, like machines,

[14:56] like Doe Carth, a few of others, but he designed all those.

[15:02] Okay.

[15:03] Now Keeney went out though, like in the 60s, right?

[15:08] Well, look at it, when Khrinsky left, because he was the sole designer at Keeney, when he

[15:14] went to Gottlieb, Keeney was out of business.

[15:16] Right.

[15:17] They may have longer had a Pimple of his honor.

[15:20] Right.

[15:21] Yeah, I mean, when Khrinsky went to Gottlieb in 64, that's when Pimple stopped at Keeney.

[15:26] Right.

[15:27] Right.

[15:28] Well, so what is your favorite era?

[15:30] I mean, do you like games on the 50s or 60s and newer stuff?

[15:34] What's your favorite era?

[15:35] Oh, quite a hub.

[15:36] I love every year.

[15:38] There's part of me.

[15:40] I love playing the old 50s machines.

[15:45] I love Queen of Hearts.

[15:47] I love the 50s, but I love the 60s as well.

[15:50] I love King's and Queen's Buckaroo.

[15:52] I geese, litching.

[15:53] I love those.

[15:54] But I love the 70s as well.

[15:57] I love King Pinel de Rato, Jacob Hagar, something, Jake.

[16:01] But the 80s, I'm not very keen on the 80s, but I love the 90s as well.

[16:08] You see, I'm just like you, this is amazing because I tell people that my favorite

[16:13] era is the 50s, playing the Woodrails.

[16:16] Even though I wasn't even born in the 50s, and I have no recollection of ever playing

[16:22] a Woodrail, you know, any time in the last five years was probably the earliest I ever

[16:30] played a Woodrail, but I think they're just what they did with them.

[16:33] They're so cool.

[16:35] The artwork and they did so much with so little and they're great games.

[16:40] I mean, strategically from a gameplay perspective, they're really great games.

[16:46] And I like the 60s stuff too.

[16:48] 70s stuff.

[16:49] Yeah, it's okay.

[16:50] 80s stuff.

[16:51] I really care for much at all.

[16:53] And then again, I start liking it again in the 90s.

[16:55] So I'm pretty much just like you.

[16:57] Yeah, which is cool.

[16:59] I mean, I've been going through my Woodrails.

[17:03] I've got a whole slew on them.

[17:06] I'm trying to get them all juke up for you when you come in the fall.

[17:10] So they'll all be ready for you.

[17:11] So you can play them.

[17:12] Oh, thank you.

[17:13] I've got to have a couple of it.

[17:14] Actually, you're very good on your bowling machine.

[17:16] That's a...

[17:17] Yeah.

[17:19] Now, do you have any bowling machines?

[17:21] I don't.

[17:22] Alan's got a few.

[17:23] They just, they just again take up a lot of room.

[17:26] Yeah, they're sure good.

[17:27] But they just look, I love all games.

[17:29] I love, I love the gun games.

[17:31] I love all types of arcade games.

[17:36] I'm just...

[17:37] And that's...

[17:38] I love the wood in here.

[17:39] So that's why it's...

[17:40] Look, I had a couple of very rare gun games, which Alan's got on there.

[17:48] Even the Chicago, all my cranes and that balance there, all at Alan's now.

[17:54] And this is all for the museum.

[17:55] It's all worth, hopefully.

[17:56] And they'd all be working and probably will have one of the biggest collections in the world.

[18:00] There'll be great times in that up and that time, and I'm really looking forward to doing, you know.

[18:06] Do you really think you can get 800 machines?

[18:08] You know, I mean, I read your kind of your web thing,

[18:13] and it said that you were talking about 800 machines at the museum.

[18:18] Is that cool?

[18:19] Well, I know Alan's got over 15, 150,000 games, including mine.

[18:26] So, yes, imagine that Clay, imagine close to 2,000 the shame set up.

[18:32] That's including all the countertops, all the small arcades in that.

[18:36] A lot of pre-30s and all the 40s as well.

[18:43] Are you helping them restore those?

[18:45] I mean, that must be it.

[18:46] No, no.

[18:47] I'd be more helping him once on the technical side.

[18:52] That's where I can really help him with the repairs and leave Philbig.

[18:58] But for one man to get 2,000 machines with his nearing possible, once the building starts getting directly,

[19:04] I'm going to put in different paper lines.

[19:06] I've even suggested bringing you back, Clay, when you tell me that your expertise,

[19:09] I was going to be going.

[19:10] Yeah, there you go.

[19:11] Sure, yeah.

[19:12] You know, I can't.

[19:13] Yeah, yeah.

[19:14] Yeah, I'm going to come out and spend like two weeks of holiday visiting you guys,

[19:19] and I'm going to fix 1,000 machines.

[19:21] Oh, these fantastic, right now.

[19:23] I get to spend 10 seconds on each game.

[19:26] I'm fixing it.

[19:27] Yeah.

[19:29] And I'm looking, Clay, I don't know if I just mentioned this to your listeners.

[19:32] Look, I'm working on one more book on Pimble.

[19:35] I'm going to do another book on Pimble, I'm showing this.

[19:37] And what is this one?

[19:39] Well, the reason behind this one, I've become a good friend to Valve and got over the years.

[19:46] And I used to always say, Valve, do you got any photos for me?

[19:53] And probably out of just that tracking, you know, my favorite section,

[19:58] my favorite chapter in the three books will be the chapter on the Pimble Pioneers,

[20:04] which is involved in two.

[20:06] Okay.

[20:07] And Valve, and again, gave me some beautiful photos.

[20:10] There's a photo with him and his father, another photo in the boardroom,

[20:16] another photo, I think, in 1952, a couple of distributors.

[20:22] And in that section as well, I've got a photo of the Ginsburg brothers.

[20:26] Nothing that's the only time anyone's ever seen the four brothers together.

[20:30] Really?

[20:31] Yeah.

[20:32] That's it.

[20:34] That's the next section.

[20:36] So anyway, after book three was just had gone to the shiffer to get into the process of becoming a book,

[20:45] Valve and Gaze and Gizmi, like another 40 photos.

[20:49] Again, no one's ever seen these before.

[20:52] Right.

[20:53] There's a lot of these are brilliant.

[20:54] I've got other more photos of Harry Mab, the men of the Inventor, the flip-up.

[20:58] I've got all these photos.

[20:59] I think in what do I do with these photos?

[21:01] I thought, well, I can probably put another book together.

[21:04] But this book will be more about, see my three books, Clier,

[21:08] and not about the pictures.

[21:10] Everyone says, oh, how do you pictures are smaller?

[21:12] Well, unfortunately, my books were not about the pictures.

[21:15] They were more about the interviews.

[21:17] So that's, so this book that I'm working on now will be more about the pictures.

[21:22] Where you can actually look at the play field.

[21:24] Like, I was trying to show someone a picture of Popeye.

[21:27] I'm just using that as an example.

[21:28] I haven't got my book.

[21:30] That's really the play field photo.

[21:31] It's a terrible photo.

[21:32] You can hardly see the machine.

[21:34] So now, in this book, you'll be able to see the play field and the backlight.

[21:38] It'll really bring it to life.

[21:41] Plus, a lot of photos are behind the scenes.

[21:45] From Alvin, I've got a few more from Gensberg, which was so Chicago-Corn in Genkau.

[21:51] That'll just make it a bit more interesting.

[21:53] So, you know, I understand that the Chiffler is an easy publisher to work with.

[22:00] Is that true?

[22:01] Yes, yes.

[22:05] Some, yes, they're very, they're very, very good.

[22:08] I mean, if somebody wanted to do a book, and they basically had a concept,

[22:12] and they had the photos, and they had the text, I mean, is it, you know,

[22:16] do they do a lot of the work for you, or do you have to actually lay the whole thing out,

[22:22] and, you know, and hand them photo-ready art?

[22:25] I mean, you know, how much do they help, really?

[22:29] Well, they, they said, they said they have people that are so interested in the book.

[22:36] There's a couple of places in, in volume 2, for example, I felt that some of the photos are really small,

[22:44] and there's a lot of wasted space.

[22:46] I call a lot of, like when you say a lot of white, I call that wasted space.

[22:50] I like to see, I like big photos, Clay.

[22:53] So, but other than that, they were fantastic, they were.

[22:57] If someone out there, any of you read it, whether they want to do a book, I've been more, or whatever,

[23:02] they're very good to work with.

[23:05] And who comes up with the pricing information?

[23:08] Is that something that you had to come up with, or do they have their own research team?

[23:12] Um, the pricing on the bottom of every game?

[23:15] Yeah, you know, how they do that, they put the price on, you know, like every picture has, you know,

[23:20] basically has a price associated with it.

[23:22] Okay, well I, I, um, okay, I've done some research, but see, when you, and the prices,

[23:30] and this is what I've stayed in the book, these are class 1 machines.

[23:34] Right, right, fully restored work.

[23:36] Even if some of those may not be a class 1 game.

[23:39] So, it's hard to, you know, like, people say this class 4, class 3, class 2, class 1,

[23:44] and which, and it could be thousands dollar difference between, between the games.

[23:48] So, I, I, uh, I went to a couple of websites, um, classic pinball, um,

[23:56] boardens, what boardens, right, um, herb-silver, pinball, um,

[24:01] there's a season that, yeah.

[24:02] So, what are all these different types?

[24:03] What they were asking for their class 1 games, I had like 20 sites,

[24:08] and I just got an average, and that's where the classes come from.

[24:11] Okay, I was just kind of curious.

[24:13] I know that, you know, if you, uh, the Schiffler, uh, company, you know,

[24:18] they put out books on a lot of different books on a lot of different subject matter,

[24:23] you know, all collection based books.

[24:25] And that's one thing that they always seem to require is that everybody have pricing for, for everything.

[24:31] You know, they, they like to make their books like a price guide type thing.

[24:35] You know, I guess that's kind of an angle that they take, you know.

[24:38] Um, which, which is, look, some games is very hard to come with the price.

[24:43] Well, um, oh, yeah, it was absolutely a lot of research.

[24:46] And then some people criticized and said, look, yeah, you, you can,

[24:49] why over the top, this is a machine that I picked up.

[24:51] You know, look, look, I know people that have picked up on a guy in Missouri

[24:55] that picked up a mermaid for $100.

[24:57] I got my mermaid for free.

[24:59] Yeah, well, I'm just saying, so what's the machine worth?

[25:01] If you want it to free, what's the worth $100, $100?

[25:04] I think it's worth $10.

[25:05] grain, I don't know, what's that about?

[25:06] What's that?

[25:07] I think it's worth $10.

[25:08] Yeah.

[25:09] And, well, my buddy Mars will just put into their credit and ship it straight.

[25:12] I know why.

[25:13] And we've caused too much for shipping.

[25:14] The shipping would eclipse the value of the game.

[25:16] I just don't think it's worth it, Michael.

[25:18] I, I'm sorry.

[25:19] I just don't.

[25:20] You see what I'm saying?

[25:22] Yeah.

[25:23] Yeah, it's why I understand.

[25:24] I'm teasing you, of course.

[25:25] Of course.

[25:26] Yeah, so, you know, I, I really enjoy the books.

[25:29] And, you know, when you, when you came to Expo, you know, you're like kind of an icon,

[25:33] kind of an icon of expo. I mean, you know, I always see you at expo and you're, you know,

[25:38] every time I turn around, you're right there. I mean, you're like, I, you must not sleep

[25:43] the entire time you're in Chicago, you know, you're, you're, because you're everywhere.

[25:48] Every time I turn around, I see you and you got, you know, big smile on your face and you're

[25:51] talking to somebody, you know, it seems like you're having such a really good time.

[25:55] Well, I think that's what that's what expo is all about. I say that the family gets together

[26:00] with, and I look for the scene everybody, I look for the scene you again, I look for even

[26:05] a showberg, a pin game journal and just, it is a lot of fun. It's just good to catch up

[26:11] of all the people that I've interviewed and, and, and, and, and, and see, it's also enjoyable

[26:16] to sort of a new people to come to me, it's a new people to enjoy and people, at the

[26:20] end of the day, I don't make, you know, like people tell me how much money you made out

[26:23] of the books, but quite I've made nothing out of these books. Oh, really? But I'll never

[26:27] write the books to make anything out of them. It's a, it's a passion. It's something that

[26:30] I, you know, I've loved pinballs all my life. I've genuinely loved pinballs all my life.

[26:35] You know, I'm, you know, there's, there's, if you write a book, there's no, right, there's,

[26:41] when you write a book, there's really no money in any, there's no profit incentive at all,

[26:45] huh? No, I'll cry. You know, one of this, one of the

[26:49] disasters, people say, well, about your first book, the fighters, or yellow, this and that,

[26:54] originally, Shufa wanted all the photos done on slides. So I actually hired professional

[27:02] photographers to go and take photos using slides. So, so, and, and the same amount of money

[27:08] I thought, what I'll do, I'll develop all these in one at once, and I'll save money on,

[27:13] on getting them developed. So anyway, I took them all to this photo lab, and when they come,

[27:19] like, they've probably 99% of the photos were at disaster. Really? It was very expensive.

[27:27] I merely had a, anyway, so, so most of the photos in there, I ended up, well, probably

[27:32] over half of them were, I just went on a quick course on photography, and I, and I took

[27:38] me on photos. Yeah, but that was anyway now. It's all digital. You can, they can use digital,

[27:45] they can, it's a lot easier to take photos, and you can actually see what you're taking,

[27:49] and if it's out of focus, that's okay. So you can really take it. It's a lot easier now

[27:55] to photos in that way. Right. What kind of camera do you use for this stuff?

[27:59] I've got a Nikon, I've done it at the model, but it's a, yeah, it's a digital.

[28:05] And it's a digital. But it's a digital, right? A digital camera.

[28:09] Yes, digital camera, yes. Is it like eight megapixel or type thing, or is it higher or low?

[28:14] It's six, so it's got all the gimmicks you can really zoom in close and

[28:19] it's really nice photos of five pixels and that. Okay, we're going to take a break from our

[28:23] interview with Michael Shalube, author of the pinball compendiums, and we will be right back.

[28:44] Okay, we're back with Michael Shalube, the author of the pinball compendium volumes one through three

[29:11] books. Now you also run a pinball repair business there in Sydney, right?

[29:17] Yes, yes. I run a company called Pinball Master Sales and Service.

[29:21] Well, let's tell me about that. Yeah, well, that's something that's, yeah,

[29:25] I nearly probably over 20 years now. I just, I'll go out and, you know,

[29:30] go and repair people's machines, and I help them get machines. I've got a lot of people that I

[29:36] can get machines from. So I help people track down those, those games,

[29:40] they played maybe near miss spend you for if someone's after actually, when you rang earlier

[29:45] today, I had some guys that were supposed to be with six angels arrived here, but they just

[29:49] born an Adams family, which I've got a, I've got a few machines in the garage. Not really for

[29:55] sale, but if someone wants a particular machine, they can come over if I've got a whole lot of

[29:59] sell it to them. So that's something I do. I've done a lot of repairs over the years.

[30:05] Actually, I was talking to someone today, which I've done a repair today for a gentleman,

[30:11] he's actually got a TV show where he's like Andrew Denton, it's called Denton Live.

[30:17] So next time Gary Stern comes down, I'm going to try and get him on TV in Sydney and try

[30:23] and promote Stern Pinball here. Wow. So do you specialize mostly in like AM repairs or

[30:29] solid state repairs? No, I do everything. I do anything from the, I can do from the 50s,

[30:33] all the way through to the lowlands. Okay. And as far as the pinwall scene in Australia,

[30:40] I mean, how popular is pinwall there? Well, it's probably not as popular as it is in the states,

[30:48] but it is very, very popular. And are there a lot of machines in people's homes?

[30:56] Yeah, yes, a lot of machines. There's a lot of machines here.

[31:03] I think the interest with pinwall machines, especially in the 70s, pinwalls were everywhere.

[31:09] Like you couldn't go to any shopping mall, there's a lot of them using a lot of snooker,

[31:17] snooker holes, lot of pool holes, I mean, bowling centers,

[31:21] laundromat, they were everywhere. So people, especially in my age group, would have

[31:26] would have played pinwall machines. The unfortunate part now is there's not many machines

[31:32] down on location. So a lot of people are buying and putting them in their homes and

[31:42] I've got the pleasure. I go out and, and some of us, I help them trade down these machines,

[31:47] especially if they pay them as it's had their miss spend you, I could go a lot longer,

[31:52] go, he wanted a king cool, because that's a machine he used to play the corner shop,

[31:57] well, I helped him trade one of those down. So that's a machine. Well, he should have sent his

[32:01] face claim when I delivered it, which is like a little boy, you know, giving him his first

[32:04] first bit of candy, so excited. Now, are machines expensive there, or are they about the same

[32:11] prices they are here? Probably in the same price, but there's a lot of machines coming into a

[32:19] square from Europe, Europe, but I don't know how, where they're getting all these machines from,

[32:24] like there's this same many machines in Europe. Look, I've already even brought out a couple of

[32:28] containers from Germany, and I've waited them here, but, but around the same price, maybe a little

[32:36] bit more here. Okay. So the wood rails for sure are a lot more here, because wood rails,

[32:43] client looks in a wood rail, pay more the same for now, the stride for years. Really?

[32:48] 100%. They just not around. Huh. Now, you said you have like 300 games in your collection,

[32:56] but you're only able to set up like 20 at a time? Yes, yes. Okay. And of your 300, are they,

[33:04] you know, what percentage do you have restored versus just, you know, versus just storage?

[33:10] I probably, in store, probably a third of them will be probably stored, restored. Okay.

[33:18] And just put away, but the other, I've always kept the best machines. It's like the machines that

[33:24] I've got in my collection, they're all in, if not class one, they're being classed to the condition.

[33:31] Okay. And you buy a lot of parts from the US, you know, like pinball resource or whatever,

[33:39] to restore them, or can you get a lot of stuff locally? Oh, they make you get nothing. There's

[33:44] nothing locally, and the couple of companies that do sell parts, they're just in family price.

[33:52] So, yes, pinball resource we find is a great source of spare parts.

[33:57] Well, we've got another gentleman in Chicago, pinball life. He does,

[34:02] rubber is very chavng, he's got a lot of cheapness.

[34:07] There's probably a 500, 600 percent marker from pinball life's prices by time they get over here

[34:12] and people start selling them. So, what retailers are there in Australia to buy parts from?

[34:18] Is there anybody? Yes, there's a place in Melbourne,

[34:26] dump action in newsrooms, there's Mr. Pinball in Melbourne as well, there's a place in Pinball

[34:33] Mania, and I'm happy days in newsrooms. There's a few different places around that retail and

[34:41] sell parts and all that. Okay. All right, and I mean, if you go into these, any of these shops,

[34:48] is it all going to be like 90's machines? They're not going to have any electromechanical stuff.

[34:52] Yes, but no electromechanical, all monies machines. Right. Probably now, probably just the last,

[34:59] probably mostly all stern machines. Oh, really? Yes. So, stern is a big importer in Australia.

[35:07] Oh, yes, yes, yes. The family guy, actually the family guy and prior to the Caribbean,

[35:11] and like hits down here, which is great for pinball. That's what I was only thinking about today,

[35:17] because I'm thinking of what we've got to get Gary to go on to and help from.

[35:22] And a lot of people today, it's probably like the states that would be buying machines, bringing you.

[35:28] Right. Right. Yeah. There's a new market there. There's people that have actually buying machines,

[35:35] probably distributed on my tag in Straitheim. And now, be connected with a new used to come W.W.

[35:40] If only. Sure. Yeah. I always thought that was kind of goofy, you know, to, you know,

[35:45] write a check for $4,000 US and, you know, bring a new pinball machine home. Man, it just seems

[35:51] so extravagant to me, but, you know, kind of looking back on it now after, you know, you've seen it

[35:56] happening for a few years, you think, well, you know, maybe it's not such a bad idea, because

[36:01] it seems like you can always get your money back when you go to turn around and sell the game, you know.

[36:06] Well, this is, you imagine a few years ago, you know, I feel that maybe five years ago, you could have

[36:11] been picking up many of your madmases or cactus canyons or, you could have bought all of them,

[36:16] but look at those today. Yeah, people are trying to get between $8,000 and $9,000,

[36:19] they're trying to make sure that's the change. Right. Right. So you're, you basically work full

[36:25] time doing pinball repair in people's homes, and? Yeah, yeah, but I work for myself. I,

[36:33] say what I try and do, I just put in a big day, you know, and, yeah, just going to do repairs and all

[36:39] that. And now I'm actually starting, I'm putting the four book together for that, but there's a lot

[36:43] of work out. I've actually, I've written the book. And you're just assembling it. Yeah, so let's

[36:49] just take a lot of time. Is the layout the worst part? Yeah, well, well, the worst part is

[36:57] marking all the photos and then marking where the photos are going to go in the book.

[37:02] It just takes a lot, a lot of time. Well, that's why I was trying to figure out, like,

[37:08] if you were doing a book, I mean, do you actually like set up like pieces of cardboard that represent

[37:13] a page and like, you know, glue the text on there and then, you know, set the photo where you want

[37:18] it with a little caption. And then is that how you actually lay it out or is it, or is that too low

[37:24] level? You'd see it's more electronic, you know, you're using a page maker or something like that.

[37:28] I mean, how do you do that? Now, I just, I give, I give the text, I give the photo, and they,

[37:34] they prefer the layout all that themselves. Oh, they do. I mean, like, three books, I can lay any of that out.

[37:40] Okay. I was kind of curious if that, you know, how much work they make you do, you know. And then,

[37:47] so how many of your books do they print and how many of you sold?

[37:52] I don't, it's something I don't want to know. They don't tell you.

[37:55] A million of each bar, I don't think it's that high. So I don't know.

[37:59] Because I'm just kind of curious how popular pinball really is. You know, I,

[38:06] it's, you know, because we're in it, you know, you want to say, oh, it's real popular, but,

[38:10] you know, it's just, it's really hard for me to evaluate, you know, in the mainstream population,

[38:16] how, how much popular appeal pinball really has to the masses. You know what I mean? You know,

[38:23] I, I am a, well, I think most of the people that collect machines or have any interest in

[38:30] pinballs will probably have my book, but people who, who probably have an interest, but they know

[38:36] that the book's out there. There's a lot of people here when I do pinball repairs, I always carry

[38:43] my books with me in people's house, you know, books and they normally at first glance, they love the

[38:47] book, they end up buying because that's how I distribute in Australia, the books are insanely priced.

[38:53] Really? Well, the, the distributes, everybody, it's all about money, my time, they miss,

[39:00] my book in Australia, people are trying to get like 140 to 180 dollars a book.

[39:05] Really? I mean, you can go on, I was looking online today at Amazon.com and there, you know,

[39:13] 30 to 50 dollars depending on which volume. Yeah, I know, I know, but so you think how can,

[39:18] that a lot of Australians have been buying and from Amazon? And someone, because I never had

[39:24] volume, surrounding just got volume, because I sold it just after Christmas last year.

[39:29] Yeah, people, I just tell you, you'll get an Amazon, they ship them out. So people email me all the

[39:35] time, I'll wake, wake up on your book, I'll just have to look up, I'll make a stock and you can get

[39:39] a few different Amazon. Right. That works out a lot safer. Yeah, and even Jim at the Penn Game

[39:45] Journal, you know, he sells them too and his places are really reasonable too. You know. Jim,

[39:50] yeah, Jim's, well, Jim, I gotta say, Jim Schelberg has helped me out over the years,

[39:58] and like he supplied many photos for, for book three, he's just a great guy, Jim. And,

[40:05] you know, if you don't listen to this, I'll thank Jim for your help, I really appreciate him.

[40:11] I've always to bug him all the time, but actually, I even rate hands though, I remember rate hands

[40:16] are one of the few days he had off, and he's had to have in the game a golf in his cell phone ring.

[40:21] He says, who could this be? You know, he could like, he's shallown, what are you doing?

[40:24] You know, so I was very persistent to get the story. So I think a lot of people just gave up

[40:31] and just gave me stories and photos and all that. Well, you know what, I was reading in one of your

[40:36] books that you were one of the last people to interview Harvey Heise, who worked for Gekko.

[40:43] Yeah, just before he died, you were like the last person that interviewed him. How did that go?

[40:51] Well, it was very, look, on you, Harvey was very sick, weeks prior. And I remember I actually

[41:02] rang him and I stayed through his door to Janice. The book was, you know, the book was nearly ready.

[41:09] It just had gone the print and I rang him the toll frame in his store to look, he's not doing

[41:17] too well. I said, look, Janice, I just want to confirm your address because the book's going to,

[41:21] you know, I'll live the book, having a couple of weeks and I'd love you that to see it and let me know

[41:26] what you think of it. And the next time I rang him, the tell of the book was going to be sent out.

[41:31] She said, yeah, that's what I heard that Harvey just passed away.

[41:35] Wow. And when I was doing the interviews over the fine, he was just a wonderful gentleman.

[41:42] So you did that in a while. I think all of us from maybe you can look at Steve Kordek,

[41:49] Norm Hark and Wayne Neum, you think, what a great bunch of people. Beautiful, beautiful,

[41:57] and I'll just, again, it's a lot and I'm privileged to be able to put them, yeah,

[42:01] part of the high tribute today, tremendous and fantastic work in the industry.

[42:06] Yeah, and of course Harvey was the game designer for Genko, which Kordek actually worked at too.

[42:16] And what were Kordek words for Harvey?

[42:20] Right, at Genko. And of course, Genko, when it was in 1958, they got bought out by Chicago Coin.

[42:29] So that was kind of like a mini-genko history. But they were, they did some amazing arcade games

[42:38] during the 50s too. Are you a big arcade game collector to EM arcade?

[42:43] I like, we've got most of the gang games, the Fortune Teller and the Shrine,

[42:50] Madurama. We haven't had the other one. Jet Pilot, a couple of Jet Pilot.

[42:55] Yeah, I got a Jet Pilot. I'm Modorama's car hard to get. I really love to find one.

[43:01] Man, if anybody out there is a Genko Modorama, please contact me.

[43:08] Don't call Michael. Call me.

[43:11] Now we need one for the PMO museum. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I need one for my PMO museum and my

[43:15] basement. In the other one is Space Age. That's the other one I want to try and find.

[43:21] Yes, I've got pictures of that, but I, yes, yes.

[43:25] That one's really hard to find. You know, same cabinet, the Modorama, the Jet Pilot,

[43:31] in the Space Age, they all use that kind of...

[43:34] That's fine cabinet.

[43:35] Yeah, that same kind of jukebox on leg type cabinet. It's kind of cool. I really think those games

[43:41] are really neat. You know, but you know, all those Genko, do you have any of the Genko baseballs,

[43:47] you know, the High Fly or the Champion baseball or any of that?

[43:51] I'm not a few. I've got a few, the mainly the United and the Williams ones.

[43:56] Right, right. I think we've got two Genko, or maybe one Genko.

[44:01] Okay. Okay.

[44:03] We have, which one, I'm just trying to think of the one, um,

[44:09] starts like it was the United, I've got one of the Genkais.

[44:12] The big one.

[44:13] It would be the really big one is Champion baseball and the one that's smaller, more pinball size-ish

[44:19] is High Fly.

[44:22] Well, I think we've got a Champion, but that hasn't got the animated unit hasn't.

[44:26] No, well, it has, yeah, it doesn't have the animated unit, but it has a little player

[44:30] of the play field.

[44:31] Yes, I've got the Champion, and that's got the side where the ball comes up,

[44:37] and then it's got the big, and it rolls down, and the big bat hits it up.

[44:41] Yeah, it's like a, it's not made on the play field, and it actually hit it over the fence

[44:46] right exactly.

[44:47] Right.

[44:48] Right.

[44:49] Is that yours or is that Allens?

[44:51] Well, it was smaller, I'm not sure whether I saw it, so I'm looking

[44:55] I'm not going to look at whatever it is, it's kind of beginning to me, it's not even anyway.

[44:59] Incredible game, that one's really hard to find, and I think the High Fly was a lot more

[45:03] popular because it's smaller.

[45:06] Yeah, yeah, the Champion baseball is a monster, man, that thing is big.

[45:11] Well, believe it or not, Clyde, that Champion baseball was actually all

[45:15] priored in Australia.

[45:16] Really?

[45:17] It come from a company called Golden West in Melbourne, and that machine was out on location.

[45:23] It's up to recently, Takteh?

[45:25] Oh, my God, no, God, I just want to be back in the, probably back in the late 60s,

[45:30] and then it was put in the storage and I ended up buying it.

[45:32] Oh, I got you.

[45:34] So how have you...

[45:34] Probably probably 80, 87 out by put that machine?

[45:38] So how long have you been actually actively buying machines?

[45:42] Probably 80, five.

[45:46] Wow.

[45:47] So you were ahead of the curb, you were buying stuff before pinball collecting was really a big thing.

[45:54] Well, yes, yes.

[45:57] By look, Clyde started, I remember what it brought me first, too, in the matter of a month.

[46:03] I'm just one of the topic collectors, I just collect everything, and then I started collecting

[46:07] criminal machines, and then I was on a go to try and get as many push-up balls as I can.

[46:14] Within six months, I've got close to 50 machines.

[46:20] But you have to remember, it's not like the states, push-up balls are very hard to come by there.

[46:24] Oh, wait, I'm sorry, push-up?

[46:27] Push-up, man, do you all currently get to manually push the balls out?

[46:30] Oh, all right, manual ball load games, right, yeah, pre-1967.

[46:34] So you don't call them push-up balls?

[46:36] No, I've never heard anybody call them like that.

[46:39] I always call them manual ball load.

[46:40] I've also heard people describe that as spoon loaders, because it's kind of like a big spoon

[46:46] that lifts the ball up, but I've never heard people call them push-up.

[46:50] No, maybe that's a local Australian term.

[46:55] And maybe it is, buddy, it is, because people say you've got any ball push-ups for sale.

[47:00] Oh, okay.

[47:01] Yeah, I wasn't sure what you meant when you said that.

[47:03] The other thing you said a while back that I didn't really catch was,

[47:06] did you say something about snookers?

[47:09] Snooker, snooker.

[47:10] What is that?

[47:13] Snookers, um, gullies.

[47:15] Oh, okay, okay, all right, all right, okay, sorry, that's my bad.

[47:19] You know, they call that here too.

[47:21] Okay, I'm sorry, that was my fault.

[47:24] So yeah, I just, yeah, you know, we got, uh, you know, social differences here, and even though,

[47:29] you know, you know, what I mean, you guys have different terms for things that we do.

[47:35] You know, so I'm just trying to figure it all out.

[47:37] Snooker, it's not very big in the state, because you have a more yad ball and line ball, that's, um,

[47:44] Right, right, that's definitely more popular here, eight ball and nine ball, right?

[47:49] Yeah, for sure.

[47:50] So what other stuff are you now, do you collect any video games?

[47:55] No.

[47:55] No, none at all.

[47:57] But I do have one of those videos, the main, that's got all the video's on there.

[48:01] So I, I had one video game that's got like 300 games on it.

[48:05] Right.

[48:06] But no, I don't collect video games.

[48:08] Okay.

[48:09] And do you repair?

[48:09] No.

[48:11] No, I don't.

[48:12] No, I try and see, well, clear of that claim.

[48:15] Yeah, no, I can't blame you.

[48:17] I try and steer clear of it too.

[48:19] So the, um, your, your pinball master's company, I mean, are you, is there enough

[48:25] in-home repairs that like keep you busy full time there?

[48:29] Yeah, yeah, there's, um, there's a lot of, there's not many people here that can actually repair the

[48:33] electro mechanical machines.

[48:36] Um, a lot of people can repair the non-East, um, and the IDs, but I get a lot of work, a lot of,

[48:44] a lot of, a lot of people with, uh, any mechanical machines, there's probably any two people in Sydney now

[48:50] that can repair, that go out and can repair the electro mechanical, there's not more noise cars.

[48:54] Wow.

[48:55] So do you work through, you get a lot of references from those shops that you were talking about before

[49:01] or, or, uh, wherever is it, just like people see on the, on the web and they call you?

[49:06] Yeah, people have seen me look, um, look, I do, I do repairs as a couple of, uh,

[49:10] high-tales that I got pinball machines in them and, uh, uh, uh, uh,

[49:14] that, that I get in on, on my service car.

[49:17] Um, and sometimes people go in there and they, um, they simply, like, I've got me card in there,

[49:22] so they may have a pinball machine and they give me a ring and so, look, look,

[49:24] look at that machine, it's not working.

[49:26] But, but 90s machines, right there, they're, they're very reliable and,

[49:31] you know, maybe the bridge wrecked the fire or could we just,

[49:34] the wires come off, nothing, nothing major.

[49:37] Um, and, and the electro mechanicals, when I shop them out,

[49:39] and when I, you know, I go right from, they tend to work,

[49:42] I work fantastic and, and, and give very little problems.

[49:46] Right.

[49:47] Okay, cool.

[49:48] All right. Well, uh, I'm going to let you go.

[49:50] Is there, I mean, is there anything else you want to add?

[49:51] Anything we didn't cover?

[49:54] No, just, I made it fantastic.

[49:55] I really, this is, um, this is what I do, Clio.

[49:59] I'm out, you know, to try and spread, yeah.

[50:01] We've heard about pinballs and try and help people who live there.

[50:04] Try, try, try loads and, um, enjoy the game.

[50:07] And, and I think you're doing a fantastic job and, uh, I really appreciate, uh,

[50:11] you put them on your shelf.

[50:12] Oh, well, cool.

[50:14] I appreciate you giving me a ring up and, uh, and, and, and, and, and,

[50:18] in Tarnalus.

[50:18] So the next time you're coming back to the States,

[50:20] it's going to be for Expo again, huh?

[50:23] Well, I might, I might be there.

[50:24] I might, I might go and say,

[50:26] Paisak, um, in a couple of months on.

[50:27] Well, if you go see Paisak, you know,

[50:29] make sure you come up and, uh, see me.

[50:31] I'm only about, I think I'm about a three hour drive from Paisak.

[50:35] Okay.

[50:35] Well, I might come and say it.

[50:36] Okay.

[50:37] That's all right.

[50:37] Well, I won't come and say it.

[50:38] You coming up in the summer or something?

[50:40] Yeah.

[50:41] I want to get a suit of point.

[50:42] Oh.

[50:45] you make sure you call me.

[50:46] I'll go with you.

[50:47] You know what?

[50:48] I'm, okay.

[50:48] That's, that's a,

[50:49] 100 percent will be done with Cedar Point.

[50:51] You know, I'm only like two hours from Cedar Point.

[50:53] So,

[50:54] I'll meet you there.

[50:55] I'll meet you there.

[50:56] Yeah.

[50:56] I, the Cedar Point's like,

[50:57] for people that don't know,

[50:59] Cedar Point is like the premier amusement park,

[51:01] especially if you're into roller coasters.

[51:03] And, and the whole United States,

[51:05] it got an amazing collection of roller coasters there that just,

[51:09] you know, or just unbelievable.

[51:11] Uh, that, that place is,

[51:13] you know, like people say,

[51:14] I'm going to Disneyland and I'm going to Disney World.

[51:16] And I'm like,

[51:17] man, you know, those parks,

[51:18] they're, they're all about fluff.

[51:20] You know what I mean?

[51:21] They're all about fluff.

[51:22] If you want real substance,

[51:24] you go to Cedar Point.

[51:25] You know what I mean?

[51:26] So, have you ever been in it?

[51:28] And they've also got a 60,

[51:29] and they're like a bit of a muslin,

[51:30] and they took my,

[51:31] right, right.

[51:32] Where they have like, um,

[51:34] the Rackhole the World Series.

[51:35] They got a, the parallel there in the 1937.

[51:38] Yeah, but they have, and they've also got, um,

[51:40] the Chester Power,

[51:41] the whole Shwashing Gang.

[51:43] Yep, yep, yep.

[51:44] And then they have the,

[51:45] oh, it's fucking,

[51:46] yeah, they're probably,

[51:47] you're watching the horses race around the track.

[51:48] There's a couple of, um,

[51:50] muted sky,

[51:53] fortune telling the shrieks.

[51:54] There's a lot of, um,

[51:55] interesting pieces there.

[51:56] Yeah, and they also have their old time arcade too,

[51:59] where they've got, uh,

[52:00] lecture mechanical gun games,

[52:02] and they've got, uh,

[52:02] lecture mechanical pinballs,

[52:04] mostly 70s EMs.

[52:05] Yeah.

[52:06] You know, like they got fireball and 4 million BC

[52:09] and old Chicago and,

[52:10] man, they got all kinds of stuff there.

[52:12] I really like going there.

[52:13] We, me and Norm,

[52:14] we always go every summer we go there.

[52:16] We take, uh, you know,

[52:17] I've got a, uh,

[52:18] a 13 year old kid and he's got a 15 year old kid.

[52:21] And we always kind of,

[52:30] But are you the top juice day in the front,

[52:32] so in the front row,

[52:33] okay?

[52:34] You mean on, on a roller coaster?

[52:36] Yes, yes.

[52:37] I, I don't,

[52:38] I pretty much get in wherever they tell me.

[52:40] You know, I have no preference.

[52:44] You know, we're, we're,

[52:45] they say,

[52:46] sit.

[52:46] I don't know.

[52:47] It doesn't go on anything.

[52:48] Alan Thai,

[52:49] he said,

[52:49] good enough to get.

[52:50] Oh, is he going to come with you in the summer?

[52:53] Yes, he'll be, he'll be with me.

[52:54] That's fine.

[52:55] You know, I mean,

[52:57] some of the roller coasters are a bit, um,

[53:00] you know, they're a bit daunting.

[53:01] I mean, uh,

[53:02] they get that one that's,

[53:03] I, it's like the highest one in the world.

[53:05] Oh my god.

[53:06] I mean,

[53:07] it's, it's,

[53:07] what is it?

[53:08] Zero, zero,

[53:09] zero to 120 miles and 40,

[53:11] two, four seconds.

[53:12] Oh, yeah, the dragster.

[53:13] Yeah.

[53:14] Yeah.
