[00:00] Hello there, Pinheads! This is Triumph the Insult Dog, and you're listening to Norman

[00:05] Shaggy on the Topcast. A popular program among fat, 40-year-old men with no sex life.

[00:11] Kind of like Norman Shaggy. Oh, and don't forget to download episode 42, featuring my cousin

[00:18] by Than Angelou. Until next time, see you later Pin Losers!

[00:24] Celebrity Voice impersonated. You're listening to Topcast. This old pinballs online radio

[00:29] for more information, visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com. Last Topcast!

[00:48] Welcome to another episode of Topcast, the pinball internet radio show.

[00:54] And tonight we have a designer that started work at Balli in 1981, and then later moved to

[01:00] Williams Balli, and then finally to Dadeys Slessega as a game designer.

[01:14] I like to welcome Ward Pemberton to Topcast Night. We're designed some really great games,

[01:19] including Balli Batham in 1981, BMX, Hardbody, Dungeons & Dragons, and then when Williams bought Balli

[01:29] in the late 80s, did some designs for the Williams team, including Mouse in Around, Riverboat

[01:34] Gambleer, Gilligan's Island, and then worked for Sega, Slash Data East, designing Golden Eye.

[01:41] Alright, so let's give Ward Pemberton a call right now on the phone and talk to him about his

[01:45] game designing career.

[01:58] Hey, Ward.

[02:00] How are you doing?

[02:01] Okay, how are you doing?

[02:04] I'm good. I'm good. So, you ready?

[02:07] I guess so.

[02:08] Alright, so tell me like how you your first memory is a pinball or how you got into pinball.

[02:13] I mean, you became a pinball designer. That's what a lot of people that are into pinball really

[02:17] want to be. How did you get there and where did you come from and how did it start?

[02:22] Okay, let me tell you, my dad worked for belly manufacturing for I think over 26 years.

[02:31] And out of high school or in high school, I ended up taking a drafting class.

[02:36] And out of high school, my dad was able to get me a job working for Norm Clark.

[02:43] Who was in charge of all the game designers over there at belly.

[02:47] And what happened was I was working with the other game designers as a lab tech building their designs.

[02:58] Put in their play field together. And then after a couple years, Norm Clark gave me a shot at

[03:05] designing a pinball machine and Fabin was my first game.

[03:09] So what year did you start working at belly?

[03:11] I believe it was right out of high school, which would be about 78,

[03:16] 78, 79. So you were only two years worth of under underpinning work and then you're already

[03:24] giving you designer duties? Well, what I was doing is designing on my own time. If the game

[03:30] designers had something for me to do, I'd be working for them. And then I was able to do stuff when

[03:36] they were at some downtime. So was Fabin one of those ones you kind of designed on your owner

[03:44] or did they say do a game? Yeah, Fabin was actually what it does. Back in them times,

[03:50] you would almost design a play field and then you would put a theme to it.

[03:56] Okay, you'd work on your shots and your different target areas and you know, position your bumpers,

[04:02] your footers, all that stuff. And then at the game played well, you would then put the rules

[04:08] and regulations and your game theme together. And actually, Fabin, I designed a play field,

[04:15] but actually Fabin, I believe Greg Sparris came up with the Fabin theme.

[04:24] Right, he was your artist for that game, right?

[04:26] The artist, and I believe he came up with the theme. So he came up with the cartoon,

[04:32] Grocer and everything. Did you not really care what the theme was?

[04:38] You know what? No, not necessarily. He ran a past me and I said, well, that's kind of cool,

[04:43] you know? But that's one of the things you got to sell marketing department. And Greg was

[04:50] very instrumental with a lot of those game ideas. He was a pretty sharp guy and a great artist,

[04:56] you know? Now, did you have your choice of other artists like could have you had Dave,

[05:00] Christensen or Paul Ferris or any of those guys? You know what? At the time,

[05:05] if I had mistaken, I think Paul Ferris was in charge of the art department.

[05:10] And Greg was working for him at the time Fabin was done. And no, I really didn't have a choice.

[05:17] Actually, at that time, I was still considered an associate designer, like a junior designer.

[05:25] So now, how did you get, I mean, Fathoms, you know, it's got multiple, it's got speech, it's got,

[05:32] you know, the great graphics, it's like a total pinball package. I mean, how did you pull that

[05:38] off for your first game? You know what? Talking with the other game designers, which was Gary Gaton

[05:45] and Jim Patler, who else was over there. I think George Christian, Greg Cimic were over there at the time.

[05:54] And if I had mistaken, I don't know if Claude was over there yet, Claude Fernandez or not.

[06:00] But actually Gary Gaton and Jim Patler were always very instrumental to me and taught me how to

[06:07] design play fields. Were when you're actually designing a play field, your ball always, you're kind of,

[06:14] you know, anticipate the reflection of the targets. And if you're hitting a,

[06:24] are you there? Yeah, no, I'm listening. Yeah, if you're hitting a shot into a scoop,

[06:28] you want to try to always pick up a radius, you know, you don't want any flat spots because then

[06:33] you're going to get that big clank. What do you mean by flat spots? What's that? What do you mean by

[06:38] flat spots? Well, you always want to try, since the ball's got a nice round curvature to it, of

[06:44] course, you always want to try to hit a radius, you know, and that'll make that smooth flow

[06:49] transaction with the balls. So, and if you're hitting a target, you always know that if you got your

[06:54] target angle, then a certain, you know, angle that how it's going to deflect off of those targets.

[07:00] So you're saying that you don't want to like aim at our position of target so that it's directly

[07:05] parallel to the player? Right, because it's just going to come right back at you too quick too, you know.

[07:10] Yeah, definitely. And even if you noticed the, the return lanes on Fathom, how you got it,

[07:18] where it scoops in and you get a nice flow back to the flipper. Right. You know, some of the old games,

[07:24] you'd have it where it goes straight down, stop, and then kind of rolled at a flipper. I always like

[07:28] to have it where you could almost have like cough, coughed and flow, you know. And it was that something

[07:36] that like the, you know, the old timers like Norm Clark and that, or is this just something that you

[07:40] picked up on your own? Well, you know what, yeah, just from experience of playing it and liking the

[07:47] way, I always love the way certain play fields flowed. And a lot of people, I don't know, when

[07:55] all the games I've done, they said, yeah, it looks like one of your games work because, you know,

[08:00] the play field flows nice. It's got nice, I don't know, good flow. Yeah, good kinetics. Good kinetics.

[08:08] That's right. Well, now, when, how far back were you involved with Pinball? I mean,

[08:15] did you remember playing Pinball when you were a kid? Yeah, my dad years ago, like I said, he worked

[08:20] for Valley for over 26 years. I don't know exactly how many years, but we got lucky once in a

[08:27] while he was able to bring home a prototype game and we'd have it in the basement and we could flip

[08:31] around on it. Actually, one of my favorite games that he was able to bring home was, I think,

[08:36] was 4 million BC. Well, game, one of my favorites. Yeah, with the zipper flipers. It was a great game.

[08:45] So, did you ever go out to the arcade or anything, or is this always like dad brought home a game

[08:49] and you got to play it? Right. I never went to the arcade. I got lucky when I was a kid if my dad

[08:54] took me in on a Saturday over to Valley and I could go into the arcade that had a place where

[08:58] they'd show their new games and we could flip around while he was upstairs working.

[09:05] Now, did your dad retire from Valley? Yes, he did. He retired. I want to say back in 80,

[09:14] I want to say 86 maybe. Was he mostly involved with Pinball or everything? My mind was

[09:21] Beth Leo with cancer and he ended up leaving early so we could spend some time with her.

[09:31] I'm sorry about that. Yeah, it's hard to live. We had a good life.

[09:38] Now, was he mostly involved with Pinball or just everything? My dad was at one time he was in charge

[09:43] of the mechanical engineering department. Now, what did he think of the transition from like

[09:51] electric mechanical to solid state and what did you think about that? Well, I thought it was great

[09:59] because everything seemed to be more lights and whistles and the flipers were stronger and

[10:05] the displays were easier to look at. You didn't hear that clunk of clunk of clunk of clunk of

[10:14] I don't know, I guess because everything was easier to wire and you could actually start

[10:21] putting more money into the machine and it'd be more appealing to everybody. I mean,

[10:29] you know, I came on pretty much after the electrical mechanical stage.

[10:34] So, I thought it was a great transition.

[10:41] Now, was there any feature that you wanted in fathom that you couldn't justify for cost

[10:47] reasons that got costed out? You know what? I had to remember back in the days, but you see,

[10:56] I don't think so. I think that was pretty much, you know what I always tried to do?

[11:04] I always tried to get that zipper flip or feature and but I don't think I tried to get it in the

[11:09] fathom. I just I always thought that was a pretty cool feature. Yeah, yeah, very cool.

[11:15] Now, who, I mean the voice, the voice in that for the game, you know, was there any stories behind

[11:22] that? You know how that was developed or who did it or anything like that? You know what, I can,

[11:28] there was a female voice in there, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

[11:34] Let's see, you know what, I don't even remember all these people who did the sound. I think,

[11:39] if I'm not mistaken, I think Neil Falconer was the programmer at the time for fathom.

[11:45] Neil was the programmer and I think somebody named Chris something was the

[11:49] sound guy and I can't even remember his last name. But, so you didn't have to have a bunch of

[11:59] interaction with them? Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's no doubt about it. There was interaction. Every pinball

[12:04] game that I did, okay, was based on me as the game designer, the artist, the mechanical engineer,

[12:13] the programmer and the sound guy. Was that five different guys that really had a lot of input in

[12:21] the games. You know, you talked a lot of other game designers and they like to take the credit for

[12:26] everything, but it really isn't that way. Right. You need a lot of help from a lot of different people.

[12:33] And then you need your sales and your marketing people to make it sell a lot, you know.

[12:38] Were they pretty happy and were you pretty happy with the sales on fathom? You know what?

[12:43] Again, at that time, like, you know, I want to think that it was about 3500.

[12:50] Right. Yep. Yep. Okay. At that time, that was a good sale, you know. There wasn't many games

[12:57] too much more at that time. We got, you got, I don't know, I want to say, it's pimped a little bit

[13:08] with the next game that I did, but it's all timing, you know. That pinball industry's got its

[13:14] ups and its downs. But yeah, I got great reviews from Fathom. My Roger Sharp, you know, gave me a great

[13:21] review and I don't know, was it Play Meager? Is that the magazine? Right. Yeah. So it was a exciting

[13:28] time in my life, you know. Now, you know, recently they've reproduced the Fathom Playfield in the

[13:34] back glass and the, in the flat plastic for the Playfield. Did they, did they contact you at all

[13:41] or did you even know about this? And I mean, do you have any feelings? Now, who would have reproduced it?

[13:46] Well, they, there's, Bali obviously still owns the rights to all that stuff and they licensed it out.

[13:53] And there was a, I think some guys in Canada, classic Playfield reproductions, I believe were the

[13:59] people that did that Playfield and they probably did the plastics in the back glass too.

[14:05] No. I mean, did you, did you keep a Fathom? Long ago they do that, you know.

[14:09] Maybe a two years ago. Wow, it'd be nice if you wanted those games.

[14:14] So you didn't, you didn't get to keep a Fathom after you designed one?

[14:18] No, at that time, it wasn't. See, I didn't have a contract at that time, I did Fathom.

[14:23] And after the contracts came into play and that was part of pretty much,

[14:29] and the game designers' contract, they'd always want at least one game for their home, you know.

[14:34] No, never got one.

[14:37] So, I mean, was that, would it have been a big deal to get one?

[14:43] You know what, at that time, the industry was at a low. So I guess every game that they made,

[14:49] they really wanted to try to sell, you know. I mean, it would have been a big thing for them to give

[14:54] it to me, I guess, because they didn't. Now, didn't you, so your dad was working there,

[15:02] you were working there, and I heard that you had like a sister that worked at Balley too.

[15:05] You know what, I did. I had a sister, I had a brother. My sister did work there before me,

[15:12] and I don't know what she actually did. I think she might have worked, let me think.

[15:19] I don't know who she worked for, but she was more in the office area, you know.

[15:27] Right. Right. So was that kind of weird having the whole family there?

[15:31] No, it was pretty nice. It was pretty nice, we met my wife at Balley.

[15:37] I mean, I married somebody from Balley too, then, you know.

[15:41] It's a good time for you, then.

[15:42] Oh yeah, not a good memory. Balley was a very good company to work for.

[15:46] Okay, so now, after Fathom, the next game you designed was what, BMX? Tell me about that one.

[15:53] BMX, I was really excited about, you know. And again, this was a play field that I

[15:59] designed, and then I put the new outlines in them. They were a unique style where you have the extra

[16:07] flipper button on the side with a piece of spring steel that when you press the button, it would close

[16:13] and the ball would return right to the flipper. So there was only one lane on each side,

[16:17] and it was either, and it was always an outline, unless you pressed this button that would bring it

[16:23] right back to the flipper. So theoretically, if you were very good with your fingers,

[16:28] the only way to lose the ball would be down the middle between the flippers.

[16:31] Right. Right. Now, were you a BMX fan?

[16:36] No, and actually, that was another great Ferris idea. The artist again, great Ferris.

[16:44] Did you have the exact same team as Fathom or work on BMX?

[16:49] You know what? I don't remember. I don't remember. I know great to the artwork I believe.

[16:57] Yep, great did it. Yep.

[17:02] I don't know who else did any of the other activities.

[17:05] Yeah. It could be very likely that it could have been the same guy that did the programming,

[17:15] but I don't know for sure. Now, at this time, were you considered an official designer?

[17:21] No, no, but I was still a, still was an under contract. So I was still a junior or associate designer.

[17:31] Were you happy with how BMX came out?

[17:34] Yes, I was very happy with it.

[17:37] But it didn't sell all that well.

[17:39] Two level, you know, two level play field.

[17:41] Right. Right. So that was my first two level play field. I thought it looked great.

[17:48] Well, but it just didn't sell for some reason.

[17:51] It's again, that was the time. I think we only did 350 at home.

[17:55] Yeah, I got 400, but yeah, right in there.

[17:58] Yeah, but that was it. And actually, at the time, right when I got laid off before

[18:05] even went to production with that, it was just a very, very down time at Valley.

[18:12] And I wasn't under contract, so we weren't losing anything getting rid of me.

[18:17] And like I said, they didn't make too many games.

[18:23] But I had a couple guys here that felt really bad that I was laid off,

[18:26] Jim Pettler, one of them. So what, what year was that? Let's see.

[18:31] In the 82.

[18:33] Yeah, BMX was in 82. So I got laid off shortly after that.

[18:39] And what did I do? You know what I did?

[18:44] I worked out for a while and I got to try it with the White Sucks in 83.

[18:49] What? You played for the White Sucks?

[18:51] It was a White Sucks.

[18:53] You played for the White Sucks?

[18:55] Well, they signed me up and I went down to spring training, Sarah Soder there.

[18:59] And got released, never officially made the roster.

[19:03] I think it was going down there for about three weeks.

[19:06] But it was another exciting time of my life.

[19:09] You know, I hit a shot. I hit a shot at the White Sucks.

[19:13] Now, how did you slide into that?

[19:16] Well, you know what? I played baseball pretty much all my life.

[19:20] And then right out of high school, I kind of quit baseball.

[19:22] So I quit for, it must have been almost four years.

[19:27] And then I was pretty big. I had six with four, two on ten pounds.

[19:31] And I was always a pitcher, so I had some pretty good velocity.

[19:35] I was being clocked about 90 miles an hour back at that time.

[19:38] And at the after being off the baseball for three and a half four years.

[19:42] So my dad actually wrote letters to all the baseball organizations.

[19:49] And we got a response from pretty much actually quite a few of them.

[19:53] But the White Sucks actually set up a personal trial for me down at the the amphitheater

[20:01] that year and went down there and I ended up throwing with Dennis Lamp and Steve Trout.

[20:09] And the scout, you know, he told me he says,

[20:13] well, he says, you're, you're our strength is great.

[20:16] Your mechanics need some work. He says,

[20:20] if you want to come out, you know, the next couple weeks.

[20:23] And let me work with you. He says, I'll make a decision if we can sign you

[20:27] and send you down to spring training. So that's what I did.

[20:30] So we worked with him for a couple of weeks and after that, he signed me and sent me down to spring training.

[20:39] That's all that I hired out.

[20:41] Well, now you got back into Bali a few years later. How did that happen?

[20:46] I sure did. Jim Pellick gave me a call back in 86, I think. And now he says,

[20:51] word, he says, I'm a charge of the designers, the game designers. He says, what do you think about

[20:57] coming back and working for me? You know, he says, I really like the way BMX turned out.

[21:03] We didn't make too many of them. I like you to come back and, you know, see what you could do for me.

[21:10] And when I came back, he says, he wanted me to redo BMX, change a little bit.

[21:15] That's what I did. And that's when I actually, I think it was our marketing department and

[21:22] Greg Ferris again, okay. And I think Greg Ferris was in charge of the art department at that time.

[21:30] No. And came up with hard body with, since Bali was in their health and fitness now.

[21:38] And Rachel McGlyce signed with the fitness department that they wanted to do a pinball machine for that.

[21:47] And sure enough, that's what we did. We changed our body a little bit and made, I mean, we changed to

[21:54] BMX a little bit and made it our body. And now that's all pretty decent about 2000 units.

[22:01] You know what I think that's what it did do. I think that's what it did do. It was okay for a

[22:07] Bali run. No. No, was this Bali midway, right? This is, well, yes, Bali midway, correct?

[22:19] But not Williams. No, this was still Bali. Williams didn't buy it yet.

[22:26] Okay, was there anything on hard body that, you know, you'd got costed out of that, you know,

[22:30] any kind of features or anything that you wanted in?

[22:33] Man, it's hard to remember, because it was, that was you right. They were always looking at the cost

[22:41] to see what they could do, because how many they had to sell in order to make the profit.

[22:48] I don't think so. I don't think so. I know they're always worried about the inline drop target

[22:54] cost and so much money.

[23:00] And drop target. You know what? Yeah, that is true. I mean, if you look at hard body, you'll see

[23:05] all the stand-up targets. I know the four bank was probably a drop target unit.

[23:12] See, I always love drop targets. I thought drop targets were better than just stand-up targets.

[23:16] Oh, yeah. That did visual effect. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, now that you mentioned it, I'm sure that there was

[23:21] some drop target units taken out of there. Now, was there, was the design principles or concepts

[23:31] or way that you did things any different when you came back in, you know, 86, 87 compared to when

[23:36] you were doing it in 91, 92? No, not really. Not really. It was, like I said, with hard body, it was

[23:43] kind of easy because we were kind of redoing BMX. Let's see, the game after that,

[23:52] you want to talk about that one or you want to stand on hard body? No, let's go to that. That's

[23:56] the Dungeons and Dragons, right? The Dungeons and Dragons, correct. Okay. Now, you know the guy that

[24:02] invented that game, he just died. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He already just passed away on the

[24:08] news. That was surprised to hear that, you know? No, did you have to get a license for that or

[24:12] did you guys just use the name? No, that was Valley. Valley did get a license for that. There was

[24:17] some kind of contractual agreement between the, the owner of the Dungeons and Dragons rights.

[24:23] And did you ever have to talk to the guy or anything? Not me personally, I'm sure that was our

[24:29] marketing department or, we'll listen to it with the contracts there. Okay. Yeah, tell me some

[24:37] more about that game. That's another one that you still have more drop targets, but had to be taken

[24:42] out cost effectiveness. Well, let's see. I think the, I think there was a bell tower in that

[24:52] thing. And I think we still drop targets up on the ramp that had to come out.

[24:59] You know what? I don't even remember most of the rules for that. There's no that there was a big

[25:03] flame in the center and that was how you were generating bonus by building up the flame.

[25:12] So how long did it take you to design, Dungeons and Dragons? You know, just about every game takes

[25:16] about a year, it took about a year for me. And were they okay with management okay with that?

[25:22] Oh yeah, that's what he had all these different game designers. That's what he had always given.

[25:26] And even in the contract, it was pretty much state that you had one year to do a game.

[25:33] I mean, sometimes you were able to, you know, push it quicker, sometimes it take longer.

[25:38] But, uh, a year is a pretty reasonable bum on a time.

[25:42] Now, instead of a great fairest for your art, it looks like you had Pat and Pac-McMcNanerson or McMcPain?

[25:49] You know what? Now that you mentioned it, yeah, you're right. I mean, you're refreshing my memory

[25:54] on a lot of things there. So how was it like working with him? Oh, Pat's a good guy. All these guys,

[26:01] I tell you what, everybody I worked with at Valley was good to work with.

[26:04] It really was. So you didn't have any particular favorites?

[26:08] Um, not really, not really. I mean, you know what, when you're working with somebody,

[26:13] you grow closer with them because you know that, uh, for a successful project, you really

[26:19] got to work well together, you know? You want them to do their best for you and you're going to

[26:25] do the best for them, you know? And, uh, when they would give you suggestions, you'd actually

[26:30] listen to them and sometimes you'd use them, you know? Right, right. Smart thing to do.

[26:36] Now, who was, do you remember who the programmer was? Dungeons and Dragons.

[26:43] I'm not sure. I want to say, I want to say Neil. I want to say Neil Falconer, but

[26:53] I'm not sure. Now, do you keep in touch with any of these people anymore? No.

[27:00] Nope. No. No. I mean, if I see somebody, we'll say hello and everybody, but yeah, no, we're not real.

[27:08] Everybody's seen to go on their own separate way when they left Pinball. Right. Right.

[27:14] Now, about this time, Valley was getting acquired by Williams. I mean, tell me about that

[27:20] transition because you slid over to the Valley Williams teams. Yeah, I slid over, but they didn't take me

[27:26] on right away as a game designer. They took me on as a tech. They took me on as a technician to

[27:32] help the game designers again, do all the prototypes. And so now, how did you transition from that to a

[27:39] designer? Yeah, if there was over there, I met with Ken Fidesma and told her I wasn't very happy,

[27:46] because I really wanted an opportunity to continue to design games. And it's when he let me go

[27:55] ahead and do mouse and around. And how did that go? I mean, now you've got a different environment

[28:01] with, I imagine, different team, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was definitely a, I don't know,

[28:11] I don't want to say difficult, but it was a transaction that wasn't looking forward to, you know,

[28:18] because it's like starting a new company and you already feel like you're imposing on a lot of

[28:24] these designers territory that have already been established over there. You know, they don't

[28:27] want you to be successful, but they really don't. You know, you're going over there. So you could

[28:33] feel a little bit of tension between the different designers from Williams and Valley. And you know,

[28:38] what? I think there always was even when we weren't working underneath the same roof.

[28:44] We never wanted to see each other do well. I'm sure, you know, there was our competition.

[28:49] We didn't want Valley to, our Williams to be successful when we were Valley. And I'm sure Williams

[28:54] didn't want Valley to be successful, you know. So looking back on it, do you think it was a bad

[29:00] decision for Williams to take all the Valley guys over? Not at all, because I think what they were

[29:07] doing is I think, in my opinion, I think William was technically buying the Valley name,

[29:13] figured they could get a bigger, uh, distribute, you know, patient out there. Right. They could

[29:19] distribute more games and quantity. And they probably accomplished it for a while, but then people

[29:26] realized that guess what? The Valley game is the same as Williams game now. So let's just buy

[29:32] the best one, because they were always releasing games against each other, you know, even though they

[29:36] own both, because I think when I did mouse and around, what was I up against on the Williams side?

[29:42] Oh, Elvira and the party monsters or something? Okay, if that's the date, well, that was a

[29:48] Dennis Nordmogame. He was a Valley designer, but that's what they were trying to do now. They were

[29:52] trying to mix up the name saying, well, this is going to be a Williams game. This is going to be a

[29:55] Valley game. So I don't know what they're thinking was behind that. Let's see. So they were doing like,

[30:04] you know, almost like you guys were almost like each team was in competition with the other team

[30:09] at the same company. Yes, you're right. If we're, if our games were released at the same time,

[30:14] which they were, you know, like within a month or two of each other, I think, uh, what was it? I

[30:20] did over there. I think I did River Bull Campbell, or I think it went up against the Richie's

[30:26] Terminator or what did he do over there? It might have been his Terminator. And everybody was pretty

[30:34] excited about, you know, the River Bull Campbell thing. But then with Steve Richie's name and

[30:40] reputation, you got everybody out there, you know, trying to buy that, you don't want to buy

[30:46] them both at the same time, you know, with his reputation and his good great games that are out

[30:54] there. I think River Bull suffered a little bit just because of that.

[30:58] Hmm. So what I mean did say, were they actually like, you know, I interviewed another designer

[31:05] and he was saying that it was like almost like, it was almost like street gangs that the teams were

[31:10] like, you know, really, really that much in competition against each other.

[31:15] Well, we did compete. There's no thought about it. I mean, there was some favorite, uh,

[31:21] um, what do you say it? Some favorite mechanical guys that you'd rather have working on your game,

[31:29] or, um, you know, certain artists like you said would do, you think sometimes would do a better

[31:35] package. But, uh, I tell you what, everybody that worked for me did a good job.

[31:41] They're not in bad to say about them. Yeah, it looks like you were up against bad cats, was behind

[31:47] and whirlwind was in front of you right around, mouse and around. Okay.

[31:52] The world one was a great game, but that lawyer, um, that, uh, what was the cat? You said,

[31:58] bad cats. What do you mean you didn't care too much for bad cats, but, uh, yeah, it was, uh,

[32:03] you know who designed it. Um, Mark Richie, right? Well, it was also, um, yeah, python.

[32:10] Python, right? Python. Yeah.

[32:15] What did you think of Python? So you're right. He had some good stuff, but he was a little eccentric.

[32:20] Yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. A little eccentric. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He sure was. I mean,

[32:26] uh, did you ever have to work with him? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Did you actually did the yetwork for one of my,

[32:33] uh, redemption pieces when I went to a game star? He did the yetwork for goofy hoops.

[32:38] And was he good to work with? He was all right. He had to listen to him, you know. He was, um, he was out there,

[32:45] but what are you gonna do? Yeah. Him and Mark Richie were tight. Right. Right. Yeah. Him and Mark Richie were tight.

[32:55] Okay. We're gonna take a little break of talking with Ward Pemberton, and we'll be back right after

[33:00] this message. That's right folks. It's Doc Pinball. Just reminding you about the Rochester Game

[34:27] back glasses, plastic sets. On the web at classicplayfields.com. All right. We're back with Ward

[34:38] Pemberton game designer. So now when you were doing a river bowl gambler, you had fun house behind

[34:45] and what bugs bunny's birthday ball in front of you. Were those competing with you?

[34:51] I don't think so. The bugs bunny one. I don't think that was a threaded out. What was the one behind me?

[34:59] Fun house. Fun house. Fun house was a good game. Fun house did well for Williams, right?

[35:07] Oh yeah. That was pet luller, right? Yeah, but your river bowl gambler sold

[35:13] over like 3200 units. Fun house sold like 10,000, but I mean 3200 is still a pretty good strong sales.

[35:22] No, you know what at that time was probably an average run. Most of all my games were average runs.

[35:27] I think the biggest run I had was probably maybe Gilgons Island. Was that 4,000? Yeah, exactly.

[35:34] Okay, that was probably my biggest run. And I don't know. Let me know when you want to talk about Gilgons.

[35:40] Well, wait, before we get to Gilgons, let's talk about the river bowl. Now who came up with the river bowl gambler theme?

[35:46] I want to say great first, but nah, I don't know. It might have been Greg. Yeah, I don't have the

[35:52] honest witch. I can't remember. I can't remember. And was that dictated to you or did you get to pick?

[35:59] Did you get to pick that theme? We did it as a group. The rules, the rules, the right and the place with this

[36:08] play field. It was great. I want to think, you know what? I think Pat did the artwork, but I think Greg

[36:15] Ferris came up with a nice thing with it again. And then we just made the rules fit.

[36:22] Now that I know I came up with the buttons on the bottom arch there or on the molding.

[36:29] Right. And through that wheel, we took from one of the Williams games because that was a feature,

[36:37] but we put the through that color on it and played with it.

[36:43] Shoot. I don't know. I want to say, I want to say Greg Ferris again, but

[36:49] but wasn't Linda deal the artist this time? You know what? Linda deal does ring a bell.

[36:57] But for some reason, Pat McMan, you know what? She might have did the play field.

[37:01] Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, could be. Oh, I know, I know Pat McMan.

[37:09] I want to say Pat McMan did the back glass.

[37:11] Hmm. Was that okay to have two artists do it like that?

[37:17] I think it worked out pretty good. I think it was a real nice look and package.

[37:20] Yeah, it was. You know what? I'm not sure if Linda deal did the play field.

[37:27] I really am. I'm not sure. I don't have her names from Miller.

[37:34] Now what about, did you work with Dan Fordon, Pat?

[37:37] Dan who?

[37:39] Fordon.

[37:41] Dan Fordon. Doesn't ring a bell. There was Dan Langloy,

[37:47] but he was another game designer. Okay.

[37:52] Dan Fordon. He was like a mechanical engineer or something.

[37:59] You know what? The name rings a bell. I can't play some. I'm getting old.

[38:03] I'm getting old.

[38:05] Alright, so then you got the big theme. You got the Gilligan Island theme. Tell me about that one.

[38:11] Alright, well let me tell you this. When I was with Williams, they bought a play field from a guy named Dan Langloy.

[38:20] Okay. Dan Langloy sold them a design of a play field. And at that time, you know that island that rotates.

[38:31] Right. Okay. He had it as a brain. It was supposed to look like a brain.

[38:39] And I think the name of the game that he was going to call it was the brain.

[38:44] So, at the time, Williams was looking for somebody to take over this design that they bought from

[38:51] Langloy because I guess he was a bad way. He was sick. And I volunteered to step up and take the

[38:58] play field and do something with it. And we came up with, again, I keep mentioning this guy's name Greg Ferris.

[39:07] He came up with the theme of Gilligan's Island. He says, what if we do the old TV series Gilligan's Island?

[39:14] And I said, alright, well what we can do with it. We threw some rules to the pinball machine and

[39:22] we changed a couple of shots and put the volcano in there and a couple other things there.

[39:31] And we put the package together as Gilligan's Island. With that nice story behind it with the

[39:35] lava seltzer and the ingredients and the professor's formula line, Gilligan's jet pack to take the

[39:41] the lava up to the volcano before he ruptured. Now, how did you get the license for that? Was that easy?

[39:47] You know what? All these licenses are done usually by the marketing department. I think maybe at that time Roger Sharp was in there with the marketing.

[39:59] And they would go up there and wheel and deal for the rights and how much they get them per game, stuff like that. I don't know how much so.

[40:09] And I think it would have been a Warner Brothers. Is that too?

[40:13] No, no.

[40:14] Yeah, I don't know if it was a Warner Brothers. We were on the right to Gilligan's Island.

[40:19] They had two they had in the go-shade with and then they called Bob Denver and talk with him.

[40:26] Because he actually came out and shot the brochure for us with us.

[40:30] Did he do the voice for you too?

[40:33] You know what? He did do some voiceovers. He did. Yes, he did.

[40:37] Did any of the other people get involved?

[40:40] Um, the other people meaning?

[40:43] You know, like the, you know, Marianne and whatever her name was.

[40:47] No. Um, they didn't act. I guess not that I'm aware of. I think actually they were trying to...

[40:59] Ginger, that's her name. Ginger.

[41:01] Yeah, Ginger, they didn't cheat. Didn't want none to do what I was told.

[41:05] She wanted to forget all about Gilligan's Island at the time. But

[41:09] you know, people have different thoughts in their head.

[41:12] And I think she finally got to realize it was a good thing for her after all.

[41:17] You know, right?

[41:19] Right, so I mean you didn't get the only voice you got was Bob Denver as little buddy and

[41:25] basically everybody else you just did, you know, got from like old TV shows or something?

[41:30] I think so. I'm pretty sure that's what they did.

[41:33] But don't quote me at all this because when them were in what it used to be.

[41:37] Now the artist that looks like for Gilligan was Johnny Aussie, is that right?

[41:43] Yeah, Aussie, right.

[41:44] Now how was he to work with?

[41:46] Actually, I like, he's got a good style. I like this style a lot.

[41:52] You know, it was pretty much Greg Ferris on the art department and pretty much coordinating a lot

[41:58] of the stuff with him. So yeah, it was, you know, I didn't have too much

[42:07] too much input with it. But I know that with the back glass, when they had Mary Ann on a little

[42:13] Mary Ann on her little exercise bicycle or whatever she was on, they had to do a couple of different

[42:20] versions of it because Mary Ann's her chest was too big and one of the pictures had to reduce it

[42:26] a little bit. Really? Yeah. Usually you think it'd be the other way around. Yeah, well, I don't know if

[42:33] he took offense to it or he just didn't want it, I guess, so they had to reduce him a little bit.

[42:39] I think it was her call. I don't think it was the marketing department. But yeah, you're right.

[42:43] A lot of things are usually enhanced. Right. Right. Right. No.

[42:49] When we did the River Boca, I'm going back to that one. When actually I think that back glass was

[42:55] done by Pat McMan. And he had one of the girls in the back with her silhouette. We almost see

[43:01] two redress. Actually, I think it shows pretty good on the brochure. But I think with the

[43:10] the back glass, they had to tone it down a little bit. And who dictated that kind of stuff?

[43:16] Who did what? Who dictated that kind of stuff where you had to tone it down? Overall marketing

[43:20] department sales department that said, oh, we got a tone of down a little bit.

[43:24] Now, what on Killock and Zyland, were you pretty happy with how that game sold and how it was received?

[43:35] Yes, I really was. I thought it was a very nice package again. It's probably the best package I've

[43:40] done up till that point. So my goal was always to my next game to do better than the previous one.

[43:48] Most of the time that's what happened. Were you happy with the sales?

[43:54] Yeah, I think that was right off 4,000. At that time, it was good. You're always hoping to do more.

[44:02] In 18,000, 20,000 run. Never happened for me. Some were time I always seemed to be a slow time of the year.

[44:13] And a lot of times it's in my games head. So.

[44:18] Now, did you, did you stay with Valley Williams? Well, you know what happened? Let's see, back in,

[44:26] let's see, I think Killock and was my last game there. And then in 91, I got called for the Chicago

[44:34] Fire Department. For a test, I took back in 85 and came to Chicago Firemen.

[44:42] And I went up to Ken Fidesz and I want to tell him I said I wanted to do both because of the

[44:47] great schedule of Chicago Fire Department. As you work one day and you're off too. So theoretically,

[44:52] you're just working two days a week as a fireman. And I was actually at that time, I was working on a

[45:00] new pinball game, which was pretty unique as far as I was concerned. I wanted to see with the

[45:07] white bodies out there at that time. Off and on. I never liked the way the white bodies play. It was

[45:14] just too much side to side motion too far. So my ferry was, I was going to do a horse race game

[45:23] with a pretty much a standard sized play field in a white body cabinet with a horse race track

[45:28] going around the outside, which made it a white body. It was being hit in the different features

[45:34] on a pinball machine to advance your horse. Great idea, how come I didn't get made?

[45:41] Well, there was a couple of reasons. One was because of the fact that actually Williams told me that

[45:49] they weren't going to let me do both. I had to make a decision either design pinball machines

[45:55] or become a fireman. And they had a very good reason. Their reason was the job of the game designer

[46:06] is to get this game ready so they could keep the production lines running downstairs. They

[46:11] keep the factory open. And it's something happened where I did get hurt at a fire. I wasn't able to

[46:19] work. It would be a time where they might have to shut down the factory. That made sense. I never

[46:24] thought about it that way. Being a fireman can be a pretty dangerous job at times.

[46:31] What they let me do is go through the academy at the fire department,

[46:38] and they would still keep me on. I had a team of people that I was working with, my mechanical

[46:45] engineer, my artist, my sound guy programmer. What happened is they said that they would actually

[46:51] come in in the evenings with me at work at night while I was still going through the academy.

[46:58] And so I thought that was really nice that I'm guys, you know, to do that. But they did that so

[47:05] Williams kept me on as long as I was in the academy. But once I graduated from the academy,

[47:09] they said that they weren't going to do that any longer, which was understandable.

[47:15] Well, were you working on the horse race game at that time?

[47:17] Yes, I was. I had a great task that is my mechanical engineer. He was working pretty good with the

[47:25] racetrack. But at that time again, the industry was a little weak. It looked like this game was

[47:34] going to be too expensive to produce with the racetrack and horse race mechanism. So it pretty much

[47:41] got cobbased. And it really, I didn't get far enough along with it to convince them to keep going

[47:48] with it. Did it get anywhere where it was playable? You know what, the race track was in a

[47:59] molding stage where it was like a handmade track. And it worked somewhat, but you know,

[48:11] we weren't really thrilled with it yet. We weren't thrilled with it. So yes, we were able to shoot

[48:16] it around a little bit, but nothing where you could have wanted the production with it.

[48:22] And who was helping you with the software? Let me think.

[48:29] Trying to think who the programmer was for over there. Dwight Sullivan was a programmer.

[48:37] Maybe Boone? Boone. Yeah, Boone was at that time. He was pretty much Steve Richie's only

[48:45] guy. John Hay was John Hay there? John Hay was there. Was he a sound guy or was he programmer?

[48:53] I don't know. I think he was sound. I think he was a sound guy. Because I think he did some

[49:01] of the sounds I'm mouse in for me. I think he was my sound guy I'm mouse in. Then there was another guy

[49:09] I think that was Jim's proposer. You know what? I can't read none. There's nothing.

[49:17] I guess we are looking at 17 years ago.

[49:22] So now you stayed with the fire department and did you ever come back to do any more pinball?

[49:27] Well you know what? I'm still with the fire department and back in 93. I got a call from

[49:38] I think his name was Mark Coldabella and he was working for a company in GameStar now.

[49:47] And he was asking me if I was interested in designing again. And I said sure. I said as long

[49:53] as you realize I'm a fireman too. You know, I'm not going to get up in a Chicago fireman to just

[49:58] design games. This is all no. We got no problem with that. So worked out great for a while. So from

[50:05] I want to say 93 to 93, 94, a couple years, I was over at GameStar and I designed a redemption

[50:14] piece called Goofy Hoops and we did a redemption piece. It was actually my, they hired me as a

[50:23] pinball game design. I didn't want to do pinball but since this company was still trying to get

[50:30] its foot in the door, they took my back box feature. It was going to be a back box feature

[50:37] in a pinball game. We decided around with it just as a redemption piece. What do you mean back box

[50:42] feature? Well, this was a, a Pachinko style back box with a picture like a ball the size of a

[50:52] foosball plastic ball. And it would launch a ball up on the top and it would go down these little

[51:00] Pachinko tile pins and you'd have a basketball net that slid side to side in the back box and you

[51:06] try to catch that basketball that came down. So we ended up going with that as a redemption piece

[51:14] so we could make some money for the company. Did it work out okay? Yeah, actually it was very

[51:21] exciting at the show and everybody really liked this game. My objective for that game was though

[51:29] since we decided to go with a redemption piece, I kind of wanted it to go as a, a fire piece

[51:35] so you could put this in all the local bar establishments and then you got your guys you know

[51:40] and her girls at the bar and you could go up to the machine and pretty much say okay come on let's

[51:45] go let's play. Next loser buys the next round you know but they didn't put them in the bars

[51:51] they ended up putting them just in these little you know ticket redemption places the trucky

[51:57] cheeses and stuff like that or little prizes and toys. They did fairly well. I think the company

[52:03] made some good money. I don't know how many games it made dealt probably just probably just a

[52:09] little over a thousand maybe twelve hundred fifteen hundred games. Was that good for redemption?

[52:14] That's kind of yeah because it was a lot more inexpensive to make.

[52:20] Now how long did you stay with Game Star? Let's see that was what Game Star told I want to say

[52:28] two years or almost two years in 93 to 94 and in 94.

[52:37] And now why did you why did you get out of Game Star? You know what I actually got I got fired

[52:42] over there. I get fired at Game Star or let go whichever way whatever sounds better. Yeah well

[52:49] why why what happened? Well I had to run in with Python Angel O. Python Angel and Mark Ritchie was

[52:59] actually in charge of the how do you say you was probably in charge of the game designing area.

[53:09] Well because Game Star became Capcom pinball. Right right and actually the goofy hoops was sold

[53:17] underneath the ramp star name because that was their distributor I guess. Right yeah right but yeah I

[53:26] mean Python had a run in and and then Mark Ritchie and Python like I said they were like a team

[53:35] so I got let go. Now what was the issue with Python? Well Python was one of these guys that always

[53:43] wanted to take credit for everything even though credit wasn't due to him and if you didn't think

[53:49] along his lines we were thinking the long way so we kind of could banged heads. One of those things.

[53:59] Now were you sorry that that happened or was it no big deal because you had the fire department

[54:03] game. I read it that I got let go from there because I wanted to really do another pinball

[54:08] machine there and I was actually in their cat track there and you know I just it was one of those

[54:17] things where you you've had high hoops and I've seen nothing but dollars signs of potential over there

[54:23] so yeah I was very sad to be like go over there. Well at the time were they were they working on

[54:30] the start of the pinball company. Yeah yeah and that's what Ritchie and Python were basically doing

[54:36] right. Yeah well we were all doing I mean at that time that I was let go I was working on a pinball

[54:41] machine also. Oh yeah. Now what was the game you were working on? You know what we were trying to

[54:49] get different licenses we were trying to get actually I think at the time we were trying to get

[54:53] the mission of possible license. Did you get very far with that? Yeah.

[55:01] To me it isn't far unless you got an up-and-workin model you know and so I'd have to say no

[55:13] I didn't get too far with that a lot of stuff on drawings but we didn't get much farther.

[55:22] Python doesn't really think Python wanted to keep changing the things so

[55:27] we wanted to do some kind of circus things. He began circus things and I just wasn't

[55:33] they'd want to go around that line. Well yeah he did that circus game you know at Williams that

[55:41] they spent you know millions of dollars to develop and you know right when he was leaving Williams

[55:46] and coming over to Capcom you know they spent at pinball circus they spent a ton of money on him

[55:52] and it never really got going. Yeah and you know what there's a lot of tension between this company

[55:57] and the Williams all of a sudden they were afraid to do things because Mark Richie had a clause

[56:03] in his contract and he couldn't do any pinball for a certain amount of time once he left and

[56:08] it was just a little hectic over there when it came to you know getting some of the Williams

[56:15] guys over by us got a little nerve wrecking. So after you got out of you know Game Star,

[56:24] Ramstar Capcom whatever you want to call it that you haven't been involved in pinball since then.

[56:29] Oh no after I left I should say after after I got fired from over there shortly later

[56:37] a few months later I got a call from Joe Kamikaw over at Sagapinball at the time.

[56:44] Oh and he was all excited and he wanted to hire me as a game designer for them

[56:50] so I went over there. And how did that work out? It worked out great for a short period of time.

[56:57] Again it was that pinball industry you know they spent a lot of money and I didn't have a

[57:03] contract over there and after I think it after I did hold the knife. Yeah.

[57:12] Yeah and after that game it was time for more layoffs at that company and I was one of the

[57:18] guys who got laid off. No I like Golden Eye I thought that was a pretty well done game.

[57:23] Yeah I like it too thanks. Yeah you know that one shot where you hit that satellite dish and

[57:30] you know it kind of seems goofy but the way it catches it and then feeds the ball but I just

[57:35] thought it was really neat. Thanks. Yeah was that your idea? You know what I don't know trying

[57:44] to think here actually you know what we did we designed a play field again and we had to try to do

[57:50] these certain features. I know Kamikaw hit something put on the game of course.

[57:55] Yeah what was it like working for him? Joe's a good guy very smart man very smart man he's the one

[58:04] that brought a lot of licenses in the pinball you know. Right yeah Hollywood Joe he that I think

[58:09] that was the party like the most. There you go. There you go. Yeah. Now did you get to meet any of the 007 people?

[58:17] No I did not. I know he went to a special showing somewhere Joe and he met all of them and

[58:25] he actually brought me back I think a scorecard signed by Pierce and they were really good to

[58:34] me over there. He even hit a special pinball machine made for me and you've got a little metal plaque

[58:42] you know that for the game stand this Golden I 007 Sega pinball machine made especially for award

[58:52] Poverty. I know. I said he was it was very very good guy. It took good care of me. It's

[59:00] kind of like kind of a classy guy to work for. Yeah he was he was. Now were you ever going to

[59:08] you know try and get back into the industry after that? You know what there's not that industry window

[59:14] was very very small right now. Yeah it's very very small. I mean who's just making a

[59:21] noise just start right? Right yeah. Yeah so the thing that it doesn't seem too feasible right now.

[59:29] Now was there anything at Golden I that you know you tried to put in that got costed out of that game?

[59:35] Oh yeah it was I'm just trying to figure out what it was.

[59:39] And that was Paul Ferris on the artwork there. Paul Ferris did the artwork right that was one of those

[59:50] new type of play fields. Was it like a photo or something? Yeah you mean like the the four color

[59:56] process? Yeah. Yeah Paul was kind of like pushing that pushing that technology. Yeah well he was

[01:00:04] working with it you know it's more you're right Paul Long. The old veteran artists were

[01:00:09] involved there. Mr. Perigot himself right? Right right exactly. Yeah he was big on this

[01:00:15] four color process. He thought it was the way to go. Right you know I and I guess they were doing

[01:00:21] you know they obviously are doing the translates that way but you know the play fields they I don't

[01:00:25] know it didn't it didn't do look quite as good to me personally. I agree with you. The only thing

[01:00:31] positive about it is that they left or they were hoping to last longer and stay cleaner you know

[01:00:36] or it wouldn't wear off as fast with the diamond plate and all this other stuff over it.

[01:00:42] But yeah I know what you're saying you know what I think the only thing is that the people got

[01:00:46] to look a little bit more realistic with that type of process. Right let's cartoonish looking.

[01:00:53] Right right. But no I agree that somebody old stuff looks really nice you know.

[01:01:01] So you know that's you're still a fireman and were you doing fireman and working at Sega they

[01:01:07] had no problems with that. Yes yeah that's why I said these guys took care of me you know.

[01:01:12] That was a nice little gig ahead going the same thing with Game Star and then when I went to

[01:01:17] to Sega again that's another one of the reasons where it's easier to let me let me go and

[01:01:21] somebody else because here I am you know still working still with a job somewhere and it's

[01:01:29] less guilty feeling which is totally understandable you know. Now how was the company you know

[01:01:35] philosophy and company you know just in general you know when you were like say Williams compared to

[01:01:43] Game Star compared to Sega did they have like you know different you know philosophies and work

[01:01:47] environments. Oh yeah oh yeah you know again a belly was a great great company Williams was a great

[01:01:58] company. They were all really good companies but Game Star was the Japanese company okay you're

[01:02:05] owned by the Japanese and they set up this really nice building for us and they had actually a

[01:02:11] fitness room for us where he had weights and showers and it was that's like that it was pretty

[01:02:17] exciting. And I was actually considered one of the top desires over there because they didn't

[01:02:23] really have anybody else yet you know they were still working to to get Mark Richie he had a promise

[01:02:28] in there but he had to get out of his contract before he could design anything and then he had

[01:02:32] Python come over which he wanted to start designing and doing the artworks all. That's why he said you

[01:02:39] know what that's where detention came and and that's why I got like gold or no but a lot of good

[01:02:48] opportunities out there at one time or another you know. Right right. No regrets then huh.

[01:02:55] Yeah no regrets you know I'm just a thank god I'm a cargo farm and now I'm not out there looking

[01:03:02] for jobs you know. Right right. Well how much how many more years do you have doing the fireman gig?

[01:03:08] I figure if I got about eight years left and then I can retire from there.

[01:03:14] You still got some time I mean any good fire stories? Oh yeah well I've almost been killed a few

[01:03:19] times but we won't get into that. And not by Python either right. What's that?

[01:03:27] It's not killed by Python either. Right right. Right right. Yeah now the fire department's a very

[01:03:35] gratifying self you know it's a very makes you feel good about yourself that you can help

[01:03:41] somebody else one time in need you know. Right. And it's always a good feeling to get on that rig

[01:03:46] and hearing the hearing the fireman's going on you don't know what's on the other end yet.

[01:03:50] All right cool is there anything you want to add word? I think that's about it. Just you know I

[01:03:57] got to thank everybody that helped me in that industry because it really was a team effort you know

[01:04:03] from the artist to you know the programmer and the sound guy and the mechanical guy everybody

[01:04:10] made it work for me so appreciate all their their help you know. Well I appreciate you talking

[01:04:16] to us it was good I'm glad you were able to take time because I know your schedule is kind of

[01:04:20] hectic. It's not a hectic thing it's just you know what it's just it's hard to talk about pinball

[01:04:26] now because it seems like it was such a long time ago and you don't know how much you remember and

[01:04:30] you know what you forgot it's like that. All right. No I think you did good. All right well thanks

[01:04:36] for that Clay. I'd like to thank Ward Pepperton for coming on Topcast Night really do appreciate

[01:04:42] his time and in his great design stories and I hope you all come back and here's again on another

[01:04:50] episode of Topcast the internet pinball radio show.
