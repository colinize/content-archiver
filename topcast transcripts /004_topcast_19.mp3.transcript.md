[00:17] Flash Topcast.

[00:31] Welcome to another edition of Topcast.

[00:34] Today I have Norman back, Fresh Outta Rehab.

[00:38] And looking rather sober and good actually in shape.

[00:44] Yeah, I wasn't, uh, being able to hear me out there, I can't hear myself from you.

[00:48] Why don't you boost me a little bit?

[00:50] I'm gonna boost you right out the window.

[00:52] But anyways, yeah, I was there with Britney Spears.

[00:55] She sort of looks like Shillinga from Oz.

[00:57] Everybody's watch Oz on HBO.

[00:59] And the Nazi guy with the shaved head and tattoos.

[01:02] Yeah, well minus tattoos.

[01:04] But anyways, tattoos.

[01:06] So we're from, we're coming today.

[01:08] Life.

[01:09] Life.

[01:10] From the Department of Famous People at Not so Famous Places.

[01:16] And the reason why I bring this up is because Norman wanted to talk about somebody that he met this weekend.

[01:22] Oh, it's a thriftodster.

[01:24] Yeah, it's good.

[01:26] Yeah, he, uh, I met Todd.

[01:28] He's a nice guy, real nice guy.

[01:30] Do you know Todd's last name?

[01:31] McCutchens.

[01:32] It's McCullick.

[01:33] McCullick.

[01:34] I hate to say that.

[01:36] McCullick.

[01:37] Well, I mean, not even.

[01:38] He's big.

[01:39] He's just a shy, a shade under a seven feet tall.

[01:42] He's 17.

[01:43] No, he thought, I just said, what are you?

[01:45] Six, ten, he goes, yeah.

[01:46] Must be asked by that by everybody.

[01:48] He probably does want to.

[01:49] No, he's splitting his.

[01:50] He's six, eleven and five, eights.

[01:53] Yeah, and one of those cities.

[01:54] He's seven foot in my book.

[01:55] He said he's up to 400 pounds, but I, he doesn't look, uh,

[01:58] bit over 300 to me.

[02:01] He's got a ton of games.

[02:03] He loves your site.

[02:04] Yeah, we know.

[02:05] And so what did you learn anything interesting from Todd?

[02:08] Anything we should know?

[02:09] Yeah, Todd has too much money.

[02:11] Aside from that, as a former NBA player, still under contract for the 76ers.

[02:18] Playing basketball was very lucrative to him.

[02:21] Yeah, and unfortunately, he heard himself.

[02:23] That's a real shame because he's, uh, he's, he's a little walkin' a little bad.

[02:27] I feel real bad for him.

[02:28] He's, uh, he's a good guy, he's Canadian.

[02:31] And I know you don't like Canadians, but I think you can make one exception.

[02:35] There's only one of eleven Canadians ever played in the NBA.

[02:38] And he played in the Olympics.

[02:39] He's got a very impressive, uh,

[02:41] Yeah, he played for the Canadians in the Olympics.

[02:43] Yeah, in Australia.

[02:44] Yeah.

[02:45] Which reminds me of these other guys who are getting emails from Australia,

[02:47] but we can talk about that later.

[02:48] No, actually, we're gonna talk about that right now.

[02:51] Norm has been collecting Norm's mailbag.

[02:55] Yes, Norm's mailbag.

[02:57] Norm has been collecting letters from people asking pinball questions from all over the world.

[03:03] And Norm keeps these in a little bag, along with some of this stuff.

[03:08] And he likes to review them every now and then when he's feeling not so good about himself.

[03:14] Oh, too high, which is pretty much all the time.

[03:17] We got one here from Holland.

[03:18] Well, hello there.

[03:19] First of all, lots of props.

[03:21] I don't understand half these.

[03:22] I don't think some of our English words.

[03:24] No, props means props means prop and you up.

[03:27] That means it's a good thing.

[03:28] And you don't even know the any, you know, any American lingo.

[03:32] No, I just think these guys get an American to whatever language they speak.

[03:37] Go book and pull words out not necessarily.

[03:39] They always don't translate well.

[03:41] Go on.

[03:43] Well, hello there.

[03:44] First of all, lots of props because your manual about fixing a pinball machine has helped me a lot.

[03:50] The machine works again.

[03:51] I'm very happy about that.

[03:53] I'm interested in having a couple of DVDs about repairing pinball machines.

[03:57] Now I am supposed to be sending money to this address Las Vegas pinball.

[04:02] The question is, are you working there?

[04:05] If the money arrives, you know it's for me so you can hand me the DVDs.

[04:09] What is the progress?

[04:11] Hope to hear from you soon.

[04:12] Regarding Ray and Holland.

[04:14] I told you some of these words don't really translate well.

[04:18] So what exactly is he asking you, Norm?

[04:21] I think he wants to make sure that you're sitting there waiting for his check to come and say you can mail him a DVD.

[04:26] Yeah, patiently.

[04:27] But your whole life waiting for a letter to come from Holland.

[04:31] Give us the next one there, Norm.

[04:33] You guys are great.

[04:34] I love the videos.

[04:35] The amount of information is incredible.

[04:38] I find myself taking notes and loving it.

[04:41] He gets, taking notes and loving it.

[04:44] I must be mad.

[04:45] Tell Norm that I happen to like his clips.

[04:48] So don't flame me on your next video.

[04:50] By the way, you wouldn't happen to have a nice high speed play for your lane around.

[04:55] It's Chris Minidu and I don't know where he's from.

[04:58] But if I had an extra high speed, I believe me, I would be putting it on my own game which I don't have.

[05:04] Well, you know, it's funny, Norm, because every one of these letters, they always want something at the end.

[05:10] That's pretty much the case.

[05:11] I mean, everybody, I mean, they send in, you know, expecting us to fix their pinball machines.

[05:16] You know, without seeing them, I have this specific problem.

[05:20] And it's on the J6Y connector.

[05:22] It goes into this here, it comes out here.

[05:25] And I can't make coffee.

[05:27] And we're supposed to like fix the coffee machine.

[05:30] They're their pinball machine.

[05:31] All right, well, Norm, I think I've had about enough of your letters.

[05:34] Oh, no, we got, here's a guy from Italy.

[05:36] Hi, just received a video immediately burned it.

[05:39] What does that mean?

[05:41] Oh, that means he destroyed it.

[05:44] Maybe it is on fire.

[05:45] It's simply awesome.

[05:47] I will be going to order more of them soon.

[05:50] I can't find nothing over here in Italy so your job is giving us a great help.

[05:54] Pinball greets to all of you.

[05:57] Palo Vanini from Italy.

[05:59] Well, so we have, we got Mark Anderson from Australia.

[06:03] And he invites me over to his house anytime I'm in Australia.

[06:06] Because he probably knows I'll never go there, you know.

[06:10] So that's why, but he's a nice guy.

[06:12] He's a principal of a school and he's big into pinball.

[06:16] And I send him my regards.

[06:18] Norm, I think that's enough letters.

[06:20] Can you just, let me look one more here.

[06:22] If I can find one more.

[06:23] Maybe I won't.

[06:24] Are we done?

[06:27] Yeah, some guy said about us that we're saving pinball.

[06:30] Chuck Emmery.

[06:31] You know, we get letters from all different sources.

[06:33] We get them from the wreck pinball site.

[06:35] We get them from the Maven 3M that site.

[06:38] And we get them from the top cast site.

[06:40] So if you want to send us anything that we'll actually get a couple of criticism.

[06:44] We've had one in seven years.

[06:46] We went out and had a hitman put on that guy.

[06:49] Remember what his name was?

[06:50] No, I don't.

[06:51] Stan Strain.

[06:52] Yeah, I'm not admitting that any.

[06:54] Stan Strain.

[06:55] Norm's email is norm at Maven3M.com in case anybody cares.

[06:59] Stan Strain.

[07:00] Martin.

[07:01] You know, that's enough.

[07:02] Okay, so now we're going to move to another segment because I've about had enough of norm.

[07:07] Here we go.

[07:08] You want me to come up to you?

[07:09] It's time for...

[07:10] Play a wee wee wee wee.

[07:13] Okay, so we're on the line with Trent.

[07:15] Trent is doing our play of the week.

[07:17] Now Trent, you've been working hard.

[07:19] You're up to fourth best pinball player in the whole entire world.

[07:24] How did you pull that off?

[07:25] Well, you just got to keep going to show.

[07:27] You've got to keep playing in tournaments.

[07:28] And just do your back.

[07:30] Keep practicing and pick your battles.

[07:33] Pick your battles.

[07:34] What battle did you pick?

[07:35] You have a little bit of choice when feeding yourself.

[07:39] You know, do you have to search the scores?

[07:41] I know you're going to face in the first round or what part of the bracket you're going to be in.

[07:45] So your last show was that Akron.

[07:47] How was the competition there?

[07:49] The competition was pretty good.

[07:51] And Chris, there was a lot of prizes there.

[07:54] And he rose there.

[07:56] Three guys in the top 10.

[07:58] And I think there were seven guys in the top 50.

[08:00] So it was a pretty good competition.

[08:02] But you came out number one, right?

[08:03] I did.

[08:04] I ended up feeding Chris.

[08:06] And then I ended up getting a prize to win.

[08:09] Wow.

[08:10] You're kind of a pinball stud, aren't you?

[08:12] Yeah, yeah.

[08:13] Okay, so you're at the Texas show right now.

[08:16] I'm calling you.

[08:17] You're actually at the Texas show.

[08:19] Give us a report.

[08:20] How the Texas show is, you know, I would compare it to say, expo or something like that.

[08:26] Well, the show is very good.

[08:28] There are a new location this year.

[08:29] And it's probably three or four times the size of the old location.

[08:33] We're in a night's hotel up in St. Vine Mills.

[08:36] And it's great.

[08:38] You know, there's a lot of machines here to play.

[08:40] You know, there's a few machines for sale.

[08:42] A gene cutting am is making his debut with a giant booth.

[08:47] He's got some new Centaur's Playfields, new eight ball's Playfields, new funhouse Playfields.

[08:53] Along with a bunch of new William's Hearts.

[08:56] Bob and Herbert Senna's here.

[08:58] He's got some of his old Gally VMs.

[09:00] There's a nice tournament going on.

[09:02] We've got four family guys who've been playing.

[09:05] Fun Steve Norgez.

[09:06] Got a booth here.

[09:07] That's the least of his first booth ever.

[09:09] A life is a great show.

[09:11] You know, there's a good stuff for sale.

[09:13] A good machine to play.

[09:14] It's a lot of fun.

[09:15] Okay.

[09:16] Now, are there any seminars?

[09:19] Yes.

[09:20] Dennis Norgeman, who just did part of the Caribbean, along with, you know, Scarsdiff, any 500,

[09:28] Tim Olish and Man, Whitewater, he all did for William.

[09:31] He came and gave a presentation on all his games.

[09:34] Showed us some pictures and had a question and said it was good.

[09:38] And then also Gene.

[09:39] Gene gave a seminar, which I didn't attend.

[09:41] I'm not sure what he was battling about, but he was here too.

[09:44] And have you seen any of the Big Bang bars?

[09:47] Yes.

[09:48] There are two big bang bars here.

[09:50] And the story is, one's regular one is sold.

[09:53] It's a little bit older, it's a prototype.

[09:55] And it's silent auction.

[09:57] The regular one is starting at 10,000.

[09:59] The gold one is starting at 12,000.

[10:01] As far as I know, still no good.

[10:03] Now, what's the play of the week this week?

[10:05] Well, I figured this was playing family guy in the tournament.

[10:08] I would sell a family guy.

[10:10] Okay, Leon, be dog.

[10:12] Well, basically, you've got two main things in family guy.

[10:16] One is the mini play field, which is actually a mini play field.

[10:20] The stewie is created.

[10:22] And also the TV mode.

[10:24] Wait, wait, I thought Pat Waller created it.

[10:26] Well, yeah.

[10:27] Technically, Pat Waller probably created it, but stewie takes credit.

[10:32] But we will like the TV mode by shooting the center, which is the lowest shot.

[10:37] So many spins.

[10:39] We'll like the TV, which is someone who's lighting the bookcase, so you can add something.

[10:43] Shoot it in there, and you'll get one of the modes.

[10:46] There are five TV modes altogether.

[10:48] If you've done that, you've gone through all five modes.

[10:50] There is actually a TV wizard mode.

[10:53] And the point in the wizard mode are actually based on how well you did in a regular mode,

[10:58] which I think is a very good feature.

[11:00] The other thing is the mini play field.

[11:03] There are actually two captive balls on the play field.

[11:06] And one of the side shots from the upper left footer and one of the right-and-ex to the TV scoop.

[11:12] Every time you hit the captive ball, you get lettering pinball.

[11:15] Once you stop pinball, the TV, the scoop is lit for the mini play field.

[11:20] The mini play field is actually a replica of a regular play field.

[11:24] The mentions are all correct as opposed to most of our mini play fields where the four of us are big and just the play field is small.

[11:32] Everything is miniature-eyed.

[11:34] You've got five shots up there.

[11:36] Once you complete all five shots, do we multi-ball parts where you have to actually play the mini play field?

[11:41] And the big play field at the same time.

[11:44] Are there multiple balls on the mini play field?

[11:46] No.

[11:47] Are there we talked about doing that just to make it a little more difficult?

[11:50] There's one five eight inch pinball on the mini play field.

[11:55] They can't go to the camera turn in the footage.

[11:58] And the...

[12:00] So basically what you have to do when Stewie starts is you have to make each of the five shots on the mini play field.

[12:06] At the same time you have to make each of the five character shots on the mini play field.

[12:11] Once you've done all that, the Super Jackpot will be lit for a side shot from the flip or it's very difficult to do.

[12:18] Hmm. And this is the tournament game for there, right?

[12:21] This is the tournament game.

[12:23] And how are you doing?

[12:24] So far I'm qualified for.

[12:26] I'm doing well so far. They're taking the top 16 so I think I'm qualifying in this evening at 11.30.

[12:32] They do have a bunch of tournaments down here which is very cool, unlike some of the other tournaments or shows.

[12:38] You had the...

[12:39] Today the kids tournament were all the kids that had to play.

[12:42] They were probably 30 or 40 kids.

[12:43] And they had the father son or parent child tournament.

[12:46] Today which was really...

[12:48] It was really a head again, probably 30 or 40 people playing.

[12:51] Last night we had to draw your partner which is kind of cool.

[12:54] At the random flying draw, you know, I'm just like in dust for who your partner is going to be.

[12:59] And you played doubles, you know, head to head against the other team.

[13:03] And Kaz and his partner ended up winning and...

[13:07] He walked around his partner and ended up winning.

[13:09] We're getting second.

[13:11] And was this all on Family Guy?

[13:13] That was all on Family Guy.

[13:15] And then tonight we were having a plastic tournament which is going to be on my ball.

[13:20] And they were having an E tournament which is on the clock tower.

[13:26] And that's going on right now.

[13:28] Wow, so some of the grand a good time.

[13:30] Oh, we're having a great time. It's always fun down here.

[13:32] So how does this show compare to say,

[13:34] Allentown and Expo, I mean as far as numbers and things to do and seminars and games for sale,

[13:40] parts for sale, vendors, general attitude, designers, that kind of stuff?

[13:46] I would say the slightly smaller version of Expo.

[13:50] As far as, you know, suppliers and parts and machines are concerned,

[13:54] I would say the attendance is probably quite a bit less as far as collectors go.

[13:58] Most of it are people from the area.

[14:00] There's a lot of, you know, public that come to their show.

[14:04] That goes Expo where you've got all the pinheads are going.

[14:08] Right, not now. And you know, I don't have the ultimate for parts.

[14:11] You know, they got a lot of games to play.

[14:13] They got a lot of parts.

[14:15] Right. And the other is what the new market today, but I didn't go out with them.

[14:19] I don't know how.

[14:21] Okay. All right, well cool. Well, that's Transplay.

[14:23] The week of the day, you're trying to appreciate your on the spot reporting from the Texas Pinball Festival down there.

[14:29] And it sounds like you're having a good time. I hope you do well in the tournament.

[14:33] Because, you know, I want to call you next week. You know, you could easily move up to second or third place without too much problem.

[14:41] In fact, after effort, I'm probably already up to second.

[14:45] But we'll see what happens after this one.

[14:48] As long as I finish at the Josh, I'll be up to the end.

[14:51] You'll be in second place overall, but it's going to be a big stretch to try and catch Keith right in first.

[14:57] Yeah, it'll take all year to see you then.

[15:00] Now, how did he get so far ahead compared to everybody else?

[15:03] He did really well in Papa and he did really well in Expo, which Papa is a four times tournament

[15:09] and Expo is a double tournament.

[15:12] Oh, you mean double the Wapper points or something?

[15:15] Yes, you get double and double the Wapper points.

[15:18] Okay, cool. All right, Trent. Well, thank you very much for your report.

[15:22] Okay, no problem. I was like, all right, take care. You do. Bye.

[15:25] That was our poll. How you doing?

[15:29] Norm, do you like hearing from Trent? I was great little Texas show report.

[15:34] That was great.

[15:35] I'm sure they get around and go into all these different states. That's a long haul.

[15:39] Well, I'm sure they fly.

[15:41] I don't think so. You think Trent flies?

[15:44] I'm pretty darn.

[15:46] There's a lot of dough to spend just to go play pinball.

[15:49] Somebody's got to do it. Hey, he's number two in the world. Number two.

[15:54] How old did they get the guys from foreign countries coming out of here and playing?

[15:57] Yeah, I think like the top eight are all from USA, but there's some guys from Sweden

[16:03] and some other Belgium and that and certainly in the top 15.

[16:07] These guys like wait, lift, lift weights are doing certain procedures to improve their talents.

[16:13] No Canadian, so we're actually taught is in their somewhere, but I can't remember where.

[16:19] You know, but hey, so you know, we got another feature we're going to run right now.

[16:23] And then we'll come back to normal norms of babbling, but here we go.

[16:27] And now it's time for tech, tech, tech.

[16:31] All right, tech, tech tip of the week involves new stern games.

[16:37] I've been given a lot of calls from people with newer stern games, sopranos, NASCAR, you know, all those.

[16:46] I know how to fix them.

[16:48] Yeah, enormous. I've seen in the match.

[16:50] Yeah. And the flippers don't work or the flippers get weak or they work inconsistently.

[16:56] And what happens is that stern, um, stern's manufacturer for the flipper blades that are used on the switch,

[17:04] the cabinet switch for the flippers have some issues.

[17:07] What it is is you got two kind of quarter inch wide copper blades and then they have two contacts on them.

[17:13] And the contacts are tungsten, which is supposed to be a real, real hard material.

[17:17] And the tungsten contacts are kind of form and access they meet.

[17:22] You know, so you got one slash of an axe and the other slash of the axe.

[17:25] But right where they meet, right at that cross section, you get this divot in the, in the, in the contact points.

[17:32] And that will prevent them from making good contact.

[17:34] And the reason why you get that divot is the company that was making the switch blades,

[17:39] uh, changed their tempering technique on the blades.

[17:42] And they screwed it up so that the blades weren't the actual contact points weren't being tempered correctly.

[17:49] So you get this little divot in them.

[17:51] And what I would, what I did, you can get new blades of course from stern that have, have fixed this problem.

[17:57] Um, but what I did in a, in a pinch is I've got a bunch of got leave EM switch blades that I buy from Steve Young.

[18:03] And I use from EM games.

[18:05] These cells have been light medium and heavy gauge.

[18:07] So I've got the heavy ones because those are the ones I use the most for, for got leave EM flipper, um, flippers, uh, buttons.

[18:14] And then I also bought from Steve Young a bunch of gold flash contacts.

[18:18] And I can, um, the neat thing about the Steve Young blades is that they're drilled in multiple places.

[18:24] So you can put the contact anywhere you want.

[18:27] And then you just solder it to the back of the blade.

[18:30] And so that's what I do.

[18:32] I just use those two blades and I, uh, flip them into the switch stack for the new stern games.

[18:36] And they have two nice new gold flash contacts and, um, you know, basically the less forever.

[18:41] So what games had this problem?

[18:43] Let's see, I done it to a sopranos.

[18:46] I fixed and, um, it wasn't NASCAR.

[18:50] It was something similar, something, oh, Terminator 3.

[18:53] So Terminator 3 and, um, and, uh, and sopranos have been the two that I've had to do that for.

[19:00] But I've heard other people that have had that.

[19:02] I think this will happen on all those games.

[19:04] It's from the same vendor at the same time.

[19:07] I'm really, really hoping that they all break.

[19:10] And then people, because, okay, so let's fall plug me in norm.

[19:15] We don't have enough pinballs.

[19:18] And we're looking for new games to acquire.

[19:21] Hey, you don't wait.

[19:22] Let me end this here.

[19:23] Tech, tech, tech, tech.

[19:25] All right. That was the tech tip of the week.

[19:27] Now we're going to move on to spam.

[19:28] Uh, this is norm and, and shaggy spam.

[19:31] You know, I heard that somebody gave Cliffey.

[19:35] I, a brand new Simpson's pinball party.

[19:39] Because he's a great guy.

[19:41] How come me and norm don't get free game?

[19:44] Wait, wait, you got a free game from who?

[19:46] I don't know some guy.

[19:48] Like, mail them a game and he opened it up and he got a, a free like Simpson's pinball party.

[19:52] Yeah.

[19:53] Like three plays on it or something like that.

[19:54] He making this up.

[19:55] I'm not making it up for him.

[19:57] Well, then maybe he's got a thing for Cliffey.

[19:59] They got a thing going on, you know what I mean?

[20:02] No, no, no, I don't think so.

[20:04] So I, I want to know why, uh, why norm and I don't,

[20:07] you don't get, uh, opportunities like this.

[20:09] I would even be willing to pay money for, for one of those games.

[20:13] Yes, it's true.

[20:14] Alright, so anyways, then up for our spam.

[20:17] Um, we're going to now move on to, um, curb's, systematic, uh, tech tip of the week.

[20:25] And here we go with curb.

[20:28] And now, top cast is happy to present.

[20:31] I survived, systematic.

[20:34] Presented by the man with all the answers.

[20:37] Curve!

[20:39] Hey, everyone, it's curved with a quick systematic tech tip.

[20:43] This tip has to do with coil test and troubleshooting.

[20:46] The systematic coil tests are crude at best and can't test non-CPU control coils.

[20:52] When trying to find a non-firing coil, be sure to remember that systematic uses two relays

[20:57] to block the voltage being supplied to some coils.

[21:00] The game over relay Q, and tilt relay T, can block power to supply to many coils.

[21:07] Make sure you have power to the coils before tracking down bad connectors, switches, or transistors.

[21:13] The Q and T relay are sometimes mounted in an area of the play field that allows these relays to get damaged.

[21:20] Inspect the relays and make sure they work properly.

[21:23] Don't forget to check out the systematic repair guides and the great systematic,

[21:27] and this is OpenBall DVDs at marvin3m.com and shoot Cheg in email if you have a system 80 tech tip that you want us to cover.

[21:39] And just to kind of add something to that.

[21:42] You know, on the other solid state games, you have a game over relay.

[21:47] By the other manufacturer, it's mounted either on the solenoid driver board or somewhere up in the head.

[21:53] We've got to put their game over relay to Q relay for system 80.

[21:57] It's actually mounted usually under the play field.

[21:59] And it's more open.

[22:02] It doesn't have a little clear plastic case on it.

[22:04] It's more easily damaged as it may be.

[22:07] What were you going to say, Norm?

[22:09] I said getting back to those free games if anyone wants to give me a free old gun game that's decent or Williams 50's base pod B.

[22:17] Really happy with you.

[22:20] You want to pay us back for all this free work we've done?

[22:22] What would you like? What would you be your new vine there?

[22:25] Shaggy.

[22:26] What would you do?

[22:27] One million dollars.

[22:29] Nobody's going to give you a gun game either, so stop asking.

[22:32] Sure they might.

[22:33] They might do it.

[22:34] No, no.

[22:35] I bet you that could happen.

[22:36] No, it's not going to happen.

[22:38] We'll wait.

[22:39] We'll take a bet on this.

[22:40] Yeah, it's not going to happen.

[22:41] How many years do we have on this bet?

[22:43] Ten.

[22:44] It's about ten minutes.

[22:45] We'll have a call.

[22:46] At the end of the show, we'll see if you get a gun game.

[22:48] We'll listen to the show.

[22:49] They all downloaded it.

[22:50] Yeah.

[22:51] Oh, let's see.

[22:53] Okay, so now we're going to move on to our next little segment, which is my personal favorite.

[23:00] And now it's time for...

[23:02] Stop up a jump!

[23:05] It's time for Stump the Chump.

[23:06] We're going to call a guy that we gave some technical advice to last week and see if our technical advice actually solved his problem or if we struck out.

[23:17] We're going to talk to the gentleman named Rex and he had a white water.

[23:21] And we're going to see if we solved his problems.

[23:24] But first, let's go back to last week's episode.

[23:26] And here, what his problem was and what advice we gave him.

[23:30] Yeah, this is Rex and Oregon.

[23:32] I have a white water.

[23:34] And F-111 blows on it about every 50 games or so.

[23:39] The flasters go out and then the copper lights go out.

[23:41] The chaser lights go out.

[23:42] When the fuse goes out,

[23:44] the playfield flasters go out and also the top there.

[23:50] It's a 5-volt slow blow.

[23:52] You mean a 5-amp slow blow?

[23:54] A 5-amp slow blow, yeah.

[23:56] Right, right.

[23:57] I would break the system down in the smaller chunks.

[24:00] First thing I would do is I disconnect the 194 bulbs all of them.

[24:05] There's a connector somewhere that runs power to that waterfall thing on top of the back box.

[24:11] I would go to the...

[24:14] There's a chaser board up in the top.

[24:17] I could disconnect the voltage off of that.

[24:19] Right, disconnect that, connect the board, that chaser board,

[24:22] and the power that it outputs to the lamps.

[24:26] Just take that whole thing out of the system.

[24:28] And he said it takes about 50 games to see if it blows.

[24:31] Yeah.

[24:32] Okay, that I would play 50 games.

[24:35] And just see what happens.

[24:41] Okay, that's what happened last week.

[24:43] Now we're back and let's give Rex a call in Oregon and see how things worked out with his white water.

[24:49] Let's get him on the line.

[24:51] Hello.

[24:52] Hi, is Rex here?

[24:54] This is Rex.

[24:55] Rex, the shaggy colony back on top cast to see if...

[25:07] How are technical advice played out on your white water last week?

[25:11] All right.

[25:12] Okay, so we gave you some advice that maybe you should break the system down into smaller parts.

[25:18] And maybe that would help find where the problem lied if it was either with the flashers or with your waterfall lights on the top of the back box.

[25:28] So what did you find out and what did you do and what worked and what didn't?

[25:32] Well, the first thing I did was to disconnect the connector to the chase board that was in the upper right hand side of the back box.

[25:47] Yeah, that's basically the power to the...

[25:50] To the power, the blanking signal that goes up there and connects it to the whole system.

[25:55] Yeah, and that connects the waterfall lights to the system.

[25:59] Yes, and that's plug one up there.

[26:05] And when I did that, I noticed that pins one and two were black and I looked at my schematics and that's the 16 volts AC that comes in after the F111, the fuse that was blowing.

[26:20] And I just left the hanging there and I don't have the parts to replace the connector yet.

[26:28] But I just left the connector hanging there and played many games like you told me to.

[26:35] And also to put a little stress on the system, I went through the flasher test several times.

[26:42] It sits right by my computer desk so I can run it through the flasher test and it goes cycling through all the flashers.

[26:49] Oh, 6, 7, 8, 9 times before it turns itself off and no fuse blown.

[26:58] And so I'm assuming that the problem is there at that connector.

[27:02] Yeah, probably at that connector.

[27:04] If the black and pins on the connector mean that the connector is taking on too much current, more current than that connector is capable of handling.

[27:14] And you're probably going to have to replace the pins in the female side with like Turf-Friedcon style Molex pins and replace the male header pins on the little board.

[27:27] And I think if you do those two things that should probably stop the current consumption and fuse blowing problem.

[27:34] I think the black and pins is definitely a sign that there was a problem.

[27:40] Yeah, and it makes sense too because the the chaser lights, they run all the time.

[27:47] And so it's going to put a lot of strain on that connection.

[27:53] I think if you just replace the connector housing if it's burnt or you can reuse it either way.

[27:59] And use some trifor-con pins, Molex trifor-con pins which are better resistant to a vibration environment.

[28:08] And you don't have the parts if you want. You know, email me your mailing address and it's nothing else.

[28:13] I'll slip them in and I'll open the center to you.

[28:16] Oh, that sounds great.

[28:17] Yeah, sure. That's fine.

[28:18] So basically it sounds like we're on the right track and we gave you the right advice.

[28:22] Oh, yes. It's amazing. I just took the pin off and there it was.

[28:27] I'll burn it up. You can see it from the outside.

[28:29] Right. Yeah. It's just a matter of breaking the system down into smaller parts and examining the smaller parts until you find the one that's causing the problems.

[28:37] And fortunately it was the first thing, the first tree branch you went down was the one that was the problem.

[28:44] So it made you like a little easier.

[28:46] All right.

[28:47] Okay. Well, hey, thank you very much Rex. You made me your address and I'll get that stuff off to you.

[28:51] All right. Thank you.

[28:52] All right. Take care.

[28:55] So it looks like we call that one right. Hard to believe.

[28:59] But the chumps actually pull you on the bag and did okay this time.

[29:05] Unbelievable.

[29:07] Stop. Stop.

[29:09] So what's our banning average on this stuff?

[29:15] I think we're doing pretty good.

[29:17] I think it's like in a 7800 range, which is outstanding for not knowing much.

[29:22] Well, that would certainly apply to your situation.

[29:25] Well, Eric seemed to do pretty well. He was giving you a run for the money.

[29:28] No, I need to be honest with you. The guy said this to me.

[29:31] I told him not to say anything in the phone call, but actually the advice Eric gave him a long,

[29:38] he said that the voltage got rectified by the power driver board and then went to that little driver board,

[29:46] that little tiny driver board up in the head and that was actually incorrect.

[29:50] It goes through the F-111 fuse as AC goes up to that little board and the little board does the rectification up there as needed.

[29:59] So actually Eric will send them down the wrong way.

[30:02] Oh, you're the best. You're the best.

[30:04] We're about all the times I was right on this thing and the connect is an A and Stadled you because I beat you.

[30:09] And I don't know a damn thing pretty much.

[30:11] All I know is.

[30:13] I get lucky. What, a squirrel finds a nut once in a while.

[30:17] Is that a lucky squirrel? No, blind squirrel.

[30:19] It's under review whether we're going to let Eric come back again.

[30:24] He's a good guy. Yeah, he is. We're going to let him come back.

[30:26] The other thing too that was kind of interesting about the last show.

[30:31] Mort. Do you want to talk about Mort?

[30:33] Yeah, I think people think he's irritating. I think he's funny.

[30:37] We need a lot of different weird people in this world to make it cool around.

[30:41] I think he certainly qualifies.

[30:44] He sounded like another guy that used to have a radio show and that's what I thought it was but I don't know if I can mention his name.

[30:50] No, you can't.

[30:52] Yeah, Mort was interesting. I think there was only a couple of people.

[30:56] I took a poll that I actually liked him and everybody else.

[30:59] It was like, you know, 9 million to three.

[31:01] Well, I was one of the yeses.

[31:03] Yeah, that liked Mort.

[31:04] But he's out of his mind for God's sakes.

[31:07] Mort, I can relate to that.

[31:09] Yeah, Mort will be back. I trust you. Mort will be back.

[31:12] All right, now we're going to move to our next series.

[31:16] And I want to tell people the phone number to call for this because this is Corns conundrum.

[31:19] And Corns conundrum is a call in aspect of the show where people can call in and win junk.

[31:25] It's about like byproducts of corn like testido chips and that's what it's about.

[31:31] Right. Corncabs and corn nuts.

[31:34] And this is what the questions are about.

[31:36] Finally, right?

[31:37] No. Okay, so like I've got some junk to give away.

[31:41] This is the junk I've got today.

[31:43] I've got more kuiper thin, cliffy protectors.

[31:46] He sent me a pile of them. I got a ton of those.

[31:49] I have DVDs.

[31:51] I have some top DVDs.

[31:53] Wow.

[31:54] I have some pins and vids DVDs.

[31:56] I have the system of the 11 music showcase CD which is like normal once a copy.

[32:04] I'm just looking.

[32:05] And he wants to listen to that.

[32:07] You know, so but I've got more of those.

[32:09] So I've got a bunch of crap to give away.

[32:12] So if anybody wants to call, we're going to tell you what the phone number is now.

[32:16] It's 1-800 and now it's time for.

[32:20] Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the arcade.

[32:24] Corncadero.

[32:26] Hi, people it's the corn and welcome to this week's version of the conundrum.

[32:30] Here's how the game works.

[32:31] I give 10 clues about a game's identity.

[32:34] That's up to the listeners that's you to call in and guess what game it is.

[32:38] Pretty simple, right?

[32:39] If nobody gets it, I keep giving more and more clues until someone nails it.

[32:44] What is this week's prize, Shaggy?

[32:46] Well, as we were saying, hyper thin cliffy protectors of your choice system 11 music showcase, top DVDs, and pins and vids DVDs.

[32:54] Alright, let's play.

[32:56] Clues number one through five.

[32:59] This is a Williams game.

[33:02] It's a system seven machine.

[33:04] System seven.

[33:05] It has dual play fields.

[33:07] And it was designed by Barry Orcel.

[33:10] And as usual, here are a whole bunch of sounds from this game in no particular order.

[33:21] Oh, that helps.

[33:37] So that basically sounds like every system seven game in the world that doesn't have speech.

[34:05] I mean, they all use the same goofy kind of defenderish sounds.

[34:10] But what we're going to do is give a call in 1-800-375.

[34:15] Oh my god, I think the boat is ringing.

[34:18] God, it woke me.

[34:20] Answer it quick.

[34:21] Okay, we're going to answer the phone right now and see who's on the line.

[34:25] Alright, let's get a money.

[34:27] Hello, welcome to Topcast.

[34:29] Yep, I'm Colin Dominguez here.

[34:31] Is that by chance Kazanek gunfight?

[34:33] It is not.

[34:34] It is not cosmic gunfight.

[34:36] Oh, that is too bad.

[34:37] You give me another gas.

[34:38] We'll give you another gas since you're on the phone.

[34:40] Another gas?

[34:41] Sure.

[34:42] Quick, you have five seconds.

[34:44] No.

[34:45] Oh, too late.

[34:46] Too late.

[34:47] Nope.

[34:48] Okay, we're going to take the next call.

[34:50] I'm so excited.

[34:51] Hi, you're on Topcast.

[34:54] Hey, how'd it go on?

[34:56] Good.

[34:57] So, do you have a gas for a corn's conundrum?

[34:59] Is it jungle, Lord?

[35:00] It is not jungle, Lord.

[35:02] I'll give you a second gas.

[35:03] Is it the black hole?

[35:04] It is a godly, even I know that.

[35:07] It's got two play fields.

[35:10] Yeah, but it's probably the wrong manufacturer.

[35:12] It's okay.

[35:13] It sounds like the same.

[35:14] It's William.

[35:15] I give it to many people.

[35:16] Black hole is by Williams.

[35:17] It's like a jungle lord and he says not jungle lord.

[35:19] It's not jungle lord.

[35:20] Then you said it was black hole.

[35:22] Who are you calling from?

[35:23] We're making fun of your black hole gas.

[35:25] Not the jungle lord one.

[35:27] Who are you calling from?

[35:28] One last week.

[35:29] One of these weeks it's got to be Ed.

[35:30] Yeah, you figure.

[35:32] Who are you calling from?

[35:33] Norm wants to know where you're from.

[35:35] Union City Michigan.

[35:36] Okay.

[35:37] All right.

[35:38] Well, hey, thank you.

[35:39] Can I try again if I find the answer?

[35:40] Sure.

[35:41] Oh, I'll back immediately.

[35:42] All right.

[35:43] Bye.

[35:44] Hi, you're on top cast.

[35:47] Hi, you're on top cast.

[35:49] I'm trying to run the matter back.

[35:53] Hello.

[35:54] Yes, sir.

[35:55] Hello, you're on top cast.

[35:56] Speak open.

[35:57] I'd like to guess the corn's conundrum.

[36:00] That'd be great.

[36:01] What do you got?

[36:02] Black knight.

[36:03] It's not black knight.

[36:04] No, that's what I was going to use.

[36:07] It's not black knight.

[36:08] But we thank you.

[36:09] You know, I would have to book a red card.

[36:11] Take care.

[36:12] Hi, you're on top cast.

[36:15] Hi, try again if I find the answer.

[36:17] Yeah, I think I had a guess for your gain of the day.

[36:20] Sure.

[36:21] Sounds a lot like black knight to me.

[36:24] It's not.

[36:25] And the reason why it's not is because of the lack of sound and speech.

[36:29] There's no sound or speech, so you know it's not black knight.

[36:32] Oh, man.

[36:33] Okay, well, thank you, though.

[36:34] Next.

[36:35] Nice.

[36:36] Don't go, Lord.

[36:37] Nope, not that either.

[36:38] Hey, okay, it's better.

[36:40] Thanks.

[36:41] Hi, you're on top cast.

[36:43] Is it Starlight?

[36:44] It is not Starlight.

[36:46] Boy, it's getting close, though.

[36:48] All right, we've got some more things, but we'll say, I really appreciate it.

[36:53] Paul, I just let him answer that.

[36:56] All right, next one.

[36:57] Bye.

[36:59] Hi, you're on top cast.

[37:01] Hi, I have a guess for the game.

[37:04] Sure.

[37:05] What do you think?

[37:06] Solar fire?

[37:07] My God, it is solar fire.

[37:09] Oh, it's fire for you.

[37:11] It's solar fire.

[37:12] And what's your name?

[37:13] Ethan.

[37:14] Ethan, how did you guess that it was solar fire?

[37:17] Well, we think in maybe gunfight, but then somebody called in.

[37:23] Right.

[37:24] And then somebody, you know, with their other Collins and we were narrowing down the

[37:29] orchard list, remember playing that at Papa.

[37:32] And it was a game we were in the market for, too.

[37:35] Oh, you don't have that siren.

[37:37] Remember this siren.

[37:38] Right.

[37:39] You don't have the pinball book and you just go through System 7.

[37:41] He's got the inner.

[37:42] That's what I do at the database.

[37:43] So, what you need to do is send me an email, shaggy at marvin3m.com.

[37:48] Hi.

[37:49] Well, what was your first name again?

[37:50] Ethan.

[37:51] Ethan.

[37:52] Ethan.

[37:53] Ethan, I'm going to remember that.

[37:54] Ethan, you call back and or call back.

[37:57] You email Ian with your address and what do you want to, you want to go to the

[38:02] contact?

[38:03] We're going to go with the System 11.

[38:04] Show us.

[38:05] Down.

[38:06] CD thing.

[38:07] Okay, great.

[38:08] Just make sure you tell me that in the email, too, with your address and I'll send it right

[38:11] out to you.

[38:12] We'll do.

[38:13] All right.

[38:14] Hey, thanks a lot.

[38:15] Bye-bye.

[38:16] All right.

[38:17] Bye.

[38:18] Nora, what did you think of that?

[38:19] I didn't even have to play.

[38:20] I didn't even play all of the hints.

[38:21] We had more hints.

[38:22] I'm going to just put the fun of it.

[38:23] I think that we already know.

[38:24] Here's more hints.

[38:25] People have to know what it is yet.

[38:26] No.

[38:27] Well, here's five more clues in case you don't.

[38:29] Okay, we already know.

[38:30] But we're going to let him lose 6-3 in that anyways.

[38:33] This machine has four drop target banks.

[38:36] You know, the rest of the details of corn's guesses for solar fire really

[38:45] wouldn't have helped me either.

[38:46] It was just a matter of narrowing it down when people saw that.

[38:50] But anyways, we're going to take a little break.

[38:51] We're going to run an ad and take a little break.

[38:53] We'll be back in about 30 seconds.

[38:54] Top guess is brought to you by Pinball Life.

[38:57] Give you a Pinball Machine.

[38:58] New Life with parts from Pinball Life.

[39:00] We ship Pinball Parts.

[39:01] We'll walk.

[39:02] Pinball Life is located in the Great City of Chicago.

[39:05] Their number is 773-202-8790.

[39:09] We have an open door policy and you're welcome to call us with your questions and concerns.

[39:14] 80M to 5PM, send us on Monday through Friday.

[39:17] The website is at PinballLife.com.

[39:19] Pinball Life.

[39:20] The last one is just the parts you need next.

[39:24] Okay, we're at the part of the show where we're taking calls for any tech questions.

[39:28] If you want to call in with a tech question, it's 1-800.

[39:32] Or if you're that last caller that didn't get through for the guests, you can call back and guess again.

[39:37] Even though you know the answer now.

[39:39] But if you've got any tech questions you want to call in, give us a ring and we'd be happy to talk to you.

[39:44] And the meantime, we also take them via email.

[39:47] And I've got a couple here that people have emailed off the topcast website.

[39:51] There is actually a link where you can submit tech questions for us to kind of...

[39:57] Give me a norm, get this email and we kind of can digest them over the week.

[40:01] It's kind of cheating.

[40:03] But here we go, we got a couple things here.

[40:06] But you can't be an idiot, Savant all the time and know everything off the top of your head.

[40:10] Well, sure you might, you can be, but not me.

[40:13] Okay, here we go. We got it one from a guy named Jim Krizmall in Ordell, New Jersey.

[40:20] He says, I'm interested in clear-coding and touching up my own playfields using automotive clears.

[40:26] I have the necessary spray equipment and understand the safety risks and need for protective clothing and eye wear.

[40:33] We're going to put this on hold. Hold on a second. We've got a call.

[40:37] It's Gary!

[40:38] Hi, you're on topcast.

[40:41] She asked, sir. Hey, great to see you.

[40:43] Okay, who's this?

[40:44] This is Chuck from Benton, Wisconsin.

[40:47] Chuck, how can I help you today?

[40:49] First of all, I got to thank Norm. He said my name on the air earlier and it was like having my name spoken by the gods.

[40:54] When did I say this?

[40:56] Oh, you mean you sent Norm a letter?

[40:59] Yeah, he read my name earlier. He said you guys were saving good and well and I think that's pretty accurate.

[41:06] Did Norm catch on that? He had a stick around his ass there? Or did you have to clone in on that?

[41:11] Oh, stickers, yes. They're very nice.

[41:13] Yes, he did.

[41:14] It's a very nice thing.

[41:15] He's not supposed to put anything free and I sent you some free stickers. So it's not a Benton ball machine, but a...

[41:19] Hey, it's great. I appreciate it and need more people in a world like you to do nice things for people.

[41:24] Norm, what he did is he gave a bunch of those stickers to his wife and told her to go get on dress and get imaginative with these and come back out in three minutes.

[41:34] I hope in both sticker pasties.

[41:36] Something like that. I don't want to ask you many more details than that.

[41:40] All right, Chuck, do you get any kind of a tech question for us?

[41:43] I got a definite tech question for you.

[41:45] Oh, no. Here it comes.

[41:47] All right. I got an Adam's family that I bought off coin up route that had a million problems.

[41:53] I got them all fixed, but one. My back glass doesn't flash.

[41:58] I can go into the system test and it breaks it down into the inserts. I believe are people in house.

[42:05] And you can make them dim individually, but you don't give any action when you turn the game on.

[42:12] You mean the only flashing I know of are the 455 bulbs that are used in there like for, you know, the window and that they have separate 455 actual flashing light bulbs.

[42:26] Can you put flash bulbs? This flash your bulbs in there?

[42:29] Yeah, everything is a constant burn in the back glass.

[42:32] Oh, you mean you can't dim the GI. Is that what you were saying?

[42:35] What's that? I'm sorry?

[42:37] You can't dim the general illumination string?

[42:39] No, you can dim them, but it seems like they're both acting like a general illumination string.

[42:45] It's like if you can dim the inserts and the lightning bolt kind of flash that goes through the center of it.

[42:50] But it just burns constant when you turn the game on. Nothing flashes off and on individually.

[42:57] I guess I'm confused. Maybe we should turn yours on. How go run and go look?

[43:02] Yeah, go turn it on. I'm going to go look. He's going to turn on my atoms.

[43:07] I don't think that they do flash. I think the only flashing that happens in the back box of atoms, like I said,

[43:14] was just if you have four or five five bulbs, flash your bulbs actually in the appropriate sockets in the back box.

[43:21] I think that's the only flashing that's going on, but normally actually we went around the corner to turn my atoms on.

[43:27] It'll probably take them 20 minutes to find the power switch.

[43:30] But I'll tell you what.

[43:33] No, they flash.

[43:34] Wait, he says they flash what flashes?

[43:36] The little light bulbs behind the windows they sort of go on.

[43:40] Yeah, that's the four or five five.

[43:42] Those are flashing bulbs.

[43:44] Yeah, those are flashing bulbs.

[43:45] What's what I said? Maybe he needs flashing bulbs in there.

[43:47] Does he have flashers in there? Do you have any flashing bulbs in there?

[43:50] I'm guessing that it's probably five or five. I never even thought that far ahead.

[43:54] I figured it would be a try-act or something.

[43:56] There's no flashing bulbs.

[43:57] It's overlooked the obvious apparently.

[43:59] Yeah, there's just flashing bulbs.

[44:00] I came up with the right answer.

[44:02] Well, the flash is kind of... oh god, I just don't want to admit anything to this guy.

[44:07] You know, it's like it goes to his hat.

[44:09] Got me to rip your game apart and see what kind of bulbs are in it.

[44:12] All right, here.

[44:14] You talked to him normally.

[44:15] No, no, I'll talk to him.

[44:16] You talked to him.

[44:17] You talked to him.

[44:18] So you got a printing business?

[44:20] Yeah.

[44:21] What do you print?

[44:23] That file is awesome.

[44:24] You can be perfectly honest.

[44:25] Our biggest account is John Deere.

[44:27] John Deere, that's got to be a big account.

[44:29] But Boy, we can be doing play fields on a heartbeat.

[44:31] And I'd love to go that direction someday.

[44:33] I've contacted Stern a couple times,

[44:35] but they're pretty set looking who they're with right now.

[44:38] So you could be moving on to bigger and better things.

[44:41] But at least that would be in my mind, bigger and better things.

[44:43] Spinball, you know?

[44:44] So you could do glasses?

[44:45] Financially probably not a great move.

[44:47] No, you could do glasses if you could.

[44:49] You could do pinball glass?

[44:51] Wow.

[44:52] Okay, I'm back.

[44:53] Shut up.

[44:54] We're talking something important here.

[44:55] No, okay.

[44:56] So yes, there's a combination of wedge style sockets and bayonets sockets.

[45:02] So if it's a wedge socket that's a 555,

[45:05] and if it's a bayonet, you put in a 455,

[45:07] and the 455, of course, is the flasher.

[45:10] So that's all there is to it.

[45:12] It's a pretty low attack.

[45:13] Man, well, I feel like you can please dumbass.

[45:16] No, that's fine.

[45:17] That's what you call for.

[45:18] And you're going to make me that free gun patrol back glass

[45:20] because you could do what you said.

[45:22] We'll do anything for Norm.

[45:24] Really, it's a losing proposition.

[45:26] Thank you so much.

[45:27] It's a losing proposition, trust me.

[45:29] Hey, hey, hey.

[45:31] Okay, well, hey, Chuck, I appreciate the call though.

[45:34] All right.

[45:35] All right, you take care.

[45:36] Thanks for coming.

[45:37] See you.

[45:38] Bye-bye.

[45:39] Norm.

[45:41] Well, sometimes the obvious is, you know,

[45:44] there's obvious things that you've made mistakes on,

[45:47] and we're not all knowing.

[45:49] No one is all knowing.

[45:50] Yes, especially you.

[45:51] 1-800, if you want to call in with a tech question.

[45:55] Anyways, we're back to that one I was reading when the phone call came in.

[45:59] I was going to spray in a verithane.

[46:00] He wanted to know if it was possible.

[46:01] Well, he's doing an automotive clear.

[46:03] He says, I have the necessary spray equipment to understand the safety risks

[46:06] and the need for protective clothing, eye wear and respiration.

[46:09] I'm a bit concerned about the toxicity of the over spray vapor,

[46:13] lingering effects of spraying this material.

[46:16] My detached garage is fairly close to my neighbor's house.

[46:20] Yeah, I would four feet.

[46:21] I wouldn't care about it in so much.

[46:23] I'm a dog cat.

[46:24] And I'm a bit worried about this stuff blowing around

[46:27] and injuring others with secondhand vapors.

[46:30] Just how long does it linger?

[46:31] And how much space do I really need?

[46:33] I personally, I emailed them, but then my email bounced back

[46:37] because I think I by mistake emailed it to you.

[46:39] Yeah, way to go.

[46:40] But I told them not to do it.

[46:42] But if you had to do it.

[46:44] I don't see it as a huge concern.

[46:46] I would spray during money to Friday, like nine to five,

[46:51] when people are at work, you know, when they're not around.

[46:55] I spray it late in the evening when there's no wind

[46:58] and when people are sleeping and no one's out.

[47:00] I may do like midnight.

[47:01] No, no, no.

[47:02] I would do it during the day.

[47:03] No, no.

[47:04] And you can't do it.

[47:05] You can't do it in high winds because you know,

[47:06] you just don't want to craft spray on your play field.

[47:09] But the main thing is, no, it doesn't.

[47:10] At night, one o'clock at night.

[47:12] No one's up.

[47:13] It's calm outside at night.

[47:15] Yeah, during the summer when they get their windows open

[47:17] so it's fogs into their house.

[47:18] They have a blowing, have an old fan at your window

[47:21] to blow that crap out.

[47:23] No, it doesn't linger that long.

[47:25] It just depends on how much wind is there.

[47:27] It's kind of like a cloud.

[47:28] And how fast the cloud moves depends how fast the wind is blowing

[47:33] literally.

[47:34] You know, and it could clear out in 30 seconds.

[47:37] And here's a man that sprayed verithane in his basement

[47:40] without any protection or venting.

[47:42] Or more more more.

[47:43] You talk about, you're going to take advice from a guy like this.

[47:46] Hi, you're on top cast.

[47:48] Oh, yes, Shag.

[47:50] Yes.

[47:51] How are you?

[47:52] I'm not too bad.

[47:53] How are you today?

[47:54] Good.

[47:55] My norm.

[47:56] Hello.

[47:57] Yeah, question I had for you.

[47:58] You mentioned earlier about rebuilding the contacts

[48:00] on the flipper back cabinet buttons.

[48:02] Yes, the stern.

[48:03] Yes.

[48:04] The stern.

[48:05] Yeah, on the stern.

[48:06] On any, I've gotten the tips from Steve as well on the past.

[48:10] And I seem to overdo it when I squeeze them.

[48:14] I crack them occasionally.

[48:15] You have a special tool or anything you use on them.

[48:18] I've just tried using pliers and putting them in front of the contact

[48:22] to protect it when I squeeze it.

[48:24] But it's like either to get their loose or to get them really tight.

[48:27] You're on the verge of splitting the surface.

[48:30] Yeah, I think you're taking the wrong technique.

[48:32] This is what I do.

[48:33] The contacts, the way they fit in the blades are just loose.

[48:37] They rattle around in the hole, literally.

[48:39] And I know what you mean.

[48:41] You're trying to pin the end of the contact end that goes through the blade.

[48:45] Yeah, just solder them.

[48:47] Just solder it from the back and don't even attempt to do that.

[48:50] Oh, really?

[48:51] A little bit of flux and some solder.

[48:53] Actually, you don't even need to flush.

[48:55] Just regular 60-40 solder and just solder them on from the back

[48:59] and you're good as gold and you don't have to worry about peening them

[49:02] or any of that stuff.

[49:03] Oh, cool.

[49:04] That's a heck of a lot easier.

[49:06] But good luck with that, okay?

[49:07] All right.

[49:08] Thanks a lot.

[49:09] All right.

[49:10] All right, no, you're welcome.

[49:11] Have a good one.

[49:12] Okay, here's another one.

[49:13] We got this one.

[49:14] Another one came in from the site.

[49:15] This is from Chris Hibbler.

[49:17] Now, Chris wrote us about his high speed, his system 11 high speed.

[49:23] It says, I have a technical question today for your calling show.

[49:26] I have a Williams high speed that does not have the beacon assembly on it.

[49:30] The WPC repair docs cover what to do when I get away at WPC game is missing the beacon

[49:38] but not on the high speed.

[49:40] The high speed uses 24 volts AC for the beacon and you suggest using a 12-volt DC beacon

[49:47] from HAP products as used in the getaway.

[49:50] We'll come right back to that.

[49:51] We'll take this call.

[49:52] This is Notes.

[49:53] Hi, how are you?

[49:55] Hey, I'm a fish tail and I was wondering if you knew of a way that I could fix.

[50:04] You know, the back of the tail where the solenoid activates and it pushes the fish tail.

[50:11] Yeah, we're pushes the fish's butt.

[50:14] Right, yep, yep.

[50:15] Well, I've been in the factory.

[50:18] There's the metal plate that pushes on.

[50:21] Right, so it doesn't push through the kind of silicone body and ruin it.

[50:26] It's about halfway pushed through.

[50:28] Do you know of any f***ing?

[50:31] Anyway, to fix that, yeah.

[50:33] Put a bigger plate on.

[50:35] Just increase the size of the plate to overlap the old one.

[50:39] Can you move it?

[50:40] Is there any way of moving it?

[50:41] I don't know how the plates attach to the fish's butt belt.

[50:44] Maybe you could put something in there like a baffle attached to a piece of plate.

[50:47] No, you don't.

[50:48] Don't listen to the norm.

[50:49] Or a cushion in the metal, so I won't be cutting through that.

[50:51] I would just install a larger plate.

[50:55] I guess the way I would do it if the existing plate was still locked in place nicely,

[51:01] I would probably just lightly drill it with eighth inch holes and just literally pop the rivet

[51:06] on a new larger plate.

[51:08] It's a piece of plastic on the back.

[51:10] I wouldn't do plastic, that'll break.

[51:12] Not Lexan.

[51:13] Yes, Lexan will break too.

[51:14] It's going to get hit hard.

[51:16] Okay.

[51:17] So that's what I would do.

[51:18] You think that'll work?

[51:19] Put an extender on there.

[51:20] Yeah, give it a try.

[51:21] Yeah, give it a whirl.

[51:22] Let us know.

[51:23] Let me know when.

[51:24] Let me know how it went.

[51:25] A lot.

[51:26] Okay, thank you.

[51:29] I don't think he was that happy with our response.

[51:32] I don't know, I think he was.

[51:34] I mean, it's a good suggestion.

[51:36] There's a lot of ways to do things.

[51:38] 1-800 if you have another tech question.

[51:40] Anyways, back to the one that we're reading.

[51:44] Chris from Chris Hibbler and his, his, his,

[51:48] his, his, is trying to install a 12 volt DC beacon.

[51:53] On a high speed.

[51:54] On a high speed.

[51:55] On his high speed that uses 24 volt AC for the beacon.

[51:58] So he, he goes through and says that he,

[52:01] he went to an electricians friend,

[52:03] and said, how can I convert this 24 volts AC to 12 volts DC?

[52:07] And electricians said, what are you doing?

[52:09] Cut the beacon 1-1-2.

[52:11] No, don't cut the beacon 1-1-2.

[52:13] What you can do is, as your electrician friend suggested,

[52:17] two AC-C lugs of the bridge and then the two output lugs of the bridge will be you know

[52:22] more or less 24 volts DC.

[52:25] Run those through a filter cap and the filter cap size doesn't really matter.

[52:29] Your electrician buddy suggested a 150 microfarot.

[52:33] You could go higher if you want to.

[52:34] You could go you know up to 3200.

[52:38] You can go up to 10,000 if you need it too but you don't really need to since this is

[52:42] just going to be powering a motor.

[52:45] And then bring it in to a 7812 voltage regulator which the 7812 looks like a basically like a

[52:51] tip 102 transistor and there's a what's known as a VN pin that that's the DC voltage coming

[52:58] in and then a V out is the 12 volts going out and then the last pin is ground and you connect

[53:04] that out to the other side of the bridge rectifier which is the ground and then you should

[53:07] get 12 volts of ground rectified 12 volts of ground from this 7812 device.

[53:13] Now you will need a heat sink on that puppy and it also only outputs one amp so make sure

[53:19] your motor that you're using to run your beacon is never more than one amp with the juice.

[53:25] And you still went off of police cruiser?

[53:27] No I'm Google.

[53:31] See if you can go on the Google or eBay and find a police cruiser beacon and actually use

[53:36] the real thing.

[53:37] Those would be 12 volts too.

[53:39] You know the north side of the phone stop is bringing this to us you stop giving stuff

[53:44] away.

[53:45] Yeah I've got norms, car keys.

[53:48] What's he driving to Caravan?

[53:49] He's driving a Dodge Caravan.

[53:50] If you want a late model Dodge Caravan be the next caller and it's yours.

[53:56] Nobody called I get to keep it.

[53:58] No you don't.

[54:00] You want a VW micro mini bus from 1969 which is Shaggy's?

[54:04] Oh no.

[54:06] Okay our next email question was for a 1964 United Orbit shuffle alley.

[54:14] Now I gave out some advice about this a week or two ago.

[54:17] I did too.

[54:18] I bounced it in the bounce back.

[54:19] Mine was just to check the switches on the bottom because I had issues with switches

[54:23] that get stuck or break and I think I'll shut up.

[54:27] Yeah maybe.

[54:28] It says here follow up.

[54:29] I looked under the alley part of the game and noticed the contact was broken under one

[54:33] of the roller switches.

[54:34] I replaced it and now the game ends at the 12th frame instead of going on and on.

[54:39] Just like you know norm and I told them kind of.

[54:42] Yeah more or less.

[54:43] You know sometimes there's obvious things that you can find.

[54:46] Inspection is the biggest thing and if you can't hit it in one day come back and rethink

[54:51] things out.

[54:52] I don't think you're going to have to get it this first time always and go through over

[54:55] and over until it becomes quite obvious and it should.

[54:58] Yeah and and have a couple beers too that's always been norms with both.

[55:02] We're not going to get off some of your friends or pinball guys.

[55:04] Just sit there talking.

[55:06] Somebody come up with a good idea.

[55:08] But it's a lot of inspection over and over.

[55:10] The reason why I didn't check the switch is because the pin that was under the roll

[55:16] over switch always went up when the puck was thrown over it.

[55:19] Yeah and again this back row of switches has nothing to do with raising or lowering the

[55:23] pins.

[55:24] It just has to do with completing the actual frame or shot.

[55:28] So there's a first throw and a second throw relay and if those never go up it doesn't

[55:35] matter if the pins go up or not.

[55:37] Those switches are disconnected from the activation of either the first shot or the second shot

[55:42] relay and that's what in fact he was fixing and that's why his baller now worked.

[55:48] And I had that problem.

[55:49] It drove me crazy for a long time.

[55:50] I played a game and then the game would just stop in the middle and I couldn't play it

[55:56] and I'd stop two months later pick up the game and just stop and it was a switch that

[56:01] didn't come all the way back to its final or open position and it was just driving me

[56:06] nuts.

[56:07] So I finally inspected all the switches and find it.

[56:09] One was just a little bit just sticking a little bit and once I changed that stick

[56:15] cleaned it up the whole game continues to start working again.

[56:19] Big deal.

[56:20] More great advice from Norm.

[56:22] Okay here's what we got another one that was emailed to us.

[56:25] This guy has a got-leab royal flush.

[56:27] His name is James.

[56:28] He's from Milton Washington.

[56:30] Okay.

[56:31] It says intermittently and only on the first player of all things.

[56:35] Ten unit real won't advance when the ten points switch on the play fields are closed.

[56:40] When this occurs the ten relay and the back box the n relay will lock on and I have to

[56:45] manually disengage it.

[56:47] It seems to be a problem with the score real but I can't figure it out.

[56:50] You kind of talked about this.

[56:51] I thought maybe in another episode or somebody called in with it and what happens is on that

[56:57] score real there is an end of stroke switch so that when the real pulls in it opens up

[57:04] a switch at the end of the stroke while the plunger for the score real is fully engaged

[57:08] and that releases that n relay.

[57:11] If that switch played for some reason is misadjusted and not fully opening every time occasionally

[57:17] you'll get that where the real will stick on.

[57:19] That's why it's only happening for one player because the player, the one player,

[57:24] ten is real that has that switch on it that's having the problem.

[57:28] A lot of times that switch will break completely so that the switch is always open which means

[57:33] that the n relay will never lock on.

[57:36] The disadvantage to that is it also means you won't get a full pulse to that score real

[57:42] and your score may actually be a little lower because of that because the real may not

[57:46] advance the full number every time if that end of stroke switch is not working.

[57:53] That was another kind of interesting thing.

[57:56] Here's one that's really bizarre, not really bizarre but it's going to be almost impossible

[58:00] the answer but I figured we'd talk about it anyways.

[58:03] This guy's name is Greg.

[58:04] He's from St. Paul, Minnesota.

[58:06] He has a Gottlieb surfer.

[58:09] Surker 1976 again an EM Gottlieb.

[58:12] I think it's a two-player game isn't it?

[58:14] I believe it.

[58:15] No, that was surfer champ.

[58:16] I'm sorry.

[58:17] Well surfer and surfer champ are the same once two players once four.

[58:21] I forget which is which though.

[58:22] Says when it's turned on the game continues to reset.

[58:25] It's locked in this reset mode.

[58:27] What do I do?

[58:28] Thanks for your help.

[58:29] Well that's really all he gave us for detail was two sentences and he expects you, Norm,

[58:36] to fix this game.

[58:37] I need you to give an answer in a concise format that everybody will understand in and

[58:42] needs to be correct.

[58:45] He's ahead that problem.

[58:47] Something in the start-up mode.

[58:50] That's what we would say.

[58:51] Something in the starting mode.

[58:53] It's broken is what he's saying.

[58:55] Now what I would check, the first thing I would check is make sure all your stepper

[58:59] units are resetting.

[59:01] That was the very first thing I would do and probably the only advice I can give you

[59:05] at this point that underneath the play field there's a bonus stepper and then there's

[59:10] the player unit in the back box.

[59:12] I would make sure that all those things are finding their way home.

[59:16] I suspect that you either the player unit is getting stuck and it's not fully turning

[59:22] or the bonus relay or the bonus stepper is not fully resetting.

[59:27] And also on the bonus unit there's probably a switch that determines when it's at the

[59:32] reset position.

[59:33] Make sure that switch is good.

[59:34] And again on the player unit, make sure all those little brass braids on the non-moving

[59:42] part of the Bayclad Disc are all nice and clean and the fingers on the moving part are

[59:47] nice and clean too and are free to move up and down.

[59:50] Well then why don't you just start right there and say make sure that units intact and

[59:54] the pieces are there.

[59:55] You got your first year serving too much.

[59:57] Somebody could have hacked in there and took it apart.

[59:59] Make sure that the thing twists freely and isn't gummed up.

[01:00:02] Yeah.

[01:00:03] Alright we're going to take a call.

[01:00:04] Take a call.

[01:00:05] Hi Aaron Topcast, how's it going to help you?

[01:00:08] Hi, I'm Shaggy.

[01:00:09] I have a 1939 film of Athens cocktail machine and I'm having some board problems.

[01:00:22] The board that came with it when I bought it for some reason it wouldn't activate the

[01:00:29] drop targets.

[01:00:30] So I had to buy a separate board and that board had the same problem.

[01:00:35] So I was just wondering if you knew where I could send the boards out to be fixed.

[01:00:40] I had no experience whatsoever fixing boards.

[01:00:43] Wait, wait, what was the name of the game again?

[01:00:46] Flames of Athens.

[01:00:47] Let's say again I'm sorry I didn't hear you.

[01:00:50] Flames of Athens.

[01:00:52] And who manufactures that game?

[01:00:54] Allied Leisure.

[01:00:55] Oh Allied Leisure.

[01:00:56] Okay.

[01:00:57] You know I'm afraid I'm probably not going to be able to help you with this one too much.

[01:01:03] I don't know anybody that does Allied Leisure repairs.

[01:01:06] This is one of their cocktail pins that they thought was going to...

[01:01:10] What about Drexth?

[01:01:11] I don't think anybody I know, certainly not.

[01:01:14] You can give him his email.

[01:01:16] You can try email and dragster underscore 73 at hotmail.com but I think he's going to give

[01:01:22] you a blank stare kind of like what I'm giving you.

[01:01:24] Oh you can ask him and if he doesn't know if he's not going to know maybe he can suggest

[01:01:28] somebody.

[01:01:29] That may be a top one.

[01:01:31] What do you say that the drop targets don't reset?

[01:01:34] No, when they go down like they go haywire, you know like they all drop down and go back

[01:01:41] up at once and eventually blows out the fuse.

[01:01:45] You mean it keeps resetting the bank over and over and over?

[01:01:49] Right.

[01:01:50] How do you know it's a board problem?

[01:01:51] Did you check all the switches on the drop target reset bank?

[01:01:55] Yeah, I did and I also bought a second play field when I checked all of the wires you

[01:02:02] know to make sure that they match and the all matches for as I could tell so I don't

[01:02:07] know.

[01:02:08] Does this game have any sort of a switch test or anything?

[01:02:12] Yeah, but you know I would go into the switch test and make sure that each one of the

[01:02:18] drop targets you know I don't really know how they work on allied leisure.

[01:02:22] You know like on Williams games of that era their drop targets were kind of funky and

[01:02:27] they not only had they actually had almost three different switches for any particular

[01:02:32] drop target to sense it actually on the way down and I don't know if the allied leisure

[01:02:36] can't imagine they do the same stupid thing.

[01:02:39] But you know you never know that maybe there's some switch in that drop target bank that

[01:02:43] just isn't making or breaking and you know that's probably your problem more so that sending

[01:02:50] your boards out I would really really make sure that all that is 100% you know the two

[01:02:57] switch tests.

[01:02:58] It's out of two boards that have a problem.

[01:03:00] Yeah, it really is.

[01:03:02] I would say that you probably have more of a mechanical or you know or switch problem

[01:03:07] than you have of a board problem.

[01:03:10] You know that's just kind of my off the cuff guess for a game that I've never even seen

[01:03:15] much less even heard of for that matter.

[01:03:17] Well we can welcome any.

[01:03:18] I love that there.

[01:03:19] No that's for sure.

[01:03:20] We can welcome any listeners to give us a call with their suggestions too.

[01:03:25] Okay.

[01:03:26] Thank you.

[01:03:27] Thank you so much.

[01:03:28] Okay.

[01:03:29] All right.

[01:03:30] Thank you.

[01:03:31] What do you think of that one Norm?

[01:03:33] Everybody needs a handy you know everybody's calm because you're the God that you think

[01:03:37] can fix everything and you can.

[01:03:39] No.

[01:03:40] No.

[01:03:41] No.

[01:03:42] That one I'm pretty sure I can't fix.

[01:03:43] I would like to hear back from that gentleman though if possible because that's a good stump

[01:03:47] thing if he ever does get that figured out.

[01:03:50] I don't think it's a board problem.

[01:03:51] I really don't.

[01:03:52] I really don't.

[01:03:53] That's what I mean.

[01:03:54] Sometimes it's just difficult over a phone to diagnose.

[01:03:57] You need to get in this game, get your hands dirty, start poking around and looking.

[01:04:01] I mean it could be dead rat cake, carcass in there you know squeezed into a switch stack

[01:04:06] or you know something a dead bat, the hamster body part from a spouse anything.

[01:04:17] I know I'm pretty much as this edition of Topcast and God and I really didn't want to hear

[01:04:25] about any of Norm.

[01:04:27] Previous wives.

[01:04:28] You have a previous one.

[01:04:29] Norm.

[01:04:30] Are you out of rehab now because it sure seems like it's time to go back.

[01:04:35] I think he is too.

[01:04:37] But we appreciate everybody calling in for Topcast on this edition as hot as it was.

[01:04:45] We're not thinking of one more minute.

[01:04:52] All right.

[01:04:53] It's a call we give you a one minute watch.

[01:04:55] This is the end.

[01:04:56] No, one more call.

[01:04:57] I'm shutting Norm's mic off.

[01:04:58] There.

[01:04:59] Norm's mic is off.

[01:05:00] You can't see any more.

[01:05:01] That's it.

[01:05:02] Good day.

[01:05:03] Hotcast.

[01:05:04] We'll catch you next time.
