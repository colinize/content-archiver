[00:30] They were going to be talking to a pinball artist

[00:37] that worked for Balli during the 1970s,

[00:40] and certainly made some of the most beautiful glasses

[00:44] and playfield artwork of any game of any era.

[00:48] He did such games as Monte Carlo,

[00:50] Twin' Win, Airaces, Wizard,

[00:53] Captain Fantastic,

[00:55] Matahari, Power Play,

[00:57] $5 million dollar man,

[00:59] Volt-Han, Dolly Parton,

[01:01] Nitro Ground Shaker,

[01:03] and of course Fireball.

[01:05] So we're going to be talking to him right now.

[01:08] Special guest, special guest, special guest,

[01:13] I'd like to welcome Dave Christensen to Topcast,

[01:17] as we're going to talk to him right now,

[01:19] and give him a call,

[01:21] and see how he's doing,

[01:23] and get some of his stories on how he did

[01:25] to the Blackglass and Playfield artwork,

[01:27] for such famous Balli games during the 1970s

[01:30] as Fireball,

[01:32] Monte Carlo, Twin' Win,

[01:34] Nitro Ground Shaper,

[01:36] Old Chicago, Captain Fantastic,

[01:38] and all the great classic Balli E.M. Games.

[01:41] Let's give him a call right now.

[01:42] Hello?

[01:46] Hi, is this Dave?

[01:48] Yes.

[01:49] Okay, so tell me how you got into

[01:52] the pinball art department at Balli.

[01:54] Were you always interested in pinball or was this just a job that you had to take up?

[01:58] How did you get started at Valley?

[02:02] Well, I got there in 1966 and at that time Valley had recently developed a new slot machine

[02:11] for Roller's Vegas.

[02:12] It wasn't good payout a lot more than the old mechanical ones that they were currently

[02:17] using.

[02:18] Right, the Valley slots were like the first electric mechanical ones were...

[02:24] Yeah, they had a bank type hopper that could count out coins.

[02:30] You ever see those hoppers that you put money into it and then they count them out?

[02:35] You ever see that?

[02:37] Right, right.

[02:38] It wasn't the style where they had, could you only pay out five or ten coins or just

[02:42] a jackpot?

[02:43] It actually counted the money out.

[02:46] Yeah, from this like it's utilizing a bank type coin counter.

[02:51] Right.

[02:52] And the...

[02:53] The first one's to develop that technology for a slot machine so it could actually pay

[02:58] out, you know, up to like a thousand coins.

[03:00] So I was hired...

[03:03] I was doing freelance work in the loop in Chicago for a company that was making...

[03:08] doing military work.

[03:10] Like I was doing exploded views and technical drawings for basically an account with the

[03:17] Rockwell Arsenal, you know, Rock Island Illinois, the M60 tanks, stuff like that.

[03:23] They were doing service manuals.

[03:25] And anyway, somehow they blew it.

[03:28] Somehow they had a little thing cooking with Valley but it never materialized and I went

[03:33] over there and I got a job as a freelance artist doing technical manuals for them.

[03:39] Also the Valley technical manuals you were writing or you were illustrating.

[03:43] Writing and illustrating.

[03:45] Now was this in the slot machine department?

[03:47] Yeah, so I was typed at that for a while and then I was working there as a freelancer

[03:55] because of the problems with security.

[03:59] They actually gave me an office to do my work in for the service manuals.

[04:05] So because of the federal rules in Illinois they didn't...

[04:09] You couldn't have fantasies out of the factory because they had to be shipped basically...

[04:16] had to be shipped out of state and they couldn't really have them out in public.

[04:20] So I basically did my work in the factory and because I was right next to the art department

[04:27] or in the engineering department but they were basically just starting pinball at that

[04:35] time. 65, 66 was basically when a lot of states were okay pinballs again because prior to

[04:42] that they were illegal because of the used to payouts but now the newer pinballs didn't

[04:48] pay out and were just for amusement.

[04:51] I submitted a few samples of my artwork and I made up an imaginary pinball machine so

[04:58] basically I got it cut in the door that way.

[05:00] So now you're in the pinball department?

[05:02] Not really. I was doing my work kind of remote from the engineering department so I was

[05:08] basically just doing it on a freelance basis for them.

[05:12] Well were you considered it is still in the slot machine department?

[05:15] Yeah.

[05:16] Did you like working in the slot machines?

[05:17] Well that's what I was hired for was basically doing technical manuals for the slot machine.

[05:23] But it obviously didn't really cater to your artistic side as it may be or your creative

[05:29] side right?

[05:30] I mean doing our...

[05:31] Yeah pinball is just for the fun of it basically.

[05:35] So now what was your first pinball project that you got through that you got...I guess

[05:40] you were freelance the pinball stuff right?

[05:43] Yeah right.

[05:44] I was a freelancer all the way but I basically worked out of the plan itself.

[05:48] It gave me an area to work and I brought in all my own tools equipment and you know

[05:54] and basically I just provided me a room and a desk to work on.

[05:59] So what kind of tools did you need?

[06:01] You mean all your drawing tools and all that kind of stuff.

[06:05] But now what was your first pinball project that you got into?

[06:09] Well I mean I saw it on the...

[06:11] Like it went to the...

[06:12] Well first basically the first one...

[06:15] It looked like it was fireball or something.

[06:17] It was never made it was it but it had a kind of a gangster motif.

[06:21] It was like it but Valley because of because they were making slot machines they didn't

[06:25] want to have a gangster motif.

[06:27] They wanted to have more of a family thing.

[06:31] You didn't have to do with hoodlums.

[06:33] Right.

[06:34] But then the next one was the first one was that I actually did the artwork for it was

[06:39] a gentle odds and evens which had a roulette connotation to it.

[06:45] So it basically showed a Monte Carlo type setting with a big shot of two girls and his

[06:53] arms and he was kind of a roulette wheel and he was pulling in the chips.

[06:59] Right yeah it was a guy like a white texito with a very voluptuous blonde with his arms

[07:06] around his neck.

[07:07] That was the first one was kind of a more of a cartoony one.

[07:11] That was a two player.

[07:12] No one player.

[07:13] Right.

[07:14] And that odds and evens that.

[07:16] But then they just they just sounded they kind of went into this four player business.

[07:22] And so the first big success was Monte Carlo which was basically the odds and evens

[07:28] game a four player.

[07:30] And I did the basically made a just change the back class to more of a realistic thing.

[07:37] Right.

[07:38] You mean less with less of a cartoon?

[07:40] That's a cartoonier.

[07:41] And did you like doing the more realistic art or did you like the more cartoony art?

[07:45] No.

[07:46] Basically being a technical illustrator, not just basically like doing the or doing things

[07:53] that were realistic.

[07:55] Yeah the Monte Carlo art is definitely more I would call it refined than the.

[08:02] Not beneath.

[08:03] Yeah.

[08:04] Yeah you're right and you do another girl and it too you had now I two girls.

[08:08] Yeah.

[08:09] Yeah which is almost a bonus.

[08:11] Yeah.

[08:12] And then the ball is mostly a male dominated type ball.

[08:15] Yeah.

[08:16] A lot of the net.

[08:17] Right.

[08:18] Exactly.

[08:19] And it went into the just like like roulette, you know red and black you know.

[08:25] Now tell me about fireball.

[08:27] Well fireball that was the last game designed by a guy.

[08:31] It was a kind of a legend in the business and old guy from Ted Zaley.

[08:36] Yeah.

[08:37] He came up with this idea of this rotating plate in the middle of a play field and that

[08:42] really went over big and then the whole thing was shooting balls.

[08:47] So I came up with fireball which was kind of a if you remember back there was a cartoon

[08:55] of comic, there were comic books.

[08:57] There was a guy.

[08:58] There was a man of fire and I kind of got the idea from that.

[09:02] Right.

[09:03] And then he was in the Marvel comics or something like that.

[09:06] And the Marvel comics that they had a bunch of crazy characters that were solving crime

[09:12] by, I don't know.

[09:14] They were just running around waping out gangsters.

[09:18] Yeah I remember and yeah I remember that character though I can't put his name in the

[09:23] game on it.

[09:24] Yeah.

[09:25] What now are you a comic strip or you know.

[09:29] No.

[09:30] No.

[09:31] I was never a comic book guy.

[09:34] No.

[09:35] Did you actually come up with the name fireball?

[09:37] Yeah.

[09:38] Basically all of all the games that I did I basically did the whole idea thing.

[09:43] And it was really a loose run organization.

[09:46] They had some of their pinball machines were done by a commercial company called Add Posterz

[09:52] which was done on Holster Street North Avenue and Holsterz.

[09:56] They go all the way down there in the middle of a very horrible area at the time.

[10:01] Yeah they were the company that actually did the silk screening for the artwork right?

[10:05] Well they also did the artwork too.

[10:07] So they had their own team of artists there and you were almost in competition with them then.

[10:11] Yeah I was basically hurting their business because they had a virtually 100% lack on the industry for a while.

[10:17] You know they did everything for God leave and Williams.

[10:20] Did you ever work for Add Posterz?

[10:22] No.

[10:23] So you were almost strictly purely contract or freelance?

[10:26] I worked from 66 to approximately right a part of 75 as a freelancer for them.

[10:33] And then for freelancers or for add cultures or for valid?

[10:36] For valid.

[10:37] For valid.

[10:38] Okay.

[10:39] They built a small office, a cubicle or an engineering department for me.

[10:44] But then the new president came in.

[10:48] He made one of his college pals as the art director.

[10:52] He brought him and he didn't want any loose ends like freelancers because they said corporate security and all that sort of stuff.

[11:02] So they offered me a position that I would prefer.

[11:06] A ballet and a proper chairing and health insurance and all that stuff.

[11:10] So you were a ballet employee at that point?

[11:12] Then I became a ballet employee until I left.

[11:16] Oh, so you went up to before I came?

[11:20] Before I came along they used to do mostly virtually all the artwork.

[11:24] Gotcha.

[11:25] But then there was another group of guys that were hired just about the time when I showed up and that was the three brothers.

[11:31] They also did artwork for ballet.

[11:33] And so the artwork for all the different games was divided mainly between add posters myself and the white brothers.

[11:44] They also had a kind of a remodeled office too.

[11:49] So they did their work very secretly in an office across the street.

[11:53] And when I worked in the engineering department, they worked in another department that was above the parts room.

[12:01] And they had a poster which did artwork for everybody.

[12:04] Got leave and Williams of that?

[12:07] Yeah, everybody did the artwork for everybody.

[12:10] So that's a way kind of started in 66.

[12:13] When I first started there they only had this artist that did that paper-vill style.

[12:19] That was...

[12:20] Yeah, the Jerry Kelly.

[12:21] The Jerry Kelly stuff.

[12:23] Yeah.

[12:24] The pointy artwork.

[12:25] Right.

[12:26] Now you did one called Twin Wind.

[12:28] Do you remember that class?

[12:29] Oh yeah, Twin Wind.

[12:31] Yeah, it had a real pretty girl in the center of it and two.

[12:34] Yeah, right.

[12:35] Formula cars on it.

[12:37] Yeah, but the guys in the engineering department who basically designed the game, they hit like a little track in the play field.

[12:45] And then they hit different scores, those little lights that were on the track would move forward almost like a pegboard.

[12:51] They just kind of move around like a...

[12:54] What's that card game where you use a board that you move little pins around on it?

[12:58] Right.

[12:59] I know what you mean.

[13:00] Now the girls that you drew in your glasses were these people you knew or...

[13:06] I mean where did you get the individuals that actually ended up in your glasses?

[13:11] Basically, just basically it just hit models out of men's magazines basically.

[13:16] The only girl that I copied from that girlfriend called Jerry, she was on that Mata Henry machine.

[13:24] Oh, right, right, right.

[13:25] That was her face on that one.

[13:27] Okay.

[13:28] But the rest of them were just out of...

[13:30] You know, just out of basically magazines.

[13:33] Now a friend of mine has a game called Valley 4, FORE like is in golf.

[13:40] Oh yeah.

[13:41] Did you have anything to do with that game?

[13:43] Yeah, I did the back class.

[13:45] You did. So you did the back class on that one.

[13:47] Yeah.

[13:48] Because, you know, he was looking at it and he said, man, right there.

[13:51] That was the first game I ever did.

[13:54] Yeah, because the game came in from ad posters and it was so bland and so stupid looking.

[14:01] It asked me to do something to see if I could come up with something.

[14:06] And then there was another one called Bon Voyage that was made about the same time.

[14:10] Right. Right.

[14:11] And that again was made by ad posters, but they put the artwork on the back glass.

[14:16] It was so terrible that they asked me to do it.

[14:19] So...

[14:20] Now did you do the play field on FORE also?

[14:22] Or just the...

[14:23] I can't remember where.

[14:24] It has...

[14:25] I really...

[14:26] I looked at it. I could tell.

[14:27] It usually could tell my artworks.

[14:29] Now, Playboy came out with an article on pinball in like 71 or 72.

[14:37] And the entire ball was the main machine about that article.

[14:42] You know, and that was obviously...

[14:44] You know, your machine. You did the artwork for that game.

[14:47] Right. How did you feel about that?

[14:49] What's the claim? It's just like when you're just working.

[14:52] It's just like a guy who designed the stootabaker, you know.

[14:55] The guy who basically does it really.

[14:57] Very few people get it in recognition.

[14:59] You know, who do you know that design the latest Mustang?

[15:02] You know, that the name system comes out.

[15:05] You know, there's just a few automotive designers that basically ever hit the news.

[15:11] Like Raymond Laurie or something like that or Brooks Stevens.

[15:15] And a few people come to mind.

[15:18] But the artists that work on pinball basically were never recognized.

[15:22] In fact, it didn't even want us to sign our names to the artwork.

[15:27] I usually just knocked my initials in PGC.

[15:30] You're in there in a few games.

[15:32] And that was about it.

[15:33] So the Playboy article was a little bit of recognition for you then.

[15:38] I don't think they even mention my name.

[15:42] Wow, because it was really predominant how much they showed that machine.

[15:46] And you know, and your artwork and it, you know,

[15:49] and they made a big fuss about it.

[15:51] Yeah, right there in the late 60s and early 70s,

[15:56] when pinball was just going crazy, you know.

[16:00] But you have to remember city Chicago.

[16:03] They just, and New York basically,

[16:07] okay, pinballs just about there's time.

[16:10] Right.

[16:11] They were prior to that, they were illegal.

[16:15] They did another glass or another game called the Brogo.

[16:19] Did you name that one? Did you come up with that name?

[16:21] No, Norm Clark did.

[16:23] He was the chief designer for pinballs.

[16:26] He was the man in charge.

[16:28] I don't know, it just came off at times.

[16:30] It said.

[16:31] Okay.

[16:32] Was there anything, you know, you kind of,

[16:34] it's kind of this, I don't know, you know.

[16:36] Yeah, kind of a Viking with a girl in his arms.

[16:39] I mean, when they, when they said we need artwork for a game,

[16:43] would you, would they just, would they give you any theme or any ideas?

[16:47] Or you just basically, they left it all up to you?

[16:50] Yeah, mostly was just lift up to me.

[16:52] I had no idea what Brogo meant.

[16:54] But I was just some, Norm would come up with some name occasionally,

[16:58] the hockey game.

[17:00] With the power of the whole game.

[17:02] Yeah, power of course.

[17:03] No, it's a Bobby Orr.

[17:05] Right, Bobby Orr's power play.

[17:07] The power play I came up with that one because at the time he wanted,

[17:10] he was thinking of slapstick.

[17:12] And I said, well, that's what power play meant to,

[17:15] was a little more heavy, you know, like, wherever.

[17:18] Yeah, it's a better name.

[17:20] It's headed on more impact.

[17:22] Right.

[17:23] So, wouldn't you, when they,

[17:25] would they actually give you a machine that had no artwork on it and say,

[17:29] is somehow implement your theme, your artwork into this play field.

[17:34] And, you know, and make it work and just leave you to do it?

[17:37] I was just given what they called the white wood,

[17:40] which was the engineering, you know, the play field.

[17:43] And then I'd come up with some ideas and it was just kind of,

[17:47] there was a very easy going, friendly place to work for.

[17:50] It was usually went along with ideas, you know.

[17:53] I had, you know, friends that, younger guys at that time were,

[17:58] they'd have ideas.

[17:59] So, you know, the department basically wasn't that huge, you know.

[18:04] It was just like, it's one huge room with salt,

[18:08] with a little bit of, all kinds of cubicles,

[18:11] where everybody just did their own thing.

[18:13] You know, we used to have such terrific parties there,

[18:16] was unbelievable.

[18:17] Any excuse for a party with all myres over,

[18:20] go down the street, there was a big bar,

[18:22] and build a lot of them in, lay a couple hundred on the bar,

[18:26] and say drinks for everybody.

[18:28] You know, it was really fun,

[18:31] and our Christmas parties got in the loop.

[18:34] They were, they had a big old keld on there,

[18:37] and it was just incredible.

[18:39] The Bali Christmas parties were famous.

[18:42] We held at the Palmer House in Chicago.

[18:44] It was really everything.

[18:46] Artinis and hattens, they have food, it was unbelievable.

[18:50] You know, lobster spoon or door, they'd have huge sides,

[18:53] rare roast beef, the dinners and the, you know,

[18:57] just the curks and everything.

[19:00] Back in the 60s and 70s,

[19:03] you couldn't beat Bali, I mean, a good time.

[19:05] Then when it went public, everything kind of changed.

[19:07] Well, they even had a bar in the, right next to the executive dining room.

[19:14] The bar was opened all day long.

[19:17] You could, if you were part of the engineering and the executives,

[19:22] any time of the day, you could just walk in this bar,

[19:25] get a drink.

[19:27] Wow.

[19:28] Unbelievable.

[19:29] Now, the, they ever say to you like,

[19:33] okay, we're still screening this,

[19:35] and we only want you to use eight colors,

[19:38] or we only want you to use, you know, a maximum of 10 colors.

[19:41] Were you ever given any constraints like that during, you know,

[19:45] during the art process?

[19:46] Well, I didn't ask you, like, basically 12 screens.

[19:51] That was kind of the room.

[19:53] Sometimes they went up to 14.

[19:56] That included the, you know, the blocking.

[19:59] Yeah, the black and the white and the mask.

[20:02] But there wasn't really too much of a constraint.

[20:05] I was when I introduced mirroring to the glass.

[20:08] I think I introduced that on the open-john game.

[20:11] Right.

[20:12] The captain fantastic, exactly.

[20:14] Yeah.

[20:15] They kind of cut out mirroring because of the expense and the mess.

[20:18] It was a very messy process to make a mirror glass.

[20:21] So did you have to start with a mirror and then etch away the parts you didn't want?

[20:25] Yeah, but that's where it got messy because you, you,

[20:29] did silk screen, I resist onto the glass, onto the mirror glass.

[20:34] And in any place where the resist wasn't silk screen on,

[20:39] that would be washed off with sort of an acid.

[20:43] And that's where the expense and the mess came in.

[20:46] Like when you were doing your artwork though, at, at Valley,

[20:50] did you hand your artwork off to somebody that did all the color separations?

[20:54] Or did you have to do all that too?

[20:56] No, I did my own separations.

[20:58] Okay.

[20:59] Say that we got this game, we need artwork.

[21:01] Here's the white wood.

[21:03] What were the steps that actually make the artwork and what you had to do before it was finalized?

[21:09] Well, I get a full-size paper blueprint of the young game,

[21:16] of the engineering part of the game.

[21:20] You mean like the play field or the plastic?

[21:23] And the background.

[21:25] And then the plan of the scoring, how it was scored.

[21:29] And so I could somehow present the player with some logical way of making it easy to figure out.

[21:38] You know, everything, a lot of things, if you hit one target that would raise the,

[21:43] you know, the line and other targets and stuff like that,

[21:47] it would light up certain features and stuff like that.

[21:51] So these were your first drawing that you had, you know, that you presented to whoever the game designer or management or whoever gave you your approval.

[22:00] Was it all just like a black and white, you know, pencil type drawing?

[22:04] Well, I would take the blueprint, just like paper,

[22:09] and I would kind of lay out on the paper itself my idea in pencil.

[22:19] And then sometimes I would get duplicates of that,

[22:24] and then I would kind of color in the different, indicate the colors.

[22:30] And then the second step after some of my ideas got approved,

[22:36] I would make, I would place a mylar, frosted mylar, you know,

[22:42] that's over my sketches, the final sketch,

[22:46] and then I would ink the black line first.

[22:51] And I would just do the overlays using a ruby left or some of them,

[22:56] some of them were very fine, I'd have to use other frosted mylar,

[23:01] this is a translucent plastic that's frosted on one side.

[23:06] Sure.

[23:07] That would take ink.

[23:09] So most of them had like a set around, anywhere from 12, 12 colors,

[23:14] and then you'd have the white and the mask that would direct the lighting.

[23:21] That would be up to about 14 different steps to so explain it.

[23:27] So each one of these layers of this frosted mylar

[23:30] was basically your color separation then?

[23:33] Yeah.

[23:34] And so you lay them all together?

[23:36] I would use this ruby left stuff too,

[23:39] but to make it they put a red color coating on top of a cellophane

[23:45] and then you'd peel off different parts that you didn't want,

[23:49] silk screened or something.

[23:50] Okay.

[23:51] And then you would give these layers to whoever was the guy in charge of silk screen

[23:58] and he would, you know, turn that into the screens?

[24:02] Yeah.

[24:03] It was a very expensive photographic process, you know,

[24:07] getting films that big.

[24:09] At first it was sent to an outside opera, they would do it.

[24:13] But then in the, oh, on 1969 they built their own camera equipment

[24:23] and then they did the digital themselves.

[24:27] Also, Allison included the slot machine glass.

[24:31] So Valley became more or less, they didn't really need ad posters to do anything.

[24:36] Prior to that, the ad posters was...

[24:40] Handle the whole thing, right?

[24:42] They had all equipment, the silk screening, the making of the silk screen,

[24:47] the whole cutting of a little, you know,

[24:51] they provided the glass and everything else.

[24:55] How long would it take you to do a game, a pinball game, you know,

[24:59] doing the back glass, the flat plastics in the play field

[25:03] from start to finish?

[25:04] How long would that take you?

[25:05] Well, we're taking you three months.

[25:08] My captain, fantastic.

[25:10] One of your more, certainly one of the more famous games and famous glasses

[25:14] that all the little characters, you know,

[25:18] you know, you got Elton John playing the pinball machine on the front.

[25:22] And then behind them, I mean, you got everybody from,

[25:25] I don't know, probably people that worked there to hit learn,

[25:28] all kinds of different people there.

[25:30] I mean, where did you come up with that idea?

[25:34] And, you know, and the people that were actually,

[25:37] that you drew into there?

[25:38] Well, I always went out for a few drinks at lunch.

[25:41] It was just, it was just a joke.

[25:46] It was just a joke.

[25:48] If you remember the movie, that was Elton John,

[25:52] what was playing on the stage?

[25:53] And he had this kind of an audience there.

[25:56] And I, to join that audience, I just, you know,

[26:01] either going to be kind of cute for you,

[26:04] or they're going to be just kind of just nobody's out there.

[26:07] So I try to make it the audience kind of interesting.

[26:12] Now, why, like, you have like,

[26:14] brudas in it and Hitler and it,

[26:17] why, why those people, I mean,

[26:19] of all people, although kind of strange people, the pick.

[26:23] Yeah. Well, I don't think you can come up with any logical answer for this.

[26:28] It was just how you felt that the client.

[26:31] Right. Great glass.

[26:33] I mean, it's one of my, well, in the other one,

[26:36] of course, that was just a masterpiece,

[26:39] was wizard with Roger Daltry and Anne Margaret on them.

[26:43] And, you know, I mean, that was,

[26:46] that's piece of work. That one, I'm just...

[26:48] Well, if you remember, part of that movie

[26:51] did involve the Blitz and Mondit, you remember that?

[26:55] Sure.

[26:56] And maybe that's for the idea for putting Hitler in there,

[27:01] because it was involved in the...

[27:04] Oh, in the World War II.

[27:06] Right.

[27:07] The Blitz thing.

[27:08] Right.

[27:09] But believe me, there was no real logical.

[27:13] It wasn't meant to offend anybody.

[27:15] Oh, sure. No. It's not like...

[27:17] Did they ever, did the ballet executives ever come up to you and say,

[27:20] they've those, you know, there's something we don't,

[27:23] you know, there's somebody in there we don't like,

[27:25] and the role is to, you know,

[27:27] there's too much nipples showing on the girl or anything like that.

[27:30] Normally, no. They did get a complaint about it

[27:35] and that audience scene and that theater

[27:37] where the girl was grabbed this guy's crotch.

[27:41] It was like he was bothering her,

[27:43] and so she bought back a little bit.

[27:46] And they said, maybe she'd put us

[27:49] like a mirrored star over her hand,

[27:53] you know, so it doesn't look like told if she was really doing it.

[27:57] And that was the starred back-class version.

[28:00] Yeah, and then I'm not a hurry.

[28:03] She was holding a dagger that had been

[28:06] inscriptions in Germany on it that they didn't like.

[28:08] What did the inscriptions say?

[28:10] I was in Germany and said,

[28:11] my, my honors, my loyalty in Germany.

[28:14] And they didn't like that?

[28:15] No, because that was...

[28:17] and great, they've done a dress daggers

[28:20] at the German Army, had 1933 dress daggers

[28:24] that were just for officers.

[28:27] And they felt that would bring back bad memories.

[28:31] Gotcha, so that's why there was two versions of the Mata Hari Glass.

[28:34] Yeah, the only difference was to take that inscription off.

[28:38] Right, right.

[28:39] Now, when you worked with somebody like on the Wizard Glass,

[28:43] when you had Roger Dahltree and Ann Margaret,

[28:48] you know, two of the stars from the movie Tommy.

[28:50] Yeah.

[28:51] On the glass, did they have to give approval of your artwork?

[28:54] Yeah, Ann Margaret did.

[28:56] At first, we made a diversion of her with her hair up.

[29:01] She didn't like it because it looked like a...

[29:04] she said that kind of dated her.

[29:07] It was kind of like a beehive haircut.

[29:09] And by 19, in other words,

[29:11] that 74 of the beehive haircuts kind of repassay.

[29:16] So she wanted a different one.

[29:18] And the same thing went for the Dalai Parting Glass.

[29:21] She reviewed it several times.

[29:24] First, the header and a...

[29:26] we're in just blue jeans and kind of a...

[29:28] being a blouse, she said,

[29:30] because she was at that time kind of crossing over

[29:33] into some kind of like country music into different music.

[29:38] She wanted to appear more cosmopolitan.

[29:41] She didn't want to look like a country girl.

[29:44] And then she also liked butterflies.

[29:47] That was her theme.

[29:48] We added butterflies.

[29:50] And then she, because of the crossover,

[29:53] things she...

[29:55] from strictly country music to the modern music,

[30:00] like the country western singers.

[30:02] Today, they just don't...

[30:04] remember she was singing more of ballads and stuff.

[30:08] She didn't want that e-haw image, you know.

[30:12] So we've changed her hair a couple times.

[30:14] And then she wanted that yellow chiffon dress.

[30:18] That was the one to get out of the blue jeans.

[30:20] So we actually made several versions for Dalai Parting.

[30:25] That could be kind of expensive.

[30:27] So she was the hardest clientele to work with during that era.

[30:31] Well, she wasn't... wasn't her personally.

[30:33] It was her manager, your point of choose.

[30:37] Right.

[30:38] But early he made her rich.

[30:42] So he can't really say it was wrong,

[30:47] because he steered her in the right direction all the time.

[30:51] We'll be back in just a moment with our conversation with Dave Christensen.

[31:26] We're back with Dave Christensen of Bally Art on his famous pinball games during the 1970s.

[31:33] So now which did you prefer to do,

[31:35] which was more fun doing the play field or doing the back glass?

[31:39] Well, the back glass,

[31:41] well, first of all, we try to explain the play of the game.

[31:45] And then the back glass somehow,

[31:48] they hit both of the kind of pair each other.

[31:51] You know what I mean?

[31:52] They basically, the theme of the play,

[31:56] at the kind of, you reflected in the theme of the back glass kind of.

[32:01] So was it more of a challenge to do the play field?

[32:04] Because you had to tie in all the scoring type stuff, you mean?

[32:08] Well, it wasn't really that.

[32:10] Of course, today, the play fields are so busy,

[32:14] it's really hard to figure out how to score them.

[32:17] You know what I mean?

[32:18] Right.

[32:19] Now, the one game, the game Future Spot,

[32:21] do you remember that one?

[32:22] Yeah.

[32:23] What was the deal with that?

[32:24] Who came up with that name and that theme and everything?

[32:27] Well, they had a management,

[32:29] came in with what they called it,

[32:31] a new art director who tried to combine all the different art departments

[32:36] that were working on pinball,

[32:39] free trade to consolidate everything.

[32:42] And he had his own ideas about stuff.

[32:45] And so he basically changed everything over to a marble.

[32:49] He was into a base experience, you know, like outer space.

[32:54] If you remember there was an era there where almost all the pinballs

[32:57] had something to do with asteroids and all that kind of stuff, you know?

[33:02] Does that explain the bolt-and glass too a bit?

[33:07] Well, the bolt-and basically they put it out,

[33:10] and the play of the game was so bad that they didn't, they never produced.

[33:15] They just put out a bunch to see how it would go.

[33:19] And the people played it once,

[33:21] and it was just a very boring game to play.

[33:24] You have to realize that sometimes the play of the game certainly over rules the artworks sometimes.

[33:29] Yeah, they didn't make a lot of that game.

[33:31] That's how they just, they had a run of maybe 200.

[33:34] Right, and they, they never had a big run.

[33:38] Right, beautiful glass.

[33:40] I mean, you did great job on the artwork.

[33:42] Well, yeah, it's almost like my job at the time.

[33:47] Once they brought in this new artwork, right?

[33:50] That was about it for me.

[33:52] He didn't like me and I didn't like him.

[33:54] So you mean all of a sudden it went from being a fun job to not being so fun, eh?

[33:58] No, he brought in, well, see, you know, corporate type in the area.

[34:03] It was all corporate from there on.

[34:05] It was like, all of a sudden the ability to, you know, just come up with your own ideas

[34:10] is well, we're out the window.

[34:12] I didn't really last that much longer and on top of that industry was going from, you know,

[34:19] the Pac-Man and all of the other games came out.

[34:22] They, they more or less started, they lifted the, uh, pinballs in there.

[34:26] They were making much more money and there wasn't a commercially known maintenance or damn things.

[34:31] Right.

[34:32] After members, a lot of, uh, maintenance to a pinball.

[34:35] You know, the service guys were on the run all the time trying to keep always games going.

[34:39] And, uh, with the stuff like Pac-Man and all the rest of them, you know,

[34:45] about the everything that go wrong and afford burnout or something.

[34:49] They ever asked you to do artwork for any video games?

[34:52] Um, no.

[34:53] Now, you also did, um, the game, the artwork for the game, $6 million dollar man.

[34:59] Yeah.

[35:00] Were those guys easy to work with?

[35:02] As, you know, as a licensed theme, as it may be?

[35:06] Oh, yeah, I didn't hear anything from them.

[35:08] So you just didn't want them?

[35:09] Wasn't like working with Dally Parton, huh?

[35:11] No, they, uh, that, that wasn't one off.

[35:13] It went off real good.

[35:14] It's, uh, the only thing that interfered with the artwork was, because it was a six, six player.

[35:20] So we had to work around all the, uh, you know, the readouts, you know, toners.

[35:24] Right.

[35:25] Right, the score display.

[35:26] Yeah, the score display.

[35:27] Yeah.

[35:28] Rather than that, uh, then they were also experimenting instead of doing standard silkscreen.

[35:34] They were going with this four color stuff.

[35:37] And they were basically, uh, painting the, uh, the back glasses, you know, they were using

[35:42] a photo technique to print on the glass instead of a silkscreen.

[35:46] Now, would it set and make your job harder or easier to use the four color process?

[35:52] Well, I like the old way, the silkscreen way, but...

[35:55] Now, when you did art where they were using the four color process, how did that, I mean,

[36:01] you weren't doing the frost at my large for that anymore, right?

[36:04] I mean, how did that work?

[36:06] Well, no, no.

[36:08] But I always used, I still used the black silkscreen for the number one, and then they, they

[36:14] would print over my, uh, my black line.

[36:17] But I only did a couple.

[36:19] But what would they do, like, take a picture of it and, or something?

[36:22] Or take a picture?

[36:23] You have to paint, you have to paint the damn thing.

[36:25] So the whole thing would become a painting, almost?

[36:27] Yes.

[36:28] Yeah.

[36:29] And then somehow they would, uh, through photographic process or something, change that into the whole color.

[36:33] It was a very tricky thing on that one game with the dragster.

[36:37] Yeah, I was finishing Nitro Ground Shaker.

[36:39] Well, that, in my only one night, there was a black screen, that was it, and the rest was painted

[36:45] and printed on the black, lined itself with the black screen.

[36:49] So that was a four process color back glass, was the night glass?

[36:52] Yeah, I was, I mean, about the only one I did, I think.

[36:55] And, um, now that one, I really like the artwork on, though.

[36:59] And that's a really well done glass.

[37:01] I mean, it's a beautiful thing in, in like, the control tower.

[37:05] You know, where you got, it's always like sticking up in the tower.

[37:08] I mean, there's just a lot of little subtle pieces to your artwork that, you know, you look at it.

[37:14] You've looked at the glass a hundred times and you look at it again and you say,

[37:17] she, I never seen that before, you know.

[37:19] I never noticed that one little detail.

[37:22] And that night glass really reminds me of that.

[37:25] You know, I remember I see it.

[37:27] I basically got a union growth drag strip.

[37:30] I never go down there.

[37:32] I never went to that one, but when I was a, when I was a kid in the 70s,

[37:36] my dad would take me to, you know, the, the, um, the drag races.

[37:40] It was kind of fine.

[37:42] Back in the old days, that's basically a takeoff of union growth drag strip.

[37:47] So now when, um, there was this one machine or one artwork you did

[37:53] that for a machine that didn't get produced called, let's see if I could say it right.

[37:57] Lovey, Paris, lovey, premium.

[38:00] Right.

[38:01] There you go.

[38:02] Thank you.

[38:03] Yeah.

[38:04] Now what was up with that, with that artwork in that machine?

[38:07] Well, Billy O'Donnell Jr., who was, took over the presidency after his dad left.

[38:16] He, um, he went to school in Paris and he always had a big thing for Paris.

[38:22] And so I made up this game because he wanted to, they had a, they did have a,

[38:33] uh, distribution ship in Paris.

[38:36] And so this was kind of like a, paying homage to his pals in Paris.

[38:42] So that's where it came.

[38:44] But again, um, that's when the whole pinball thing was falling apart.

[38:51] Right.

[38:52] The machine never got made.

[38:53] Yeah.

[38:54] That's just before we had left to them.

[38:57] Now, when, um, there was a machine that, I understand that Herb Silver's actually, um,

[39:06] asked you to do a glass called Big Dick.

[39:11] What, I mean, what, uh, tell me about that one.

[39:16] What, what happened was, uh, I collected a lot of these games myself.

[39:24] I had a, uh, I had a collection of old pinballs and old thing on machines.

[39:32] And, uh, I had a no Williams game called the Big Deal.

[39:37] Right.

[39:38] From like 63 or something like that.

[39:40] And, uh, when I was restoring it and painting it, uh, or I, doing all my touch-ups

[39:49] because I, I'm constantly renovating something.

[39:54] So slot machines and stuff.

[39:56] I got a big collection of those.

[39:58] And so, I was working on the back glass because that, that, that, that, that,

[40:05] I could, back up, back, or the artwork was done by ad poster.

[40:10] And instead of using enamel paint like Valley did, when they, when they developed,

[40:16] when Valley set up their own silkscreen department, they used enamel paints.

[40:23] And, um, you mean, there were a lot of like, tinballs that paint would peel, you know what I mean?

[40:28] Yeah.

[40:29] And old slot machines that had, uh, light bulbs and stuff behind the glass,

[40:34] what would happen, the heat would, uh, like the paint peel.

[40:38] That was because ad poster was using, uh, case scene, water-based case scene paints to silkscreen.

[40:45] And, uh, they were never, uh, very durable.

[40:48] Especially the yellow color would always peel.

[40:51] And so I was wiping the back glass, cleaning off the, uh, the black stuff from the lights and stuff.

[40:58] Cause, uh, the, you know, light bulbs that always, uh, kind of black in the back glass, you know.

[41:03] So, and I didn't realize they had water-based case scene paints on them, glass,

[41:09] and so, when I was washing up with the detergent, all the paint came off.

[41:14] So I had a, I didn't have a glass in it.

[41:18] Right.

[41:19] There's no way to repair it.

[41:21] Because they, one big swish in all of, all of the whole back glass is ruined.

[41:27] So, I decided I would design my own back glass for it.

[41:32] Yeah, a pornographic back glass.

[41:35] I, uh, I did that on my own.

[41:38] Okay, then they, they had a silkscreen, uh, like some friends in the business, and it was kind of like a joke.

[41:44] How many of those did you have made?

[41:46] Well, I had about a dozen glasses made.

[41:48] I still have a couple back glasses in my deep and my bulb, in my basement.

[41:55] That's, um, the one collector, Jean Cunningham.

[41:58] He, he, he was a game that I made it for plus, plus the glass.

[42:02] So, he's got the only machine and, uh, with the glass that I designed in it.

[42:08] So, I want to see it.

[42:10] Most have been Jean Cunningham.

[42:12] Right.

[42:13] You know, he's a collector blooming to Illinois.

[42:16] Yep.

[42:17] Gals depicted in that glass were from, were people that, you know, like, you know,

[42:23] uh, you know, some of the women that worked at Valley.

[42:26] No.

[42:27] No, not at all.

[42:28] Not at all.

[42:29] They were just nonclimbs, they got a hustler magazine.

[42:32] Right.

[42:33] You know, whoever was it, you know, the play man of the world.

[42:36] It was nobody.

[42:37] Yeah.

[42:38] It was, uh, but I didn't find out that somebody got a hold of one of those glasses out in Vegas, and they reprimmed it.

[42:45] And they made a bunch of them.

[42:46] But I really didn't want anything to do with it.

[42:48] To me, it was just a private joke for a few private friends.

[42:53] The guy out in, uh, California or Vegas or whatever that, that redid your, uh, your big dick class.

[43:01] Were you mad about that when, when you found out about that?

[43:04] Well, I just heard of it offhand.

[43:07] I never, I never talked to him.

[43:09] I never, I didn't even know who he was.

[43:11] But I heard, I heard about it.

[43:12] Where would anybody find a, uh, Williams big deal pinball machine?

[43:17] Right.

[43:18] There was probably only maybe half a dozen left in the whole world.

[43:22] Yeah.

[43:23] So, good point.

[43:24] And it wasn't a particularly interesting game as a collector's item anyway.

[43:28] Right.

[43:29] Right.

[43:30] I just happened to get one and it just, it was just kind of, it's a joke.

[43:35] I think I got it for 20 bucks.

[43:37] Right.

[43:38] Yeah.

[43:39] Sure.

[43:40] And it was just fun to repair it.

[43:42] Gene Cunningham.

[43:43] And he did a book on you.

[43:44] Yeah.

[43:45] He's another, uh, fanatic.

[43:46] Kind of hard to gold very.

[43:48] You know, it's hard for me like if you're working in a candy store all the time you get

[43:53] paired with a candy, you know, but it's hard for me to see the absolute almost fanatic

[43:59] interests.

[44:00] Yeah.

[44:01] Do you have a lot of machines now?

[44:02] Well, basically Gene Cunningham bought a bunch for me.

[44:05] I still, you know, our family, uh, I've got slot machines found out to my brothers and

[44:11] people who like them for their rec room, you know, and I still have a bunch in the basement

[44:17] that they've been sitting, they've been sitting for, you know, ever since, like early 80s.

[44:24] And I haven't played them once.

[44:27] And then I look at them and I plug them in and you know that I can work.

[44:31] It's a goofy and I mean.

[44:33] Now when you were making machines at Valley, um, did you have a chance to buy machines at

[44:39] discounted prices?

[44:40] You know, because you worked there at the factory or, you know, well, yes, it gave me a

[44:45] lot of hiring because they, that was, they were changing over from the, you know, for the

[44:51] scoring, they went from the reels to a, you know, the way they do it now.

[44:55] Yeah, they went from a lecture mechanical to solid state with digital scoring.

[44:59] Yeah, that's right.

[45:00] And so I, they gave me the last one with the, the real type, like a mechanical.

[45:05] I also sold that to team Cunningham.

[45:08] So he's got the last of the real machines there.

[45:11] How was that?

[45:12] The change over at the ground 75.

[45:15] 77, the 70s.

[45:16] Yeah.

[45:17] Yeah, they made a lot of that game too.

[45:19] They made like over a thousand of the lecture mechanical ones like you have.

[45:24] And then they made six, over 16,000 of the Monahari's with the solid state.

[45:30] Yeah.

[45:31] You know, so you were up.

[45:32] Yeah, you're up.

[45:33] Yeah, you're up.

[45:34] Yeah, you're up there.

[45:35] I mean, people, a lot of people saw that game.

[45:37] I just was talking to a guy that, you know, he met his wife at an arcade playing Monahari

[45:44] and, you know, his wife to be at the time.

[45:47] And, um, I was a quick game to play too.

[45:49] Yeah, yeah, he, he had to be a great smith.

[45:52] He was the top designers there and he, uh, he designed the play, play that game.

[45:58] That was really a terrific game.

[45:59] Right.

[46:00] Yeah.

[46:01] Yeah, he was just, you know, he bought one on eBay and he was just thrilled to get it.

[46:05] You know, I mean, this was, you know, I pay for it.

[46:08] I, you know, I don't know.

[46:09] I didn't ask him, but, you know, he was just, he was just thrilled.

[46:13] And, and one of the reasons he was thrilled is because of the artwork on the game.

[46:17] I mean, to him, it was a really, you know, the game had to be in good condition because

[46:22] he wanted all the artwork, you know, to be, you know, as perfect as possible.

[46:27] So I did a lot of, there was a little historical research that game.

[46:31] It's a map that she was handing over to this, this, uh, German ambassador or everyone

[46:38] call it, where German double agent or something, you know, he was that map.

[46:43] I actually, uh, that was actually the battle map of the Battle of Caporetto and Italy,

[46:49] where the Austrian Army broke through the, uh, Italian lines.

[46:54] So, so I tried to be authentic.

[46:59] Now, did you come up with that, with that name and that theme from out of hurry?

[47:02] I don't know.

[47:03] I can't remember tell you true.

[47:05] I, uh, but it was the way, the artwork I basically did on my own.

[47:11] So, did you have like almost a stock of artwork, you know, as they, as new machines came,

[47:15] you know, you could apply, you know, or was this done per machine?

[47:19] Yeah, but towards the end, everything went to this space stuff and this guy that was

[47:26] going to be the art director area.

[47:28] I just, everything went down.

[47:31] I just didn't even want to, I wanted to go back to the slot machine department and actually

[47:37] towards the end, that sort of, I was doing mostly anyway with slot machines because there

[47:41] was a lot of jealousy within the art department.

[47:44] A lot of, nobody really got along.

[47:47] And that eight ball came out that was kind of the podsy one.

[47:51] Yeah.

[47:52] Now, you didn't do that one?

[47:53] No.

[47:54] But that one was very similar to your style.

[47:56] Yeah, the person who did that was right next to you know, in a cubicle mix to me.

[48:01] It was pretty competitive then.

[48:02] No, it was just, it was just a lot of very unhappy situation, a political situation.

[48:11] There was really a bummer.

[48:12] Well, I mean, of all the, all the, all the games in the, in the 70s, you know, you were,

[48:18] your artwork definitely stands out above everybody else's.

[48:22] I mean, I don't think there was any argument to that.

[48:25] I mean, I looked at the, you look at the artwork that Williams was doing in that, that kind

[48:29] of pointy style artwork.

[48:31] I just, yeah, that's the way they're, they're called Angelo Python.

[48:36] There was another guy there and they were, again, they, you know, really didn't want anything

[48:42] to do with me.

[48:43] I knew there are stuff.

[48:45] If, anytime, we had to go down to add poster to see how they were doing on silk screening

[48:51] something on a game that I was working on, they wouldn't even, they wouldn't, I had to,

[48:57] I had to sit in a lobby and the guy would come out and talk to me like I was like, it's

[49:04] worth it.

[49:05] Like I was taking work away from him.

[49:07] And basically I was because they went down the tubes too.

[49:12] Yeah, I mean, your, your artwork was, I mean, unbelievable.

[49:16] I mean, just as far as like the, the women were always the prettiest, always the best looking

[49:21] all was the curviest.

[49:22] And on the Williams games, they were always, you know, that pointy and the godly stuff,

[49:29] they were all real cartoony, you know, that real cartoon look.

[49:33] You know, that was, that was a, that's called George Mullin.

[49:36] He worked on, he was there working for ad posters from, I think, from basically from

[49:42] World War II on.

[49:43] And he just, he just had this idea that didn't fall should be, you know, like thick and

[49:49] plain, you know, a lot of this cartoony, you know, and there was another guy that worked

[49:54] for ad posters.

[49:55] He had everything, the pointy style faces that kind of like, you know, like modern art.

[50:01] I remember, they had one with the Beatles and then they had another one.

[50:06] All right.

[50:07] A hyper spill stuff like that, that style.

[50:10] Yeah, the capersville was real pointy art too.

[50:13] Now, did you ever know Roy Parker by chance?

[50:16] Did you ever know Roy Parker?

[50:18] Yeah, Roy Parker.

[50:19] He was another one from ad poster.

[50:21] He had a, that was a cartoony guy too.

[50:25] He used to like the kind of little sexy too.

[50:28] You know, those had girls in shorts and stuff like that.

[50:32] Now, you're, the guy you were talking about at Williams, did you mean Jerry Kelly?

[50:36] Oh, yeah, Jerry, you know, Jerry Kelly worked for Ballin.

[50:39] Oh, he worked for Ballin?

[50:40] Well, okay.

[50:41] He did a lot of stuff in the, basically, in the 60s.

[50:47] But he just, he just kind of faded away.

[50:50] I don't think he was very interested in it anymore.

[50:52] Yeah, he only did 13 games and, you know, some for Williams and some for Ballin.

[50:59] And that was, that was about all he did.

[51:01] He didn't do a lot.

[51:02] No, he didn't.

[51:03] I'm at a once.

[51:04] He seemed like a nice guy.

[51:06] So, what was it out of all the, all the artwork you did on the pinwall machines?

[51:10] What was the one that you had the most fun with?

[51:12] Probably not a hurry.

[51:13] Yeah, that's a, that's a beautiful glass.

[51:16] I, I really, I know you didn't like the four color process so much, but I really liked

[51:21] the Nitro Ground Shaker one.

[51:23] That and Tamsantastic and Wizard.

[51:25] Those ones are like my favorite.

[51:26] I'm one of these people, so all fashion, like, I can't even operate a computer.

[51:33] You know, I just, I was stuck with the old, they tried and proved.

[51:38] And it's right now, the, you know, computer graphics, it's all on the screen.

[51:43] It's an entirely different concept.

[51:45] It's nothing, there is no artwork.

[51:48] It's all, you know, it's the television thing.

[51:51] You don't use the computer at all then in any of your art, right?

[51:54] No, I still do it the way the Egyptians used to do it.

[51:58] Thousands of years.

[52:00] I get old, scribed over my light table.

[52:03] I like that.

[52:04] Doing the separations and all that stuff.

[52:08] Wasn't I hated the four color process?

[52:10] It was just, it was, I was just used to doing it the old way.

[52:14] Now, I once saw a, a twin wind back glass that had, you know, there's a girl in the center,

[52:22] a real pretty girl in the center and she's got kind of like a halter top on it.

[52:25] Yeah, right.

[52:26] It's our, you know, I saw one version of the glass where she's topless.

[52:29] Oh, yeah.

[52:30] Now, did you do that or did somebody else do that?

[52:32] No, I knew the guy designed it, designed the, the play field play.

[52:38] Real nice guy and he was getting married and he was very proud of that game.

[52:44] So we made that up as a joke.

[52:47] I just took a razor blade, scraped off her halter in the back and then I painted this

[52:55] boom and stuff.

[52:59] We gave it to you as a birthday present.

[53:01] Wow, it's pretty good.

[53:02] You just painted that, huh?

[53:04] Yeah.

[53:05] Well, that's why you're the artist and I'm not.

[53:08] That was hand painted.

[53:11] On future spot.

[53:12] He said like you did the, the artwork for the play field and the plastics but not for

[53:17] the back glass.

[53:18] Is that true?

[53:19] Yeah.

[53:20] Well, no, why would that happen?

[53:21] Well, I, like I said, I had an art director who, he had, he was more into outer space stuff.

[53:30] He was like flash Gordon type things and I, we just had a different view of the earth,

[53:37] you know?

[53:38] I made up a back glass and he didn't like it because it, you had just a different idea

[53:45] and so he, he did the back glass.

[53:48] Did you save your artwork?

[53:50] Yeah, I still have that back glass somewhere.

[53:53] It was, it's actually just, it was drawn on, it was just colored pencils on the, on the

[54:00] plan, you know, the back glass plan.

[54:03] So were there any other kind of interesting stories that, you know, while you were doing

[54:06] the, well, you didn't talk about maybe this air aces and bond voyage?

[54:10] Oh, air aces, yeah.

[54:12] We made that up kind of at the height of the Vietnam war.

[54:17] Basically, the, we had an aviator there.

[54:20] He was coming in from his mission and he had the girl, they're kind of welcome.

[54:25] He had back home, he had this red biplane.

[54:27] Basically, it was kind of thought of as kind of like the, it wasn't a World War II.

[54:33] It was basically remember the biplane, it was kind of like a, like a biplane that they

[54:38] had, we're using in the late 20s and early 30s.

[54:42] Yeah, I was going to say it kind of had a 1930s field camera.

[54:45] I mean, basically I had machine guns on the plane and bomb, bomb rack and on the play

[54:53] field, I mean in the back glass, there was a battleship.

[54:56] Like they were all these planes were diving down on a battleship.

[55:00] That was a splatter of little planes in the background.

[55:05] There was, it was like they were flying over an enemy battleship and they were about

[55:09] to peel off and dive on the damn thing.

[55:13] And head of marketing was like a raw shear and he was definitely against the war and

[55:20] then Vietnam and he wanted to eliminate any possible connection to war and it was his personal

[55:28] feeling.

[55:29] So he requested I take out the battleship, this iron replanes and basically it kind of

[55:37] screwed up the whole point of the picture, you know what I mean?

[55:40] Right, right, right.

[55:41] I was seeing.

[55:42] Look, like the thing was, this guy was coming back from a mission of bombing or sinking

[55:49] a battleship and then the back of the, back in the background showed the actual fight

[55:55] where the planes were diving down on this battleship which was, you know, a quarter of a mile

[56:01] down below these planes, you know.

[56:04] And so you saw the battleship kind of with a wig like it was like you used to see the

[56:09] ships when they were trying to avoid a bombing attack and we back and forth and you know

[56:14] they had the trail behind the ship.

[56:17] And so basically I had this battleship kind of running towards life underneath these planes

[56:23] and then I had like puffs of anti-curve aircraft flying around the planes and all that was

[56:30] taken out.

[56:32] And so it just, so basically it was just a bunch of planes sailing through the sky with

[56:37] no mission.

[56:38] But if you remember the guy said the guy in the foreground was with the girl, he was a little

[56:44] blurb there, it says mission accomplished.

[56:47] So the whole connection was lost.

[56:50] Right.

[56:51] And then on the plane it says he's got a skull and crossbones in the word flash.

[56:56] Did that mean anything?

[56:57] No.

[56:58] No.

[56:59] You know what's again lost in translation due to the modifications, right?

[57:03] Like in the racing game, I had a lot of names on the racing cars.

[57:09] I had names of people who worked in the department in the engineer, the Norm Clark and they had

[57:17] William Donnell on there.

[57:19] I was the president of the company and the sponsors, different sponsors, you know, they

[57:24] write on the NASCAR stuff, you know, like that.

[57:27] You mean on the two you're talking about the point now in both the racing games they made?

[57:30] Oh, do you mean they had names on both of them, huh?

[57:33] Like in Ground Shaker there was various names of guys that worked in the department and

[57:41] the other one that Texas twin thing that was there, a lot of names of people that worked

[57:46] in the department.

[57:47] Yeah, like on the car and Nitro Ground Shaker, it said Dr. Doom.

[57:51] I don't know if that means anything.

[57:53] No, I didn't mean anything.

[57:55] I only think why is the not a hurry thing, the Germans got very upset even though they

[58:03] loved the game, they didn't like that inscription on the dagger which they said brought back bad

[58:08] memories, figured they lost the horn.

[58:16] So was that in the Nitro Ground Shaker on the car?

[58:19] It says Mad Dog Christians in which it courses you.

[58:23] Is that you in the car?

[58:25] Well, it's a better looking version of me.

[58:27] Now, how did you get that name Mad Dog?

[58:31] I got David and the Army.

[58:33] They called me Mad Dog because it was, you know, where I just did a lot of nutty stuff

[58:39] when I was in the Army.

[58:41] So they mostly drinking exploits and stuff like that.

[58:45] Got you.

[58:46] So, in the Army you, there's a lot of nicknames for different characters, you know.

[58:52] Right.

[58:53] Like, for instance, one of the guys that was facing there and we could call the jackpot

[58:57] Sullivan because first time we got his paycheck, he walked into the EM club, sat down

[59:04] with the first flat machine and he wouldn't stop playing damn thing until he got a jackpot.

[59:09] And so he was always broke.

[59:12] Right.

[59:13] I guess Mad Dog is probably kept over on Mercedes coming off a mountain one time.

[59:22] And that got everybody very excited.

[59:27] Rolling a Mercedes down a mountain.

[59:29] Was this the Army?

[59:30] You talking about a Mercedes like a passenger car?

[59:34] Yeah.

[59:35] I was in Germany.

[59:36] I had a little Mercedes that I bought for the old one, 1953 Mercedes.

[59:43] It looked like something was made in the 30s.

[59:46] You know, and it had the old type fenders and stuff, you know.

[59:48] It was kind of a cute old car.

[59:50] It was added today.

[59:53] But, you know, I tried not to, you know, you can put little things in these back classes.

[01:00:04] And I didn't want to do anything that would actually be insulting or anything to anybody

[01:00:13] with, you know, silly things, you know.

[01:00:16] Sure.

[01:00:17] I did a great job.

[01:00:18] I mean, outstanding.

[01:00:19] All right, Dave's anything I left out that I should have brought up?

[01:00:24] No, I, like I said, left there in 82 the long time ago.

[01:00:28] But I'm still doing artwork.

[01:00:29] I'm doing stuff for Harley Davidson right now.

[01:00:33] So I'm still at it, got an office at home.

[01:00:36] I can't realize I'm 68 years old now.

[01:00:39] So it's kind of a part of the over the hill gang.

[01:00:43] Not yet.

[01:00:44] Not yet.

[01:00:46] Oh, what's in your heart and what you draw with that pen, you know.

[01:00:50] Well, still works.

[01:00:51] I still got my set of repeat your graphs and so I hardly likes the stuff I do.

[01:00:56] So there you go.

[01:00:57] There you go.

[01:00:58] Well, thanks again, Dave.

[01:01:00] I appreciate the time.

[01:01:01] I really appreciate you talking to me.

[01:01:02] Yeah, say hello to my friend, Clevel.

[01:01:03] Tell him I hope to see him again.

[01:01:04] All right, I'll have him do the call.

[01:01:05] Okay, thanks.

[01:01:06] Okay, you take care.

[01:01:07] Bye-bye.

[01:01:08] I'd like to thank Dave.

[01:01:09] I'm spending some time with us.

[01:01:10] You talk to us here on Topcast.

[01:01:12] Really do appreciate his time and his artwork.

[01:01:16] His artwork is just unbelievable.

[01:01:19] One of the most famous artists of the whole pinball era is certain Dave Christians in

[01:01:31] there.

[01:01:32] Really appreciate him spending some time with us.

[01:01:34] So until next time, I hope to hear you again on Topcast.

[01:01:39] Bye-bye.
