[00:44] Lawler of Williams, Valley, and Stern. So now, part two of our extended interview with Pat

[00:50] Lawler. Okay, so we're once old 7300 units. Like you said, that was an excellent, an excellent

[01:00] run. So now, your next game was was fun house. Where did the whole team actually originate

[01:11] from? You know, I imagine originate well before Rudy came about. I wanted to do a game

[01:17] with a big talking head. That was the original concept. The original concept I had was I'm

[01:22] going to have this big head. It's going to be on the play field. It's going to be sitting

[01:26] there yacking away at you, and you're going to get the you're going to get the whack back

[01:30] at it with the ball. That was the concept. As we went along, I was trying to figure out

[01:37] okay, what would be the theme that would encompass this whole, you know, this whole kind of

[01:43] bizarre concept of, you know, a talking head and whatever. Somewhere in the development

[01:48] of me drawing the game and working with it, I said, you know, there used to be this

[01:53] great amusement park that I grew up next to across the river here called Riverview, and

[01:59] it had this huge, I had this huge fun house where you walked in through the mouth of a

[02:06] laden. It was called a laden's castle. And the eyes on the, the eyes on a laden move.

[02:12] They moved back and forth on the fun house. I said, why don't we just, you know, why

[02:18] don't we do fun house? Why don't we make this a whole amusement park game? I kind of

[02:22] worked a amusement park game because at the time, Barry Osler, you know, was king of the

[02:29] amusement park games. He had done comet, cyclone, and so I couldn't take the direct route

[02:37] of doing the amusement park rides and the roller coasters and all that stuff. That was sort

[02:41] of Barry's point of reference. And so I decided that what I was going to do was do this

[02:51] fun house theme, which was a whole side show theme. And we did more of the wacky side show,

[02:58] carnival, fun house thing. And it turned out great. Now, the naming of a Rudy came about

[03:07] from your daughter, sorry, remember correctly? Yep. Yep. At the time we, we were trying to figure

[03:15] out what we could call our, our dummy. And I came home and I had some pictures. And I

[03:22] showed them to Cassandra. And I said, what should we call the, you know, what should we

[03:27] call the dummy? And I, you know, gosh, no, it's where she got all this from. She just

[03:31] stared at it and went Rudy. And I said Rudy. And she said Rudy. And I said, okay. Now,

[03:40] how was the talking head concept taken at Williams? I mean, this is another crazy pat

[03:48] law or idea. I would imagine is what they were saying. Oh, yeah. No one was sure, once again,

[03:55] what we were cooking up. They were, everybody was up in arms because, oh my god, they're,

[04:01] they're building a giant, you know, well, they didn't know. They didn't, first of all,

[04:06] that they didn't know how big the head was going to be. Everybody assumed it was going

[04:09] to be some small little thing that would be, you know, on the play field. And it wouldn't,

[04:15] first of all, they all assumed it wouldn't be animated. You know, how could you hit a head

[04:20] that, you know, moving and talking and doing things? You know, nobody even dreamed of such

[04:25] a thing. Well, luckily, the mechanical engineer that I had had spent time in the toy business.

[04:31] And he's a genius. And he sat there and he dreamed up a way where you'd have a mechanical

[04:40] mouth going up and down. And his eyes would move and you'd be able to do that and his eyelids would

[04:46] move. And then, you know, we brought in Johnny LC and Johnny LC happily did sketches for what

[04:55] a side show dummy should look like. And then everybody said, okay, this is really cool. How big

[05:03] is this thing going to be? And I went over to my play field and I came over and I brought out

[05:08] this big block of wood that was the size of it. And I said, it's going to be this big. And

[05:13] they all looked at me and said, you're kidding. And I said, no, it's got to be so big that it

[05:18] just blows you away when you're looking at it in the game. And they said, how are you going to fit

[05:23] it in there? And I said, that's my job. You love me. We're about that. And so we went off and

[05:30] everybody did their thing and we had this. It was, you know, Rudy is way bigger than most people

[05:36] dreamed we'd do. And I know I've told the story before. This is one of the great stories

[05:42] from Williams. The very, you know, sort of first time we had the whole game together.

[05:50] With Rudy, with his face, within talking, Neil, the Castro came upstairs on the floor.

[05:58] Neil, the Castro is the midway president at the time. And he walked in and he played the game.

[06:03] And he turned to everybody in the room. And basically, this is a paraphrase. He said,

[06:11] he said, don't fuck this up. He said, he said, this is so cool that I can't imagine that we're

[06:23] not going to sell a zillion of these. And he walked out. And of course, we're all giving each other high

[06:29] five. And then the, you know, but something I want to make very, very clear here. Something like

[06:41] Rudy takes everybody. It doesn't just take a game designer. It takes all of these talented people

[06:51] to make something like that come to life. Let me give you an example. It took John Crutch

[06:59] to figure out mechanically how to make Rudy. It took Larry DeMar hours, hours, hours, hours, hours,

[07:10] hours of him sitting there with his computer, generating a scripting language that would allow

[07:19] Rudy's mouth to look like he was talking the words that you were, you were doing hundreds of

[07:29] hours of him programming Rudy's eyes to follow the ball to look like they were following the ball.

[07:35] Okay, and make that happen. It took the sound and music guys, many, many, many attempts to get Rudy's

[07:44] speech to sound, you know, the way he does. The first attempt we did, he sounded cartoonish and he

[07:53] didn't sound right. Lots of groups would have simply gone, that's good enough. He's cool enough,

[08:00] just put him out on the street. There was one of the music that had sound guys who walked in one

[08:09] day and we said we're trying to make Rudy unhappy because it's getting to be midnight. Rudy needs to

[08:15] be unhappy but he doesn't sound unhappy. What are we doing wrong? And he said, you know, when you

[08:22] talk to a child and you're angry at them, you don't raise your voice, what you do is lower your

[08:28] voice and you slow down. And so everybody went back down to the recording studio and if you watch

[08:36] what Rudy says, he drops down and active and he becomes very sheld. And the first time we put

[08:44] that in the game and we played it, Ed Boone was in the office, he was playing it and Rudy went,

[08:50] I'm not happy with you now. And Ed Boone took his hands off the flippers and he turned everybody

[08:55] went, he went, oh, like that. But it takes so many talented people to do that and every one of

[09:09] those people is deserving of the praise that all of these games got. It's not one person,

[09:21] it's not two people. It's literally 20 people that it takes to make this happen. You know, they're

[09:29] all, Steve Richie says this best, he says, you know, there's one dad, there's one guy who makes

[09:35] sure that everyone keeps the right on the ball. But, you know, there's a team of people with the

[09:42] right on the ball that, you know, that it takes to do that kind of stuff. And, and funhouse is a

[09:49] perfect example of that of the number of talented people it takes to pull that off.

[09:56] The thing that was to me really amazing was the snoring and the way his jaw kind of

[10:04] vibrates almost when he snores, when you put him to sleep, it's just to me it's unbelievable.

[10:10] I think this is a funny story. I don't know if I've ever told a story before, but a couple of

[10:14] years after funhouse came out, I received a call from a professor of languages, you know,

[10:21] Ohio somewhere. And he wanted me to come teach a class on how you infer, you know, language and

[10:31] constructs based on what you're doing with facial expressions and, you know, that kind of stuff.

[10:37] And I told him, I'm, I'm uniquely unqualified to do what you're asking, but I really appreciate

[10:43] you calling. Yeah. And the thing about funhouse too is it's, it's, you know, we're running one,

[10:52] we're operating one there right now at at Marvin's Marvellous Mechanical Museum. And, you know,

[10:56] it makes good money. I mean, we're running at a 50 cent of play and next to it is all the new

[11:03] stirrns. You know, and I don't mean like dog stirrns. I mean, you know, Lord of the Rings,

[11:09] Pirates of the Caribbean, you know, Simpson's family guy, all the, you know, the good stirrns and funhouse

[11:16] basically keeps up with them, you know, I mean, it's, it's, you know, maybe it doesn't make quite

[11:21] as much money, you know, they're at 75 cent and funhouses at 50, but it's still damn, the thing's

[11:28] still learning. Yeah. And once again, we pushed the sales records for that year beyond, you know,

[11:36] where they had been we broke, you know, we, we almost hit 12,000. Any time in the coin operated

[11:44] game business that you break 10,000, that's a big day. That's a really, really big day. And when

[11:53] we hit that, you know, when we, when we got to that number, you know, Joe Dylan at the time was

[11:59] still alive. He was still the sales guy at Williams and he came to me and Larry and he said,

[12:04] he said, you know, a slightly different era, a slightly different time and we might have hit 15

[12:10] or 20,000 with this game. He said, we're, you know, we're still sort of in a run up here. He said

[12:18] that's what you guys just did with spectacular. All right. Now, before we talk about Adam's family,

[12:32] we've got to talk about play field coatings. You were kind of the pioneer in what became Williams

[12:41] Diamond Plate. And this started on, on your games. I mean, typically with there are diamond

[12:46] plated play fields that are in bonds. I run right. Right. Right. Bonsai run. Now, what, what was,

[12:52] I mean, how did you make this happen? Why would it take so long to actually, you know, it was

[12:57] early 90s before this actually became, you know, quote, production standard feature. Why did it

[13:03] take so long and what was the whole process? Diamond Plate was initiated by one of the vendors

[13:12] Sun Process and the guy who was the sales guy for Sun Process at the time was a gentleman named

[13:19] Run Bomb. Run would come in to the, to the plant. Any head this process and he was trying to get

[13:28] people interested in it. And nobody wanted to bite partly because it cost an extra $20 a play field.

[13:38] And so we said, we agreed. Larry said, you know, okay, run. Why don't you do some of the,

[13:46] some of the sample play fields in bonds I run in Diamond Plate and we'll find out how good this

[13:51] stuff is. You also have to understand that you don't just do things like that. You don't just

[13:58] one day have a salesman come in and go, oh, there's this new stuff I can put on your play field.

[14:02] Trust me, it'll be great. And then you put it into production the next week. And one of the

[14:07] reasons you don't do that is because what happens a year later when the play field hard coats

[14:16] starts delaminating from the play field and flaking off in giant chunks. You know, you can't

[14:23] afford to risk your company on untried processes. You just can't. So you have to be conservative

[14:35] and you have to say, all right, we're going to give this, you know, we'll, we'll start out with

[14:39] samples. We'll put them into the real world. We'll try and keep track as best we can of some of

[14:45] these samples and we'll find out what happens with the process. And so we did that with bonds I run.

[14:54] We did more of them with whirlwind and et cetera, et cetera. And so basically it got proved that

[15:05] there wasn't anything detrimental that was going to happen with the hard coat. It was proved that

[15:11] it truly gave the play fields more life. And at some point the company decided, okay, we'll, we'll go

[15:21] with it. Now you have to understand that along with all of that there was a huge discussion internally

[15:30] about are we building play fields that will never wear out? Because one of the reasons that

[15:38] an operator would replace a game eventually was because the play fields were out. If you look at,

[15:46] you know, the ballet games from the from the 60s and 70s and some of the got laid games and the

[15:53] older games, the play fields wear out on your games that are big, you know, get played a lot.

[15:58] They just, they would just wear out. The paint would go away. And so you sold product because that

[16:04] happened. And there was a huge discussion in house about are we cutting a home throat

[16:12] by doing this? And the people in engineering convinced the people in management that it was far

[16:22] better to sell product based on how good your product was than just playing on wearing out your

[16:30] old product. You know, it was kind of the old Detroit, new Detroit thing. And that's how it

[16:37] happened. We started out using it as samples and we went along. Ron was so grateful that I was

[16:47] willing to try it. I have whirlwind play fields in my possession that he had specially stenciled,

[16:57] especially screen printed on the bottom that says this play field was specially made for

[17:03] Pat Waller and is protected by Diamond Point. Looking back on it though, I mean when it became

[17:12] obvious that in the mid 90s, the biggest competitor to Williams games was early 90s games.

[17:22] If you think that Diamond Point was a mistake.

[17:27] Can't convince me of it. You know, it's just like when you buy a car now, you know,

[17:34] it's why I used the automotive analogy. If your company is not darn good enough to build a better product,

[17:42] you know, you should, you should build the best product you possibly can. You know,

[17:48] within the reason and the amount of money that you're putting into the product, you don't sell cars,

[17:54] you know, anymore because the fenders are rusted out. I mean, you sell them because what you're

[17:58] selling is a more technically advanced and better product. And, you know, I'm just not a believer in,

[18:08] you know, purposely building bad things into products because you can.

[18:13] But when you've got games that basically everything else has made to last in a five-year window,

[18:20] but you've got to play field that will last, you know, 10 or 20 years, isn't it?

[18:24] Mechanical parts of the pinball machines won't. And, you know, again, if, you know, if we're not

[18:33] good enough to build new entertainment that people are interested in seeing then we shouldn't,

[18:40] you know, we shouldn't be doing it anymore. And, you know, we could, we could gladly talk about that

[18:45] in the current timeframe. Right. But we're not there yet. So, that's a line up there.

[18:55] Now, Adam's family was the first game with the Godmetrics display screen for you.

[19:00] And, I mean, did this, and also, you know, you've got the toys, you've got the cloud topper

[19:09] with the flashlights in it, and you've got, of course, the hand. But I mean, it doesn't have quite,

[19:18] it doesn't have quite the cool toys that say, like, fun house had, but on the other hand,

[19:23] it's got everything put together in one solid package. You know, it's only about your feeling

[19:31] with that and the toys in the hands and et cetera, et cetera. First of all, the cloud

[19:35] topper on the game was designed, we had the movie script. We had gotten the movie script from the

[19:42] movie company early on. And the opening, one of the opening sequences of the movie that was later

[19:51] cut, there was a, there was a weather machine on top of their house. And at the beginning of the

[19:58] movie, what happened was they were sitting there generating weather off the top of their house,

[20:03] you know, to show how sort of weird and powerful they were. That was eventually cut from the script.

[20:09] But I didn't know that at the time, so I put the cloud topper up there along with the,

[20:13] that's what that weird sort of round bog thing is that's up there on the decal. That's their weather

[20:19] machine, which got cut from the movie. And most people, most people don't, you know, don't know

[20:26] nor care about that. It's also why there's lightning and thunder up there going on. But it ended

[20:31] up staying because at the time we had finished all the work on it and really didn't cost, you know,

[20:35] it was the price of a couple of flash lamps in the, in the topper. Adam's family is a,

[20:45] is, is, is obviously we could talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.

[20:51] But, but it's a, it's a pretty much perfect example of average people being able to walk up to

[21:01] something and see something, not pinheads. People who just were looking for something fun to do,

[21:09] walking up to a pinball machine and looking and, and going, you know, when you play this game,

[21:16] thing comes out and takes the ball away. And, you know, everyone, I tell this story, at the time we,

[21:26] we were in touch with Paramount's light, you know, licensing group with their marketing people.

[21:32] And when the marketing people had gotten the rights to do the movie, they had gone out on the street

[21:37] with their clipboards and they were asking people things. And, and they would walk up to people

[21:44] and they would do this. They would go, dada da da snap snap. And people would look at them. 85%

[21:50] of the people would look at them and go, Adam's family. And, in the marketing world,

[21:57] if you can get past 20%, you know, 21% of recognition of your product out of a gate,

[22:07] that's considered to be a, you know, overwhelming thing. These people had 85% or 90% of the people

[22:14] they were walking up to going, dada da snap snap going, Adam's family. They didn't have to

[22:19] solve a movie as much as give people what they expected. And, we made sure when we did the game,

[22:28] that we gave them what they expected. They expected the hand, they expected crazy Gomez,

[22:35] they expected a train being wrecked somewhere. We gave it all to them. And they, they got what they

[22:43] expected. They, you know, I would stand in our gates and watch people grow and grab their

[22:48] girlfriend who obviously could care less about pinball come, come over and they'd stand there

[22:55] expectively waiting for the hand to come out and take the ball away. And, you know, that just,

[23:03] blue people in the pinball community away. They just, they, they looked at it and went, you know,

[23:09] what's with the stupid hand, you know. Again, to us, it's a pinball machine to everybody else who's

[23:16] looking at it. It was an experience they expected. We delivered on the experience and they were

[23:20] more than happy to buy into it. Now, was there any toys, you know, you talked about the

[23:25] chair, the train wreck. I mean, you know, like a cactus canyon type train or any other toys that

[23:31] you wanted in, in Adam's family that didn't, didn't come to, you know, a reality for whatever reason.

[23:37] Actually, in the, in the first pass of what I wanted to do when I read the script, I wanted to

[23:42] take the whole back box and I wanted to turn it into a dollhouse. I wanted you to walk up to the

[23:48] back box and I wanted you to look inside the rooms of their house and see the different things that

[23:52] were in there. And we sort of gave up on that early on because we couldn't figure out who

[23:58] had to pull it off cheaply enough. But I thought, wouldn't that be cool? You walk up to a pinball

[24:03] machine and what are you doing? You're stirring into the back glass to see the things in the rooms

[24:07] of their house. Yeah, maybe even like a diner type thing with the little guys on springs type

[24:13] thing. Right. Well, you know, obviously Adam's family is the, you know, the game to beat all

[24:20] games as far sales figures. I mean, you sold, you know, well over 20,000 units, especially if you

[24:25] include the, you know, the 1994 collectors edition. And 232. There you go. You know, the thing

[24:33] that kills me about that game is it's, you know, like I'll have a pinball party. And Adam's family

[24:40] will sit there and no pin heads will play it. But if you have, you know, like you were saying

[24:45] regular people over, they just swoon over it. It's unbelievable. And like I recently bought

[24:52] a second Adam's family from a guy. And I put it on location. And now location I've got a,

[24:57] I've got a spider man. I've got the Pirates of the Caribbean. You know, big, stern games,

[25:02] new, stern games. And I've got an Adam's family right next to them. And the Adam's family got

[25:08] damn it. That thing made more money than the other games. I mean, it killed Spider-Man. I mean,

[25:13] it wasn't even close. And you know, and I mean, it's just unbelievable. It's in one of those

[25:18] timeless themes. People will travel to play that game, especially now because they can't find them.

[25:26] Yeah, we just, we, Larry and I received an award from Play Meter Magazine. And I know you're in

[25:32] the trade. So you know what Play Meter Magazine is. We received an award for Adam's family being

[25:40] the longest running game on their top 10. We got that this last fall. So the game had been

[25:52] in the top 10 for 17 years. Yeah, it's just, it's one of those games. It just, you know, it won't

[25:59] stop earning. It's just, it's a testament that you did everything right. I mean, everything

[26:06] hit dead on nuts. Perfect. And, and it's just the theme that just won't go away. Even though

[26:11] there hasn't been an Adam's family movie. And since what they had the second one in the mid 90s.

[26:16] So it's kind of been out of the public's, you know, mind-eye for a number of years. You have people,

[26:23] they, they love that game. And yet, and yet, it's the game that single-handedly

[26:30] walked right up to the edge of the line of being not understandable in terms of gameplay.

[26:42] And the entire pinball industry followed it over the cliff right after that.

[26:49] You mean because it was just the the software design of it became, like you said, a bit

[26:58] overwhelming. The template for all pinball machines afterwards. It's, it's you have modes.

[27:06] And you sit there and you play the modes. And when you get done with the modes, you get to play

[27:11] a wizard mode. Okay. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the great, you know this. The great

[27:18] thing about coin-operated games is once everyone sees a hit, they will beat it to death until they,

[27:26] you know, are forced to do something different. In the 18 intervening years, no one has changed

[27:34] the software template for how you build a pinball machine. They are exactly the same today as they

[27:44] were in 1992. Well, we'll come back to that. But the, the one thing that's kind of interesting,

[27:52] or an interesting question was, who was driving that train? Was that you or was that Larry?

[27:59] We all were. Everyone. The, you know, Larry had the, had, and you know, first of all, John Norris

[28:09] had done a, had done a, a game. Where he had a couple of very, very, very simple modes in it.

[28:23] And Larry had, you know, Larry like all, like all of us. All of us had seen those, you know,

[28:30] we saw what everybody else was doing. And Larry said, well, what, what if you took some of these

[28:35] simple modes and really integrated them more into the gameplay? And, you know, through his genius,

[28:44] he took and, you know, really worked them so they, they were part of the game. Now you could

[28:50] also look back at Funhouse. Funhouse has him, has a mode in it. You know, get yourself a hot dog.

[28:56] Rudy sits there and starts to, to go get yourself a hot dog, get yourself a hot dog. And,

[29:02] that, that's a mode, you know, there's clearly a mode there. So we were, we were heading in that

[29:09] direction. And, you know, again, we got right up to the precipice of where you were supposed to

[29:18] go with Adam's family. And, everybody drove over it like Lemmings following that.

[29:27] Well, when you sell, you know, 20 plus thousand units, more of any pinball machine in the history

[29:34] of time and space, this has to wield you a fair amount of power and with power becomes

[29:44] responsibility. How do you feel that you've handled it? Well, you get to the next game, which is

[29:50] Twilight Zone, and I've said this publicly over and over and over again, we drove off the cliff.

[30:04] We very carefully integrated a theme where you went out of our way to, to give a more and better

[30:09] and bigger and more powerful and cooler and all that other stuff. And on location, Twilight

[30:14] Zone never did that well. It did okay. It, it, it was not understandable. A normal person would

[30:21] walk up to Twilight Zone and go, I have no idea what this game is doing. All right. You know, we,

[30:27] we, we drove it over the cliff. You know, and once again, you know, I have to be very clear

[30:35] about this. People who play pinball, you know, they know what's going on because it's their hobby.

[30:42] It's their specialty. You know, if you go to somebody who knows about diamonds, their specialty

[30:47] is diamonds. They know what's going on, but nobody else does. And so you end up playing to a smaller

[30:56] and smaller audience who, who wants more and more and more of the weirdness that, you know,

[31:04] that only they understand. And it, that becomes a problem. That becomes a big problem.

[31:12] But, but Adam, like I said, Adam delivered on what average sorts of people wanted to do. And,

[31:20] and for that, I'm, you know, I'm grateful that that everybody's hard work paid off.

[31:25] Well, the one thing that I noticed by the time you're hitting Twilight Zone and Adam's family and,

[31:34] and even whirlwind, not so much fun house, Fonsey Runner or Shakers, though you, you're coming up with kind of a,

[31:44] I don't want to say a standard design, but you're coming up with this design of either three or six pop

[31:48] bumpers either on the far left or far right side. And they're kind of like a loop, you know,

[31:53] they're to get to them, you kind of loop around and then they exit down out back. Was this, I mean,

[31:59] were you designing play fields now, um, pre-theme or theme and then play, play field or play field and then theme or were you kind of getting?

[32:09] No, just like I'd always done. Leslie, you begin to, you begin to say to yourself, I have some signature things that I put into what I do.

[32:21] Musicians do it, you know, all kinds of creative people do it. I was sitting there and I was saying I've got some things that the people who play my games expect to see in my games.

[32:33] You know, the, what I call the pet bottom, which is the five-ling bottom, which is, you know, which is, which is tricky to do correctly.

[32:45] There's geometry down there to doing that little bottom that's different than a Steve Richie bottom.

[32:52] You know, if it's one shot's or bigger, there's a slightly different angle to what goes on.

[32:57] And the jet bumpers were sort of the same thing. I really, really, really like the shots, you know, when I was doing the shots through the jet bumpers,

[33:09] where you could actually shoot the ball without touching the jet bumpers and it would go ripping through there.

[33:14] You know, that takes a lot of work to sit there and lay that stuff out so that it works correctly.

[33:22] And I kind of considered that to be sort of my signature stuff. You know, if you could walk up to a pet game and you could see a pet game with the signature stuff.

[33:32] And, you know, did I do it too much, probably?

[33:40] Was I sitting there and just mindlessly cranking out play fields? No.

[33:44] Every one of those play fields took the same amount of hard work as every other one.

[33:52] There's a lot that goes into, when you start out with a blank sheet of paper, even if it looks to normal people like you're just jamming things in the same place you're not.

[34:01] And if you're off by a half an inch from where they used to be to where you're putting them in this game, well then the shot goes in a different place and you struggle to make it all work.

[34:13] It's far from being, you know, canned or whatever.

[34:17] You know, and some of the more modern stuff that I did in the last 10 years, I purposely shook myself out of what I considered to be sort of the signature stuff.

[34:32] And said, okay, it's time to just give it up and do something different except for the bottom. I love my five-waying bottom. I don't know why I just do.

[34:41] And, you know, I can do interesting things with it. Other people try and copy it and, you know, the, I smile because they don't get the geometry right.

[34:53] You know, there's a lot that goes into making network.

[34:57] But I mean, no, I agree. And you've had some great success with, you know, with, you know, like I mean, for instance, the NASCAR doesn't have the shoot through the pop bumper thing.

[35:09] And obviously, a family guy really doesn't either. And, you know, I like him. I think it's, you know, I think it's good when you shake things up.

[35:22] Yeah, it's just, you know, you, you, you know, you decide today we're going to finally, you know, finally do something different. And that's fine. You know, I, I, I really like the challenge of doing.

[35:37] I'm the kind of person that likes that, you know, obviously what we talked about earlier in the interview. I like the challenge of doing things that makes other people uneasy.

[35:47] I like, I like telling people on no good gofers that there's going to be a ramp that comes down from space and launches a ball.

[35:55] You know, that that that's upsetting to that was upset. That again was upsetting to people. You know, you're, you're going to, you're going to do what? And the ball is going to do what?

[36:04] You know, so, you know, doing that kind of stuff is great fun for me.

[36:10] Now, when they decided in 94 to do the Adams Family Collector's Edition, what was your, what was your take on that and where and how involved were you in that project?

[36:20] They knew they could sign our games. It was a business decision. And they realized that they had understood they were getting calls from distributors saying, can we please buy more Adams families?

[36:33] And that was unheard of at that time. Williams didn't put anything back in production.

[36:40] And so, you know, they were getting called. They were getting called. And finally they re-lended and said, all right, we're going to, you know, we're going to build some more games and the day they announced the thousand games, they were sold.

[36:54] Every one of those thousand was gone. And the real truth was they could have sold more. But the guy who was in charge of sales for the company,

[37:05] they were, we were legitimately also getting called by our distributors and saying, you know, okay, I'm really happy with my Adams Family. What's another game I can sell? I need more, you know, I need more product to sell.

[37:20] And so, they didn't have the way with all the really run three lines because they were running the value line, the Williams line. And, you know,

[37:29] so they built the thousand games. They called it, you know, they called a Adams Family Go. We were instrumental in setting up the whole plaque thing. And, you know, and these science certificates, that was my doing. That was all my doing was the science certificates and the plaque.

[37:45] You know, I went, I said, if we're going to do this, we're going to do it. And we're going to be really, you know, I'd seen the collector stuff that you could buy, you know, from Franklin Mint and stuff.

[37:54] And I said, we're going to do it big time. We went out. We got real sandcast plaques. You know, we didn't, we didn't cut on the things. We put the gold armor on them, the brass armor.

[38:08] And we did a few things different in the game. And, you know, they had sold their thousand the day they announced them. They were happy. They bumped another thousand games out. And we were happy because we sold another thousand.

[38:23] And that's how it went.

[38:32] The Twilight Zone, when you got that theme, was that a theme that you were digging for?

[38:37] I came up with Twilight Zone, you know, again, it was another, it was another thing that I had really enjoyed as a kid watching on TV.

[38:46] And, you know, we already talked about soft licenses. And that was a soft license. It was, you know, I can get the license. I can do all this ridiculously crazy stuff.

[38:58] Just I know around it and use the license, you know, use the license, you know, as best we can. And it worked out really well for, you know, for the collectors of today.

[39:09] Yeah, I mean, when did you know that you had gone too far with Twilight Zone?

[39:14] When we put it out on test. Was it too late to do anything?

[39:19] It was too late. We would put the game out on test. And there was a, that was on a Friday night on a Saturday. I came, I hadn't been on test with a belayery and test has been out with it on test.

[39:31] They came back in on Saturday morning. They came back in on Saturday morning. I was already there. They walked up to me and said, my God, we've done an awful thing.

[39:43] And I said, what do you mean? And they related this story about how they had a kid playing the game who had gotten the power ball. And he couldn't get rid of it.

[39:56] He had no idea what to do with it. He had no idea how to get rid of it. And he threw his hands up in the air and screamed, I hate this game and walked away.

[40:07] And that, that death, if you've got people who put their money in, throw their arms up and scream, I hate this game. And don't come back and play again. You may as well put a gun to your head and pull the trigger.

[40:19] Just let a whole lot of work in the next couple of weeks to try and, you know, and try and make it easier for people to understand what we had done.

[40:32] But we, you know, we realized we had gone over a cliff.

[40:36] How did you sell the clock? Again, one of those kind of like the earth shaker institute, one of those things, it doesn't really interact with the ball.

[40:44] But it was an expensive toy. How did you sell that to management?

[40:52] The clock was an entire management meeting. Everybody from management was there. They were demanding that we take the clock out and save money.

[41:05] We were telling them that we, that we were using the clock as a way of showing people how long they had to do things.

[41:17] But it's fit the theme. We'd already pay, it's something most people don't know. Twilight Zone is the most expensive tooling budget ever done for a pinball machine at Williams.

[41:33] The plastic tooling, all of the tooling that went into all those toys that are in there broke every record they had ever spent to do anything.

[41:45] It was an excess of $200,000 for all the tooling, for the gumball machine, for the, you know, for the clock. For all of those plastic parts, we just broke the budget big time.

[42:03] Now, that being said, we went to a show and we sold 17,000 of them.

[42:13] But in all fairness, some of those 17,000 were on closeout.

[42:19] Correct. That's a bad thing, right?

[42:22] And that was a bad thing. You have to understand those orders for that many games were taken at one show. That's unbelievable.

[42:33] People saw the game and just were amazed. They said, this thing's just incredible. And then it went out and, you know, it didn't earn as well as it should have.

[42:45] Yeah, but you know, from a collector's point of view, you're right. It's, you know, I don't know if you follow your, how much you follow your games, but, you know, Adam's family and Twilight Zone have to be the two games that have the most goofy modifications and little toys that you can buy on.

[43:03] And you know, I mean, it's all of that stuff is just a god-eat-junk, but people love those games and they want to dial them up even more than you dial them up.

[43:17] Which is a great testament to, you know, again, you struck the theme. You know, you hit them right where they wanted to get hit. You know, I mean, you did a good thing.

[43:28] You know, I mean, it doesn't sound like you feel that way now, but you did.

[43:34] Well, yeah, I'm, you know, I'm, I try and be, you know, I try and be one of my own best critics.

[43:43] The way you get better at anything is not by having rose colored glasses. It's by saying, what, what did I do wrong that we could do better next time?

[43:52] Sometimes you get it right. Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you take a chance and it doesn't, you know, it doesn't pay off.

[43:59] No, does that mean you should stop taking chances? No.

[44:03] With that in mind, you saw what happened with Twilight Zone and the software being so complicated. Why didn't that become the pinnacle of complicated software and then everything kind of slipped back down, you know, Adam's family or, or, or lower?

[44:16] But it didn't. That wasn't really how it, it panned out.

[44:21] Because the way the world works is people are constantly trained out to do the last thing they saw.

[44:27] And so the last thing they saw was, you know, Adam's family and that and now they've got to do something better.

[44:33] They've got to have three wizard modes and they've got to have 16, you know, things that are happening over here and you have to be able to play, you know, something here and something here simultaneously.

[44:46] And, you know, and again, for people who are locked into what it is we do, that's all fine and good.

[44:53] For people who don't have any clue what it is we're, you know, we're all about its depth. It means they're never going to touch the game.

[45:04] And now you've got 1994 and now the industry is in a solid decline as far as game numbers.

[45:17] I mean, you went from, you know, over 20,000 atoms to over 15,000 of the wildlife and now you're in 1994 with Red and Ted Roadshow.

[45:29] And it's, I don't want to say it's a recycling of an idea but it is to a some degree. What was your thinking with the two heads versus, you know, the Fun House One?

[45:41] Well, first of all, you have to start out with wide bodies.

[45:46] The whole reason that we taught management into doing the wide body thing was that there was historical precedent when you knew that you had a market that was starting to decline, which we all did.

[46:06] There was precedent for saying, all right, we'll change the packaging.

[46:13] When you need to change how you do with candy bars, you change the packaging.

[46:20] When, you know, the industry had done wide bodies before. They were, you know, they were somewhat declining and they decided they were going to try and show people this, you know, bigger, better, jump higher kind of thing.

[46:35] So we decided that, you know, you could put a little more fun in a wide body and maybe we'd be able to try and sell the same big numbers.

[46:49] And so I could always wanted to do a sequel to Fun House, but I didn't want to use Rudy. Rudy needed to be retired.

[47:00] He was far too big a hit to make a second appearance.

[47:04] And we always had these goofy ideas where we wanted to bring his relatives along.

[47:10] And so, red is actually one of Rudy's relatives.

[47:15] There's a line in Roadshow where either he or she says something about his brother in a circus.

[47:27] And of course, Ted's the bulldozer guy and he's a friend of Red's.

[47:34] And so I had this whole big thing I wanted to do, which was, you know, the whole travel the country with the construction thing.

[47:42] And so that's what we headed off to do.

[47:46] I thought it would be really fun to have the two heads talking to each other.

[47:51] Are you sorry that you did that or were you glad that you did that?

[47:55] No, no, because I'm glad that I did it.

[48:00] I'm glad that if I could go back in time and fix one thing in Roadshow, it would be how the game locks balls.

[48:16] The shot to lock balls on Roadshow violates a tenet and pinball which says make it hard to get to the point where you're locking balls.

[48:30] But then go ahead and let people lock the balls.

[48:33] In Roadshow, the shot is so narrow and so thin to lock balls on the left side of the game that people get to locking balls and then can't do it.

[48:44] And say what you will about the music and everything else that goes with it, whether you like country western, once again we were out on a whim trying something different.

[48:55] You and I can sit here and talk about different kinds of music and what we like and whatever.

[49:01] There's a whole giant section of the country that likes country music.

[49:06] And we just decided we were going to go for it, we were going to give it a shot.

[49:11] It was okay.

[49:13] Again, we sold some of the money and we ended up moving I think 7000 at one.

[49:20] If I had a few things to fix I would go back and fix them.

[49:25] But again, if you sort of go along with the theme and put a big smile on your face, there's a lot there to smile at.

[49:37] Candy, 2000 Series System Online.

[49:44] The one game that really makes me smile is safe cracker.

[49:49] I know that again maybe this is your candy bar analogy with different packaging. Is that apply to this?

[49:56] No, well partly.

[49:59] Pinball was clearly in decline. Pinball was taking a huge hit everywhere.

[50:05] We were getting beat up left and right. We were getting screamed at by people our games weren't making money.

[50:13] Our European customers in particular were being beat up by equipment that was a gray area gambling games.

[50:28] And in Europe they were called trail games.

[50:33] What does that mean?

[50:35] People would sort of recognize what those trail games were from the games they play in Las Vegas today.

[50:41] Where you essentially play what amounts to a flat machine on the bottom of the game.

[50:48] And once you earn the right there's a board game above it and you get to move around on the board game

[50:57] and the game would pay you off in these gray area tokens that people would then trade for real cash.

[51:06] And in Europe those trail games hadn't been outlawed and they were taking over the arcades.

[51:15] And so our distributor had brought us some of a couple of trail games and we hit flat engineering and play them and play them and play them and play them.

[51:28] And we looked up and said you know why don't we give it a shot to turn a pinball machine into a combination pinball machine trail game.

[51:38] Maybe we'll regain our lost ground in Europe.

[51:43] And the other complaint was that our pinball machines took up too big a footprint in the locations they were in in comparison to both video games and these trail games.

[51:59] And so I said okay I think it would be a really cool fun challenge to design a slightly smaller footprint pinball machine and do all this other stuff.

[52:10] Well I was just playing it out many years later by someone they said you didn't just change one thing you changed everything.

[52:19] And we did.

[52:22] And so we sent safe cracker to Europe, the Europeans really didn't want to deal with it because they didn't want to flaunt that they were running below the radar of the law on their regular trail games.

[52:42] And they sort of there was a big political thing going on there.

[52:47] In this country the operators didn't have a clue what they were going to do with these tokens.

[52:56] We pointed out to them you know the deal is you're supposed to let them win a token and then give them a pizza or something, give them a free beer.

[53:03] And they were like really and we were like yeah and they were like oh I can't do that.

[53:11] So we could sort of create a gray area pinball machine that nobody knew what to do with them.

[53:16] And that's the reason that assault on the vault is in the game.

[53:20] Yeah.

[53:21] You could put it back in the game and get something different that someone else who had known that couldn't get.

[53:27] I think assault on the vault is so cool.

[53:30] I mean you get the token and it's like an entirely different game.

[53:34] I think it's genius. It's fun.

[53:37] And the whole token thing was you know it was so in Europe they didn't really have a big problem with it.

[53:46] In this country people didn't have any idea that the game gave you this token and they'd stand there with it in their hand and they'd stare at it.

[53:54] They'd go what does this do?

[53:58] And there were a couple of operators. There were a couple of operators.

[54:02] There were some up in Minneapolis St. Paul. There were some in the South that understood they put a sign on the game.

[54:09] You know get a magic token you know a bartender will give you a beer or bartender will give you a pizza or whatever.

[54:17] And they had games that made a lot of money.

[54:20] There were a few operators that got it. They understood what the game was and they really sort of enjoyed operating them.

[54:28] But by and large we created a game that sort of mystified people.

[54:35] They weren't really sure what it was all about.

[54:38] But you only sold 1100 units. That machine could have sold more.

[54:44] But something happened didn't it in this whole transition between here in Europe or something?

[54:52] Yeah there was some of that one other thing that's an interesting point that will probably bring up later in our discussion.

[55:01] So Shracker was going to be monopoly.

[55:06] And Roger Sharp and I had gone to Hasbro and we had talked to Hasbro about making the board game on top of it be monopoly.

[55:18] And we had set up a licensing deal.

[55:23] And our German customer came in and we said what do you think about this being monopoly?

[55:29] And he said monopoly is a stupid old game that only old people know nobody else cares.

[55:38] No I won't buy them if it's head cast monopoly.

[55:43] And so we basically had gone to all the trouble to make the acquaintances do the licensing.

[55:50] It was a big deal because monopoly at that time wasn't just licensing themselves that were atomic and hairy.

[55:57] And I was really disappointed because I really wanted it to be monopoly.

[56:02] But we headed off and I turned it into safe cracker.

[56:07] And so that's some of the background story that went with that.

[56:13] The other part of what occurred there was we had gone to all the trouble of building this new game.

[56:22] And the game went out and it earned okay.

[56:25] I mean it didn't earn less than a regular pinball machine.

[56:30] But it didn't earn enough more than a standard game once again like Bones I run that you'd be inclined to run out and buy them.

[56:39] And what happened at the same time was for I and Eddie came out with a tech from Mars.

[56:48] And a tech from Mars, you know a pinball machine had been making 150, 175, 200 dollars.

[56:57] A tech from Mars came out and a tech from Mars was making $300, $325 a week.

[57:06] And people looked and said wow this is a regular pinball machine.

[57:12] There's no reason to continue this crazy experiment.

[57:16] And they were right.

[57:18] You know they were right for what happened.

[57:21] And Brian did a fabulous job with a tech from Mars.

[57:24] It was just a great game.

[57:26] And you know once again Williams was its own competition.

[57:31] Yeah because originally there was going to be like a whole line of these smaller games right.

[57:36] Right correct.

[57:38] I like Sift Cracker and I don't know again if you follow the collector's market they bring good money today.

[57:45] I mean they don't sell cheap.

[57:47] I managed to hang onto my four of them.

[57:50] Four of them?

[57:52] Speaking of which, what do you have a pinball collection if you do what do you have in it?

[57:57] I have one of everything I've ever built.

[58:00] Except for Sift Cracker you've got four.

[58:03] Yeah I've got a bunch of those there in my poll building.

[58:06] And why do you have?

[58:07] Because we had some parts games that were laying around when we were done testing.

[58:12] And rather than just sell them off the parts I said well I'll give you a few hundred dollars each form for you know.

[58:18] For what I got them, what's in them.

[58:23] And so I've just kept them out in my poll building ever since.

[58:25] Yeah!

[58:27] So now after Sift Cracker and now in you obviously took note of what Brian Eddie did with Attack from Mars.

[58:38] How did no good gopher come about?

[58:42] Well it's another interesting story.

[58:46] No good gopher is I originally wanted to be a sort of backyard mayhem game.

[58:58] I wanted it to be this thing where there were gopher's.

[59:04] It didn't start out to be a golf game in my mind.

[59:09] I had this thing where I wanted the spinning wheel in the game was going to be a weed wacker.

[59:15] And the gopher's were going to be tearing up your lawn and you were going to be playing croquet and trying to kill them.

[59:22] There was all this mayhem going on.

[59:25] The head of Sail of Cayman said you know people in Japan don't have backyard.

[59:32] They don't know what they are.

[59:34] So how am I going to sell this game to people in Japan?

[59:37] I said well we only sell half a container of games to Japan anyway.

[59:42] But he said why don't you make it golf and then I can sell it everywhere.

[59:48] I said okay I'll make it golf.

[59:54] It's one of the only times I've ever been when I was sort of set on something original theme that I got sidetracked on to.

[01:00:04] By somebody else telling me that they were going to sell more games by turning it into golf.

[01:00:13] And I know that there's no good gopher's.

[01:00:18] Once again a game that we came out with it was like oh it's you know the people who are playing can buy the time when oh golf.

[01:00:26] Golf sucks I don't like golf.

[01:00:30] And then some years later in the last few years people walk up to me and go you know I get it.

[01:00:37] It's one of the funniest most fun games I play.

[01:00:43] And so you know I think sometimes when I build things it takes a while you know for it to kind of catch on.

[01:00:54] Were there anything that you didn't gopher's that you're sorry you did or didn't do you know as far you know like you said like the slam ramp.

[01:01:01] You said a lot of people didn't really get that I think that's kind of actually I think that that many playfield the clear many playfield with the whole and one and the slam ramp.

[01:01:09] I think it's a really cool shot myself.
