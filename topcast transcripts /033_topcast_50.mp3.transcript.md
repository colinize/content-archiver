[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:18] Tonight on Topcast this is our 50th Topcast show.

[00:22] 50 shows, number 50. I can't believe we got this far.

[00:26] Everybody at the Topcast tab is quite proud that we've

[00:29] gotten to 50 shows. But tonight we've got a really special

[00:32] show on Topcast. Tonight on Topcast for a 50th show we've got

[00:36] somebody that's an excellent pinball player.

[00:39] Somebody just won a great number of pinball tournaments,

[00:41] but he's also somebody that worked in the industry,

[00:44] working for Dating East and Williams,

[00:47] developing such games as Guns and Roses,

[00:50] the Hoos Tommy, Royal Rumble,

[00:54] and then he moved over to Williams and worked on attack from

[00:56] Mars, Medieval Madness, Monster Bash,

[00:59] Safe Cracker, and Revenge from Mars.

[01:03] And now has recently started working again at Stern,

[01:07] doing some games over there.

[01:10] Special guests. Special guests. Special guests.

[01:14] Special guests.

[01:16] Tonight I'd like to welcome Lyman Sheets to our Topcast show tonight.

[01:20] Again, Lyman worked for Dating East and for Williams.

[01:24] And now is back at Stern, doing programming

[01:27] and operating system development software there.

[01:30] Lyman is also an excellent pinball player,

[01:33] winning a great number of really big pinball tournaments.

[01:37] So we're going to give Lyman Sheets a call right now on Topcast.

[01:41] Hello.

[01:50] Hello. Lyman, it's Clay.

[01:53] Hi Clay, how are you?

[01:54] Good, how are you? Is it OK?

[01:56] I'm good, yeah, sure.

[01:57] OK, how did you get into the whole pinball thing?

[02:01] I mean, what was your first memory of pinball

[02:04] and how you get to her nod to it?

[02:06] Yeah, I wasn't one of those guys who

[02:10] started playing pinball at age three.

[02:14] I didn't pick it up until college.

[02:16] I actually played a lot of video games.

[02:18] I love video games.

[02:20] The Laxian and Robotron, Defender, all these great classic games

[02:27] that I played.

[02:28] And it wasn't until college.

[02:29] And I saw a couple of guys playing Apal Deluxe.

[02:34] And they're just absolutely killing the game, playing.

[02:37] And winning all kinds of credits and stuff

[02:40] and playing and back and forth.

[02:41] And that sort of appealed to me like, hey, they're like video games.

[02:49] There was skill and pinball.

[02:51] And of course, I wasn't very good at it.

[02:54] But I got better over the years watching other people play.

[03:01] I mean, probably one of the first games I played outside

[03:04] of the Apal Deluxe was high speed.

[03:06] I used to play at an arcade in Framingham, Massachusetts

[03:12] fun and games.

[03:12] It's actually still there, although I haven't been in there

[03:16] for a while.

[03:18] I'm, although I'm in Chicago now, I was born and grew up

[03:25] around Boston area.

[03:28] Where'd you go to school?

[03:30] I went to college at the Northeastern University.

[03:35] They had majored in computer science, which

[03:40] did a great CS program back in the day.

[03:44] I'm not sure how it is now.

[03:45] I don't kind of keep up on the school or whatever.

[03:48] But they had a great bunch of professors

[03:53] who mostly all came over from the math department.

[03:56] And so it was a lot of introductory material,

[04:00] basic algorithm, data structures, so on and so forth,

[04:04] and programming, Pascal, C, LIST, and Fortran.

[04:09] And then theory, probably like three years of theory,

[04:13] operating systems, compilers, artificial intelligence,

[04:17] databases, things like that.

[04:19] It was college was like one of the best experiences

[04:23] of my life.

[04:25] Not like I wasn't like this big college party dude

[04:28] or whatever, but it was just a very stress-free, relaxing

[04:33] time for me.

[04:34] It's just a very fun environment and anybody who

[04:38] has that opportunity to go to school and learn

[04:43] should definitely take advantage of it.

[04:47] Yeah, it was my, I mean, I don't mean,

[04:49] when I was in school for, well, actually,

[04:51] I stretched it to five years.

[04:53] And man, I was, which I stretched it longer.

[04:55] I didn't even know who the president was.

[04:57] I mean, it was like, you're just disconnected from reality.

[05:00] It was great.

[05:02] Yeah, I think if I could do absolutely anything,

[05:06] I wanted to do in life.

[05:07] But probably just go back to school full time

[05:10] for the rest of my life because there's, it's just again.

[05:15] It's a very relaxing atmosphere.

[05:18] And you get to learn to me that's one of the best things

[05:22] in life.

[05:25] Never stop learning.

[05:27] So now how did you make this connection between programming

[05:31] and pinball?

[05:33] I mean, was that just like a natural turn?

[05:37] I never really thought about the connection at all

[05:40] because I guess that was sort of insulated

[05:46] as to what options were available as far as what computer

[05:52] science people did.

[05:54] I didn't really get involved or even

[05:58] know about people programming games.

[06:02] I mean, it's supposed it occurred to me at some point.

[06:04] Hey, somebody actually has to write code for these things

[06:09] to work and be fun because they have micro-processors in them.

[06:14] But to me, like, I guess very naively computers

[06:19] were mainframes in PCs because that's mostly

[06:22] what I dealt with in school.

[06:25] And eventually, it worked when I worked

[06:28] for a couple of years at Draper Labs in Cambridge.

[06:33] And after I graduated, I worked for MITRE.

[06:39] In bed, for those names, probably they may or may not

[06:42] mean anything to people.

[06:43] But they're mostly sort of DOD-funded research

[06:47] firm that's probably a bad generalization.

[06:53] But that's mostly, you know, they get their money from the

[06:56] government and they do research projects and RFPs and

[07:00] things like that.

[07:02] But actually, when I was in school, I used to play, again,

[07:07] I sit at fun and games and framing him.

[07:10] I played Black Knight 2000.

[07:13] I used to play a lot.

[07:14] And some of my favorite games back then were

[07:18] Steve's Richie games and Pat Waller games.

[07:20] I mean, I played a lot of Earth Shaker,

[07:23] Bonsai Run, Worldland, and then Steve's games,

[07:29] high speed, obviously, F-14, which I guess, unlike most

[07:34] people, I actually enjoyed playing and liked it.

[07:37] And Black Knight 2000, and one of my friends, not at the time,

[07:42] but later became one of my friends.

[07:45] Dallas, overtour, E used to go to that arcade too.

[07:50] And I used to put in my initials on all the games.

[07:54] He was curious because Dallas is a former, I guess,

[08:02] great pinball player.

[08:03] He won this championship in Connecticut in 1980.

[08:08] And has been to tournament, pinball expo, and so on and so forth.

[08:13] He talked to the staff there at fun and games and asked

[08:17] them if they knew who LFS was, those are the initials

[08:21] I used to put in on the game.

[08:23] And they said, yeah, sure.

[08:25] And so he asked them to give him a call when I showed up.

[08:30] And so I guess one of the next times I showed up,

[08:36] Dallas came over to me and introduced himself.

[08:39] And we played pinball for a couple hours and talked.

[08:44] And of course, this was 1988.

[08:47] And I was in school.

[08:50] And he was trying to talk me into going out to pinball expo.

[08:55] He said, yeah, you should go out to this thing.

[08:58] He probably went it.

[08:59] And I told him I didn't have the time or the money or anything.

[09:05] But it was two years later.

[09:07] And I graduated from school in 1990.

[09:12] And one of my friends, Mike Texteira, a good friend from college.

[09:20] We both were in the CS program.

[09:23] And it was about close to the fall of 1991.

[09:29] And he and I used to play a lot of pinball in college.

[09:33] And he asked me if I wanted just out of the blue,

[09:39] if I wanted to go out for pinball expo 1991.

[09:42] I guess it was a party zone with the tournament games.

[09:46] That's sort of how I remember expo's the year.

[09:48] And what like what game was there.

[09:50] So I thought about it for just a couple of minutes.

[09:55] And I thought, well, why not?

[09:57] I'm employed.

[09:58] I have the time.

[10:00] I have the money to go.

[10:02] And why not?

[10:03] Why not just go out and see what it's all about?

[10:06] Now, I hadn't played pinball in probably about a year and a half.

[10:10] Because once I sort of got out of college, I didn't have a lot of time with work and a lot

[10:20] of the reading and whatever else I would do in my spare time.

[10:25] And so I hadn't played in a long time.

[10:30] And it's kind of hard to go back to play.

[10:33] Well, it's kind of like riding a bicycle, I guess.

[10:37] You're away from it for a long time.

[10:39] And then some of the more advanced skills take a while to refine over a point, some number

[10:49] of times.

[10:53] We went out to Chicago.

[10:54] I had a great time.

[10:55] It was a lot of fun.

[10:57] And I played in a tournament.

[10:58] I did not qualify.

[10:59] I played like, I think like 400 something million on party zone.

[11:05] My friend Dallas, qualified last minute, qualified A. This was back.

[11:09] Convalesco would take eight qualifiers instead of 16 or A or B division or whatever they do

[11:17] now.

[11:18] And he finished second to Rick Stetta in the final set here.

[11:25] But after I went, I saw what everybody was doing as far as their skills and how they were

[11:34] getting scores on the games and whatever.

[11:38] And my thought was, hey, I used to be able to do this.

[11:41] I just need a little bit more practice.

[11:45] And I'll come out next year and see what happens.

[11:50] After that, I started playing again, making time to practice and play.

[11:58] Of course, I didn't own any games.

[12:00] And I used to go out on location and play.

[12:03] There were a few good ones around.

[12:05] Fun and games was OK.

[12:06] There was a bowling alley.

[12:08] It's gone now.

[12:10] It was Metro West Lane run by Bob Sundberg, who has, well, he doesn't have it anymore,

[12:19] actually.

[12:20] I think it could have an act in ball, anybody who's in and around.

[12:23] Act in.

[12:24] There were some new games.

[12:28] There are new stirons there to play.

[12:32] So anybody who wants to go out there and check it out should it's over like kind of in

[12:38] the back amid some novelty games.

[12:44] After that, I just mostly practice and play and being able to find out about tournaments

[12:52] and go to tournaments.

[12:54] I met a lot of people in the industry because they used to go to tournaments to like IFPA.

[13:01] I met Larry DeMar.

[13:03] Well, actually, my friend Dallas introduced me to Larry at Pimboxville in 1991.

[13:12] Then I sort of saw him at IFPA.

[13:15] We talked a little bit about his game and past game, Adam's family was there.

[13:22] And that ended up being the first game I bought.

[13:26] Well, Adam's family has excellent games, very entertaining, great game.

[13:31] Did you buy a brand new?

[13:32] Yeah, back in the day, I sure did.

[13:38] It was difficult for me with my time constraints and so on trying to find good games that worked.

[13:48] It seemed to make sense to just, well, hey, if I'm going to take this seriously or be

[13:53] serious about it or even just have some fun, which is what it used to be back in college,

[14:02] I didn't see the harm in owning a game or two or three or whatever is now 20 something.

[14:10] So you got 20 games in your collection?

[14:13] Yeah, roughly.

[14:16] Some come, some go.

[14:17] I mean, it's mostly limited on space as everybody knows.

[14:25] It happens you start collecting and one just isn't enough.

[14:29] And I think a lot of that has to do with just a variety and one game and how long can you

[14:36] play one game or whatever.

[14:39] Yeah, but realistically, I've been collecting for, well, since 1992, about 15 years,

[14:48] little more than that.

[14:49] Did you get good at fixing games?

[14:51] You mentioned that there was a lot of games you played that were in disrepair.

[14:55] So are you pretty good at fixing your own stuff?

[14:57] But you know what?

[14:58] I learned that just out of interest and necessity, you know, something goes wrong with it.

[15:05] It's like, okay, how do I fix this thing?

[15:09] Of course, now it's a lot easier because you want to figure something out.

[15:13] You just like, go on to internet and do a search and go, oh, yeah, okay, I think I know

[15:18] how to do this.

[15:19] And back then, it was a little harder.

[15:22] Like not like you could go down to the library and figure out how to fix a pinball machine,

[15:26] how that will.

[15:27] But there was a wrecking pinball, which I don't read anymore today because it's just too

[15:35] what I want to say.

[15:38] Deluted?

[15:39] Yeah, I suppose.

[15:42] Back in the days, I think there, and this is probably true of internet in general.

[15:47] And maybe I just, the big, well, I'll just say what I feel about it.

[15:51] I mean, back in the day, I think, you know, they were more educated people using the internet

[15:57] because you actually had to work somewhere or go to school or whatever to some college

[16:04] to get access to it.

[16:06] It's not like, you know, every home user could like go buy a computer and sign up for

[16:11] AOL and get on internet.

[16:14] You know, you had to be reasonably, I don't know.

[16:19] Yeah, a student ought to be able to find a way on.

[16:22] Well, yeah, technically, I guess, technically capable, I suppose, yes.

[16:30] And it wasn't of great interest to everybody because it was, I may be still sort of in its

[16:37] infancy.

[16:38] I mean, there were, for me, there were mostly news groups and that was about it, male and

[16:42] news groups.

[16:43] Right.

[16:44] But within that community, it was great.

[16:46] I mean, I met a lot of people who I wouldn't ordinarily have met.

[16:52] And back in the day, you know, there were a lot of helpful people who were really great.

[17:01] Today, it's difficult because I just think you have, in general, more of a makeup of what

[17:09] the society really is.

[17:11] And you know, you get the good and you get the bad.

[17:15] And so there you go.

[17:16] So now, how did you get over to actually programming machines?

[17:21] Now, I assume you're talking about working on your own games.

[17:24] Did it ever occur to you before you got into the industry that, gee, maybe, you know,

[17:29] it'd be nice if I could change this rule set or change this programming or anything like

[17:33] that?

[17:35] I didn't think so much about changing games other than, say, 16 bugs.

[17:45] It's just kind of a thing where each game, if I like it, it sort of, you know, stands

[17:52] on its own and I don't think.

[17:53] I mean, I may think like, oh, well, if I worked on this game, then I would have done something

[17:58] a little bit different or so on and so forth.

[18:01] As far as changing the game, it's, I don't know, to me, the game is the game.

[18:10] I mean, there's a lot going on right now.

[18:12] It's like, oh, you know, we're going to remake this or, oh, we're going to remake that.

[18:16] And to me, it's like the interesting thing is in the new games and what new things people

[18:24] can do.

[18:25] And also, I think, you know, a lot of the games that are worth remaking are, you know, just

[18:32] fine on their own.

[18:33] You know, they can stand on their own and they've held up for, you know, however many years.

[18:39] But, yeah, I mostly was more, I mean, when I was thinking about getting into the industry,

[18:50] I was thinking more of just like game design as opposed to programming.

[18:56] I mean, programming for me was, it wasn't that big of a deal.

[19:00] It was like, yeah, you know, it's programming.

[19:02] I mean, I sort of felt like anybody could do it.

[19:06] It turns out that's as far from the truth as possible.

[19:09] It just requires a lot of thought and a lot of discipline and a lot of long hours is

[19:18] no other way to say it.

[19:21] But, yeah, I, when I became interested in getting into the industry, I was living in Virginia

[19:33] and I had won the pop alternates in 1993.

[19:40] And Williams sent me out to Las Vegas to like kind of do demonstrations on their games

[19:51] there at the show.

[19:52] They had Twilight Zone and Creature from the Black Lagoon and Dracula there at the show.

[19:58] And so, wait, wait, wait, was that when they taped that camera to like your head and you

[20:03] played their game?

[20:04] What did they call it?

[20:06] I'm sorry, what?

[20:08] What did they call it?

[20:09] Oh, we called it Monkey Cam.

[20:11] Like Jim Green, who I ended up not working with, but he worked for, you know, back in the

[20:18] day, it was just one company.

[20:21] But, yeah, we jokingly called it Monkey Cam because it was just like, you know, you know,

[20:27] it's like, okay, let's watch the train monkey, you know, make this shot or that shot or

[20:31] whatever.

[20:32] And so, yeah, it was, it was just a way to try to get people interested and excited about

[20:47] pinball, you know, at a show.

[20:48] I mean, at a show, you have a bunch of industry people and some operators and some booth beds

[20:56] and not a lot happens there.

[20:58] I mean, most people, you know, the hours are like, like bankers hours for people who sleep

[21:02] in and then, you know, at four o'clock or three o'clock or whatever, everybody goes out

[21:08] and, you know, has a fat meal and parties and goes drinking and whatever else.

[21:12] So, Williams hired, because you won Papa in 1993, so because of that, they hired you to

[21:21] do this?

[21:22] Yes, to go out to Las Vegas and demonstrate on Twilight Zone, yes.

[21:28] Now when did you win your first turn?

[21:30] I mean, you know, you talked about entering and the expo tournaments and you didn't qualify

[21:34] when that one year when Dallas came in second.

[21:37] How long was it before you actually were winning tournaments?

[21:43] It took a little while.

[21:46] Expo 91, where I didn't qualify and then my friend Mike and I actually, we won the

[21:55] double set, IFPA in 1992, but as far as myself, I was like Mr. Second Place because I would

[22:04] go to tournaments and then I would come close but not win and then come close and not win.

[22:10] And it gets disappointed along the way because I felt that I was pretty good and that,

[22:15] you know, I could probably beat most people, but it took individually.

[22:23] It took about a year and a half to actually win a tournament and the Papa tournament in

[22:28] 1993 was the first tournament that I had won, just on an individual basis.

[22:34] And I mean, to, in order, you know, so you went from not going to any tournaments to winning

[22:40] and sounds like under two years, how much time did it take you to hone your skills to

[22:46] get to that level?

[22:48] Actually, not very much.

[22:53] People would probably be disgusted with, you know, if they knew how little time I spent

[23:00] playing and whatever I mean, people think like, oh, these people who are really good at

[23:06] something, they spend their whole lives at it and it's like, well, no, this is just

[23:11] a fun thing for me.

[23:12] And yes, I take it very seriously, excuse me, seriously, but at the same time it's all

[23:19] in perspective.

[23:20] It's just a fun, entertaining thing that I do.

[23:25] But again, it's sort of like riding a bicycle.

[23:29] I mean, for me, I could drop it for months and then come back and take it up and maybe

[23:36] in a period of, I don't know.

[23:40] Two or three days feel like I'm back in it.

[23:45] So, back then it probably wasn't all that different.

[23:49] I mean, back then I was, I might have been a better player back then than I am now.

[23:56] It's really hard to say, but they're really only a handful of skills that anybody needs

[24:02] to really do well in a tournament or competitively.

[24:07] Now how did you get over to your first pinball job I assume was with DADY East?

[24:12] How did you get to that point?

[24:15] Oh, sure.

[24:17] Well, I was in Virginia and I had after, you know, talking with Larry and Pat and spending

[24:27] time with some of the people at Williams at that show in Las Vegas.

[24:36] I thought, wow, you know, they talked about, you know, a little bit what work was like

[24:40] and what they did.

[24:42] And it's more than what they'd normally say, I suppose, say anybody like to any enthusiast

[24:49] who just, you know, say it like a pinball expo or some other show like that where somebody

[24:56] wouldn't necessarily just come up to them and ask like, oh, oh, so, you know, how has

[25:01] worked today or what'd you do or this or that where they just, you know, I mean, I'm

[25:06] talked about it because like, hey, we're at work.

[25:08] We're at a show and here's our games and so on and so forth.

[25:11] And that's when it really occurred to me that like, hey, these people do this for a living

[25:17] and it sounds kind of fun.

[25:19] And I probably have a set of skills that would be useful.

[25:25] So it was after that.

[25:28] I pursued, you know, trying to get a job in the industry.

[25:38] I sent the resume to Larry and Ed Williams and also Lonnie Roth who at that show in Vegas.

[25:48] I met and actually we're on the same flight back.

[25:51] This red eye, huh, Vegas, every flight out of Vegas is a red eye.

[25:56] The flight, we were on the same flight and we talked for a long time on a flight just

[26:06] about, you know, tin ball and games and stuff like that.

[26:09] And one of the things that was really great about the whole, that whole experience was

[26:16] that it seemed like everybody I talked to really enjoyed what they did.

[26:21] And to me, it's really important.

[26:24] A lot of people I think that they kind of go through life and they're like, yeah, I have

[26:29] this job and it has the bills and so on and so forth.

[26:32] And they find other things like outside of work or whatever to entertain them or make

[26:40] them happy in their lives or whatever.

[26:43] And to me, it just hadn't occurred to me that like, oh, wow, you know, you could actually

[26:49] do something for work that's also your hobby.

[26:54] So I sent resume to Larry and I sent resume to Lonnie at D.E.

[27:04] And how long was it before you heard back from these people?

[27:09] It was pretty immediate.

[27:11] I think, I mean, within, you know, like a few days or a week, head and Larry did an

[27:19] interview with me over the phone.

[27:23] And he meets Ted Estes, right?

[27:26] Yes, Ted Estes, right.

[27:27] He was, I don't know if he was manager of the department at the time, but he was, you

[27:34] know, basically worked very closely with Larry on Twilight Zone, which was happened just

[27:41] shortly before that.

[27:44] And then Joe Camico from D.E.

[27:47] actually flew me out to Chicago to interview.

[27:52] And because I had only really talked with Lonnie, I had spent, you know, a lot of time at

[27:58] the show with the guys at Williams.

[28:01] And so I had only really, you know, talked with Lonnie briefly at the show and on the

[28:07] flight back to Chicago, my stopover was in Chicago.

[28:13] And so Joe had me come out to Chicago to just mostly spend the weekend and talk with everybody

[28:20] and all that.

[28:24] So why did you take, why, I mean, did both companies offer you jobs or just D.E.s?

[28:30] D.E.s offered me a job.

[28:32] Williams did not offer me a job.

[28:35] And it's kind of funny actually later, but I'm trying to remember exactly what the reason

[28:49] or whatever.

[28:51] Later, Larry had explained to me that, you know, he wasn't sure leaving an environment

[28:59] like Miter, which everybody, Miter's a great company to work for.

[29:05] But I think the perception is that it's not very intense and people don't have dead

[29:11] lines and people don't really work more than 9 to 5 and work 40 hours a week.

[29:18] And his concern, he told me later, was that it would be, you know, kind of a shock to

[29:26] me to be thrown into an environment where...

[29:29] Yeah, the dead lines were so tight and everybody was pushed.

[29:34] You have to sacrifice a lot in your life to get things done.

[29:40] And it's not for everybody, that's for sure.

[29:45] So, but I wanted to work in Timbol, so I said, sure, I'll go to work for D.E.s.

[29:53] I absolutely will.

[29:56] And I packed up all my things and moved out to Chicago.

[29:59] Was it a pay increase for you?

[30:03] Not really.

[30:05] It was more like a lateral.

[30:08] Lots of living increase.

[30:11] It was, I mean, pretty much a lateral move.

[30:15] Virginia, I lived around North Vicaria and Virginia worked on Langley Air Force Base.

[30:22] And the cost of living there is just not all that high.

[30:28] Now Chicago is there, a lot of people here.

[30:31] It's not as bad as Boston, but it's expensive to live here.

[30:38] So, but no, it's not like they offered me more money outside of what you'd expect from

[30:49] moving from, basically like North of Chicago.

[30:56] So what was your first day like for that matter at D.E.s.?

[31:03] My first day at a new place is always a lot of fun, especially at a Timbol company.

[31:14] Some people were, they saw me and they were, I mean, I didn't know hardly anybody except

[31:21] Joe, Camico, Neil Southner, who I had met and talked with over that weekend and Laudie,

[31:28] obviously, too.

[31:30] I think they sort of knew who I was because they like, maybe they'd see me at a tournament,

[31:37] play an tournament or they would know that, oh yeah, he won this or he won that, whatever.

[31:45] Some people were surprised, they were like, what's he doing here?

[31:49] Like always working here and I don't think people realize that, hey, I have a college degree

[31:57] and I'm a programmer.

[32:01] But it was a lot of fun.

[32:02] I mean, coming in and just seeing everything and seeing this factory was a great thing to

[32:11] see.

[32:12] I mean, he walked in and just games are being built all day long and this was back in

[32:19] the day when nobody could get them out the door fast enough.

[32:25] And work, there were several projects going on at a time.

[32:30] And I mean, it was great.

[32:32] It was just like, it's so unlike, hey, this corporate America where you kind of walk in and

[32:38] everything's quiet and everybody's wearing either suits or ties or a nice pants and

[32:44] whatever.

[32:45] Everybody's wearing shorts and jeans.

[32:47] I moved out in the middle of the summer and everything was just kind of relaxed and very

[32:57] casual.

[32:58] So what was the first project they put you on?

[33:04] I was put on Tommy was the first project I worked on.

[33:08] I was hired to do a dot matrix display programming.

[33:13] Back in the day, the DADies, their system was basically like William System 11 except it

[33:25] had a dot matrix display that communicated with the CPU and the two operating systems were

[33:33] separate.

[33:34] There was an operating system for like game code, what was considered to be game code.

[33:40] And then there was operating system for dot matrix display.

[33:45] I was hired to do dot matrix display programming and the first project I got put on was Tommy.

[33:53] Now it's kind of funny because I talked about the things being like you have to make

[34:02] sacrifices and so on and so forth.

[34:06] When I started I think we had to have a bunch of games ready for the people who did the

[34:18] Broadway musical, Tommy in New York.

[34:20] They were going on sort of like a road tour around the US.

[34:26] And their first stop was in Dallas and we had to have like, I think it was like six

[34:32] games or however many games ready for this premiere.

[34:39] And that happened.

[34:40] We had like six weeks to just basically like throw a game together and get it out there.

[34:48] When you say throw a game together, you mean from like a ground up design or the thing

[34:52] was already designed?

[34:53] Yeah, we had, Joe had pursued, Joe Kamikoe had pursued the license and we got the license

[35:01] and then they wanted to have games at the premiere and the premiere was like six weeks

[35:07] away.

[35:08] And Joe is usually not somebody who says no to something like that.

[35:15] So he put us all on working towards that goal which we did manage to get six games down

[35:23] to Dallas for the premiere.

[35:26] They were actually there a little bit beforehand.

[35:30] For these six games like the quote, prototypical, Tommy's that were different than the actual

[35:36] production ones.

[35:37] Yes, that's correct.

[35:39] And you know, why didn't they, I mean a lot of people, you know, rant and rave about

[35:44] the prototypical ones opposed to the production ones.

[35:47] Were they really that much different?

[35:49] They were pretty different.

[35:51] The prototype had six bumpers.

[35:57] The prototype, there's no way we could have built that game and made any money with it.

[36:01] I mean, there was just so much stuff in it.

[36:03] It was like there were six bumpers.

[36:05] There was, I think there was like a shaker motor in it.

[36:10] There was a chiming in it too.

[36:11] That was the one thing that was pretty cool about the game that, you know, I didn't like

[36:17] to see disappear but it disappeared anyway.

[36:22] The production game plays a lot better than the prototype.

[36:27] I mean, even if the prototype got out of that stage, I would still say the same thing.

[36:33] The prototype just, it's very crowded.

[36:40] It just, it didn't play all that well.

[36:43] I didn't think.

[36:44] I mean, again, even if it made it beyond that stage, I still think that what we ended up

[36:50] with, the production version was much better.

[36:53] Now so you had you done any 6809 assembly language programming prior to this experience?

[36:59] No, no, not at all.

[37:01] I actually spent a couple of weeks before moving out to Chicago just learning 6809 assembler.

[37:11] I had taken Vax 11780 assembler in college.

[37:18] I actually took a full year of it as part of, you know, again, what I thought was a great

[37:24] computer science program at Northeastern.

[37:28] I mean, we took courses like calculus and physics and assembler, computer architecture,

[37:38] a lot of stuff that I don't even know if they teach this stuff anymore.

[37:42] I mean, most guys we interview at a college, they're like, you know, they've got like

[37:46] job listed on their resumes.

[37:48] And I don't know.

[37:51] So languages are languages.

[37:55] I mean, to me, anybody with a degree in CF should be able to pick up most any language.

[38:05] I mean, languages are just the way to solve problems.

[38:09] I mean, the real asset that somebody has is their ability to solve problems.

[38:17] I mean, whether it's done in 6809 assembler or speed or the whole ball or take your pick,

[38:24] to me, it doesn't matter all that much.

[38:27] I mean, obviously, there are better fits for different types of problems that you're

[38:30] trying to solve.

[38:31] The assembly language scares a lot of people and I just don't understand why, I guess.

[38:43] It's actually a lot easier to learn than most people think as long as they have a good

[38:48] understanding of computers and how they work and architecture and so on and so forth.

[38:54] So now you've got, in the data use environment, you've got basically a system 11 board set

[38:59] that's one of the 6809.

[39:01] And then you've got another computer, another, I believe, 6809 running the 128 by 32 pixel

[39:09] display.

[39:10] And these two have to handshake or you have to make calls from the one computer on the

[39:16] main board to the dot matrix computer, which is kind of a different environment than how

[39:21] say Williams was doing it where they just had 16809.

[39:24] Was this programming in this way?

[39:28] Did this create any special challenges or anything?

[39:32] Well, first of all, given the choice, it's probably much preferable to have one CPU

[39:45] do all of the work because a lot of, assuming it can handle all of the work, a lot of what

[39:52] we do as programmers of Simba machine, it doesn't take usually much to program just the

[40:00] basic structure of a rule and so on and so forth.

[40:04] But what takes all the time is all of the choreography and all of the dot matrix work and all of the

[40:10] sound work and all of the light shows and so on and so forth.

[40:15] If everything's done on one processor, it's a lot easier to synchronize all of that and

[40:22] just make it very tight so that when you're doing a display effect on a particular frame,

[40:28] you're like, okay, there's this big explosion on this frame.

[40:31] So when you're just going to display that frame, it's like, okay, let's make the sound

[40:37] call here and maybe we'll like hit a couple of flashes or so on and so forth.

[40:43] When you're sending, you know, like, commands over to a display to tell it to the way the

[40:52] dataE system worked was you requested an effect and the effect might run for a second or

[40:58] two seconds or five seconds or longer and a lot of the thinking up didn't happen with

[41:06] that fine resolution.

[41:09] Hopefully it would be the display effect would run on one end and then the game CPU would

[41:16] try to figure out and time out like when to do the light shows and when to do the sound

[41:23] calls and so on and so forth.

[41:26] Not to mention you might have, you know, just the flaky communication channel sometimes

[41:31] so things might get like a little out of sync or whatever.

[41:35] So when you did a call, like, say that you, you know, you did a call to the dot matrix

[41:39] computer to run an animation and the animation was say it was three seconds long.

[41:45] Did the main processor wait until it received like a handshake back from the dot matrix

[41:52] to say, okay, I did the display.

[41:54] It's all done.

[41:55] Keep going or did you have to actually incorporate that timing on your end?

[42:00] Well, on my end all I really did was just program effects and so I would do say all of

[42:06] the rendering for a particular effect, you know, like raw, a score and, you know, plot

[42:13] some tax and play some animation or whatever.

[42:18] I didn't, I mean, all of what you're talking about was mostly handled by the operating

[42:27] system which at the time was, you know, had already been written and I didn't really have

[42:34] much need to go in and mess with, I guess.

[42:43] I mean, it was all sort of handled.

[42:45] For me as a programmer of effects for Tommy and other games later, it didn't really concern

[42:53] me much what the operating system was doing.

[42:56] I just sort of knew that like, okay, here's this effect and here's what it's going to do.

[43:02] You know, it's going to, you know, like a jackpot effect.

[43:06] It's going to, you know, play some bit of animation and show a score and so on and so forth.

[43:11] And so mostly it was just programming the artwork and the tax didn't really involve much

[43:18] else.

[43:19] You would get the artwork pixels from the artist and then your job was basically to actually

[43:27] sequence that and animate them.

[43:30] Sure.

[43:31] And what did you find this, I mean, was this like, okay, this is like an entry level job

[43:35] to you were at the time, was this pretty challenging?

[43:38] Well, Lonnie had developed an operating system that was for the dot matrix that was basically

[43:48] it was a scripting language and it made it very easy, I guess, for non-technical people

[43:55] to just kind of come in and pick it up and program effects.

[44:02] And for me, I probably had, you know, a little bit more experience than what your average

[44:10] person might have coming into that type of job.

[44:14] But at the same time, everybody has to start somewhere.

[44:17] I mean, in pinball, people, they get hired and I don't know.

[44:24] Everybody who hires them, they like to throw people into the fire and see what happens.

[44:29] You know, it's kind of like think or swim.

[44:32] You do the best you can.

[44:35] And after a while, I know what you're saying, after a while, it does get to be a little

[44:45] tedious because you get the artwork from the artist and after you've gone through like

[44:52] after I went through Tommy, it becomes like you get the artwork and you think about it

[45:00] in your head in a second and you already know how you're going to program the effect.

[45:09] And after that happens several times, what goes through my head is, gee, you know, I've

[45:15] done this like a hundred times.

[45:17] Can't this thing just write itself?

[45:20] Because you still have to go through the process of, you know, typing the characters

[45:24] into the computer to make the effect do what you want it to do.

[45:28] But there's nothing new or innovative or whatever about what it is you're doing.

[45:35] There's no learning process.

[45:38] At some point the learning process stops and you're just kind of like, well, okay, you

[45:44] know, I've programmed in effect, you know, and this is just like 50 others that I've

[45:50] programmed.

[45:51] So.

[45:52] All right.

[45:53] Well, back to the work with, you know, at DADES as far as the product, the Tommy products,

[46:00] what was the deal with the Macy's Parade?

[46:04] Yeah.

[46:05] We had, they had, I guess, a float in the parade and they had, they had a couple Tommy

[46:14] games in the, in the parade, which, you know, for me was exciting because, well, my family

[46:22] thought my job was, they always wondered when I was going to grow up even before I let

[46:29] get a job at Kinballin.

[46:31] They never really liked about, you know, oh, he's doing Kinball stuff and they thought

[46:37] it was childish and, you know, like, when is he going to grow up or whatever.

[46:42] And then, but, you know, it's like I can turn on the TV and point to a thing.

[46:48] It's like, hey, you know, I worked on that and then they get all excited because it's

[46:53] something that's quantifiable to them.

[46:56] You know, it's not like working at Miter and it's a black box like they don't

[47:01] know what I'm doing and they're never going to see any, any results of what I do for

[47:06] my work.

[47:07] But, you know, you look at it and you see it on TV and you're like, hey, you know, there

[47:12] it is.

[47:13] So, yeah, that was, I mean, to me, it was, it was, that was pretty exciting.

[47:17] And what was that Thanksgiving parade in New York?

[47:21] Yeah.

[47:22] Okay, now, what about, I heard that you also, through that time experience that you, you

[47:28] actually met Pete Townsend of the Who?

[47:31] Yeah, we were invited to Dallas for the premiere of the musical and Pete Townsend was there

[47:45] in the audience.

[47:46] Actually, we went out a little earlier in the day because we had all these games at these

[47:55] different locations, these six Tommy games that we put out and we had to go out and service

[48:02] them.

[48:03] It was like myself and Eric Winston who worked at the, at the, at the A to E's.

[48:10] And I'm trying to remember who else, who went out to, to help like, you know, clean up

[48:19] the games and so on and so forth.

[48:20] We had six games all throughout Dallas, you know, on, on free play, just, you know, walk

[48:25] up to the, to the games and play them.

[48:27] Anybody could, somewhere in a couple of music stores, record stores.

[48:33] One was at Hard Rock Cafe.

[48:36] I can't really remember where, where, mostly the other ones were, but we, so we went out

[48:41] a little early that day and it was interesting because we're cleaning up the games.

[48:48] We collected over a hundred dollars in quarters out of these games that were on free play.

[48:56] So I think like the natural tendency for people when they block up to a game and it's like

[49:01] they put money in at first and then they look at the start button and maybe they don't

[49:05] realize that like, oh, well, you know, the start button was already blinking on free play.

[49:10] Let's just play it for free.

[49:12] So yeah, we had all these orders that the following morning we were in the hotel.

[49:19] It was like Joe, Camelco, Neil, Lonnie, myself, a bunch of people.

[49:25] We paid for breakfast and with all the quarters we took out of the game.

[49:29] But so we saw the musical Tommy and then later there was like sort of like a cast party

[49:39] at the Hard Rock Cafe.

[49:42] We were invited to that and that's where we got to meet Pete Townsend.

[49:47] Actually he signed my instruction card for my game, which was pretty cool.

[49:53] And what's Pete like?

[49:55] Yeah, he was, you know, he was pretty cool.

[49:59] You know, lots of women around him and you know, he looked like he was having a good time.

[50:05] So he told us that he thought we did a great job with the game, which made us all feel

[50:13] pretty good about what we were doing and what we were going with it.

[50:18] That ends up being important.

[50:20] Later, I mean, this was my first experience with licensing and all that.

[50:27] And most of the games that I played were, seemed like they didn't have licenses associated

[50:35] with them.

[50:36] I mean like high speed or earth shaker.

[50:38] I mean, they were teamed games, but not like, you know, not like movie licenses or rock

[50:45] and roll licenses or anything like that.

[50:48] And this was a whole other aspect to the Timball industry that just, I guess, you know,

[50:58] for better or for worse.

[50:59] I don't want to say had to be dealt with.

[51:01] But it was something that we all had to be aware of and all had to be very careful about

[51:09] because, you know, the people who we licensed the material from, there are a lot of them

[51:15] are very protective of their material and they want to make sure that, you know, somebody

[51:21] like a data east Williams treats their license appropriately.

[51:30] So now, what was the next project you worked on after Tommy?

[51:39] After Tommy, I worked on display for WWF.

[51:44] And did you get to meet all those guys?

[51:47] No, actually, no, I don't remember.

[51:55] You know, we just, there was nothing really involved with that.

[52:01] I think it was a project that had existed for a little while around at DataEast and it

[52:09] was sort of like, more like I kind of got just, you know, sort of thrown on it than anything

[52:16] else.

[52:17] You know, it's like, okay, here's this project that's going on and, you know, lie on and just

[52:22] help out with, you know, do display and stuff on Neil Foutner, just the game programming

[52:28] on that.

[52:29] I used to be a big wrestling fan back, you know, back in the day, I guess, when I was in

[52:37] Lays High School.

[52:38] Wait, wait, wait, wait, did you think it was real or staged?

[52:42] No, you know, a little of both, I think, I mean, I think some stuff is real and I think

[52:48] some stuff is totally fake.

[52:50] Like, when they screw up and they make a mistake and somebody really gets hurt, well, that

[52:55] parts real.

[52:56] But most of the time they try to make it fake.

[52:58] So, it's entertainment.

[53:00] It's like anything else.

[53:02] It's what you get out of it.

[53:04] Right.

[53:05] Right.

[53:06] But then you did Guns and Roses, another, you know, rock and roll theme game.

[53:12] Any interesting stories with that?

[53:14] Yeah.

[53:15] That project was a lot of fun.

[53:18] Well, I mean, I love Guns and Roses.

[53:22] I mean, I like rock and roll.

[53:26] So, you know, death, lapper, Guns and Roses, Metallica, stuff like that.

[53:33] And Guns and Roses, Flash, was originally interested in having Guns and Roses game made.

[53:46] And he was friends with Marcus Schroff, who maybe still does in Los Angeles.

[53:55] That's where Flash was living at the time.

[53:58] And I guess Marcus told Flash like, hey, you know, talk to these guys, the data east,

[54:06] these are the guys who you want, you know, to do your game.

[54:09] So, we weren't looking to do Guns and Roses game.

[54:12] We were just going to like, man, what are we going to do?

[54:16] We weren't thinking about Guns and Roses.

[54:18] And so Marcus set this whole thing up and had Flash come out.

[54:25] And it was, I think it was an eye-opening experience because I remember Joe, I probably

[54:31] shouldn't say this, but I'll say it anyway.

[54:33] And then we can edit it out later if possible or if necessary.

[54:37] But I remember Joe, you know, he, he, what I heard about this.

[54:44] And I was asking about it.

[54:46] He's like, he's like, nah, we're not going to do a Guns and Roses game.

[54:50] But, you know, we'll have Flash out, we'll talk with them and see, you know, what is

[54:54] interest level is and tin ball and so on and so forth.

[54:56] And, but, you know, we're not going to do a Guns and Roses game, probably not.

[55:00] And then Flash shows up.

[55:02] And the way it was, the way the data east building was set up at 1990, Janus.

[55:10] You walked in to the building and then you actually had to walk through the factory to

[55:16] get back into engineering.

[55:19] If you enter like any normal person would enter now, most people just like, like went through

[55:24] the side door and trampled through my office to get into the building.

[55:27] But, you know, the people who just show up and don't know where they're going.

[55:31] Like, there's the main entrance and you go in the main entrance and you talk to the

[55:34] secretary and then she takes you through, you have to walk through the factory to get

[55:39] into engineering.

[55:40] So, the Flash, you know, while he was being like whatever, escorted through the factory,

[55:48] a lot of the factory people recognized who he was.

[55:52] And, you know, they're like sort of stopping what they're doing and like trying to get his

[55:57] autograph and stuff like that.

[55:59] And, I'm handed up signing a bunch of stuff, which I thought was really nice.

[56:03] But, you know, once everybody was in the factory was done for the day, they like run out and

[56:10] get their stuff from the sign.

[56:15] And then I think after talking with Flash, I mean, certainly Joe and Neil and Lonnie and

[56:24] myself and other people there spent some time with him, go out to dinner and so on and

[56:29] so forth.

[56:30] And, talk with him, his interest was pretty high.

[56:35] He had a lot of good ideas as to like what should be in a Guns and Roses game.

[56:41] And he was, he seemed extremely knowledgeable about Kimball and like what was fun and what

[56:47] wasn't.

[56:49] And, after that day, it wasn't even a full day.

[56:53] It was like maybe I think he came in around one or two in the afternoon.

[56:59] But at the end of it, I remember after he left, after Flash left, Joe said, there's no

[57:05] way we're not doing the Guns and Roses game.

[57:08] And I think most of that came from the reaction of people in the factory who saw him and recognized

[57:17] him.

[57:18] It's like, hey, you know, a lot of people know Flash, Guns and Roses and then I also think

[57:25] what sold everybody later was, you know, the interest level and the knowledge.

[57:32] Flash really did a lot of, came up with a lot of the ideas in the game.

[57:39] And I think the game is it was when it came out.

[57:43] It earned pretty good money.

[57:44] And we probably didn't make as many of them as we could.

[57:49] At the time, it was certainly during a downturn in the industry.

[57:53] But it was one of those strong games that you see, you know, a good game will come out

[58:01] and it'll do a little bit better than others.

[58:06] And it ended up being a pretty good game.

[58:09] Yeah, it's considered, you know, amongst pinball people is, you know, probably, you know,

[58:14] probably the best DT East game that was ever made, really.

[58:19] That's really encouraging because it was probably one of the most fun projects that we all

[58:25] worked on there because it was, ah, everybody, the, well, you work as hard on a project that

[58:36] sells like 15,000 as you do a project that sells, you know, by 100.

[58:45] And so what you can take from a project is, you hope to have a lot of fun along the way,

[58:53] even if the market dictates that the end result isn't going to be so great.

[58:58] Or if it dictates that it is going to be great.

[59:01] I mean, ideally, you would get out of it what you put into it, but that isn't always the

[59:09] case.

[59:10] How do Gary Stern feel about the Guns and Roses, you know, Monica for a game?

[59:17] I actually am not, I probably have no idea because Gary at the time back then, he was

[59:28] sort of like, he was sort of like a business guy like, ah, so it was Joe that was making

[59:39] all the calls is what you're saying.

[59:41] Yeah, I mean, I thought to me, I never really saw Gary all that much back when I worked

[59:47] there.

[59:48] I mean, I saw Joe every day, multiple times a day usually.

[59:52] And Gary I often never saw.

[59:55] I mean, I might see him like once a week, he worked, ah, essentially over in the, in the

[01:00:00] other building, ah, at, uh, 2020, where we are now.

[01:00:05] And, ah, so I didn't see him all that often.

[01:00:07] And Joe left the company, Gary really, really picked up a lot more response, day-to-day

[01:00:12] responsibility then.

[01:00:13] Oh, sure, sure.

[01:00:15] I mean, Joe was the driving force behind engineering.

[01:00:20] I mean, Joe was the person who just made pretty much everything happen there.

[01:00:25] And, Joe and Gary, I mean, they're business partners.

[01:00:28] There are two guys who started a business together mostly.

[01:00:33] Um, but Joe, you know, Joe was sort of in control or whatever of engineering on a day-to-day

[01:00:41] basis.

[01:00:43] So now, how was it working with Joe?

[01:00:45] I mean, was it, was it stressful because he was such a hard pusher or was it fun?

[01:00:51] Um, it was a little of both.

[01:00:53] I, I, I mean, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have any fun there because I did.

[01:01:00] So, Joe, um, was, he worked hard and he, uh, you know, you got a hand at to the guy because

[01:01:10] he did some great stuff while he was there.

[01:01:12] I mean, you look at, there have been other more qualified people in my opinion who have

[01:01:17] tried and failed at Pinball Company in general.

[01:01:21] Um, and, and Joe found, uh, you know, his, uh, he found a group of people who, uh, also

[01:01:30] worked hard for him and did some, some, some great things there.

[01:01:34] I mean, the thing I think I take away most from, from my experience at, at Data East and,

[01:01:42] and trust me, I'm very appreciative of, uh, the opportunity to have worked there.

[01:01:48] I mean, at the time, there were a lot of headaches and I felt like, uh, you know, we could have

[01:01:54] done more to improve our games and so on and so forth.

[01:01:58] But, uh, I mean, I think Joe had the right, uh, perspective on it, which was, hey, you

[01:02:06] know, we make Pinball machines.

[01:02:08] We employ a bunch of people who have fun with what they do.

[01:02:14] We make money at it.

[01:02:16] And, uh, you know, we all get to enjoy our time with our, with our friends and our family.

[01:02:22] And, uh, I mean, I think that's, that's what's important.

[01:02:25] I mean, he made a, he made a, a great product in a great time.

[01:02:30] And, uh, I mean, yeah, a lot of people would say, oh, you know, Data East and number two Pinball

[01:02:36] Company and whatever, but you look back at all the games they did and some of them are

[01:02:41] pretty good games.

[01:02:43] And, uh, I think you have to hand it to the both Joe and Gary and the fact that Gary

[01:02:50] is still running a successful business.

[01:02:52] Now, you know, I think that business is probably as only as good as the, the people who are

[01:02:59] doing the work, but, uh, you know, you definitely need people to just, like, keep a lid on, on the

[01:03:06] cost because of those designers, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll bankrupt any company as,

[01:03:11] as soon as we can because we just bought full stuff in our games.

[01:03:16] You need somebody else to, who fights, uh, the other way, you know, who's saying, hey,

[01:03:20] you know, you can't have all this stuff because if you do, then we're not going to make any

[01:03:24] money and then everybody will just have to go home.

[01:03:28] So, well, you know, some of the criticisms of Joe was that, you know, he, he'd see something

[01:03:35] on a Williams game, you know, a, a, a competitor's game, I should say.

[01:03:39] He thought that was cool and he'd come in with a, you know, a drawing on a paper napkin

[01:03:43] and say, basically, you know, I saw this feature on a Williams game, make it so in our game.

[01:03:49] I mean, was this, uh, you know, a creative handicap for you guys?

[01:03:53] Um, I wouldn't call it a handicap so much as, uh, I would say that, you know, Joe recognized

[01:04:03] the things that he felt, uh, the people liked and he wanted to incorporate those things

[01:04:14] into his games.

[01:04:16] Um, there's been, uh, I guess a number of different instances where, uh, you know, I've done

[01:04:24] the same thing.

[01:04:25] I mean, it, uh, uh, it's kind of a fine line between, I mean, Tim Ball, we always

[01:04:33] joke when we work now in Tim Ball that, that like, there's some number of, you know, things

[01:04:41] you can do with, like, say, a set of drop targets or, uh, you know, a ramp or a spinner

[01:04:47] or whatever and, and, you know, they've all mostly been done.

[01:04:52] Um, you know, there's just a bunch of rules that, that people try and you try and be new

[01:04:57] and different and innovative.

[01:04:59] Um, I guess maybe some about the frustration on my part at the time because I was young

[01:05:05] in Naive.

[01:05:06] Obviously, I, you know, come in and I want to change the world.

[01:05:10] Um, and, and really it was more of an experience of like learning how the world works.

[01:05:15] Um, and, uh, but, but, um, I think that, uh, you know, we certainly had our chance to

[01:05:24] do, uh, to come up with our own ideas and our own, uh, things, um, while we were there.

[01:05:31] I mean, I don't think there was a case where, where somebody would come up with a really

[01:05:36] good idea and then it would be, you know, shot down.

[01:05:39] Um, you know, there was always an opportunity, uh, to do, uh, you know, to do great things

[01:05:47] there.

[01:05:48] But, I mean, as far as Joe, I mean, there probably isn't anyone who would argue against, uh,

[01:05:57] just the fact that, uh, Joe recognized, uh, the value of a license and he sort of knew

[01:06:06] what people liked based on, uh, games that had been done in the past and you put those

[01:06:11] two things together.

[01:06:14] Uh, you know, you get games like lethal weapon three and you get games like, uh, Star Wars

[01:06:20] and Jurassic Park where, uh, they, they used to sold a lot of those games and, uh, looking

[01:06:26] back on them and I don't know, uh, I had fun playing those games.

[01:06:32] Now, back to the Guns and Roses thing.

[01:06:36] Um, did you like, uh, you know, have any other, uh, meetings with, with slash or any of

[01:06:41] the other, I mean, did Axel Rose put any input into this or was this all just slash?

[01:06:46] Yeah, we didn't, it was all slash.

[01:06:49] Um, uh, slash came in several times actually to Chicago.

[01:06:54] Um, the first time I was really annoyed, I mean, this is the kind of thing that, you

[01:06:58] know, just like, uh, it just made me upset at the time.

[01:07:04] I have a very, very, very short fuse and I have a bad temper at times.

[01:07:10] But, uh, the slash, uh, we're in this conference room upstairs to have our meetings up there

[01:07:18] and, uh, Flash wanted some Jack Daniels and, uh, and so Joe, you know, it's like, why

[01:07:25] am I go get some Jack Daniels?

[01:07:28] I'm like, come on, what are you talking about?

[01:07:33] You know, so like, I had to go to the liquor store and get to Jack Daniels.

[01:07:37] So, uh, I would, uh, in the morning, I would get coffee at Gota, Dunkin' Donuts and get

[01:07:45] coffee.

[01:07:46] And, uh, so I had like this, I guess the biggest cup of coffee I could get is I, I can't

[01:07:53] remember the size or whatever, but, um, and then I used to carry the coffee cup around

[01:07:59] with me for the rest of the day, the Styrofoam Dunkin' Donuts cup and, and throw it away at

[01:08:03] the end of the day.

[01:08:04] Uh, so anyway, I have to go out and I have to get Jack Daniels until I go and I buy Jack

[01:08:09] Daniels and, uh, I bring it back and, uh, I poured about half the bottle into my cup and

[01:08:16] started drinking out of the cup.

[01:08:18] This is because it's like, hey, you know, if you're gonna, if you're gonna send me out

[01:08:22] to buy Jack Daniels, I'm gonna have some of it.

[01:08:25] Um, but, uh, he, uh, we had Flash out for, he came out, I don't remember how many times

[01:08:34] but, but he came out a number of times and, uh, talked about, you know, the game, not

[01:08:41] just things on the play field, but the inside he provided, we didn't know much about the

[01:08:47] rest of the band.

[01:08:48] I mean, Flash came in and we talked to him and we learned about Flash by talking to Flash.

[01:08:53] Well, we didn't know much about the rest of the band, um, and, uh, Flash just sort of,

[01:09:00] uh, helped us out there, you know, uh, um, with some of the things that we could do in

[01:09:07] the game like, uh, you know, Gilby and, and motorcycles and things like that.

[01:09:12] Um, you know, to try and help theme like band members to features in the game and, and

[01:09:17] so on and so forth.

[01:09:19] And, uh, we, uh, I'm trying to remember, uh, we went out to, uh, uh, Orange County for

[01:09:31] the trade show, the AMOA show.

[01:09:33] They have two shows, uh, every year, uh, one used to be, uh, ACME, which is now, uh, ASI

[01:09:39] and that's in the spring and then, uh, AMOA is in the fall.

[01:09:43] Uh, the, uh, the show in 93, um, in the fall, uh, AMOA.

[01:09:51] Uh, we were in Orange County and so, uh, Flash lived out in L.A.

[01:09:57] And so he came by, uh, the booth we had, uh, uh, last action here on tells from the

[01:10:02] clip, uh, in the booth.

[01:10:05] Um, and so, uh, uh, Saturday, uh, we went, uh, we actually, uh, uh, Flash, uh, I

[01:10:14] guess you know, it was given or purchased a, tells from the clip so like, Dino, um, who

[01:10:19] lives out in that area, um, set it up in his house.

[01:10:22] So, uh, Flash, um, had us over, uh, this place he had like, uh, a bunch of pinball machines

[01:10:29] in his house.

[01:10:30] Uh, he had 18 games.

[01:10:32] Just all throughout his house and it was like, wow, this guy, you know, this guy is pretty

[01:10:36] into it.

[01:10:37] Um, and, uh, um, we, uh, he took us out to, uh, uh, he took us out to the Viparum, um,

[01:10:47] which is, um, uh, Johnny Depp's club, um, and, uh, we, uh, we got to meet, uh, we got

[01:10:54] to meet Johnny Depp.

[01:10:55] Um, I was probably the only person there who wasn't wearing black.

[01:10:59] I mean, I had like, these washed out jeans and, uh, and a white jacket and, like, felt

[01:11:05] pretty out of place.

[01:11:07] But, uh, uh, uh, Flash played there.

[01:11:09] It was pretty cool.

[01:11:10] It was really the first time I had ever seen him play live and, uh, you know, it was

[01:11:15] great.

[01:11:16] You know, what do you mean the whole band play?

[01:11:17] Or just kind of like slash and prompt to or something?

[01:11:20] Uh, uh, Flash and, uh, I'm trying to remember who else from the band was there.

[01:11:25] Uh, there were a couple other guys, uh, from the band who played too, but just, yeah, it's,

[01:11:32] uh, I mean, I didn't even realize that, that, that kind of thing happened.

[01:11:36] You know, it's like, oh, you want to see Guns and Roses, you go to a show, you know, they

[01:11:41] like go on tour and whatever.

[01:11:43] And then, you know, here's Flash, he goes to the Viparum and plays, you know, just, yeah,

[01:11:48] I mean, if you want to say in prompt, you know, I guess, but, uh, yeah.

[01:11:52] So that was, uh, you know, that was pretty cool.

[01:11:56] So actually, uh, I guess it was like the following week, week, uh, Riverfield was when River

[01:12:02] Phoenix died there.

[01:12:04] Right.

[01:12:05] Right.

[01:12:06] Right.

[01:12:07] So then after Guns and Roses, that basically doubled the size of the dot matrix and you had

[01:12:11] some involvement in that?

[01:12:13] Yeah, the, um, uh, the thought process behind it and, uh, I didn't buy into it all that

[01:12:22] much because, I don't know, I think if you're going to make, uh, technological advancements,

[01:12:30] they need to be, uh, I don't know, I guess a little bit more significant than going from,

[01:12:37] uh, you know, one twenty eight by thirty two to this one was one ninety two by sixty four.

[01:12:42] Right.

[01:12:43] I'm sorry, you're right.

[01:12:44] Yeah, the display on, uh, on Maverick and, uh, Frankenstein, um, I guess it was on four

[01:12:52] games.

[01:12:53] Is that right?

[01:12:54] I had an idea.

[01:12:55] Yeah, let's see.

[01:12:56] Baywatch, Frankenstein, Maverick and we were one other one.

[01:13:01] Yeah, there was, there was Maverick, uh, Frankenstein, uh, Batman Forever.

[01:13:07] Right.

[01:13:08] In Baywatch.

[01:13:09] And Baywatch, right.

[01:13:10] I'm not sure.

[01:13:13] So yeah, um, I, I was sort of tasked to do the operating system for that, uh, display,

[01:13:23] um, it's, uh, let me think, like three times as much data.

[01:13:28] I guess so, um, realistically, you need three times, uh, throughput, uh, uh, whatever you

[01:13:35] want to say, um, uh, to be able to do, uh, you know, be apples for apples as far as, uh,

[01:13:43] frame rate and so on.

[01:13:45] Um, and, uh, Bob Kuala's yet to yes, who did, uh, uh, pretty much all of the hardware for

[01:13:53] data east up to that point.

[01:13:54] He designed the controller board for it.

[01:13:57] It was basically the same, uh, sort of interface type, uh, uh, with the ribbon cable to the

[01:14:03] CPU communication, um, and, uh, but it was, uh, 68,000 processor, uh, which, uh, you

[01:14:13] know, the, oh, nine was like a two megahertz, oh, nine.

[01:14:17] I can't remember what the, what the, what the clock was on the 68,000, but, um, it's

[01:14:24] a lot nicer instruction set, um, certainly.

[01:14:29] And, uh, uh, that project, um, I want to say I had maybe like three months to do the

[01:14:38] whole thing.

[01:14:39] I mean, it just all happened so fast.

[01:14:40] I mean, after Guns and Roses, I didn't really do a lot of display programming on Guns

[01:14:45] and Roses.

[01:14:46] I did a handful of effects and, and programmed the, uh, the, the Guild B roll video mode.

[01:14:52] Um, and then after that, I was, uh, um, put on Maverick, uh, the work with, uh, Lawnie

[01:15:00] on that to do display.

[01:15:02] And then the display was supposed to be this, you know, big display.

[01:15:05] I mean, to me, it was a nice experiment.

[01:15:08] We talked about it later as like the, you know, the million dollar experiment, because

[01:15:12] that's about like how much it costs and how much extra the display costs and how much

[01:15:17] money was just like basically, you know, burned through to see this thing, you know, try

[01:15:22] and fail.

[01:15:24] Um, so, uh, it, uh, well, I mean, I, I, I wrote the operating system for it.

[01:15:34] It was, uh, similar to the operating system that was written, uh, the, the scripting language

[01:15:40] that, uh, that, that, that, that Monty did for the, uh, the old display.

[01:15:45] I mean, it was pretty much as far as scripting goes, identical.

[01:15:50] And, uh, um, I don't know, it looked pretty cool.

[01:15:54] It was a nice big display.

[01:15:57] Um, it was, uh, nice to have, uh, diagnostics.

[01:16:01] Uh, you do like some neat things with diagnostics, you know, like draw circuits and stuff like

[01:16:07] that and, and, and, uh, but, uh, ultimately, uh, it just ended up costing too much and,

[01:16:14] when the industry is, is in sort of a downtrend and, uh, you're looking to save costs, I mean,

[01:16:21] putting extra money into a, into a big dot matrix display probably isn't the way to go.

[01:16:26] I mean, we always say at work, I mean, most people just don't even really look at it all

[01:16:31] that much.

[01:16:32] They look up everyone from a while and, and, and, and, right.

[01:16:35] Most of the people, uh, are just watching their, their eyes on the ball, their eyes and

[01:16:40] on the display.

[01:16:41] And the display is mostly for people who, uh, you know, who are, are standing around watching,

[01:16:48] but, um, you know, our audits say that, that 80% of all games that are played are single

[01:16:53] player games.

[01:16:54] So, I mean, how many people are really watching?

[01:16:57] So, but, uh, but, uh, it was, it was an interesting project.

[01:17:02] I mean, I certainly was grateful for the experience because, uh, I mean, being able to, like, go

[01:17:08] from, to, to come in to just be, uh, um, you know, a display program, or to actually,

[01:17:14] like, be trusted to, to write an operating system was, um, was, uh, yeah, pretty, pretty

[01:17:23] good.

[01:17:24] Well, now, on the, um, on the 130, or on the 128 by 32 display, there was only like three

[01:17:31] different levels of intensity.

[01:17:32] On the 192 by 64 display, did you get a lot more levels of dot intensities with that,

[01:17:38] too?

[01:17:39] No, there were still just three levels.

[01:17:42] There were, there were just three times as many pixels.

[01:17:45] Now, what said was the number of levels dictated by the display itself or just by, you know,

[01:17:51] your programming?

[01:17:52] Um, actually, in that case, because, um, the way the hardware was set up, I didn't really

[01:17:59] have control over, uh, like, uh, clocking out the, the pixel data.

[01:18:06] All I did was, uh, write to some buffers and there were, there were two buffers, basically,

[01:18:11] it was, uh, and they were, they were implemented as, uh, as bid planes.

[01:18:15] So basically, there are two planes for four colors.

[01:18:19] You want to count black.

[01:18:20] I count black as the colors some people don't.

[01:18:22] Um, so basically, um, you know, you have, you have four colors, um, and it was all controlled

[01:18:28] by the, uh, by the hardware.

[01:18:30] So when, like on the newer, stern display now, where they have more, uh, where they have

[01:18:35] more colors as, or intensity levels, you mean the hardware, actually, it was a programming

[01:18:41] change.

[01:18:42] It was a hardware and a programming change.

[01:18:43] Well, originally, um, for the stern system, uh, we had talked about, again, Bob Kwaski

[01:18:55] S, who designed the hardware.

[01:18:57] Um, we had talked about that, that I would actually do, like clock all of the pixel data.

[01:19:03] Did you have involvement with, uh, with the Richie Rich project?

[01:19:07] Actually, no.

[01:19:09] I'm not really sure why people associate me with that project.

[01:19:13] Um, my only guess is that, um, because I think Richie Rich, um, Brian Rudolph did, uh,

[01:19:19] did the code for Richie Rich.

[01:19:21] Um, and I don't think I did anything.

[01:19:23] I mean, I might have done a couple of display things, um, with Richie Rich.

[01:19:29] Um, the one I was more associated with, I suppose, was Kabuki, which was, uh, kind

[01:19:35] of a custom game that, uh, Joe, uh, was, uh, putting together, uh, I can't even remember

[01:19:44] who, uh, who it was for.

[01:19:46] It was, uh, for some Japanese gentlemen.

[01:19:49] Um, and, uh, but no, I'm not sure why, uh, my name comes up with, uh, Richie Rich.

[01:19:56] I mean, that game was mostly just, uh, a movie prop, um, and it didn't really have to

[01:20:01] do anything.

[01:20:02] Uh, it just sort of sat there and, you know, it's like, oh, okay, here's Richie Rich.

[01:20:07] He's so rich he has his own pinball machine.

[01:20:09] Um, that's also Richie Rich.

[01:20:11] So, uh, it, I don't think, uh, I mean, I never saw that movie.

[01:20:17] I don't know what, uh, I don't, I don't know what the game does in the movie or whatever,

[01:20:24] but, uh, I, I didn't have really anything to do with that.

[01:20:27] Except maybe I, I studged in a couple of, this play effects or whatever.

[01:20:32] Okay, so now at this period, you left Atees and went to Williams.

[01:20:37] What was the reasoning for that and, uh, you know, the, the cultural transition between

[01:20:43] the, the, the two, the two companies?

[01:20:45] Sure.

[01:20:46] Um, well, how is the data east and, and we'll touch that a little bit before.

[01:20:52] I really wanted to do game programming.

[01:20:55] I wanted to move beyond doing that matrix display, drifting, which, um, I mean, this

[01:21:05] work, I'll have to get done.

[01:21:06] So, you know, if there's work to be done, the people there will do it.

[01:21:10] Uh, so me, in terms of being challenged, I, I wanted to move beyond that.

[01:21:17] I felt it was like, okay, you know, this was a, it could, uh, thank you to do, uh, get

[01:21:22] familiar with the dot matrix system, uh, do a few games, uh, using it, write, uh, a new

[01:21:30] system, uh, for a large display.

[01:21:33] And, uh, I wanted to do game programming, but there really wasn't a, a position for a game

[01:21:39] program.

[01:21:40] I guess, um, uh, Lonnie and, uh, Neil were the game programmers that spurn and, uh, uh,

[01:21:48] Kevin Martin, who was hired, uh, I think Kevin was mostly hired to do game programming,

[01:21:56] uh, uh, pinball game programming, um, and eventually was put onto a video project, um, tattoo

[01:22:04] and, uh, when I talked to Joe about doing game programming or whatever, it just, uh, it

[01:22:11] just never really came up.

[01:22:13] I mean, it just seemed like I was going to be doing display programming.

[01:22:16] Well, I was young, but, you know, I thought forever.

[01:22:21] So, uh, I talked, uh, uh, I was, I called Ted at, at Williams and, uh, uh, he interviewed

[01:22:32] me, um, for the second time, and, uh, offered me a job.

[01:22:41] Um, I think, uh, part of that was, um, the fact that I had, you know, worked for a pinball

[01:22:50] company for a year, and, uh, I think everybody in the industry knows, uh, kind of, you know,

[01:22:57] who does what and, and, what people are involved in certain projects and so on and so forth.

[01:23:02] Um, I, I suppose, you know, people there were a little bit more comfortable about, uh,

[01:23:10] you know, hiring me just based on the fact that I had, you know, picked up and, and, and

[01:23:16] moved out to Chicago and I had worked on a lot of things and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

[01:23:22] you know, basically sort of proven to everybody that, that I could, I could do the work.

[01:23:30] But right now is like a kind of, you know, we're talking what this is 1994, 1995.

[01:23:36] The industry is kind of in, uh, kind of in a slight downturn.

[01:23:41] Did that make the transition easier or harder or more difficult or anything like that?

[01:23:46] It was kind of hard because, well, at the same time I was, you know, also pursuing job,

[01:23:52] back in, in Virginia, and had, uh, received an offer, uh, from MITRE, talking with Ted and,

[01:24:00] and, and he offered, uh, he offered me a job at Williams and I was sort of at a crossroads.

[01:24:06] I, I, there was, there was one way for my life to go, which was go back to Virginia and work for

[01:24:13] MITRE again and get married and have, you know, whatever, like a knife.

[01:24:19] I want to say boring life, but, uh, you know, just sort of be back into, uh, what I consider

[01:24:27] place and see to some extent or, uh, go to work for Williams and give pinball one more chance because,

[01:24:35] uh, it really was something that I enjoyed a lot and I felt like, okay, uh, people always say that,

[01:24:43] the grass isn't always greener but, um, you know, experiencing things in life is, is, is a great thing and,

[01:24:53] uh, I decided that, uh, I wanted to give it one more chance but at that time, uh, I, uh,

[01:25:00] I couldn't accept Ted's offer because I was, it was probably a little bit earlier than, than,

[01:25:07] I wanted to, to talk to him but I needed to get a feel for whether that was going to be an option

[01:25:15] because, um, if it wasn't then, I sort of wanted to, uh, make my decision about going back to, uh,

[01:25:23] the MITRE, um, because they had, I had already talked to, uh, them and they were sort of waiting for

[01:25:31] an answer for me. Um, but when, uh, Ted, uh, said that, you know, when Ted, uh, gave me an offer, um,

[01:25:40] and I turned him down, I think he was a little upset because it's like, well, you know, why do you

[01:25:46] ask me, you know, to, to, to talk to me about a job and then you say, no, but he didn't understand all,

[01:25:54] all of, all of what was going on, uh, with me. So, maybe if he listens to this, he will now, but, uh,

[01:26:01] so I, I stuck around, uh, data east for a little while longer just because I had, you know, put a lot of

[01:26:10] time and effort into, uh, into some projects and I wanted to, you know, uh, uh, realize, uh, you know, some,

[01:26:19] um, you know, some more time at the company and, uh, I think it was, uh, right around, it was

[01:26:30] shortly before Christmas. Uh, I know there was a big, uh, there was a big meeting in engineering and,

[01:26:38] and things were kind of ugly at data east at the time. I mean, I think people were getting

[01:26:43] frustrated from, you know, just a year earlier selling, uh, a large number of games, you know, like,

[01:26:51] over 9,000 Jurassic parks on to them being faced with only being able to sell like 3,000 of a model,

[01:26:58] I mean, I know we went from, from, I think it was like 9,000 eighth of Jurassic Park to

[01:27:06] 5,500 of last action hero to, uh, 4,500 of rip and I mean, you kind of get the, the, the trend here, so

[01:27:21] yeah, and, and data east had kind of a interesting compensation policy too. I mean, like, everybody got

[01:27:27] a piece of the pie. I mean, everybody from like, you know, the secretary to the guy turned

[01:27:31] its screws on the line or something like that? Sure. Uh, I think pretty much all of the,

[01:27:39] you know, the, the, the staff, yes, he considered staff, um, would, uh, yeah, there'd be, you know,

[01:27:46] one big pie and then it would get divided up as, as, you know, whomever felt, uh, it should be

[01:27:54] so divided up on. It was often very discretionary. And I don't want to get into too much

[01:28:00] detail here, but, um, you know, there were some things where, again, like I said earlier, this,

[01:28:07] this rings true with, with this also is that you always hope that, that the effort that, that goes

[01:28:13] into something, you know, is, is rewarded appropriately and, and in a lot of cases, that just

[01:28:20] doesn't work in Timball. I mean, you know, there have been times when I've made very little

[01:28:25] effort on something and have been, uh, you know, rewarded, uh, in ways that I, I never thought

[01:28:31] would happen. And there have been other times when I've put a lot of time and a lot of effort into

[01:28:36] something and then just, you know, there's like not much to come of it and, and, and, uh, so I, I mean,

[01:28:46] at, at, at the time, you go through a, uh, whatever, a downtrend or transitional period or whatever

[01:28:54] you want to call it, um, you know, people were getting grumpy because, you know, they're, they're

[01:29:00] used to like, hey, you know, uh, my bonus was this or my royalty was that or whatever and they all

[01:29:06] start, you know, to complain a little bit or, or, or whatever and it's just a function of, uh,

[01:29:13] how the market is. I mean, we don't have any control over it. I mean, I personally feel that,

[01:29:18] that, I mean, at least with guns and roses and some other games that, that, you know, we were doing

[01:29:23] games that were, you know, some of the, the best games that have been done as a company and, you

[01:29:29] know, to see themselves, uh, the way they did is certainly depressing, uh, say the least, but, uh,

[01:29:38] but yeah, I remember, uh, there was a meeting and engineering.

[01:29:45] Uh, I don't know pretty much after the meeting, I felt like, well, okay, you know, um,

[01:29:50] here's how things are and I'm not going to be able to do a game programming and, you know, uh,

[01:29:57] uh, that's going to be that. So I called, uh, Alcad, uh, went out to launch and I called Ted and I asked

[01:30:04] him if the offer was still on the table and he said, yes. And so I accepted and, and I gave my notice and,

[01:30:13] uh, you know, I never want to, uh, uh, you know, I guess, uh, screw anybody over, uh, uh,

[01:30:22] at all, ever, um, especially it, it's, uh, uh, you know, at, at a company I worked for and,

[01:30:30] and some people, you know, who I enjoyed working with, and certainly, uh, as I said, um, and very

[01:30:38] thankful, you know, for that opportunity and, you know, I, I had some great times at D.E.

[01:30:43] that was, it was a lot of fun. I mean, when, when you're, when you're caught in the heat of battle and

[01:30:47] you're trying to, you know, get a game done, it's, it's often very easy to let your emotions, um,

[01:30:55] uh, take over and, uh, and, and the least little thing or annoyance or whatever becomes this,

[01:31:03] this, this, this monstrous problem, uh, but, uh, after a number of years that go by,

[01:31:12] begin to put it into perspective and, well, we all had a lot of fun. All right, we're going to

[01:31:17] take a little break from our interview with Lyman Sheetson. We'll be right back after these messages.

[01:31:22] Deep in the forest of Eastern Canada, you will find something, well, ground breaking and something

[01:31:30] that's very, very pinball, but something that's really, really small,

[01:31:37] presenting classic play field reproductions. Two guys in their basement.

[01:31:43] We've got the passion, we've got the gear, and we've got the quality. Doing our very best to

[01:31:48] remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts. Classic play field reproductions.

[01:31:57] Play fields, back glasses, plastic sets.

[01:32:20] Okay, we're back with Lyman Sheets of Dade East and Williams, uh, telling us some more about his

[01:32:24] pinball stories. When you went over to Williams and started working with Ted Estes,

[01:32:28] what was your first experience there? Yeah, Williams, uh, it was a little scared about going to

[01:32:35] Williams, actually, because I felt like, um, I mean, these were people who designed games and,

[01:32:44] I had played through, uh, I had played, uh, while I was in college and I felt like,

[01:32:52] you know, that maybe I was going to be a small fish and a big pond.

[01:32:58] But I was excited too, because, um, I felt like, hey, you know, this is my opportunity.

[01:33:06] This is my last chance to really, you know, do what I came here to do, which was program games.

[01:33:13] And, uh, I remember, uh, when I, uh, when I got to Williams, um, well, first of all, like, I,

[01:33:24] I went totally the wrong way to get there. So like, from based on where I lived, I should have

[01:33:29] taken I-90 and gotten off at Addison, like I'm going to a Cubs game or whatever. But instead,

[01:33:35] I went for whatever reason. I went interstate 2-90 and like got off in California and then

[01:33:41] hit a dead end at some rock quarry or something, because like I was just, I don't know, way out of

[01:33:48] the way of where I should have been. But, uh, I-I-I didn't manage to get there and, uh, I remember

[01:33:55] that-that's one of the first people I ran into there was Steve Richie and I mean, I figured I

[01:34:01] just sort of show up and I-I, you know, like, uh, talk with, uh, you know, uh, Larry and other

[01:34:11] programmers. I didn't really know too many people there. I mean, I knew, uh, sort of Pat and Larry

[01:34:16] and Steve and of course Ted from shows and stuff like that. But, uh, Steve was one of the guys who,

[01:34:22] I mean, he just sort of came out and he's like, he's like, you're really here. And, uh, it seemed

[01:34:28] weird to me because, you know, whatever. I mean, Steve's just kind of an open, one person and,

[01:34:34] you know, he's like calling me as spies. Like, you're here to spy, aren't you? You know, and, um,

[01:34:40] he-he just made me feel kind of comfortable there. Um, and, uh, for the first couple weeks, uh,

[01:34:47] I, um, I shared an office with Larry. So, uh, it, uh, uh, he had, uh, Jack Bot in his-in his office. Um,

[01:34:58] he was, uh, working on that project with, uh, Lewis Cozyars, uh, who had started just a couple of weeks

[01:35:04] where I did. And, uh, so, you know, it's a little nerve-wracking to, you know, like start and,

[01:35:11] I don't know, I just like was sort of playing around with Jack Bot and getting to do different

[01:35:16] things. And Larry was kind of showing me, you know, like, oh, here's this and here's that and so on

[01:35:22] and so forth. And I was very excited to be able to, um, you know, look at some of the, the,

[01:35:29] the codes for the games that, you know, I played over the years because it's always like, wow, you know,

[01:35:34] uh, you know, how did they do this or how did they do that or so on and so forth because all I

[01:35:39] had ever really done was display programming. So, it was kind of a, uh, not a big learning curve,

[01:35:45] but, yeah, it's a lot to go through. Um, I mean, it's not like any of, of the, it's not like any

[01:35:52] of the stuff is all that difficult. It's just, uh, there's just a lot of it. There's, there's a lot of it.

[01:36:03] So now, what, tell me about the, uh, the Demo Man, uh, Demo Man project.

[01:36:08] Uh, yeah, sure. Um, when I started, again, I was like, I, I, they had no

[01:36:14] space for me. Uh, within Larry's office for about two weeks and then I, uh, I, I managed to get a,

[01:36:22] a cubicle, um, uh, and, uh, Ted, uh, had finished with, uh, actually, I guess he had mostly finished

[01:36:33] with Roadshow. The Demo Man was, uh, a little bit before that, but, uh, Lewis had this Demolition Man.

[01:36:40] Lewis was supposed to do this work, I guess originally, uh, he had a Demolition Man at his

[01:36:45] cubicle and then the Jackpot project started up pretty quickly and Lewis got tossed on that and so,

[01:36:52] um, uh, there, there was a whole bunch of, uh, custom speech, uh, for Demolition Man that, that

[01:37:01] Ted wanted, uh, into the game and some of it was, um, stuff for like, uh, investors to loan

[01:37:09] and, uh, Sandra Bullock and Wesley Snipe. Um, you mean these people were getting custom games or

[01:37:15] something? Uh, as far as I know, yeah. Um, and then, um, there was some other stuff for, um, uh,

[01:37:24] you know, specific for a dentist and Ted and so on and so forth. Um, so anyway, uh, Ted,

[01:37:30] you know, one of the things that you want to bring somebody up to speed on, on, on, you know,

[01:37:36] writing, uh, uh, code for Kimball Machines, uh, one of the nice things to do or easy things to do

[01:37:43] or whatever is like, okay, here's this game that already does stuff, you know, make it do something

[01:37:48] a little bit different. So, um, when, when, uh, he, he, uh, moved the Demolition Man into, into my cubicle

[01:37:57] and, you know, I went to go and, and put all these, uh, these sound calls in. Uh, so, I, uh, actually,

[01:38:04] Chris, I like, I don't know, I guess, uh, I get it starting fires at Williams because the Demolition

[01:38:11] Man came in and of course I got it from Lewis and then, uh, it had the old, uh, the old, uh, E-Proms in

[01:38:17] it and so I needed to, uh, put the new E-Proms in it with all of them. Uh, the, uh, the speech, the

[01:38:24] custom speech and so on and so forth. So I take the old ones out and I put the new ones in and of

[01:38:28] course I didn't think to look, oh, I can always look at the board and see which way they're not just

[01:38:32] pointing on the board. Uh, but the, uh, the original rounds were plugged in backwards. So when I plugged

[01:38:37] in the new rounds, like, you know, I didn't think I'm like, oh, nobody would plug in a round backwards.

[01:38:41] And so like, all of these sound rounds were in backwards and like, you know, like, like go to,

[01:38:47] you know, uh, load up the code and do whatever and it just sort of sits there and, uh, like,

[01:38:53] at a loss to know what was going on. So I like, look at the debugger and, and try and

[01:38:58] bring things up in the debugger and the next thing I knew I blew a, a cap off the, off the board.

[01:39:04] The shot is, uh, it just shot the little, little plastic cover right across my cubicle and

[01:39:11] did out this nasty gray smoke and made a big stink. It wouldn't have been so bad if I,

[01:39:17] if I had an office, but I was in a cubicle and it like, just got the whole floor. Yeah, everybody smelled it.

[01:39:24] Yeah, I've just about, yeah, people would walk by and they sort of stop by my cub and they'd like,

[01:39:31] you know, rubber neck over the top of my cube and knit a little bit and ask me if I blew a cap and

[01:39:36] be like, yes, sorry. But, uh, yeah, so demolition man was, uh, was sort of my first introduction to, uh,

[01:39:47] Larry's, uh, the Larry system and, uh, uh, I had fun working on it. I mean, it's, it's kind of

[01:39:55] weird like, you'd never see this in corporate America either where, you know, I'm like typing

[01:40:00] little commands through the debugger and it's making sound calls and, you know, they're all like,

[01:40:05] like cursing and swearing and stuff like that. So, so these custom, you were basically, you did

[01:40:11] the swear roms then for demo man is what you're eluding to. Right, sure. And, and this was well

[01:40:19] after demo man was already released and sold, right? Oh, yeah. Uh, I mean, uh, right, when I got there,

[01:40:30] right, I had to just finished, uh, with roadshow, I did display, uh, programming on roadshow. So,

[01:40:40] so the whole purpose of this, like, demo man was spring of 94. So the whole purpose of this

[01:40:47] exercise was aid to break you in and be to get, uh, some custom roms out to the celebrities that

[01:40:55] were involved in the demo man project. Sure. And did you ever hear back from the people that you

[01:41:01] did the, you know, did the roms for? No. No, I mean, um, actually, this is, I suppose, where, um,

[01:41:11] things were a little bit different about Williams and Data East. Data East, we got to meet a lot

[01:41:18] of the people involved with the, with the, with the licensing, you know, we get to meet,

[01:41:24] um, you know, all kinds of people, uh, you know, who were involved with the, with the projects

[01:41:31] that, that we worked on and Williams, it was like all sort of handled, like, I think Roger Sharp

[01:41:36] handled most of that, um, up in the front office. So we never even really saw, you know, uh, people,

[01:41:42] or, or at least I didn't, um, you know, people who, who, uh, you know, were involved with the,

[01:41:49] with the projects that, that we licensed. Yeah. So Roger did all the work and basically

[01:41:54] insulated you guys. Yeah. Which I think is, is a good thing. I mean, to me, it's like, hey, you

[01:42:01] know, if you want to get the most out of somebody and, and, and their work, it's like, give them, uh,

[01:42:06] a comfortable work environment and, you know, insulate them from, from distractions and, and, and,

[01:42:12] and day to day B.F. and let them, you know, do their work and concentrate and have fun. That's how

[01:42:18] you're going to get, uh, good people to do great work. All right. Now, what was the deal with the

[01:42:25] fire in Steve's hallway? Yeah. I set, uh, I set fire to, uh, the Steve Richie's hallway because, um,

[01:42:34] I used to smoke, so when I worked at Williams when I started, I, I smoked and, and I used to,

[01:42:41] you know, I didn't like to smoke in the, in the, in the cubicle because there were people around

[01:42:47] me. So I'd like, you smoke too, so I go down to his office and, and I, but I didn't like to go into

[01:42:52] his office and smoke because then like, you couldn't breathe in there. You get way too people smoking

[01:42:56] in one office and, uh, so you used to go to the hall and it'll, it'll asshrain all and, uh,

[01:43:03] so I like to smoke and I put the cigarette out and, um, it's, uh, oh, like, I guess I didn't put

[01:43:09] it out all the way. And so it, it's just sort of caught fire to all everything else that was in the

[01:43:15] ass tray and then smoked all, and then like another hallway too. So, um, yeah, I mean, within a period of,

[01:43:23] like, a week or two, I just, like, uh, smoked up the engineering department. Why?

[01:43:31] So it didn't seem like it was a very good start at Williams.

[01:43:38] All right, now how did you get involved? What was the deal with Congo and, uh, and teaming up with

[01:43:43] Brian Eddie for Attack from Mars? Yeah, originally, uh, after I finished up with, uh, Demolition Man,

[01:43:54] where, um, I guess that's what everybody calls them. Um, I, uh, I did like a test fixture for

[01:44:03] theater of magic. A lot of what people, I don't know if this has been discussed before, but

[01:44:08] a lot of what we do, both, you know, now at Stern and back at Williams, uh, is, uh, the mechanical

[01:44:16] engineers design these mechanical gadgets and whatever and oftentimes we like to know, you know,

[01:44:23] how they're going to hold up over time. It's like anybody else who tests mechanical things.

[01:44:28] Um, you want to make sure they hold up in the field. So, um, I ended up writing code for, uh,

[01:44:33] theater of magic, uh, the, uh, the trunk, um, basically it was, uh, a little self-contained fixture

[01:44:40] that would fire a ball at the trunk and come back and then the trunk would spin and turn and

[01:44:46] fire it at another side of the trunk and then, you know, pick up the ball with the magnet and turn

[01:44:51] and drop it into the, you know, the little lock up underneath the play field and kick it out and

[01:44:55] so on and so forth. So, um, after I did that, I mean, I got there and I'm like, hey, you know,

[01:45:01] I want to work on a project, you know, get me on a project and so, um, I was put on, uh,

[01:45:07] Congo, uh, with, uh, Bill Grubb. Uh, I, I enjoyed working with Bill Grubb a lot. He was a good guy.

[01:45:15] I was, uh, you know, kind of, I guess projects back then were done by new people for the most part.

[01:45:23] There was like sort of, uh, you know, I'm not going to say like, uh, you know, like a D to E,

[01:45:29] there was a game programmer, a display programmer because in that case, like the game programmer did

[01:45:34] all the game code and all the game roads and the display programmer just programmed the facts,

[01:45:39] you know, it didn't have anything to do with like what the game actually did. It was just all

[01:45:43] of what you saw in the display or at Williams, it was more like there was, uh, you know, a lead

[01:45:48] programmer and a support programmer. Um, the lead programmer was sort of responsible for like the

[01:45:55] overall structure of the code and, uh, you know, just the, uh, you know, I guess, uh, dealing with the,

[01:46:05] most of the technical aspects of the, of the game and, you know, for the most part, uh,

[01:46:13] programmers, two programmers who'd work on a project that, you know, like collaborate on rules

[01:46:17] and stuff like that. But, uh, the lead programmer was more responsible for like the technical aspects

[01:46:24] of the, of the, the project, how the code was structured, uh, writing, uh, device drivers for

[01:46:31] different mechanical things, so on and so forth. After that, I mean, I suppose, um, the,

[01:46:36] the work was sort of shared as far as, uh, both programmers would write display facts and land

[01:46:42] effects and do rules and so on and so forth. Um, so I was, uh, I was basically, um, support, uh,

[01:46:51] programmer for, um, for Bill on, uh, on Congo, um, up into the point where, uh, the original,

[01:46:59] I had, I don't know if people know this, uh, Congo used to be a, a two level game. Uh, it was a

[01:47:05] four flipper game, uh, and, uh, it had an upper play field with two flippers. Um, it was actually a

[01:47:13] very interesting play field. Um, it didn't play, uh, and I guess that's why it sort of got redesigned.

[01:47:21] Um, it didn't play, the, the upper play field didn't play very well and it was sort of decided

[01:47:27] that, that, you know, Congo, like, in, in its current form back then, as a two level game, it was

[01:47:33] also expensive, um, at a time when, you know, we're looking to reduce costs, um, you know,

[01:47:39] it was decided that Congo should be, um, redesigned. So basically, yeah, you go back to the

[01:47:45] drawing board on the play field, well, you've got a couple of programmers sitting around because,

[01:47:50] uh, most of what happened at Williams was that, uh, you know, you didn't really do a whole heck

[01:47:57] of a lot until you've got a play field and then you start working on the, on the code. Um, so Bill and

[01:48:03] I were just sort of sitting around, uh, after that and, uh, so, you know, Ted has a problem now.

[01:48:10] It's like, okay, what am I going to do with these guys? And Bill was sort of, you know, left on

[01:48:15] Congo and, and, and they want to leave two people on it, you know, sitting around, not going to say

[01:48:21] doing nothing because there was no such thing as, as, as doing nothing at, at, at any symbol company,

[01:48:28] that I worked for. But, uh, I was taking off and, and I'm pretty sure it was Larry who,

[01:48:35] you know, was like, hey, you know, said to Ted, put him on a game. Um, and, uh, so, uh, I got put on,

[01:48:42] uh, attack from Mars with, uh, with Brian. And, you know, they kind of asked me first, which I thought

[01:48:47] was funny. I'm like, what do you need to ask me for? Just, you know, put me on it. It sounds fun. And,

[01:48:53] uh, the, the, the attack from Mars, um, the play field had already been designed. Uh, and, uh, Brian

[01:49:02] actually had like the whitewood up and flipping. Um, uh, and so, um, you know, I didn't know much

[01:49:09] about Brian. I mean, I knew, I knew Shadow, um, which, which I have been alike a lot. I mean,

[01:49:14] I, I like Shadow a lot of us playing it. Um, but to me, it's like, you know, it, it's a, it's a good

[01:49:20] example of every new designers. Um, I, I, I really don't like to use the word mistake, but,

[01:49:27] I mean, everybody who I've ever seen like design a game for the first time, they just seem to want

[01:49:32] it to be like the kitchen sink. They want to like, they, you know, they, they've, they've wanted to

[01:49:37] design a game for so long, and they have all these ideas. And they're like, oh, you know, I want to

[01:49:41] do this. I want to do that. I want to do this. And they put them all into one game. Like, okay,

[01:49:46] you know, just put a couple of good ideas into the game and then save a couple more for the next game.

[01:49:52] But, uh, I saw Shadow and, and I liked the game. I saw a tack from Mars and I thought, you know,

[01:49:58] wow, you know, this, this looks pretty cool. I mean, it's a theme appeal to me and a lot of what

[01:50:03] Brian, you know, wanted to do with the whole, you know, the whole, uh, uh, you know, uh, can't be, uh,

[01:50:11] science fiction stuff, uh, really appeal to me. And so, um, the, the one thing I was concerned about

[01:50:17] with that project was though that, um, you know, Brian was a, was a programmer and, uh, he, uh, when I

[01:50:24] talked with him, he said that, you know, he did, uh, um, he did the majority of the code on, on Shadow,

[01:50:32] and I talked to Mike doing a little bit too because Mike would work on Shadow. And, uh, you know,

[01:50:37] I just asked him like, hey, how's it, how's it to work with Brian and so on and so forth? So, um,

[01:50:42] uh, you know, there wasn't really a problem, but, um, I sort of wanted control of the, uh,

[01:50:48] of the software. I mean, it's like, hey, Brian, you're a designer. You have your hands full. I don't

[01:50:52] want you doing 70% of the code on the scan. You know, you have to trust me that, that, you know,

[01:50:57] I'm your programmer and, and I can do this job and I'll get it done and you'll be happy with it.

[01:51:03] Um, and, you know, if it were me in that position, I'd be like, uh, I don't know if I can do that.

[01:51:11] So, I, I just, uh, what did they, they ultimately, they made that decision of that and let you,

[01:51:17] you know, have your way with it, right? Yeah, I talked with Larry a little bit about it.

[01:51:21] I still look Larry. This is what I like to do and, you know, I want to make sure that, you know,

[01:51:26] we have the best chance at doing, you know, a good job on this game and, and, you know,

[01:51:32] for that to happen, I, I really believe that like, you know, Brian, you're the game designer.

[01:51:37] If you want to be a game designer, get your damn hands out of the code.

[01:51:42] It's like you can't do it all as, as I've learned very recently. It's, it's, it's very hard, um,

[01:51:52] to do all the work. Like I said, it's not, it's not all that complicated. It's just,

[01:51:58] there's just no end to it. There's no end. So, I mean, I'm an attack from Mars. How did you feel

[01:52:04] that came out? Um, I think pretty, pretty good. Uh, I mean, as far as like what I consider to be

[01:52:12] really my first game, um, yeah, that's what I was going to say. It was really the first game that you

[01:52:17] did everything. Right. I mean, everything is, everything is a, is a big word as far as,

[01:52:27] as, as Kimball goes, um, as far as software is concerned, certainly, but, uh, you know, we're very

[01:52:33] much, um, uh, in all projects, but this way, you know, we're, we're, we're a team. And one of the

[01:52:41] things that I didn't realize it at the time, but I realized it now, um, because the environments I

[01:52:48] work in now is a lot different than, than, than what it was at Williams. I mean, now at Stern,

[01:52:54] um, with the exception of Dennis who, who works, uh, as an employee of the company and is,

[01:53:05] and is there on, on a daily basis, uh, there really isn't a lot of space to, face time with the

[01:53:12] designer because to me, it's like, I mean, no one person on any project is, is responsible for all

[01:53:21] of the, the greatness. Maybe all of the failure because I've seen some bozos screw some stuff up,

[01:53:28] but, um, no one person I don't think can really claim like, oh, this game is great because of me

[01:53:35] and no one else. Um, what happened at Williams was at least with Brian and, and well, also George

[01:53:43] afterwards was that, you know, Brian, he'd be busy during his day and then, you know, he'd keep

[01:53:50] going leave whenever at nine or ten or, or whatever and, but he'd come into my office and we'd

[01:53:56] always talk about stuff and I'd say, hey, you know, this is what happened today. This is what's done,

[01:54:01] you know, and, and, you know, here I did this, played it, he played the game for like half an hour or

[01:54:06] sometimes an hour or whatever and then we'd talk about stuff. I'm like, okay, what did you like?

[01:54:11] What did you not like? And, and, um, I think that works really well. I mean, I, I think that, that two

[01:54:17] people, uh, you know, independently a person can have some good ideas and, and then, you know,

[01:54:26] it's just some validation to have somebody else come by and say, yeah, you know, this is good.

[01:54:30] Or if he stuck or if I'm stuck, then the other person can sort of pick up the slack. It's,

[01:54:35] it's really hard for just, you know, one person to, to feel like they're responsible. I mean,

[01:54:41] even though we all have different jobs, I mean, Brian's designer on programmer, there's usually like

[01:54:46] one of each discipline on a project. Although I suppose, uh, later on it was more like two people

[01:54:54] as far as programming goes. Um, at Williams, uh, because there was, well, we just kept wanting to

[01:55:02] design more stuff into our game as far as software and it required more people, um, based on the

[01:55:08] schedule. But, uh, I mean, it just really helps a lot to have people, you know, come by and,

[01:55:15] and, and play the game and you see them have fun or you see them confused by something or,

[01:55:21] or whatever. And, and, and it's in ball, uh, at least programming and doing rules and things

[01:55:26] like that. And design in general, I think too. It's an iterative process. I mean, you certainly

[01:55:31] try to put your best foot forward all the time. And based on the people who are doing the work

[01:55:36] today, they have a lot of experience. And at this point, you're going to get, uh, I mean,

[01:55:42] you're going to get something pretty good with, with that. Um, but the rest of it is, is, is just a

[01:55:49] lot of, uh, evolution and tweaking, um, to take a game from, um, you know, something that's,

[01:55:56] that's, you know, either fair or pretty good, uh, you know, it's just something that's great.

[01:56:00] Hopefully. Now what, uh, what was your involvement with Safe Cracker?

[01:56:07] Um, yeah, after attack from Mars, um, I don't know, I was just kind of, uh,

[01:56:17] I don't know if I want to say just a point is, but, um, it's just really frustrating when

[01:56:22] people come by and they're like, hey, we love this game. Hey, we love this game. Hey, we love this

[01:56:27] game. And then you sell like, you know, three thousand of them. I'm like, oh, uh, everybody must

[01:56:31] love this game. So, um, I don't know, afterwards, I was, I was also very tired because I, I worked

[01:56:39] really hard on that project, um, attack from Mars, um, projects later on after you do again,

[01:56:47] um, you sort of build up, uh, your own, uh, I don't know, like toolkit of, uh, of software that

[01:56:57] you can, you know, more easily just sort of drop into another game like, oh, I need to implement,

[01:57:02] you know, in a track mode, well, you know, here's all this stuff and it allows me to, like, go

[01:57:06] forwards and backwards and, you know, for attack from Mars, I just like sort of had to write all that

[01:57:11] from, from, you know, from scratch. I mean, not totally from scratch. There were certainly examples

[01:57:17] around, but... Did you guys have a central programming library that you shared from?

[01:57:21] Oh, absolutely. I'm just talking about stuff like, like at the game level. I mean, uh,

[01:57:27] Larry's operating system was everybody, well, except for Fuzzler-Rooter, which I never understood,

[01:57:32] but, um, everybody used, uh, his, his operating system, you know, as is. Um, and it was the great

[01:57:40] operating system. I mean, I mean, to me, it's like, uh, uh, you know, a good operating system, um,

[01:57:48] will, uh, allow, uh, maybe people with varying levels of technical ability to do, uh, uh,

[01:57:57] you know, to easily do, uh, the things they want to do. Have the creative people be creative

[01:58:03] and not get bogged down by a lot of technical details. I mean, for me, I'm a pretty technical

[01:58:10] person and I've done mostly technical work my whole life. But, uh, as far as operating systems go,

[01:58:18] you know, I think that a good operating system is, is going to be simple enough to use to allow

[01:58:25] a creative person to be not so technical. And I think, you know, that's probably what Larry's

[01:58:32] system did really well. I mean, he designed it so that, you know, most people could just come in

[01:58:38] and pick it up and work with it, which was, uh, which was great. But also there was, uh,

[01:58:45] uh, um, people, uh, you know, obviously used it and, and, and, um, but, but there's a, uh,

[01:58:57] difference between, uh, you know, what's in the operating system and some of the things that,

[01:59:03] that you would maybe do in your game, uh, uh, that maybe somebody else would into, uh, in their game.

[01:59:10] I mean, for me, like, um, um, I had a way of dealing with, uh, uh, uh, well, I mean, just say

[01:59:19] something like a track mode, you know, if I implement something where, oh, you know, I'd like to be

[01:59:23] able to hit the left flipper to page backwards through a track mode and the right flipper, uh, you

[01:59:28] know, to page forward, that's, you know, some, uh, uh, piece of software that's written. And then

[01:59:35] I can just use it, uh, from, from one game to another game and so on and so forth. But it isn't

[01:59:41] necessarily part of, of, you know, this core operating system that, that everybody uses. So,

[01:59:47] that's all I'm saying is that, uh, you know, there's some things that you do, uh, some structure

[01:59:53] to your game, not, not the system, uh, that happens that, you know, it's, it's a little learning

[02:00:00] curve. But like I say, there's there are plenty of examples. But anyway, what's back to the safe

[02:00:05] cracker? What was your involvement there? Um, safe cracker, well, like after AFM, um, I never really

[02:00:14] learned how to relax after finishing with the project. But um, uh, safe cracker was under

[02:00:20] the way. It was mostly a different kind of, uh, game. It was a, uh, there was a lot of, I don't

[02:00:29] want to say pressure, but there was a lot of, uh, desire from people at the company to do, uh,

[02:00:40] different types of cymbal games. We had, again, there had been a decline in sales and so on and so forth.

[02:00:47] Um, and people like to normally do, uh, they, they, they say, hey, let's reinvent cymbal. Let's,

[02:00:54] let's do something new and different to cymbal, uh, that, uh, you know, we'll, we'll get our,

[02:01:00] our silver back and, um, history will tell you that, um, you know, you just have to ride out the,

[02:01:09] the downtrend or whatever and come back and do good, a good solid cymbal machine. I mean, like,

[02:01:16] if you look at what happens, uh, in the 90s, I mean, it's almost exactly what, like, what happened

[02:01:24] back in the 80s, you know, you have this big boom and then people start doing a wide body game.

[02:01:30] And then, you know, like, there's a downtrend and then people start doing games like with, uh, old

[02:01:37] games that are just artwork conversions, you know, like jackpot, tin botten, you know, whatever,

[02:01:42] I don't know, uh, I guess like warlock was the game like that. Are people start doing like

[02:01:47] these hybrid games like, yeah, you know, uh, back, back in the, in the, I guess in the 80s,

[02:01:54] it was video that was, that was making all of the money for the people who did coin op games.

[02:02:01] And, and for us, it was, uh, at least over in Europe, it was all these, uh, these AWPs and these,

[02:02:09] with prize games. Um, and so everybody gets on that kick and they're like, oh, yeah, you know,

[02:02:15] we need to incorporate more of these elements into our games and it's like, I mean, just pick up,

[02:02:21] there's a great book. Um, I love reading this book. I probably read it about once a year. Um,

[02:02:27] it's called, uh, the fountain head, uh, forget it. Okay. You didn't hear the Python interview, did you?

[02:02:34] No, actually, I have not listened to, uh, I have not listened to that yet. Um, I'm sure it's very

[02:02:43] colorful. To say the least. Python is, uh, uh, my son is a character for sure. Um, anyway,

[02:02:57] this book, uh, I, I, I read the book every once in a while and, and it's, it's really, uh, I mean,

[02:03:05] history, just, it's another way to look at history and say, well, history just repeats itself because

[02:03:11] it's like, uh, anyway, so we're doing all these things with, with, uh, with AWPs and save cracker

[02:03:19] with one of those games. It's like a smaller game and it's time play and it's got a trail game,

[02:03:24] a board game and it's bizzah token. And, uh, so, um, I was, uh, you know, I didn't really have

[02:03:33] anything to do and it was going to be a while before, uh, Brian could get another playfield, uh,

[02:03:40] yet, uh, before we met to decide on what we wanted to do and whatnot. So, uh, I was put on, uh,

[02:03:47] save cracker. I helped out with, uh, some, uh, display effects and I wrote, uh, um, a fault on the

[02:03:53] vault, which was the, uh, the mode that you, uh, that you got when you, when you put the, the,

[02:03:58] the magic token back into the game, it played like a different kind of, uh, game. Right. So, and I, uh,

[02:04:06] well, uh, save cracker was, uh, like a lot of people, uh, well, I shouldn't say a lot of people.

[02:04:14] I mean, palace, the designer, but, uh, as far as, like, the cast of people who, uh, really, uh,

[02:04:21] engineered the game, it was, it was a lot of people because, uh, uh, there was a lot of designing

[02:04:27] that had to go on. It was a smaller game, so we need a smaller cabinet and the back box was

[02:04:33] different. There were these token mechanisms and, I mean, it was just, uh, it was just a lot.

[02:04:40] It was a lot in, in a lot of respect, but, uh, yeah, it was, uh, uh, you know, an interesting

[02:04:49] project to work on because I hadn't, uh, I mean, after working on a tax from ours, it was, um,

[02:04:57] it was different to be, you know, in, uh, like kind of a, supporting role again because, um,

[02:05:03] I mean, for me, the role of sport is always, uh, um, I'll always defer to whoever the lead is

[02:05:13] and say, hey, what do you want? I, I'd be certainly, um, willing to offer suggestions and

[02:05:22] comments and stuff like that. And actually, as far as safe cracker goes, I mean, the assault on the

[02:05:26] vault was, um, you know, I just sort of kind of went off and, and, and did it, um, and, I think it's

[02:05:34] pretty cool mode myself. I, I, you know, it's like two games in one and I, I, I like that whole

[02:05:40] concept and I like the assault on the vault type, you know, thing. I, I think it was well done.

[02:05:45] Well, I appreciate it. Um, safe cracker, I think, uh, um, I mean, I, I really like the concept of,

[02:05:54] the, the tokens like being able to win a token, um, you know, I, uh, the rest of the game,

[02:06:02] like the smaller, the, the ball and hand stuff and, and whatever. And, yeah, that's, I mean, I think,

[02:06:10] you know, just just being able to, to play for tokens was, uh, you know, for me, like the, the real

[02:06:16] hook of that game. And, uh, I don't know. Um, I think also, uh, you know, the interesting, I,

[02:06:26] I don't know, to try that again or, or, or, or not. But, uh, I, I thought the whole concept of that

[02:06:32] was interesting, uh, you know, with the, um, with the, uh, with the token. But, yeah, no, I thought

[02:06:39] it was, uh, I thought it was a great idea too, which is, you know, the market obviously didn't

[02:06:45] bite into it as well as you probably had planned. But I, I thought the whole implementation and,

[02:06:50] I like it when you're playing and it's, it's a token out and it rolls down like glass and hitch. Yeah,

[02:06:55] I think that's great. Absolutely. I mean, that's like for when the first time it happens, you

[02:07:01] like, wow, what's this? And, and, uh, I, I mean, it's, it's pretty exciting. I think, uh,

[02:07:09] um, I don't know, it'd be interesting to see what would happen with that game if, uh,

[02:07:15] you know, we're just like some token that's applied to, uh, you know, like a normal, in-ball

[02:07:21] machine. I mean, it really gets to a, uh, you know, a subject that I think, um, I've always

[02:07:28] wanted, I mean, I, I feel like I'm a pretty good player. Um, but I always try to look at, at, at

[02:07:35] games, uh, and, and figure out ways to, uh, make things more, uh, equitable, I guess, because

[02:07:46] really, um, the games don't make much money when, when they're people like me playing them.

[02:07:53] And I always want when I work on a game for, for an average guy to just be able to walk up to it

[02:07:59] and have some fun. Um, I think, you know, over over the years, we've designed a lot of the randomness

[02:08:06] out of the game. And now it's like, you know, unless you have a ball, stave, or an all-your-ramp,

[02:08:11] see the flipper lands, and the pop-upers can't drain you down the side or whatever, uh, you know,

[02:08:18] the games are just like so based on, on, on, on, you know, that, that, with that a lot of the fun

[02:08:27] goes, goes out of it. And I almost wish that, you know, the games could, could get back to the day,

[02:08:33] you know, more like, when I played A-Fall the Lux, I mean, this is how games used to be. I mean,

[02:08:40] A-Fall the Lux, our, our games are, are so much entertainment right now. It's like, we tell these

[02:08:45] long, drawn out stories and it's like, okay, here's an extra ball, so you can see more of the story.

[02:08:50] Okay, here's another extra ball, so you can see more of the story. And, and back in the day,

[02:08:54] I think like A-Fall the Lux and even earlier than that, I mean, it's like one of the first games I

[02:08:59] remember playing. Um, the games were more like, I didn't hear more like gambling, you know, you're like,

[02:09:04] okay, I'm gonna put my quarter in, and you play, you're like, ah, all right, I can't. I didn't do

[02:09:09] anything here. So you put, you put another quarter in your play and then, you know, you have another

[02:09:14] bad game and then you have like, three, four, five, six bad games and then you have that one match

[02:09:19] again where you win like, six or eight credits. And you're like, wow, that's why I'm playing the game.

[02:09:24] And extra balls, there's only one extra ball, there's only one way to get it. And, and the game times

[02:09:30] were quick and the turnover was quick and it was back when like, ball time really mattered. I mean,

[02:09:36] ball time doesn't seem like it matters much anymore because we don't have people lined up to play our game.

[02:09:41] You know, there's just kind of like, well, you know, people come up and they play them and then

[02:09:46] they walk away. And back in the day, people used to care about ball time because they're like, well,

[02:09:51] yeah, you know, we have people lined up to play them. And, I mean, today it's like,

[02:09:58] it's almost like there's too much skill required to play our games today and we design too much

[02:10:04] into them based on that. But I'm off the subject a little bit, sorry.

[02:10:10] Well, let's get to medieval madness. Tell me about that project and how you came up with the name

[02:10:15] and the whole initial design and thinking and the programming.

[02:10:21] Yeah, medieval madness was, that was probably the most fun I ever had working on any project

[02:10:31] because we basically had the same team as we had for attack from ours. But, you know, we lost Doug Watson

[02:10:44] and picked up Greg Ferrer to do the artwork on the game. Now Greg is, Greg I think is probably the best

[02:10:54] himbal artist on the planet. He's tough, it's just absolutely amazing. I mean, he can even make,

[02:11:02] you know, a game like No Fear, it look good. And some of the stuff he's done this over his career has

[02:11:09] been just very diverse and very colorful and beautiful. Medieval madness, Brian, you know,

[02:11:21] or going over themes and stuff like that. And we had decided, I mean, for whatever reason,

[02:11:30] the medieval theme was appealing to pretty much everybody on the team. And for me, I mean, my

[02:11:37] appeal was I'm a big Monty Python fan. And I mean, I really felt like this French guy in

[02:11:47] attack from ours is my favorite guy. Cameron loves him too. He's like that Monty Python kind of guy

[02:11:57] from, yeah, from Holy Grail. And to me, it's like I sort of saw Medieval, I saw Holy Grail.

[02:12:13] And I thought, wow, you know, we could do a lot with the humor and the scant. And because to me,

[02:12:20] it was like what was important to me about attack from ours was the sort of the light fun,

[02:12:29] campy humor. I mean, to me, it's like when I play a pinball game, I want to be entertained. I don't

[02:12:37] want to get bogged down and like the problems with the world. I want to be able to play a game and

[02:12:45] just sort of forget about whatever's going on and just get caught up in the game. And there

[02:12:52] were so many elements that we could use. I mean, I think back to like Dungeons and Dragons and

[02:13:00] all of that. And it just, you mentioned some themes and I think a lot of people or myself,

[02:13:08] I'll, somebody will mention to me a theme and it's almost like I'll get an incident response.

[02:13:15] Like, yeah, that would be a great pinball theme or no, that's probably not a good pinball theme.

[02:13:19] And Medieval madness, we didn't even call it that. We just, I think we called it like castle or

[02:13:25] something. We called it like the castle game because Brian wanted to put the, you know, have to

[02:13:31] be a castle on it. And I think probably all my code that I wrote at the time, it was called

[02:13:37] castle something. And it wasn't called Medieval madness. And so, but no, I mean, everybody seemed

[02:13:47] really into it. And, but we couldn't decide on a name. You know, we decided, okay, we're going

[02:13:53] to do this castle game. And Brian, he had, he had this list of names and they were all really bad.

[02:14:03] And the one name that I guess everybody didn't jump out at them, but they thought, oh, well,

[02:14:10] you know, this one isn't so bad, you know, Medieval madness. And it was very late in the project

[02:14:15] that we decided what, what the name was going to be. It was almost like, hey, we need a name.

[02:14:21] You know, what are we going to call it? And so we sort of settled for Medieval madness. But,

[02:14:28] you know, that game, when I worked on Attack from Mars because the play field was already sort of

[02:14:35] designed when I got put on the project. Medieval madness wasn't. And I remember it. It was a great

[02:14:45] experience. It's why because we all sat around as a team. Brian, myself, Dan Fordon, Adam Rhyne,

[02:14:54] Greg. And Greg's a great creative person. He contributed a lot to the game.

[02:15:02] We sat around for many days and talked about, you know, the game and what we'd like to have.

[02:15:09] And so on and so forth. It was probably the first time that, you know, from the very beginning,

[02:15:17] I was on a project where, you know, I was part of, I guess, like the design team from day one,

[02:15:27] you know, from like the very beginning. So even though Attack from Mars was the game that I first

[02:15:36] considered like my first game programming, Medieval was probably the one that was the first one

[02:15:42] where I was, you know, sort of involved, you know, with the group of people from the very beginning,

[02:15:48] you know, and just like deciding what we're going to do. So,

[02:15:54] So that one was the most fun you had?

[02:15:57] I think so because the pressure of having to do all of this stuff for the first time,

[02:16:08] like I got Attack from Mars was a lot more comfortable working with Larry's systems and

[02:16:15] and stuff just sort of happens more easily because I was more familiar with, you know,

[02:16:25] do's and don't. And I could, you know, sort of spend more time talking, you know, with Brian and

[02:16:35] other people on the team about things. The one thing we struggled with though on the project was

[02:16:42] that the Catapult, like Attack from Mars, which I think I had for seven months,

[02:16:53] went together pretty smoothly. I mean, there weren't a lot of, you know,

[02:16:57] hiccups along the way as far as implementing rules and then saying, ooh boy, this is not working,

[02:17:05] we have to start over or whatever. But on Medieval, I remember the Catapult, there were like

[02:17:13] fewer three iterations of rules for the Catapult that were just bad. And so, you know, we just

[02:17:22] decided like, okay, I mean, we like the idea of launching animals and stuff like that. It's

[02:17:28] just sort of fun. I mean, again, it's like very Monty Python-esque, you know, they love the cow,

[02:17:34] it's a castle and, you know, so it's like, okay, we can do all these other animals and all this other

[02:17:39] stuff. But I don't know, it's just that that whole rule just came together very slowly and took

[02:17:47] lots of iterations to get where it was. Did you guys ever try and actually get a Monty Python license

[02:17:54] for this? No. No, I don't think that was ever considered. I mean, I'm sure we,

[02:18:03] we might have talked about it, but as far as pursuing it, no. We just sort of felt that,

[02:18:10] and I believe this today is that, yeah, you didn't need it. Well, a license is probably,

[02:18:23] it can limit you. Bad points. Good points of a license is for the average Joe off the street,

[02:18:30] okay, they can just look at it and know what it is if it's a good license. The bad point is,

[02:18:35] is that as creative people and designers and programmers and whatever else we are, it's less

[02:18:44] creative like we can, it's harder for us to do things with the game because... Yeah, fences you

[02:18:55] can. Tates that we do something else or the people who are licensing from won't let us have

[02:19:00] creative freedom to do like a lot of the fun goofy stuff that we put into our non-license game.

[02:19:06] Right. Right. So. Now, did you have some involvement with Slat Machine projects too?

[02:19:11] Yeah, a little bit. Well Williams was... Williams... Boy, Williams was a video game,

[02:19:26] and then we were left with two divisions that lost money. We had Williams, Tim Ball,

[02:19:54] Williams Valley, Tim Ball that lost money. And then we had WMS Gaming that lost money.

[02:20:05] I think a lot of management really wanted its Tim Ball designers to become more interested and

[02:20:13] involved in Slat Machine design because I think a lot of management really felt like, hey,

[02:20:20] this is really where our future lies. As a public company, nobody's happy with selling 50 whatever

[02:20:29] thousand games one year and then 15,000 whatever games the following year. They just don't like that.

[02:20:36] Your shareholders will just like bail on you and drove. But the gaming business was perceived to be this

[02:20:47] sort of infinitely growing business that Williams could take a little piece of and do very well with.

[02:21:00] There were a lot of people trying to get the Tim Ball people involved in Slat Machine design.

[02:21:10] So I worked on the Slat Machine between medieval methods and Monster Bash after...

[02:21:22] Did you like it? Actually, I did. I enjoyed working on it. It was a new experience for me.

[02:21:34] And I like to say I always enjoy learning these things. It was a lot of fun.

[02:21:42] Designing the Slat Machine, it's a lot. You're really to concentrate more on team and presentation.

[02:21:48] And the game itself is you're very limited in what you can do. It's just a bunch of math basically.

[02:21:57] And you can tweak your math. You want your payouts to be different or whatever. You feel from

[02:22:07] Paul to Pay Peter. You're very restricted in what you can do. At least with real spinning

[02:22:14] Slat machines, which is the game I did. But I enjoyed it. I had a lot of fun doing it.

[02:22:26] Which Slat was it? It was a Slat called Mermaid's Treasure.

[02:22:32] Later got redesigned into a game called Mermaid's Gold because we were going through some

[02:22:40] legal issues with IGT and one of their patents. The system, the gaming group had

[02:22:49] apparently violated one of those patents. So, IGT, you know, all a bunch of lawyer stuff.

[02:22:55] It's really ugly. They get an injunction, stop selling games, and all this other mess. So then,

[02:23:03] you know, there was a scrambling effort to I wasn't part of this. I was like working on

[02:23:08] Medieval Madness Code at the time. But afterwards, these people scrambling to kind of pick up the

[02:23:14] pieces from all of the direction that WMF had been going with their lot machines and how

[02:23:25] the math was implemented in their system. Yeah, IGT was really trying to drag Williams down

[02:23:31] in regard to Slat Reels. And that's what kind of forced Williams into the video Slat Market.

[02:23:39] In the end, it turned out to be a good thing for them because they basically rule that market.

[02:23:44] You know, now. They're niche with, I mean, they started with Real Men, which to me is like

[02:23:51] perfect theme for gambling. I mean, it's like you got fishing, you know, you're like,

[02:23:57] hey, I don't know if I'm going to catch anything, you know, it might be raining, it might be

[02:24:01] sunny. You know, you go out with lots of expectations. Like people go into a casino. They're like,

[02:24:07] hey, I'm going to win. And then, you know, it's just like you got fishing. Yeah, I'm going to catch

[02:24:11] my big fish today or I'm going to catch a bunch of fish or whatever. And then you go and

[02:24:15] sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. So I mean, to me, it was a great theme. And then,

[02:24:21] you know, they just did a good job with the game. So. Now, what's, tell me about how you got a

[02:24:27] hooked up with Monster Bash. Now, that was a George Gomez game. It wasn't a, you know, a Brian Eddie

[02:24:31] game. How did you get switched over to George as your designer? Yeah, Brian, Brian failed out

[02:24:40] of us, which, hey, I never fault anybody for wanting to pursue their interests. I mean, again,

[02:24:48] life is short. You have to do what you enjoy doing because while you can't. And so Brian

[02:24:59] really wanted to work in video. Brian, well, Brian implemented the, he wrote the two video modes

[02:25:08] and how he wrote the, the, the, the software tag video mode and the attack from our, then he wrote the,

[02:25:16] the save the children video mode in medieval madness. So he, I mean, Brian loved video games. And so he,

[02:25:24] he wanted to go over to midway to work on, work on video games and, you know, management at Williams

[02:25:30] and midway, basically the same. Well, wait, wait, wait, the, I meant to ask you this before. In regards

[02:25:36] to video modes implemented in pinwall machines, what is your, you know, there's some people that hate

[02:25:41] that and there's some people that like it. What's your feeling about it? Well, I think they have

[02:25:48] their place in Timbalp. I mean, I think that if you're going to do a video mode, it better be fun.

[02:25:58] Otherwise, it has no business in the game. If you're going to do a video mode, it better not be

[02:26:04] like Doctor Who where I scratch my head and go, am I playing a pinball machine or am I playing,

[02:26:10] you know, am I playing a pinball machine that all it has in it is video mode? I play Doctor Who and

[02:26:16] like I can play the whole game, make one shot and then play, you know, like, oh, here's the way

[02:26:22] of video mode and then make like the same shot again and, you know, or mostly on playing video mode

[02:26:28] and I'm not playing pinball. I think, you know, what aggravates the video mode too is the average

[02:26:38] player is not going to understand video mode, you know, 80 percent of the people who play the game.

[02:26:43] It's to be like, you know, ball goes in the hole, start video mode and they're like, hey, how come

[02:26:49] my ball's not coming out of the hole, you know, and they don't know that there's a display and there's

[02:26:53] the video mode, they don't know what to do. As long as it's far enough out, so that when I say far enough

[02:26:59] out, you know, at the point where the ball times such where I figure or a feature is far enough

[02:27:08] out where I figure, okay, I'm not dealing with an average guy here, I'm dealing with more like

[02:27:13] an intermediate guy or an expert guy and the video mode is fun and it relates to the theme of the

[02:27:22] game. Then, you know, I think it's a nice diversion, it's a nice break. You know, and I think

[02:27:32] both in attack from Mars and medieval madness, you know, all of that criteria was met. I mean,

[02:27:39] it gets super jets in attack from Mars. You're probably not a bozo if you get super jets. I mean,

[02:27:48] you certainly have to get the ball up into the bumpers enough times or start at a couple of

[02:27:52] multi balls or whatever. And same thing for medieval madness. I mean, you have to know how to

[02:27:58] work lane change. I think the video mode in medieval madness is more of like the distance and the

[02:28:05] level of skill I would, you know, normally expect, you know, at least for me to have a video mode in

[02:28:14] but I like them in general. Well, back to monster bash, tell me about your involvement with

[02:28:18] that project and working with George. George Gomesis. Yeah, so Brian was on his way out to

[02:28:27] over to Midway to work on video and then I was sort of left like, hey, where'd my designer go?

[02:28:37] And so Larry, Larry had asked me if I was interested in working with George. And I mean,

[02:28:52] I certainly saw George around the department. I didn't, you know, really know him all that well

[02:28:58] talked with him too much or whatever. The most I got to interface with George was George

[02:29:08] designed the exploding castle on medieval madness like kind of in the 11th hour and saved it

[02:29:15] as a feature on the game because our mechanical people on the game were having trouble coming up with

[02:29:24] a reliable cost effective implementation for exploding castle. So I was certainly thankful for him

[02:29:33] for that because it's like one of the big things in the game. So Larry asked me about working with

[02:29:44] George and I mean, I feel like it could probably work with anybody but as far as Tim Balgoes,

[02:29:53] I told him I said, hey, you know, if we can come up with a theme and we can agree on it and both

[02:30:01] be interested in it then yeah, sure, why not. And so I don't know, we were not having an easy time

[02:30:11] like trying to come up with themes because George was into like robots and bi-seems and monster

[02:30:22] trucks and stuff like that. There's like, you know, testosterone not as much as Steve but, you know,

[02:30:28] he's the guy and you know, he's like, he likes, you know, like stuff like bi-seems and monster trucks

[02:30:37] and you know whatever. So, um, and robots. And so I was wanting to do like a goofy monsters game,

[02:30:45] you know, like make up our own sort of characters and have, you know, just sort of fun

[02:30:54] monsters that you could not take too seriously. You know, you could think of maybe not so much like

[02:31:01] how screen is now but one of my favorite screen, what is that movie where they do the parodies

[02:31:12] on the scary movie? Yeah, scary movie, right, thanks. Not so much that but, you know, but just

[02:31:21] inventing our own kind of monsters and having, you know, just kind of a fun time with it like we did

[02:31:29] attack from ours and medieval madness. I mean, I don't want to be the dead horse but I think,

[02:31:36] you know, that kind of thing, you know, work in both of those games. And George really wanted a

[02:31:43] license. He's like, nah, I got to have a license. And I didn't necessarily agree with him because

[02:31:49] I had just come off of two games that were not licensed at all. And I mean, I didn't see the value.

[02:31:57] And one day he came walking down the hall and he had a little brochure for Universal Studios

[02:32:06] monsters. And he said, he like popped into my office and he's like, I'm doing this game. And I'm like,

[02:32:15] what are you talking about? You know, you're not doing that without me. That's, if many, I just like

[02:32:19] felt really, you know, like, hey, that monster thing is my idea. You want to do robots, you know,

[02:32:25] or James Bond or whatever. So, you know, basically, they're doing like, no, you're not doing it without me.

[02:32:34] And that was the beginning of Monster Bash. Now, originally, we wanted to call it Monster Bash

[02:32:41] on and use the song, you know, the Monster Bash song because like, uh,

[02:32:49] yeah, plays into the whole campy theme. Yeah, exactly. And Roger Scherf

[02:32:58] contacted the guy, I guess, who like, it's his only song or one of his only songs or one of his

[02:33:05] only songs that was like, well known or a hit or something like that and talked to him. And

[02:33:11] I think he wanted like half a million dollars to use the song in the game. And Roger, you know,

[02:33:17] he's like, well, no, this is what we normally offer people. And the guy I think thought, you know,

[02:33:26] we were trying to screw him or something. And it's like, well, no, this is these are the deals we

[02:33:30] do for music. And I don't remember what it was, like a dollar a game or five dollars a game or

[02:33:36] I can't even remember what it was. But, you know, the guy was, he just looked like, no, not interested.

[02:33:43] And I don't know, the way I look at it is like, hey, you know, you could either have your

[02:33:49] thing in a Timbum machine and make some money off of it or you could have nothing. And so,

[02:33:53] the guy wanted nothing. So we changed gears and we did the monster bash and the music was a

[02:34:00] little bit different. Kevin O'Connor, who was artist on the game and Vince Ponderelli, they're both

[02:34:08] like, well, Vince is the sound guy on the game. It's the first time I had worked with Vince. Actually,

[02:34:13] what's interesting is, on every single project that Williams that I worked on,

[02:34:17] from attack from Mars and medieval man, not monster bash, but also a safe cracker at no fear,

[02:34:26] which I helped out on a little bit when I first got there. And revenge from Mars, the

[02:34:33] unfortunate was the sound engineer on all those games. And Vince was up on monster bash. And

[02:34:45] Vince, I didn't realize this, but he went to school right down the street from me. He went to

[02:34:51] Berkeley School of Music, which is right on Maths Ave in Boston. And we were there like,

[02:34:58] you know, within a mile of each other for, you know, while we went to school. But he was in

[02:35:03] to a rock and roll, like doing like kind of a rock and roll type theme in Kevin. I'm not sure if it

[02:35:09] was Kevin and Vince, or I think it was mostly Kevin, you know, suggested doing, you know, like kind of,

[02:35:19] monsters with instruments and music and so on, which is actually kind of what they do down in Florida,

[02:35:27] universal, on the have like the guys on stage and they come out and they play and dance around and stuff.

[02:35:33] So, yeah, it's just, it took kind of a little turn from what we, from what we had thought of originally,

[02:35:43] which was more like a more classical treatment of the monsters, but it turned out being more like

[02:35:53] a rock and roll type thing. Now, what about Lyman's lament? What was the thicker behind that?

[02:36:02] Yeah, I mean, I didn't have anything to do with that. You had nothing to do with that?

[02:36:11] Well, Gomez, I call him Gomez when I'm showing him disrespect. Gomez, okay, he put this thing like,

[02:36:20] he thinks I complain a lot. I don't know what he's talking about, but he thinks I like to complain a lot.

[02:36:29] So, he jokingly said, yeah, I'm going to put this feature in this song. It was supposed to be a song

[02:36:37] that, you know, it's like, okay, it's just Lyman complaining about stuff in the game because,

[02:36:41] you know, he likes to complain. And so, Kevin put it on the play field and then George came in and

[02:36:47] hammered me, you know, and said, hey, you have to put this feature in the game. And so,

[02:36:55] I really didn't have anything to do with it. I mean, I'd prefer like, I like seeing my name, you know,

[02:37:00] and okay, designer George Gomez, you know, software, Lyman, that's fine, but, you know,

[02:37:07] elsewhere on the play field, forget it. And so, I was sort of, you know, forced to put it in.

[02:37:16] Well, you had to do the voiceovers for it, right?

[02:37:19] Sure. Yeah, Vince had me down in the studio. I'm actually Vince and Greg Dunlap used to come in

[02:37:27] in my office pretty much every day and around 4 p.m. I don't know why 4 p.m. But they come by around 4 p.m.

[02:37:35] And we play the game. And the game was just a draining piece of crap as the whitewood. It's just like

[02:37:46] you'd plunge the bog in the bumpers and it was like the bumper which shoot it off into the rail

[02:37:53] where the spinner is and go straight down the middle. And it's like, it was so funny just sitting

[02:37:58] there watching those two play the game. They just get so frustrated and then they just go right

[02:38:03] back and play some more. And, you know, I'd listen to these guys, you know, talk about, you know,

[02:38:13] the game just being really mean to them and draining and stuff like that. So that's mostly what it

[02:38:18] ended up being because Vince sort of developed his own vocabulary as far as that went and he

[02:38:27] invented all these phrases which I won't repeat. They're not repeatable. But that's sort of how

[02:38:34] that all evolved. Now, what was your involvement in pinball 2000?

[02:38:38] Pinball 2000 mostly started as, you know, John Poppity had a sort of a presentation where,

[02:38:56] you know, pinball 2000 was, well, basically take a pinball back last and replace it with the monitor.

[02:39:02] That was in both 2000 and then I think that was, if we had taken that to a show,

[02:39:12] you know, that would have been pretty much the end of it all. I mean, I think that was everybody's

[02:39:19] worst fear when we took pinball 2000 to ATI in London, we were at the distributor event

[02:39:27] and for the people who didn't know, I mean, there are certainly people who knew, but for the people

[02:39:32] who didn't know, I think that was what they were fearing. They're like, no, they're just going to

[02:39:37] unveil a pinball and it's going to have a monitor, you know, and then I don't know. I think we've

[02:39:43] been surprised everybody because we actually had a new sort of play mechanics for the game. But

[02:39:52] yeah, after Monster Bash, Larry wanted me to work on pinball 2000, not the John Poppity version,

[02:40:01] but the implementation that George and Pat had come up with. When I saw it, they had like the

[02:40:09] robot character, George and his robot, and then the hollow pin, I guess is what they were calling

[02:40:15] or whatever. I mean, it looked very interesting and it just, I think it inspired people as far

[02:40:25] as their imaginations go for game design because everybody just saw this new medium that they could

[02:40:34] work with and it just made people think about new things to do with pinball. For me, I mean, I

[02:40:47] had spent years playing sort of mechanical, whatever you want to call it, pinball, and not have

[02:40:58] the video. I mean, it was sort of like a sacrilege or whatever to see this thing. But it looked

[02:41:08] interesting and I mean, I just sort of decided to work on it because I thought like, hey, you know,

[02:41:17] this is our best chance and I mean, I don't know if everybody understands this, but basically it's

[02:41:27] George and Pat didn't do what they did and have that presentation and you were all pretty much

[02:41:34] done. I mean, doors would have closed, probably shortly after Monster Bash, I mean,

[02:41:45] we probably all would have gotten picked out a lot sooner. So it was sort of, it was not put to

[02:41:53] me this way, but I sort of came to this conclusion that it was, work on pinball 2000 and try to turn

[02:42:03] things around or not be part of it and then just leave, you know, because there really wasn't going

[02:42:10] to be much else, you know, to do. I mean, so when somebody says like, hey, do you want to work on pinball 2000?

[02:42:16] It's basically if the answer is no, then, you know, you probably need to find something else to do

[02:42:26] because there wasn't much future in anything else. The company didn't really want to

[02:42:33] didn't really want to spend any more time with conventional

[02:42:38] involved, that being, you know, like, in like Monster Bash or, you know, whatever the stuff I had worked on

[02:42:45] previously. So what programming or design did you do for pinball 2000?

[02:42:52] Pinball 2000, I was a lead programmer on Revenge from ours and again, like, lead programmer is,

[02:43:01] you know, to me like, designing structures and, you know, doing rules and again, you know, I

[02:43:15] hesitate to say that, you know, it's not like, you know, as a programmer, like, I'm totally responsible

[02:43:28] for all of the stuff actually, pinball 2000 was a big cast of a lot of people, I mean, it,

[02:43:35] everybody in the department worked on pinball 2000 in some form of fashion.

[02:43:40] On the bad was, had been developing the operating system for pinball 2000

[02:43:46] for some time, previous to that and I was going to be a lead programmer on Revenge from ours

[02:44:00] and Dwight Sullivan and Keith Johnson were added to the project. I mean, for ball 2000 was,

[02:44:09] well, mostly what I call a get it done project, it was kind of like, management just really wanted

[02:44:20] to see the thing, it's like, all right, hurry up and get it done and get it out there because

[02:44:24] the technology, I think, really, through what that product was and, you know, management just,

[02:44:32] I think, sort of wanted to know as soon as possible whether the technology was going to be viable.

[02:44:39] And, you know, I think I didn't realize at the time, I mean, I hated Revenge from ours

[02:44:45] when I was working on it and I hated it when it came out because I just didn't feel like

[02:44:51] that it was up to, you know, some other things I had worked on and I had played one

[02:44:59] within the last year and I don't know, I like the game, I think at this point. So, I think it turned

[02:45:07] out pretty well. I just get so caught up in having to get it done and having to get it done that,

[02:45:15] it's almost like you can't enjoy things along the way and it's important to, I didn't have a lot

[02:45:20] of time off between Monster Bash and with Anjai there. I think I had done, I had like four days,

[02:45:27] I had Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, remember specifically. It sounds weird that like,

[02:45:34] oh, you had, you know, like a Saturday or a Sunday off, some people shake their heads and say,

[02:45:39] what do you mean? Don't you get those days off? Not if you want to do a good job and be happy with,

[02:45:48] you know, what you're done with. Well, I think Revenge from Mars is a great product. I mean,

[02:45:56] I think as far as a pinball game goes, it's a really good, I think it's a good strong game and for

[02:46:03] a first effort on that platform, I think you guys did an incredible job.

[02:46:10] I think that, yeah, for a first effort, I think it turned out pretty well. Again, I, when I was working

[02:46:18] on it, I just couldn't be, I mean, I was so burned out, I couldn't, I couldn't see where there was

[02:46:29] fun in the game. And, you know, after working on so many games that were, I felt, you know,

[02:46:37] more entertaining as far as humor goes. I looked at Revenge from Mars and I'm like, well,

[02:46:43] I don't know about this game. And the, the effort that went into it was, was great. That's for sure.

[02:46:53] And a lot of people just wanted to, well, I shouldn't say a lot of people, but mostly management wanted

[02:47:02] to see it done and out and see, you know, what it would do. I can't say I had a lot of fun working

[02:47:09] on Revenge from Mars, mostly because of the pressure and the sacrifice that went into working on my

[02:47:17] game. But that's why Williams sent you to Disney World, right? Yeah, I didn't go on that trip.

[02:47:24] Okay, tell me about that Fiasco. Yeah, no, I still have my ticket upstairs. I felt like, you know,

[02:47:31] if somebody wants to send me on a trip, send me on a trip for some good accomplishment. I mean, maybe

[02:47:37] actually just like bringing that product to market was a good accomplishment. And maybe that's how

[02:47:43] I should have looked at it. But I looked at it like, hey, you know what? I've been to Disney a bunch of

[02:47:49] times. Okay. And it's a very special place for me. And I didn't want it to be about like, oh yeah,

[02:47:57] I remember I came here when, you know, we basically like tried this thing and management wasn't happy

[02:48:03] with it. So, you know, they just decided to get rid of this all. I mean, that's for them to decide.

[02:48:09] I don't really care. But I look at it differently now. I look at it and I probably should have

[02:48:15] gone and should have just, you know, spent the time and enjoyed it with people, you know, who I

[02:48:21] had a lot of fun working with over the years. Now, did you feel that management had it in for pinball

[02:48:28] the whole time? I don't think so. I maybe kneeled it. I mean, because kneel,

[02:48:37] he answers to a higher authority. Can I think, and this is where I think like, you know,

[02:48:49] can and Larry, you know, I have a lot of respect for both of those guys because as people who were

[02:48:59] my superiors, they came up, you know, like through the trenches and they paid their dues,

[02:49:07] working on projects. I mean, they both started as engineers. And so, through that process, I think,

[02:49:15] you know, they knew a lot of what, you know, we were going through when we were working on the

[02:49:20] stuff. It's like, hey, you know, we put all this time and effort into it. And then like, you know,

[02:49:25] management's not happy. Like, I don't think, I think kneeled bitched about stuff more than

[02:49:30] can did just because, I mean, can can spin through the cycle, you know, and he he kind of, I think,

[02:49:37] knows what it's like. So, I'm not really sure. What was the parking line incident with kneel? What

[02:49:47] was that all about? Yeah, I mentioned it in that in that video. There were a lot of,

[02:49:57] well, my radar kind of goes up when, you know, certain people start saying certain things. And,

[02:50:04] you know, it's like there were some comments being made about, you know, the plug getting pulled in

[02:50:09] whatever. And I, we kept long odd hours at Williams. And I think I was heading out for dinner or

[02:50:18] something to kneel with, leaving for the day. And I saw him in the parking lot. And so, we joked

[02:50:24] around a little bit, not too much. But, you know, I just sort of, you know, said, hey, you know,

[02:50:30] who pulled the plug on us? You know, and he, I mean, it was, I was just like sort of fishing. And he,

[02:50:42] you know, just sort of told me like, hey, you know, sorry. But I think we sold the, I think it was

[02:50:51] like around 7200 of revenge from ours. And then 5,000 or whatever of the hours, episode one,

[02:51:01] both 10,000, 2000 games. And, you know, he, you know, was just kind of like, yeah, I want to sort of

[02:51:07] cut my losses while I can. And, and, you know, he just didn't, he saw that trend again, you know,

[02:51:16] it's like, okay, you know, the first game comes out and the technology carries it. Maybe it's

[02:51:20] a better game, who knows, that's a matter of opinion. But, you know, the next game, which is a,

[02:51:28] which is a license and a pretty damn good one. I mean, you know, it sells less and is thinking,

[02:51:35] well, like, okay, you know, here we go again. And I think he probably did the right thing,

[02:51:40] you know, to just say, hey, you know, as part of WMS public company, this is not how we want to,

[02:51:50] you know, spend our resources. We don't want to, we don't spend time or money on this anymore,

[02:51:58] because it's, you know, again, like this negative growth thing. And, so yeah, I mean, I just,

[02:52:05] I just guessed because I, you know, I've heard people, certain people say certain things. And,

[02:52:12] I mean, it wasn't like it was a big mystery because, I mean, it says this before, when, when,

[02:52:18] when you start going, it's the project knowing, like, okay, this is our last shot at Pimball,

[02:52:25] at Williams. And you want to be part of it or, or no. And, you know, going in, it's like, all right,

[02:52:31] I'm going to work on this project. And it's, it's, if it goes down, I'm going down with the ship.

[02:52:38] I mean, that's what happens. So, it really is just, I mean, there are other problems. I don't think

[02:52:45] there's any product short of a gambling product that you're going to put out that's got like

[02:52:53] blippers and the deal ball and targets and whatever else on it that is going to get people to,

[02:53:01] you know, come out of their houses and go into bars to play on a regular basis, you know,

[02:53:07] to the point where operators are going to get excited about what the gamer is.

[02:53:13] It's just there, they're just way too many forms of, of, of alternative entertainment today,

[02:53:20] that more accessible, more entertaining. I don't know. Would you disagree?

[02:53:30] Well, I, I didn't give the platform long enough. I mean, two games on that platform. I don't

[02:53:36] think it to just, justice to it. I, I mean, fine, you're going to pull the, if you, if you're destined

[02:53:43] to pull the plug, you know, there was also like, I mean, they raised the price of Star Wars. They

[02:53:47] had all these European orders. The dollar at the time was very, very strong. So when you raise a

[02:53:52] retail price on the US dollar level and it dramatically increases the price, you know, to your,

[02:53:59] your European market, you know, they, they got a lot of orders almost like they were,

[02:54:03] were trying to force it to be canceled to some degree. I mean, that would be one perception of,

[02:54:09] of how it looked kind of like, you know, they, like they put this carrot on a stick and you guys

[02:54:15] took the carrot, you ate the carrot and you gave them back a, you know, a good return on the carrot

[02:54:22] and they still weren't happy to me. It was, you know, I don't know, you know, and, and just based on

[02:54:29] what Gary Stern has done with pinball, I, I mean, not that, you know, he's getting filthy rich on

[02:54:34] it or anything, but you know, it just seems like it was premature. It may have been, I mean, I think

[02:54:42] with any new technology, you have to give it time, but I think, you know, again, I think the big

[02:54:49] issue was, you know, just the trend. I mean, here's another scenario and I don't think that Williams

[02:54:58] closes so soon under this scenario. And the scenario is, Revenge for Mars sells 7200 ends.

[02:55:07] Star Wars instead of selling 5,000, let's say it sells 10,000. Okay, if you're, if you're

[02:55:15] Neil or you're anybody else, okay, what do you do? You're like, hey, let's do another game,

[02:55:20] right? Don't you? But if you go, okay, 7200 now 5,000, you're like, you know what? We're done.

[02:55:29] Bye. See you later. Okay, the movie, people can argue whatever they want, I thought how that

[02:55:35] movie was. I mean, I personally didn't like it, but Star Wars is a kind of license that if

[02:55:43] there hadn't already been so many games done and maybe it were a little bit more, you know, if the

[02:55:51] Star Wars movies are just coming out now, maybe. I'm sure Gary would have picked up Star Wars if Williams

[02:55:56] didn't. It's just a kind of license that is very desirable because there's already a history of

[02:56:04] it. You already have all of these fans. You have this huge fan base and you have this recognizable

[02:56:09] thing. And as far as getting people to come up to the game and say, hey, I know what this is.

[02:56:15] It's Star Wars. That's exactly what you want. I don't see how the license hurt it, I guess,

[02:56:22] is what I'm saying. Other than that, you know, the movie was probably, you know, overhyped.

[02:56:28] I mean, with new technology, people are going to have different ways of doing things or different

[02:56:36] ideas about what to do with the technology. You know, we went one direction and we were still

[02:56:46] to the point you're saying where, hey, you know, management didn't give it enough time.

[02:56:52] That's probably to some extent true because with new technology or like that, you need time

[02:57:02] or you need some leeway to be able to try and fail. Or experiment and say, oh, well, you know,

[02:57:10] maybe we won't do that again. Or, hey, this looks promising. Let's go down this path.

[02:57:15] So I kind of agree, if you give that license to, you know, I mean, this is with any pinball machine,

[02:57:25] not just pinball 2000. If you give the license to 10 different guys, they're going to come up with

[02:57:30] 10 different games, you know, 10 different ways to do stuff. And again, the problem with licenses is

[02:57:39] that somebody else is dictating to you what is sort of, you know, what your game is more or less

[02:57:49] going to be, you know, I mean, Star Wars. What's going to be in the Star Wars game? Well, all of the

[02:57:54] stuff that was in the Star Wars game, you know, you have Darth Maul and you have all that stuff.

[02:58:01] And whereas, you know, Revenge from Mars, we were sort of free to do in that new thing.

[02:58:08] Well, what about Wizard Black? You've obviously seen Wizard Blacks. What was your feeling on that game?

[02:58:15] I didn't really see Wizard Blacks all that much. I mean, everybody, you know, makes Wizard Blacks

[02:58:19] out to be like, oh, yeah, you know, this is, this is, this is, you know, going to be what was going

[02:58:25] to do it. Maybe, maybe not. It's, I would have certainly liked to have seen more games, including

[02:58:34] Wizard Blacks, you know, come to fruition because everybody has different ideas as to what

[02:58:43] Pinball 2000 should be. And, you know, Pat, I'm sure, has different ideas. And, you know,

[02:58:52] it's just the shame to not see some of those come to life. They just gave it a little bit more time.

[02:58:59] You know, we would have, you know, you could have made a better judgment call, you know,

[02:59:03] especially based on what happened to Pinball after Williams closed, you know, kind of like, you know,

[02:59:09] you know, it definitely went on an upswing.

[02:59:15] Yeah, maybe. I mean, I don't know if it went on an upswing right away.

[02:59:22] I mean, because certainly Williams goes away and then you have Gary.

[02:59:26] Okay, Gary's last man standing. But, I mean, how many games did he really do? I mean, in the absence of

[02:59:32] Williams, the, you know, the overall production of games was probably left. I would have to think.

[02:59:42] I mean, I don't know. I really, I mean, after, after Williams closed their Pinball division,

[02:59:50] I went over to, to the midway to work on video games. And I really didn't pay much attention

[02:59:59] to Pinball quite honestly. I stopped playing. I stopped competing. And I was pretty much out of touch

[03:00:07] with it for about three years. So I'm not totally sure. Well, in those three years, I mean,

[03:00:14] Gary put out some games that I would say are definitely not as past. But it also took

[03:00:20] that right or extreme and sharky. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And the thing is is that what, what,

[03:00:28] took it to get it rolling is, you know, I think there was like this healing process for,

[03:00:33] you know, a lot of the Williams people were, they were like you when they didn't really want

[03:00:36] anything to do with Pinball. But then a few years had passed. And I think, you know,

[03:00:41] somebody said, hey, why don't you, you know, why don't you come over to Stern and do some work.

[03:00:46] And once that snowball got turned in, you know, things really turned around on them. I mean,

[03:00:51] he's been producing some, some pretty darn good games. Well, I think I'm not the first person to say

[03:00:59] that's, but, you know, I think the value that Williams had and the value that Stern has today

[03:01:09] is the employees. It's the people who do the work, who do the work on the games. I mean, because,

[03:01:19] you know, if we're all on a plane going to a show and we get wiped out, I mean, what does anybody

[03:01:24] have? I mean, you're going to, you know, how are you going to scramble to get all this stuff done?

[03:01:30] You know, we all really care about what we do. And I think, you know, a lot of it has to do with

[03:01:38] the people. You know, you have people with a lot of experience who love what they do. And

[03:01:45] they're probably going to do pretty good work. The downside to that is, we're all getting older.

[03:01:51] I mean, I'm in my 40s now. And a lot of people are a lot older than I am. Some people are going to

[03:01:59] be retiring soon. It makes me wonder, you know, you have to pass the torch. You know, that's just how

[03:02:09] life works. And, you know, I think some of the, Tim Ball has always had its ups and downs.

[03:02:20] I know for me, I needed a break from it because I had so much work piled on me. And, I mean, I

[03:02:28] look at all of the stuff that I did in the less than five years that I was at Williams in the year

[03:02:35] and a half. I was at Data East. And I never thought all of that work would be possible.

[03:02:44] And sometimes you get burnt out and you need a break. You also, I think, need a break to, you know,

[03:02:49] just kind of recharge and come up with some fresh ideas. You know, we all sort of,

[03:02:56] we all sort of, as far as Tim Ball design goes, I think we know what we know. And there's such

[03:03:04] time constraints on projects that people end up doing things that they know will work,

[03:03:11] even if they might be things that like, well, yeah, you know, this game maybe did this or that

[03:03:15] game maybe did that. Because again, you only have to put your best foot forward. And if you have

[03:03:21] the extra time on a project then, you know, you can experiment a little bit and try some different

[03:03:28] things. All right, I mean, well, I guess we're going to close it. This is, you know, not to take

[03:03:35] this interview too far. This would be a good closing point because now, you know, we're,

[03:03:42] you're done with the Williams in the Data East era. And you're still kind of right in your

[03:03:46] history with, with Stern, right? Sure. Well, you know, are you okay with closing here?

[03:03:52] Yeah. Is there anything that I left out that you'd like to add?

[03:03:58] I'm sure after I listen to this, you know, a couple of times, I'll think of something. It's just,

[03:04:08] you know, the only thing I suppose I'd like to say at the end of all of it is, you know,

[03:04:16] it's been a lot of fun, you know, along the way. It's a lot of work along the way, but

[03:04:24] to be able to look back on it and, and, and, and realize that, you know, how much fun it's been.

[03:04:33] Also, it's, it's a great gift to be able to make a living at something you really enjoy doing.

[03:04:42] So, I mean, how does the future for pinball look in your eye?

[03:04:46] I think that pinball, in some form of fashion, will probably always be around.

[03:04:58] I think that it will continue to have its ups and downs. The one thing that concerns me

[03:05:06] right now is that, you know, we're doing games that that really aren't all that different

[03:05:14] from the games that that that we just talked about. I mean,

[03:05:21] games that that have been out for 10 or 15 years, you know, we're, it's like we're aspiring to do

[03:05:27] games that are as good as those games today, you know, back when they were 15 years ago.

[03:05:34] I, I keep hoping for not hoping. I keep, well, yeah, I guess hoping that pinball can be,

[03:05:46] you know, sort of a viable form of entertainment that, you know, excites people again.

[03:05:55] I think that's only going to be the case under a couple of scenarios. If we keep

[03:06:00] sort of down the path we're on and that's, you know, one is we could, we could certainly get into

[03:06:06] markets that don't have pinballs right now. I mean, pinball is pretty fun to people who haven't

[03:06:13] really experienced it before. That's one way. The other way is to look at where we are now and see

[03:06:21] what's working and what's not working. And again, I think, come, you know, I think our games need to be

[03:06:28] more random and be more like they were back in the days when everybody thought they were gambling

[03:06:36] machines. I just think that, you know, we've designed it way too. We've designed all the luck out

[03:06:44] of the games. And so, you know, you mean so the bad players do really bad and the good players do

[03:06:50] really good. Sure. You know, it's very intimidating playing pinball. If you just go out and you want

[03:07:02] to play and you go, all of this game looks interesting and you play and there are things like

[03:07:07] rules that you have to understand. I mean, I think the best things that there are in pinball

[03:07:13] machines are, you know, the mechanics. Like, you know, like, oh, say the castle in the Evil

[03:07:20] Madness being a perfect example. You could play out that whole rule without any lights on the

[03:07:27] play field and understand it. It's a camp, blowing up the castle. You get it. You don't have to

[03:07:34] look at like, oh, I shot that ramp three times and it lit up that light over there and then if I

[03:07:39] shoot that light and then, you know, go down this lane and do this and do that and then I get

[03:07:44] the small t-ball or whatever. You know, we could be doing a lot more to make our games simpler.

[03:07:50] But it's a fine line because you don't want to make the game so simple that you lose even more

[03:07:57] of the people who are still playing your games now. It's a little, I mean, I've watched people,

[03:08:10] you know, disappear over the years playing games and, you know, again, it's more forms of

[03:08:18] entertainment competing for entertainment dollars and I don't want to say pinball is run its course.

[03:08:26] I don't think it has, but I think that, you know, we could do more to make the games,

[03:08:33] you know, more appealing to average people. All right, I'd like to thank Lyman

[03:08:37] Sheets for coming on Topcast and I really do appreciate his time who is a great honor to have

[03:08:41] Lyman on here and I really do appreciate all his stories and I hope you all come back and hear us

[03:08:46] again soon on Topcast.
