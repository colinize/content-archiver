[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:11] Welcome to Topcast, tonight we got another great show with a designer that started out as

[00:26] a video game designer, designing such video games as Tron and Spy Hunter.

[00:31] And then finally ended up at the Valley Williams Pinball Division in the 1990s designing

[00:36] games there.

[00:37] He is also the father of Pinball 2000, which is a platform that started in 1999 at Williams

[00:45] that combined a video monitor in a holographic fashion into a pinball machine.

[00:57] So I'd like to welcome George Gomez to Topcast, that George designed some incredible pinball

[01:03] titles at Valley Williams in the 1990s including Corvette, Monster Bash, Revenge from Mars.

[01:09] He's also done some designs for the current Stern pinball including Playboy, Sopranos,

[01:15] and of course Ward of the Rings.

[01:17] We're going to give George Gomez a call right now and talk to him here on Topcast.

[01:24] Hey, George, can you hear me okay?

[01:31] I can.

[01:32] George, let's talk about how you got into pinball and how you started out your life as a designer.

[01:38] I studied industrial design at the University of Illinois in Chicago and I graduated in May of 78.

[01:48] And my first job out of school was actually a midway game.

[01:51] I did video games before I did Toys or Pinball.

[01:56] So in the fall, I blew off the summer and in the fall I started looking for work.

[02:03] Had another teacher that had said, you know, you really should design something that you're passionate about

[02:08] because you're going to get your best work that way.

[02:13] You're going to love to go to work and you're going to love to do this.

[02:16] And at the time I was playing a lot of video games in the student center at the University.

[02:24] And between classes or during lunch time or whatever, they had an arcade.

[02:29] And I would go into the arcade and I would play the very, very crude video games.

[02:33] I mean, what you would find basically in 1977 and 1978, basically black and white, very, very crude.

[02:41] I spend a lot of quarters on the key games, tank games.

[02:46] I don't know if you remember that game.

[02:48] Top down sort of an amaze on either side and a minefield separating the two mazes.

[02:56] And so anyway, I was playing these games and I was way into this kind of,

[03:02] I had never made the connection that I could design a game.

[03:06] But it occurred to me one day with all the arrogance of a 22-year-old that the stuff really shocked.

[03:13] It was pretty bad.

[03:15] Hank didn't look like tanks and jets didn't look like jets.

[03:20] And the controls were abysmal.

[03:24] And here I had kind of spent all this time in school studying man-machine interface,

[03:30] how do you make controls that feel right and look good and all this kind of stuff.

[03:35] And as I thought, hey, what do I call one of these companies and try to get a job doing this

[03:40] since it seems like it could be a lot of fun.

[03:43] And I noticed that there was a company here in the outskirts of Chicago called Midway.

[03:51] And I noticed that because it used to say Midway Manufacturing, Franklin Park, Illinois.

[03:55] And I said, well, that's, I know what that is, it's up at the airport.

[03:58] So, you know, I called, I called over there and got some guy in HR.

[04:05] And I said, I'm a designer and I think you guys really need help.

[04:09] And I want to make tanks.

[04:12] And he brought me in and I think that they didn't know what to make of me.

[04:18] You know, they really, their company at a time had a lot of engineers.

[04:24] They had mechanical engineers and they had electrical engineers.

[04:28] Most of the software people were electrical engineers by training or mathematicians at the time.

[04:35] And so I came in and before I came in, I had sort of taken a bunch of, looked at a bunch of their products.

[04:45] And this is really not, you know, this was not innovation on my part.

[04:49] It was simply something that we had been taught in school was to, you know,

[04:53] to really kind of understand the products of the companies that you would apply to work for.

[04:59] And so I had taken a lot of their product and sort of redesigned it my way.

[05:05] Without knowing anything about anything, because you know, when you're 22 years old,

[05:08] what really do you know, even if somebody says you're now a degree designer.

[05:14] And so I went in there with a bunch of stuff that was kind of my vision of what they should be doing.

[05:21] And I think right away that they saw that, well, you know, here's this kid that has

[05:29] got into this a little bit. And so they paraded a bunch of engineering people through

[05:35] during my interview and looked at my stuff. And you know, at the end of the day, the guy was the Chief

[05:42] Engineer at the time. You know, offered me a job. And so, you know, I remember he took me out to

[05:50] the factory and they were running space invaders at the time. And you could, you know, that scene in

[05:56] Indiana Jones where they put the, you know, they put the crate with the arc. Yeah, way in the back.

[06:03] Yeah. Yeah. And so it's, so they, you know, you're in an office area at what, what used to be

[06:09] Midway Manufacturing out in Franklin Park. And in the office, you know, it's an office and engineering

[06:14] looks actually very primitive. The only guys with computers are the programmers. Everybody else

[06:21] has got drawing tables and, you know, even the electrical engineers. And so we're in this office

[06:28] area and he walks me through, giving me the tour and then he throws open the door and there, as far

[06:34] as the eye could see, running off into infinity, was, you know, the assembly area, the factory basically

[06:42] with an assembly line of space invaders going off as far as the eye could see. And you know, your

[06:47] your senses are assaulted by the sound of the air tools and the bustle and hustle of literally

[06:53] hundreds of people. I mean, that's a game that they produced over 70,000 copies of, which,

[07:01] you know, I mean, the largest run of involve machines to date with, you know, I think Pats Game,

[07:08] that's something like 22,000 and change. Right. I remember correctly, right? Yep. So imagine the

[07:14] cons, you know, imagine the notion of, and this was a factory where not only were they producing

[07:20] space invaders, they were producing other products. So this was a factory that was turning out

[07:26] 1100 coin-operated games a day. If you can, you know, it's like it's a hard number for people to,

[07:35] if even people in the business, right? Because the the pinball machine factory at the height of the,

[07:40] you know, during the 90s craze with, you know, Williams could maybe make across both lines,

[07:47] maybe 300 games a day. So, you know, grasp that number. 1100 games a day. There was a line of

[07:55] semi-trucks with raw material coming into the plant on one end and they would literally be stacked

[08:02] up starting at five in the morning for for many blocks, screwing up all the Franklin Park traffic

[08:10] and at the other end of the factory there was a line of semi-trucks leading with created games.

[08:17] So, I mean, you know, it was just a, you know, to kid out of school. It was an overwhelming

[08:25] experience. I mean, I walked out there and said, oh my god, you know, 300 bucks a week,

[08:30] $15,600 a year, come and design games. So, you know, when you said you bought some of their products

[08:39] and that you had redesigned, like, what was, give me an example.

[08:43] Well, I just basically took their stuff, like I went out to the ERCades and looked at stuff that

[08:48] they, you know, had midway labels on it and I just kind of redid it the way I envisioned it.

[08:54] Well, what do you mean, like control panels? No, like the whole everything, the entire package, you

[08:59] know, so I was, you know, I did, I even took stuff, even stuff on the screen because I didn't know

[09:05] where the lines were drawn. You know, I didn't know who was allowed to design what. I just looked

[09:11] at the whole thing. I mean, I did, I mean, I had a couple of pieces of, I can find them somewhere.

[09:17] I'm sure I have them somewhere that have, you know, even them, you know, even the marquee art,

[09:23] you know, I thought needed to tell the story. So, and so I think that,

[09:29] in the beginning, they wouldn't let me anywhere near the actual design of what we know as a game.

[09:38] I was stuck in, they threw me into the Mechanical Engineering Department and I did

[09:45] control systems and, you know, control panels and and and and being cabinets, you know.

[09:52] Here kid, we need a submarine periscope for a game.

[09:57] For submarine game. Here kid, we need a gun for a gun game and you know, we need some, you know,

[10:03] I think looks like a fighter joystick for a flying game and we need a, you know, we need a sit-down

[10:08] driving cabinet for a driving game. So, all that kind of stuff, but you know, that stuff got old

[10:15] quick and uh... Well, what titles, what titles did you work on that, you know, specifically what

[10:20] video titles that? Then, um, God, you know, lots of stuff that lots of obscure stuff that you've

[10:28] probably never heard of because Midway was basically, you know, licensing a lot of product and

[10:35] producing tons of stuff. The very first thing I did on my first day at work was style a thing

[10:41] that looked like a spear gun for a game called Blue Shark. Black and white video game where

[10:46] basically all these fish swam across the screen and you turned the gun and the gun had a couple

[10:52] of potentiometers driven by by small gears to determine the position of the fish and when you

[10:59] lined up and you squeeze the trigger, you basically shot the fish with a spear. So, um, that was

[11:07] the very very first thing that I did. So you did a control panel? I did the the thing that looked

[11:12] like a, it was a big gun that looked like a spear gun and it, you know, it was the thing that you

[11:18] actually played the game with. So you remember back in the day when gun games actually had guns on

[11:25] them, right? Yeah, I'm a big gun game collector, so I got the lecture mechanicals, yeah.

[11:29] Shark was basically, I believe it was actually designed by Tato and Midway was manufacturing it

[11:37] and, you know, they need Tato basically sent software over and Midway did everything else.

[11:43] And so that, you know, I worked on that. I worked on, I did the the famous Gwarf

[11:55] joystick, you know, the control stick that was years later I took it and turned it into the

[12:02] tron stick. Yeah, I was just going to say that, you know, it was like the same stick as tron.

[12:06] Exactly, I did that. There's a thing that looks like a dot matrix, a little red and black display panel

[12:12] on the, you know, on the top of the joystick and it's backlit. Right, exactly. Okay, if you

[12:18] look search, search in that area, you will find my name in there. It says Gomez and, you know, in

[12:25] that little in the little dot matrix. Yeah, every time you press the button, that thing lit.

[12:29] Right. So, you know, just, you'll see all the letters are turned sideways and separated in every

[12:35] which way. But yeah, poke around in there and you'll see it. Did they know that you did that?

[12:41] Probably not. Probably not. Midway, Midway at the time, Midway in the 80s was run by manufacturing

[12:52] guys. Guys that came from the factory side of the world and they were not real teen on giving

[12:59] designers credit. I think they were very, very, I don't know, concerned about, you know, that we

[13:07] would become rock stars or something. I'm not sure. But they were very touchy about credit. So, a

[13:13] lot of that stuff, it wasn't until years after I left there that people realized that I'd done

[13:19] the buy hunter while I was there. You know, buy hunter was a midway game. Nobody knew anything

[13:28] about me, relative to the game. Are you saying you designed the whole game or just the controls for it?

[13:36] No, I designed the game. I designed the game. I brought the concept in the house. You know,

[13:41] basically Bill Adams, guy named Bill Adams was running the software group at the time and he said,

[13:47] I mean, I'm kind of jumping ahead. I'll get there if you.

[13:50] Okay, sorry. That's okay. I did these controller things and there were a couple of other guys.

[14:00] There was a guy named Bill Adams who was a software engineer and it was a guy named Attiche Go.

[14:08] She was a hardware engineer. And the three of us, we've got the launch and pal around.

[14:15] And we really wanted to make games. And the company at the time, the business of Midway was

[14:24] licensing products such as Space Invaders in Tito and of course the most famous Midway

[14:29] game of all time, the license from Namco for Pac-Man. And so they had two sort of

[14:39] resident design shops that neither of them were in house, but they were owned by Midway.

[14:47] One was called Arcade Engineering in Florida and South Florida.

[14:52] Run by a guy named Ronnie hella Burton. And they had done their claim to fame with Omega race.

[15:00] And then they had Dave Nottingen associates in Arlington Heights, just maybe 20 minutes from

[15:06] the Midway office, the actual factory where I worked. And run by a guy named Dave Nottingen,

[15:12] who by the way also happens to be an industrial designer by trade. I didn't know that at the time.

[15:18] And so Dave Nottingen associates with Go. Org. By the way, Wizard of War, Go.

[15:25] A bunch of other things. They were the big Kahuna. Dave Nottingen would tool up in his Ferrari and

[15:31] with this, you know, really actually Dave Nottingen associates by the way as a pinball aside

[15:38] is where Pat Lawler got his first job in the game business. Before he designed pinball machines,

[15:43] Pat designed video games that Dave Nottingen associates.

[15:47] So you're saying that Dave Nottingen was different than the other Nottingen?

[15:51] They were brothers, but Dave Nottingen associates was owned by Midway. It was a captive,

[15:56] captively owned Midway R&D house. And so you can imagine that the powers that be at Midway

[16:05] paid a lot of attention to products that came from Dave Nottingen. They paid a lot of attention to

[16:09] products. It came from our Kate engineering. And then the what we call the in-house engineers,

[16:16] which I was a part of, we were really a support group. We were basically taking and filling

[16:22] the blanks for anything that didn't come in done from the outside. We were making sure

[16:28] that things were manufacturable. We were making we were cost-reducing things. We were dealing with

[16:34] service issues, you know, like something that was breaking in the field would get, you know,

[16:38] come back and have to be redesigned or whatever, whether it was the cabinet or whatever,

[16:41] even the electronics. So we had all of the disciplines. You know, we had software, we had art,

[16:47] we had mechanical and we had electronics hardware design. We had all the stuff, but it was like,

[16:55] we were always, you know, working, I mean, how I got to work on the Gorf joystick was Dave

[17:00] Nottingen brought in a game with a, I think it was a copy of an F4 phantom joystick on it. And

[17:12] you know, my boss said, you know, we can't really reproduce this. So, you know, why don't you see

[17:17] what you can do and design a joystick? What, why couldn't you reproduce that? Is it too difficult?

[17:24] You know, I think it, a couple of things, I think. So whatever reason thematically, it didn't,

[17:31] you know, it wasn't futuristic, right? It was an F4 joystick and the game was a space game and

[17:38] there were some aesthetic concerns and there was also, you know, the fact that we just, we had

[17:43] it, Dave didn't really have to worry about production. He could essentially mock something up.

[17:49] And so all the stuff that came in from there was not ready for production. It was a long way from

[17:53] ready for production. It was basically, you know, like that joystick was like, I think he got a real

[17:59] one and he made a casting of it and put it on the prototype and then sent it over to Midway.

[18:04] So it was not something that you could, you know, turn the key on and go out and get, you know,

[18:10] 100,000 of these things molded. So we would basically, a lot of, a lot of the designers on the outside,

[18:16] even the captive houses, they didn't have to worry about making the stuff reproducible.

[18:21] They basically just had to somehow mock up the concept and get everybody to sign off on it and

[18:28] of course the games would be tested. Sometimes they would be tested with prototype ports and

[18:33] stuff like that. And it was our job to make the stuff real, so to speak. So anyway, the three guys

[18:46] that I mentioned, or two guys I mentioned, the Peish Goshen and Bill Adams, you know, we kind of

[18:55] kept trying, you know, we kept talking about, you know, how do we do this? How do we get that,

[19:00] you know, how do we get one of our ideas in the pipe? And, you know, Bill was a relentless at,

[19:10] you know, he just kept programming and making sample mock-up things and he never got anyone to

[19:20] pay any attention to it. The strength of our little group and a teach with a hardware designer and

[19:28] he kept coming up with, you know, he would show up and say, okay, I can, you know, I can give you

[19:32] 496 colors, but you can only use 16. And, you know, nobody knew what to do with that.

[19:40] So the magic was putting it all together. Now the magic was the three of us getting together

[19:47] and actually doing a game. So the very first game that we actually got into production

[19:53] with a game called Satan's Hollow, which I don't know if you know.

[19:56] Oh yeah, I remember it. Okay. I mean, it wasn't a huge hit like, say, Tron, but I remember the game.

[20:04] No, we're near. I think we really screwed up with putting Satan in the name because if I recall,

[20:14] all the salesman complained that we didn't sell a single game in the Bible Bell. And, you know,

[20:19] different times, different moors. And, you know, so, yeah, so I did all the bird patterns.

[20:26] I mean, when we started making games, you know, we would, I literally would do pixel art by coloring in

[20:33] you know, graph paper. And then a data entry person would take and, you know, she would make,

[20:39] you know, all the vertical columns numbers and all the horizontal colors letters. And, you know,

[20:44] A1 was a blue pixel. And so it was fairly primitive. And years later, a teach guy that I would

[20:53] refer to who designed the hardware that we shipped Tron and eventually, it's 500. It was 500

[21:02] was actually a modification of that hardware because we didn't have scrolling hardware. And I

[21:06] was a huge defender fan. And so I kept, you know, by then we were actually, we'd become a legitimate

[21:14] game team inside the company. And so when I went to the 500, I started jumping up and down for

[21:20] a scrolling hardware. And I got him carried medic who was at Williams all through the,

[21:26] through the height of pinball, et cetera, doing electronic systems. Took the, what we call the

[21:31] Midway Cartgrak II, the MCR II, which has been Tron and a bunch of other games, taking

[21:37] all of them in numerous other games. And he redesigned it for its scroll. And so, you mean by

[21:45] scroll? You mean, first off, a lot of people don't know what MCR. MCR was like this card rack where it

[21:50] had like five or six cards that plugged into this thing. Midway Cartgrak system. Yeah, I mean,

[21:57] Gorf used it, for example. Actually, Gorf used MCR1. Right, right. Yeah. And the Tron hardware was

[22:06] different. It was Tron hardware with the T-shirts, two or four, if you will. And what he did is,

[22:15] he had a patent, he had come up with a thing called a double line buffer, which allowed

[22:19] me to patent on it and allowed us to use a bazillion moving, small moving objects. We called them

[22:27] picture blocks. The industry calls them sprites. The Midway term at the time was picture blocks.

[22:33] So, you had these 32 pixels by 32 pixel sprites, if you will. And you had a lot of them on a

[22:39] foreground plane. And that was basically all your interactive stuff. And then you had

[22:47] an art page at roughly half that resolution, 16 by 16 pixel blocks, that did not lend themselves

[22:56] to moving. And those picture blocks were used to create static art. So, for example, in Staten

[23:03] Tallow, all the birds are in the front in the foreground plane. And all of the castle and the

[23:14] scenery and all that stuff is in the background plane. So anyway, so 500. I had gone to

[23:26] the company as a kind of a reward. It was a big reward at the time. They would pick

[23:33] five or six guys and they would send us to the jama show, which was a big video game show in Japan.

[23:39] And it was a big deal to go. And so, I, you know, they sent me to Japan and when I was in Japan,

[23:44] I bought a cassette tape. Walkman had just come out and I bought a cassette tape and a walkman

[23:53] of James Bond's greatest hit. I'm a big James Bond fan. So, I was listening to this on the way

[23:59] back and coincidentally Bill Adams was on my case about, you know, we need to come up with another game.

[24:06] What should it be? Should it be a driving game or what should it be? And so, I just kind of

[24:11] listening to this James Bond tape, I said, you know, hey, you know, it's a car with a lot of weapons.

[24:16] And I was kind of getting into the whole zen of driving music, if you will.

[24:23] And that's what generated the, when you get weapons, you have music. When you don't have weapons,

[24:28] you don't have music idea, which somehow has been lost to the guys that have carried on,

[24:35] the Spy Hunter name and all of the current iterations of the product was, by the way, I've had

[24:40] nothing to do with. But so, this whole notion of driving music and this car with a lot of

[24:51] weapons is where it all began. So, I had a roll of, you know, 18 inch roll of tracing paper,

[24:58] because you know, back then we did a lot of stuff with paper and pen and pencil and stuff and markers.

[25:04] And so, I drew this, I drew this road. I just kept on rolling the, the, the roll and drawing the

[25:10] road. And when I had an interesting road, I started populating the road with the enemies and the,

[25:18] and you know, all of the different things that could happen to the car as it, as it, as it,

[25:22] as you progress through the game, helicopter, you know, helicopter is going to bomb you and, you

[25:27] know, these big cars are going to come knock you, try to knock you off and die in a motorcycle and

[25:32] eventually, and, right on that time, also influenced by the trip to Japan, transformers,

[25:41] had just come out in Japan, but they were, they were not here yet in the stage.

[25:48] And everywhere I went in Japan, there was like plastic robots. I mean, it was like, I would be

[25:52] standing in line at a restaurant with a bowl of noodles to pay for my noodles. And there would be

[25:59] a stack of robots for sale at the counter of the restaurant. I mean, it was the most bizarre thing.

[26:07] And so, you know, we just kind of got the thinking, so it's a guy named, there was an artist

[26:13] on staff called a guy named Steve Olstad and Steve was a guy that, I mean, he's a guy that,

[26:21] you know, said, hey, you know, I had the car going into a vehicle, into a building and the car

[26:29] would come out of boat. And, and in his head, he said, you know, you know, transform the car.

[26:37] And, to me, it was like, you know, I thought, you know, we had pulled into the, pulled into the barn

[26:45] and left with the boat, you know, left the car to go up in the boat. Right, yeah, you didn't convert it,

[26:50] you'd form the car. So, so that's how the car got to transform. And so, so anyway, we, you know,

[26:59] we did, we started doing games before Spy Hunter, we actually had done Tron. That had really

[27:04] gotten us the notoriety. And Tron was an interesting project because Tron was licensed with a

[27:12] license that Tom Neeman, one of the very first guys that did any kind of, the problem of the first

[27:18] guy did any kind of licensing in the Pinball business. Tom Neeman was the, the Valley licensing guy.

[27:24] And, you know, he's, he's talked at numerous pinball events in the last few years and stuff.

[27:30] So, Tom Neeman had gone to Hollywood and brought back the Tron license. And nobody knew what it was.

[27:36] And he dropped off scripts. And we looked at the scripts and Bill said, this is our ticket. You know,

[27:43] this is what we got to do. We got to do this game. And the company had had, without even having a game,

[27:49] the deal that Tom had made with Disney was that when the movie launched, the game had to be on the

[27:55] street. And so further complicate things to company, at the time the company owned,

[28:01] Valley owned, Empire distributing and they owned Aladdin's Castle arcade. So the game had to be

[28:11] in all of the, you know, they decided they were going to have this competition at all the Aladdin's

[28:15] castles. And so every Aladdin's castle was going to get a Tron. And so you are on an amazing time

[28:22] constraint. And, um, Grand Finale was going to happen in, um, in New York, Madison Square Garden,

[28:29] a playoff of basically the, you know, like the top 25 kids from across the country, which we went to

[28:35] and it was great fun. But first we had to get the right to do Tron. I mean, we were just this,

[28:39] no name R&D groups that had, you know, had a minor, very, very minor success with St. Tallah. I mean,

[28:45] they used to laugh at us because, you know, I know what we made maybe 10,000 St. Tallah's or something.

[28:52] And so, you know, the company had just come off of a run of whatever, 70,000 space invaders and

[28:59] who knows how many, you know, Galaxians and you know, it was that the, so the in-house guys,

[29:04] honestly, we were just, you know, we were small time. But they had this, so they said, okay,

[29:10] we're going to open this competition up to the three R&D groups basically and the two big,

[29:14] Kahuna R&D groups were Dave Notting and Arcade Engineering and then our group. And so, my first,

[29:27] my first industry all nighter, if you will, was we actually made, created a presentation for

[29:36] to try to get the Tron, you know, project. And I made storyboards that I still have of what

[29:43] all the game waves should be. And we'd been working on, we'd read the scripts and worked on it for a

[29:48] few weeks. But the night before the presentation, I was up all night with this storyboards for all the

[29:52] games and all the games, you know, and by the way, this of Tron was actually the fifth wave in

[29:57] the original Tron. A lot of people don't know that. And we just ran out of time and couldn't do it.

[30:04] It became, we had very little memory at the time and so it was just a really an incredible job to

[30:10] just even get that, get it into the game, let alone design it in time. Environmental discs of Tron.

[30:17] Did you ever anything to do with that? Yeah, I did. You know, we were pretty excited about, I mean,

[30:21] Tron sold like, you know, a ton of games. I mean, like, you know, I don't know, 35,000 units or

[30:28] something. So it was a pretty big hit for us. And we were excited. This of Tron was being

[30:37] programmed by a guy named Bob Dinderman. And I was working with him on, you know, trying to

[30:45] figure out how to make the thing work. At the time, you remember, we had very little in the way of

[30:50] hardware to do these things. At that time, we were still thinking that it was going to be the fifth wave

[30:56] in Tron. And finally, one day, he just came to me and he said, you know what, we've got to make

[31:02] the room real because I can't fake the math. And so, so then I redrew the room and the minute that

[31:09] I redrew the room into a real one point perspective of the room, the, you know, the game basically

[31:19] just didn't fit with the rest of, you know, the rest of the wave in Tron. So it became a standalone

[31:23] game. And we said, okay, it'll be the sequel. And we were very excited about it. But at the time,

[31:29] all of the, you know, I mentioned to you that Dave Nudding was pioneering a lot of 3D stuff.

[31:38] And he was working on a 3D vector, you know, vector graphics-based game, flying game. And

[31:48] that game was really pretty much feeling all of our thunder. And we thought, you know,

[31:55] that's, you know, we had such great success with Tron. Let's try to blow it out and we'll do,

[32:02] you know, we'll do two versions. And so we basically came up with the notion of the environmental

[32:06] sales guys used to kid me that, you know, in Japan, they had those very small condos that, like,

[32:13] you know, at airports or whatever, it was basically a sleeping berth. And the sales guys used to kid me

[32:18] that when, you know, when they couldn't sell these things, they were going to turn them into

[32:21] these Japanese condos, sleeping berths. So the thing was designed to just, you know, you remember that

[32:31] there was like a lot of science fiction at the time was hinting at virtual reality and all of that

[32:42] stuff was becoming a buzzword. And so we said, you know, let's, let's, people can create a

[32:49] sexier effect. And we knew that it was only going to be, the thing was huge. So it was only going

[32:54] to end up in, like, the big, big huge family entertainment center type arcade. And so it was basically

[33:04] a standard. The front end was just a standard Tron or a Disertron. And then the environmental part

[33:12] was basically grafted onto the front of it. And it had, you know, it had all my black light

[33:19] tricks. And it had, I had like some fluorescent rings painted on the, or a filth screen on the

[33:28] bottom of the floor of the cabinet. And it had, you know, had a thumper speaker in your butt.

[33:35] And all these, you know, every effect we could possibly throw at it. At one time, I don't think

[33:43] we produced them with this. But at one time I had a prototype running that had a strobe light in it.

[33:48] And, yeah, you know, you take a hit from a disc and the strobe light would fire off.

[33:56] So yeah, I think that Disertron was, you know, we didn't make very many of them. I mean, I think

[34:04] they're out there somewhere. Yeah, I would have thought that designing Tron would be difficult

[34:08] because it was basically multiple, you know, at least four different video games. And so you had

[34:12] the spiders, you had the tanks. You had all, you know, you had the, the light rays. You always had

[34:17] the thing that we loved is when you beat the light ray thing, you could spin your arm around like

[34:22] Pete Townsend of the Ho. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, the, you make me laugh at that stuff. Yeah.

[34:32] Oh, it was a big hit. That was all the reason we wanted to complete that wave.

[34:35] Yeah, midway at the time, the guy who was a vice president of engineering,

[34:39] guy named Martin Kane, Martin Kane had a PhD in mathematics and electrical engineering and all

[34:46] kinds of other things. And when I made the, I proposed the control set with the, you know, the

[34:52] spinning disc and the joystick. And I'll never forget Marty said to me during the presentation

[34:59] that he says, translation and rotation are incredibly difficult to do simultaneously.

[35:06] Kind of like rubbing your stomach and patting your head. I said, okay, we'll see what happens.

[35:14] And we just kind of kept going in that direction and we managed to pull it off.

[35:19] Yeah, it's a great, great game. I mean, I, for the longest time I had the cocktail version of it in

[35:25] my, in my basement. I just recently kind of dumped all my video games though.

[35:30] Well, you know, the thing about that, that game too is that because we had to have it done in

[35:36] such a short period of time, well, actually, let me get to the part where we actually got to do it.

[35:42] So we were essentially in competition with Dave Nutting in arcade engineering and Bill,

[35:48] a teach and I really took this to heart because we thought, you know, so we did, you know,

[35:53] we went out of our way to spend a lot of time. A teach had the MCR2 system designed and working,

[36:01] but it had not really been exercised on much other than taking color. Nobody was picking it up and

[36:06] saying, we want to make our next game on it. So it was essentially going to be a, it was going to be

[36:10] a dead system if no designer wanted to design a game on it. And Dave Nutting used to, was famous

[36:17] for doing the absolute bleeding edge of technology when he did his games and his games were very

[36:26] forward looking. I mean, he was into 3D long before anyone else and he was into a lot of things,

[36:33] but the stuff took a long time to go from that level of refined, you know, that level,

[36:39] the concept level to the production level. And so there was, we used to laugh that Dave was a

[36:45] great showman and they would bring you into a dark room and you know, you know, Sprox,

[36:52] Arasustro's playing and you know, they sit you down in this, you know, in this recarrow seed out

[36:59] of one of Dave's sports cars and there's all these controls around you and, and you know,

[37:05] there's, and then behind the scenes sort of with the rod like there's five guys with cold spray,

[37:11] you know, spraying down chips so that the thing doesn't, you know, self-destruct during the

[37:16] presentation. And so we kind of knew, okay, Dave's going to promise the world. I don't think they,

[37:22] I don't think it's going to happen in the time that we have. And our Kate engineering,

[37:29] we, they were basically a vector house. You know, they were, they had, they had reverse

[37:34] engineered the asteroid's hardware to produce some mega-race and, and you know, they were essentially

[37:40] a vector house and we thought, you know what, we can do something with a hardware set that's solid,

[37:44] it's stable. Yeah, nobody knows it, but we know it. And, and so that's what we proposed. And I think

[37:52] on the, on the strengths that, that they, they looked at us and they, they saw a tremendous

[37:58] amount of enthusiasm when we made the presentation. Our Kate and Dave showed up and all they did was

[38:05] armways. There was nothing to show. And we had storyboards and, you know, cabinet designs and a

[38:11] hardware set that with some stuff moving on the screen and all this kind of stuff. And I think

[38:16] that is what got us the job. So you had prototype software. I'm sorry. You had prototype,

[38:22] prototype software written on the MCR too. Yes. Yes. Moving, you know, moving objects,

[38:27] doing stuff, etc. colliding and doing things. And I had, you know, I had a, how the joysticks

[38:34] came about is I had a, I had a sample of a GORF one. And we were having trouble with, we're

[38:42] having trouble with one of the, some of the internal mechanism inside the joystick. And I had

[38:47] asked the vendor to mold me a clear one. You know, mold me a clear one. I want to see what's going

[38:54] on inside that thing. Because we couldn't, you know, we had been struggling with, there was a field

[38:58] complaint from GORF about some of the switches. And we just, I'm like, you know, we couldn't

[39:05] figure it out. Because it was kind of pretty simple technology or leap switch and molded

[39:11] trigger. And we were like, you know, what the hell? So I asked this vendor, the guy who made the

[39:16] joystick, I said, hey, instead of running the black ABS, can you, could you possibly shoot some

[39:21] clear styrene in that thing and just kind of give me, you know, give me 20 pieces or whatever

[39:26] that I can fool around with. And he said, yeah, sure. So he shot me some clear ones and I had him

[39:32] sitting on my desk and I was fooling around with the black light because all the tron stuff,

[39:40] we had seen some, we had seen some early concept stuff from the movie guys and all the stuff

[39:46] was glowing. And so I was messing around with a black light and some, you know, fluorescent

[39:53] paints to make stuff in the game glow. And I had the joystick sitting there and I was about to turn

[40:00] off the lights to go home one night. And I had forgotten I had left a black light on and I flipped

[40:07] the light switch in my office and I was about to close the door. I looked back at my office and

[40:12] this joystick was glowing blue sitting on my desk. You know, one of the clear ones that I had asked

[40:20] for so that I could kind of reverse engineer the issue with the switch. And I turned right back

[40:27] around and went back in and started messing with it. And in the morning I called everybody in to

[40:33] a room with the thing with the black light and voila, everybody's gone, wow, it glow is just like

[40:40] the blue guys in the movie. So, you know, it's a happy accident. Very, very happy accident.

[40:48] So anyway, so we got to do the game and we hustled. It was a weird development scenario. A scenario

[40:55] that's actually very common today where we took every wave in the game and assigned it to a different

[41:02] programmer. So for example, the guy that did the tank wave, which is my favorite, it was the one that I

[41:08] was most in love with because I had mentioned to you that I had been obsessed in college with the

[41:16] top of you down tank game. And so I always wanted to make one of those. So when I did the maze,

[41:22] you know, and I came up with the thing where you shot, you know, you shot basically good shooter on

[41:26] corners and eventually expire. Okay, well, the guy who programmed that for me,

[41:31] guy named Tom Leone, who by the way was also Cuban and as I am. And so him and I went on to do

[41:40] Spy Hunter. He used the programmer as Spy Hunter, which everybody always asked me about. And so

[41:46] basically, but Spy Hunter, a lot of people at the end towards the very end, a lot of people in

[41:52] the business worked on it. A lot of people that are still in the business worked on it on the arc,

[41:58] especially and tuning the game, etc. But now what about the Spy Hunter pinball? You had

[42:05] nothing to do with that. I get bored all the time. And so I, for that reason, I think every

[42:17] Spy R6, you know, sometimes it's been seven years. I kind of designed something else. I go

[42:24] into design something else. You know, that's like a design toys for Marvin Glass and associates

[42:28] for about five years. And I was at Midway originally, about seven years in my first tour of duty.

[42:35] And the pinball thing was always interesting to me. And so I wanted to do with the success of

[42:43] Spy Hunter. They wanted to, Nick Company wanted to leverage the property and they said, you know,

[42:47] let's make a Spy Hunter pinball. But I was not, I mean, the pinball guys didn't know who I was

[42:55] and nor care. And pinball was a pinball designers. They were basically the first rock star designers

[43:05] in our business. They were the first guys that, you know, early on, they had employment contracts

[43:12] because they were so, they were so revered that, you know, they didn't want to, you know,

[43:20] stern to steal a ballie guy or ballie to steal Williams guy, etc. So those guys were, at that time,

[43:29] it was Jimmy Patla, Greg Kameck, you know, all of those guys from that era. And Greg got the

[43:37] assignment to do Spy Hunter pinball. And I went to see my boss and I said, hey, you know, you think I

[43:42] can do something with the Spy Hunter pinball and say, sure, just go talk to the designer, okay.

[43:47] So I walked into Greg's office and I, man, I, I'll tell you, I said two words for the guy. I got

[43:52] the chilliest reception I've ever gotten. So I walked out and they're going, okay, this isn't going to

[43:57] happen. You know, this guy's not going to let me do anything relative to this pinball. And,

[44:02] and I, you know, I regret that to this day. I would love to do a Spy Hunter pinball. And,

[44:09] and as I think it should be done. If it makes you feel any better, the Spy Hunter pinball kind of

[44:16] sucks. Yeah, I, yeah. And, and I think it's, again, it goes back to, you know, it, it was,

[44:25] you know, there was that era where the stuff inside the box had nothing to do with the thing. And,

[44:31] you know, it was kind of like that thing. You could have splashed any kind of art on it and it

[44:34] could have been whatever. Right, right. There was no, there was no relationship between the actual

[44:38] pinball. Made its Spy Hunter. And, and I think that, that's significant. You know, I mean, I think

[44:44] that's significant relative to its failure. And I, and I, you know, I'm a big proponent in my,

[44:51] in my pinball games, I've always been a big proponent to, to, you know, let's, let's bring, you

[44:57] know, let's tie the entire thing together. You know, it all has to hang together the fiction.

[45:01] Everything has to be consistent. It's, it's, and when it's not, you get, you know, you get

[45:06] Spy Hunter pinball. Right. So, um, so yeah, so I didn't, I got a pretty chilly reception there. I

[45:13] didn't get to do anything with that. It was, it was about the end of my run at Midway anyway. I was,

[45:21] I was getting very disheartened because the business was, was just talking so badly. It was

[45:27] 1984 and everything was going into the toilet. Everything but Spy Hunter was going into the toilet.

[45:32] And, um, Spy Hunter, I mean, you know, what, we were just a bunch of guys working on Spy Hunter

[45:37] with no deadline, no, no, um, delivery dates, no nothing, no, no, no even recognition for

[45:43] management that this was at, that this game was happening. And things were sucking so bad,

[45:48] they were down to like a hundred games a day. That big, massive, you know, manufacturing monster

[45:54] that it's gone, you know, just a few years before with cranking out 1100 video games a day and,

[45:59] you know, making anything and everything novelties, pinball, you know, the kitchen sink had gone

[46:06] down to a hundred games a day and every, every week was a new layoff. And, um, and some, you know,

[46:13] Stanger Ockie or some, you know, the running marketing at the time, you know,

[46:16] 10 down into our lab and say, what, what is this thing? You know, it's Spy Hunter and, um,

[46:23] we originally, we actually ran the game by the way for the first six months with the James Bond

[46:27] music from that tape that I bought in Japan. And Tommy Neiman couldn't get the license. It was

[46:31] ridiculously expensive. So it was Tommy Neiman who actually suggested the Spy Hunter thing,

[46:36] or what we know of is the Spy Hunter thing, which is the Peter Guns thing. Peter Gun TV show.

[46:41] And we hated it first. And then it grew on us. And, um, and so, and my whole thing about,

[46:49] you know, let's, let's get, give him music when he has weapons, no music when he doesn't have

[46:53] weapons. Uh, to kind of reinforce the whole, you know, it's the whole, make the player feel like

[46:58] a million bucks when he's doing well. Um, which we try to do in every game. I mean, we try to do

[47:03] it today when I make video games and we try to do it in pinball machines and, and the whole thing,

[47:08] you know, it's all about when you're sucking, it's got to feel like it's not your fault. And you

[47:13] can recover. And when you're doing great, you've got to feel like you're on top of the world.

[47:18] And it's the game designer that pulls that off as a game designer that stands a chance to make

[47:22] a successful product. It's sound guys back then. We're not the sound guys that we know them today.

[47:27] You know, a sound guy today is a guy with a music degree or, you know, or, um, it doesn't come from

[47:33] the technology side. He typically comes from the, the artistic music side, you know, because

[47:38] they're composers, they score games just like you score a film. But back in the day, um,

[47:45] the guy with the power was the guy that manipulated the technology. And so a lot of our early sound

[47:50] guys were, uh, you know, a guy who was gigging in a band, but also was like into programming or

[47:57] electronics or something like that. Anyway, I don't know where I was. I was, I guess I was talking

[48:01] about. Well, you were talking about the Exodus from Midway too. So the business is pretty shitty. And,

[48:09] a couple of years before, um, company called Marvin Glass and Associates, it's the most famous,

[48:17] basically toy invention firm in the world, um, had come to Midway and said, you know, we want to

[48:24] make video games because they kind of saw the explosion of video games. And, um, and they would come

[48:32] in with, um, they would come in with ideas on storyboards form on paper. And the company said,

[48:40] you know, hey, you know, these are all really nice, but the reality is, um, you know, these are the

[48:47] guys that did, uh, root beer, capper and, uh, and domino man and games like that. Right. And, uh, um,

[48:54] what was that, uh, one where the animals switched hats, uh, wacko. So, um, uh, anyway, the,

[49:03] the Marvin Glass and Associates, how they got into business was, there was this invention house.

[49:09] They, um, they were the big cunov invention houses. They had a, they had a reputation, um,

[49:16] for consistently delivering successful products to the toy business. They had basically,

[49:21] they were the who's who of toy design. And, um, and they came, they wanted to do video games and, um,

[49:27] the company said, okay, that's all fine, but the only way we can really, you know, give your ideas

[49:32] a tumble is if you actually develop the game. You bring us games that, because, you know, the timing

[49:37] and the feeling and, you know, all of that stuff is just not perceptible from a drawn storyboard

[49:43] on a piece of paper. Right. So, um, Bill Adams by then had risen to, he was running the software

[49:49] group. And, um, and we had all kind of, uh, advanced it midway, you know, I had my own little

[49:56] development group and a teach was doing his own thing. And, and so by then we had Tron under

[50:01] our belts and, et cetera. And, um, and then, uh, uh, so they assigned us to help Marvin Glass

[50:10] come up to speed. So, you know, teach him, teach him our hardware, teach him our tools,

[50:15] et cetera. And, um, there was very threatened by this, you know, because it was kind of like

[50:20] the victory to get our own gig had been hard fought. And, um, um, you know, he considered these guys

[50:27] like a real threat. But, um, you know, it didn't bring out the best in him. Let's put it this way.

[50:34] So, so a lot of stuff would go over to, um, Marvin Glass and it wouldn't quite work. You know,

[50:40] and there'd be some poor guy at Marvin Glass. By the way, those poor guys at Marvin Glass,

[50:44] the guys that currently, uh, you know, evolved into incredible technologies. Uh, uh,

[50:49] uh, Lannan Richard, that were both there at the time, uh, working on game, on the very games

[50:54] that I'm talking about. So, um, yeah, and IT was, uh, they developed the software for the first

[51:01] state of East pinwalls too. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, I guess it's a, it's a very small world. But, um,

[51:07] Scott Morrison was, uh, one of the artists is our director at IT is, uh, his father,

[51:16] Howard Morrison was one of the partners at Marvin Glass and Associates. And, um,

[51:21] it was Howard. It was my contact when I wanted to get a job at Marvin Glass after

[51:26] leading, um, Midway. So, what, so what happened is, uh, the business was crashing and, um,

[51:31] the Marvin, I called one day, I said, you know, I think I wanted to design toys. That thing

[51:34] that'd be cool. So, I picked up the fun at call Howard. Hey Howard, I'm, I'm still at Midway,

[51:37] but now things around here are really sucking every, uh, we, we were in this, um, we were in this

[51:44] horrible mode. We had been bought, uh, uh, uh, Valley had been, uh, senior management at Valley

[51:49] had changed hands and they brought in a bunch of these GE guys, GE management guys. They were all

[51:53] about acquisitions. It was, uh, it was the buzzword of the 80s and they, they basically took and

[51:59] squandered the, the video game war chest. Um, you know, in 1982 Midway, the Midway division was a

[52:05] $500 million company. If you just looked at the Midway division, um, without anything else,

[52:11] so they were bigger than the mother company. Uh, but yet the mother company was holding the

[52:16] purse strings and calling the shots. So, um, these GE guys wanted to buy, you know, they went out and

[52:22] did all kinds of silly stuff. You know, they bought Lancer yachts and because, you know, they said

[52:26] we were an entertainment company. Some clowns at the top had a, had a Jones for yachts and so they bought

[52:31] a yacht company and they bought six flags of America and they bought, uh, Chicago health clubs and they

[52:37] bought, uh, life fitness, uh, health equipment, you know, and so this was, uh, this was all bought

[52:44] with the Midway video game money from, uh, so they had squandered the war chest and, and then

[52:50] basically told Midway, oh yeah, you know, uh, you don't have any money in the bank, basically,

[52:55] you know, you guys have to send for yourselves. And so if, if you're making 100 games a day now,

[53:00] you're going to compress your, your staff to reflect that. Um, you are not going to, uh, pretend that,

[53:09] you know, you have access to some, some rainy day money here because, you know, we're doing

[53:13] other things. We're growing in different areas. If your business is crashing, then, you know,

[53:17] tough shit, your business is crashing. So, um, so at Midway, there was this, uh, you know, I called it,

[53:25] you know, it was like every 30 days, uh, you know, my boss had called me up to his office and say,

[53:32] listen, you know, you got to find X amount of dollars in your budget. X amount of dollars in my

[53:36] budget was basically meant to have to lay off some people. So I'd lay off some people and then the

[53:42] layoff would happen. And he would say, okay, let's, uh, let's have a pizza party and let's rally

[53:47] everybody and we're back in it. Okay. All right. Good. So we do that. After you do that three, four

[53:52] times, you start going, you know, so yeah, there's not enough pizza in the world to make this work.

[53:58] No, I mean, it's just, yeah, it gets a little old. And, and so everything was compressing around us.

[54:04] And I, I said, you know what? I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm not going to beat the last, I'm just not

[54:08] going to be there. And I had, um, one of my early mentors in game design was Hank Ross,

[54:14] guy who both founded Midway and Hank was, uh, personally involved at the time. He was,

[54:19] some I retired, he was retired, basically, he would, but he was, uh, on, on the payroll, I think

[54:24] as an advisor for Dave Moross, to the president of Midway. And, uh, Hank was one of my biggest fans.

[54:29] And, um, I, you know, I talked to him and I said, uh, what are you saying? And he said, you

[54:35] know, he said as long as I'm around, you can have a job here. You don't have to worry about that.

[54:38] And, yeah, Hank, it's not about that. It's about, you know, and, you know, he basically said,

[54:44] yeah, he says, you know, I, I see your point. And he said, nobody's going to think the worst for you

[54:47] if you split. So, you know, do what you got to do. And, um, and so I, um, I started looking,

[54:55] I called Howard Morrison at the Marvin Glass and the power I wanted to design games. He's still,

[54:59] okay, get a portfolio together, come in for an interview, see what you can do. And luckily,

[55:04] I was the one guy that had not fucked with them when they were trying to do, trying to learn stuff.

[55:09] I had actually helped them. So, um, uh, you know, they didn't have any issues with me. And, um,

[55:17] and so, uh, you know, they gave me a job and I, I, I, I want to see my boss and say, you know,

[55:22] that money you're looking for, I got in the budget. You said, yeah, and I said, well, I got some good news

[55:27] and some bad news. Good news is that's how I'm going to your money. Bad news is this. I'm out of here.

[55:34] So I split, um, and, um, and then did Toys for five years. I loved Marvin Glass. It was a tremendous

[55:41] experience. It was another shark pool. It was, uh, it was really, I could have never survived

[55:47] the Williams shark pool had I not done time in the Marvin Glass shark pool.

[55:53] Um, because the, the same kind of, uh, um, just a different species of shark, but shark nonetheless.

[56:02] So, um, you know, the 30 designers at Marvin Glass and 30 model makers and the, the places

[56:08] were licensed to print money because they had done, uh, light bright operation. Uh, you know, you name it.

[56:14] I mean, every, you know, hands down, every, every know, every famous toy, you know, Simon,

[56:20] every famous toy had been done there. And, and so, um, success was basically, uh, you know, there

[56:28] were 29, if you were, there were 30 designers on the staff and, you know, that meant that, that,

[56:33] 29 guys wanted your head. So, um, after that shark pool totally prepared me for what I was going

[56:41] to, you know, what I was going to encounter when I landed it in the Williams Engineering Department

[56:46] in 1993. Well, now, how did you get to Williams? What was, uh, how did that go? Well, after, um, in,

[56:52] um, uh, the partners at Marvin Glass, um, they had this, they had a dispute amongst themselves and they,

[57:01] they could not resolve it. And, uh, basically, uh, they dissolved the company and, and they went

[57:07] off into what the toy industry, um, referred to afterwards as broken glass. It has resolved these

[57:12] little splinter design groups, um, a couple of big ones and then a bunch of little ones that, to,

[57:18] to this day, they are the, the, all of those little splinter groups are the face of the toy business.

[57:25] Um, and you know, your buddy can tell you some of that, some of the story. He'll confirm a lot of

[57:30] the stuff I'm saying. Yeah, he was at Myrglass, which closed the year ago. Right. So Myrglass was,

[57:37] Steve Meyer, who actually was one of the programmers on some of those very games that I talked about when,

[57:43] when Marvin Glass started making video games. And, uh, and these, uh, went, you know, Steve went on to

[57:50] run Myrglass and Bert Myr, his father was also a partner in Marvin Glass. So it's a, it's a,

[57:56] it's a very, very, uh, close knit little circle. Um, so that, yeah, um, Myrglass was a spin-off,

[58:04] was one of those splinter groups that happened after the breakup of Marvin Glass. So,

[58:10] so when Marvin Glass broke up, I had been doing, I was Vodka Married. It was, uh,

[58:16] um, I think it was 1984. I was Vodka Married. I just bought, um, I just bought a two flat in Evan's

[58:22] spin in anticipation of moving into it with my wife and, uh, my wife to be and, uh, you know, I had

[58:29] had a, I had a 1985 Corvette and I, you know, I had all this stuff in my life and I had, I was out of a job.

[58:34] So I, okay, I got to go, you know, I got to figure something out and, uh, I had been, uh,

[58:41] in anticipation of, uh, of my wedding, I had been getting work from Dave Morosky at Brand

[58:47] Product, uh, on the side. And, uh, Dave had, uh, uh, had, was the president of Midway during all those,

[58:55] all those years. He did the, you know, Pac-Man deal and all that stuff. And, uh, Dave, um, I called Dave

[59:02] one day and said, uh, hey, Dave, I'm getting married in June and, uh, you know, my wife, my wife's

[59:08] vision of this vision of this wedding is like Barbie's wedding and, uh, it cost me a bazillion dollars

[59:14] and I need some money and, and so, uh, send me any work you have. And, um, he was starting up this

[59:21] little, uh, manufacturing company called Grand Products. And, uh, that, uh, it's still,

[59:28] still alive. They're not so little anymore. They build basically all of Eugene Jarvis' product

[59:32] and they build, uh, IT's product and, you know, they become a big, a big crew in the business.

[59:38] Um, and I love those guys. It's a very successful bunch of guys, uh, currently. And, uh, so, um,

[59:45] I, uh, Dave started feeding me work and Dave's designer at the time was, uh, Dave was trying

[59:52] to do some stuff with Dave Nutting. Dave Nutting, you know, after, when, when, when, when, uh,

[59:58] midway went through its 1984 compression cycle, one of the things that got locked off was Dave

[01:00:03] Nutting and Associates. And so Dave had disbanded his little group, um, and, and, uh, which incidentally

[01:00:11] is how Pat ended up at Williams, um, sort of, uh, in the roundabout way. And so, uh,

[01:00:18] because Pat was working at Dave Nutting, uh, when he, he closed doors. So, and he had to go find work.

[01:00:23] And, uh, roundabout way hooked up with Larry DeMarz, that, uh, and, and, and ended up, uh, ended up, uh,

[01:00:29] uh, uh, uh, uh, Willie. Yeah, they weren't up the same bowling team or something.

[01:00:33] Exactly with Joey and, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, uh, and the Dittins and, uh, the Dittins, I think

[01:00:38] had some Brunswick, uh, work and coincidentally and, and there's some connection there with Brunswick,

[01:00:45] bowling people. And, um, so, um, Dave, or, uh, Dave Nutting was designing, uh, a game for Dave

[01:00:54] Marovsky, uh, at Grand Products on an Amiga. And then the, um, the idea was to put Amiga,

[01:01:01] is Amiga would be the hardware set that would go into the actual game. And so, they, they had bought

[01:01:05] a bazillion Amiga 1000s and they were literally bolting them into cabinets. It's a run the software

[01:01:10] of the game. And the software was being done by the Dittins. Uh, Dave Nutting was designing the game.

[01:01:17] And, uh, and I, I was basically trying to get that thing into production, uh, drawing whatever

[01:01:24] they needed me to draw. So, he was like, you know, you know, I need a periscope. Okay, I've done a

[01:01:28] periscope before it. Here's the periscope. So, just, uh, I took on whatever work I could get.

[01:01:35] When the doors closed in Marvin Glass, I called Dave right away, had lunch with him one day and said,

[01:01:40] hey, you better ramp this up, because this is no longer about Barbie's wedding. This is about, uh,

[01:01:45] you know, this is about, uh, I need a job. The Dave said, well, I can't afford you, you know,

[01:01:51] full time, but I'll give you a place to work. And you just come here and, and do your thing. So,

[01:01:58] so I went and, um, and started beating the bushes for work. And I picked up a bunch of the

[01:02:04] guys that I used to work with at Midway. So, there were, there were like four or five guys.

[01:02:08] And I started, uh, trying to drum up work. And I came up with a bunch of things.

[01:02:13] Through the Ditton, I got involved in the, um, Fossa, uh, Battle Tech Centers. They had had a

[01:02:20] couple of, uh, uh, false starts with other designers in terms of designing the pods for the Battle

[01:02:26] Tech Center and the environment for the Battle Tech Center. And so, um, Richard Ditton was in my

[01:02:32] office one day at Grand Products and he saw that I had a Battle Tech poster on, on the wall. And he

[01:02:37] said, Battle Tech, what do you know about Battle Tech? And it's, and, nothing. I just, I'm just into

[01:02:41] the fiction. Um, you know, I like the robots and, and the game and stuff. And he said, oh my god,

[01:02:47] he said, you know, you're the perfect guy for this. So, uh, he, you know, he hooked me up with

[01:02:52] the Fossa guys and I, I took on this, uh, the Battle Tech Center project and I hired, um, four of

[01:02:59] the guys that I used to work with a midway to help me. And, um, we were often running.

[01:03:05] Um, I quickly figured out that it was, it was really stankless work because, um, all of my,

[01:03:13] you know, all of my creativity was essentially how to go through the Fossa filter. And so,

[01:03:18] it was kind of like, if those guys didn't like it, it was just not going to happen. And it was, uh,

[01:03:22] it was a tighter filter than I was used to. And so, uh, I started, and, and the, and the work for Dave

[01:03:27] Moroski was very boring. It was like, you know, days manufacturing the next Sega game. It was the 80s.

[01:03:33] And it was the late 80s and, uh, we thought the Japanese were going to rule the world and, and they

[01:03:39] were sending over software. It was too expensive to, uh, send over entire fully built cabinets and

[01:03:45] game. And nuts mentioned that none of the materials that they designed in were available in this

[01:03:51] country. So, um, it never sees this to amaze me that, you know, I would get some marketing

[01:03:57] guy over here from Sega, an Amc or whoever. And he would say to me, well, here's the Japanese drawing

[01:04:03] set. And, um, you turn the key and make this thing. I don't understand why you have to redesign all

[01:04:09] this stuff. The way, the reason you have to redesign it is because the Japanese work with metric

[01:04:14] material. The entire thing is designed with metric material. The dimensions of 50 millimeter

[01:04:19] plywood, 50 millimeter piece of plywood is not a 3-quarter inch piece of plywood. Now, we can do

[01:04:23] two things. We get order all of these material stateside, which at the time were not readily available.

[01:04:31] Or you can redesign it with domestic materials, but every one of these dimensions is different

[01:04:37] because 10 millimeters is not 3-8ths of an inch. It's close, but close when you get all these

[01:04:43] parts together is not going to work. So, they would pay me a lot of money to do this. And they

[01:04:50] always paid well, but it was really boring work. I mean, it was really, really boring work, you know,

[01:04:55] and nothing like arguing with the guy at Jalaka about how no one in the United States of America

[01:05:02] referred to San Francisco at Cisco. They did a game called Cisco Heat. And I talked to

[01:05:08] that I was blue in the face of this guy going, no, let's get to know what you're talking about.

[01:05:11] Really, Cisco. No one calls San Francisco Cisco. It was a Miami Vice rip-off, you know, and it

[01:05:17] was called Cisco Heat. I can never, I'll never forget, you know, never did, they ship the game called

[01:05:25] Cisco Heat. All right, we're going to take a break from talking with George Gomez and we'll be

[01:05:30] right back after this message. Hey, George, I just had to call and tell you about this really great magazine.

[01:05:40] It's called the Ping Game General and it's the only magazine dedicated to the pinball. It's got great

[01:05:45] articles and interviews with designers and everything. No, George, I won't lend you my copy.

[01:05:50] Who knows where you'll take it to? You're going to have to go to PingGangeral.com and get your

[01:05:55] own subscription. But George, the guy says that each issue will give mail whenever it feels like

[01:05:59] what's the deal with that. All right, George, I got to go. Got to call Elaine and tell her, I can't

[01:06:05] do this. Okay, we're back with George Gomez and some of more of his design stories.

[01:06:11] I was always trying to pitch ideas and so I did some ideas for Gil Pollock, pinball features.

[01:06:20] You know, that's how I got to know Ray Tanzer and all those guys over there.

[01:06:27] So they would come up with a thing, you know, hey, we think it would be cool, but if you get a

[01:06:31] pinball to walk up stairs, I would make a little plastic working model of a pinball walking up the

[01:06:38] stairs to put a pinball on it, hook it up to 12-volt motor and the pinball would walk up the stairs.

[01:06:43] Hey, I think it would be cool if we could do this. In the meantime, I started throwing in my own

[01:06:48] you know, zingers. You know, here's what you think about this. Here's the monster. He lives underneath

[01:06:52] the play field. The whole top of the play field lifts up and the monster comes up. What do you think

[01:06:55] about that? So I was pitching all these ideas and they were all very happy to use, but none of

[01:07:03] you know, use what they wanted to do, but nobody wanted, you know, with the old story, right?

[01:07:07] I'm the designer of the game. Why do I want your design in my game? So none of the designers

[01:07:12] working on the games would take any of my stuff. So I had accumulated literally rooms full of

[01:07:22] working prototypes of stuff. And one of the guys that I used to show stuff to was Kenny Fudaz and

[01:07:28] at Williams. And I had known Kenny from the business. And I would call him from time to time and

[01:07:34] say, hey Kenny, I got this thing and I'll come see it and he would come out and you would look at it.

[01:07:39] Yeah, you know, and Kenny told me right up front, so you know, the problem with this is our guys.

[01:07:44] That's your problem. It's not that there's anything wrong with the stuff. It's just our guys. Our guys,

[01:07:51] well, Pat Waller's not going to take your stuff. He's got his own and he bridges not going to take

[01:07:55] your stuff. He's got his own. So, um, so it's solved the problem. It's hired George. Now he can have his

[01:08:00] own. Well, so you know what happened is one day, Ken Fudaz was coming over to see me so I could

[01:08:09] show him something. And he had Neil McAstrow and Tull because they were going on to some other

[01:08:15] meeting and something like that. I can't remember the specifics of why the two of them were there.

[01:08:23] But Neil showed up and I think he saw, you know, I think at the time Capcom has come to town and

[01:08:30] stole in a bunch of Williams designers, you know, Mark Richey and a bunch of those guys that split

[01:08:34] to the work on the Capcom stuff. And I was just in the right place at the right time.

[01:08:40] I showed them, you know, Kenny said, well, yeah, bring out what else you got back there.

[01:08:47] And so I just started bringing stuff out of the prize closet. And I think they figured out,

[01:08:56] oh, you know, this guy can make stuff. I had done a bunch of, they actually, I think I had come to

[01:09:03] to their attention because I had done a bunch of stuff for Lauren Bromley in redemption games.

[01:09:09] And through grand product. And so they had seen some of my stuff at trade shows.

[01:09:17] You know, it's funny. They didn't know of me from Midway, which since I've been gone in the toy

[01:09:22] business, I found it curious that none of them knew me from Midway. And yet, you know, I had

[01:09:29] competed with all of those guys, you know, back in the day. So they actually, so they offered me a job.

[01:09:37] And I, what swung it was, because I actually, I literally went to the, you know, Kenny and Neil

[01:09:46] were over on a Friday or something. And on Monday, I get a call from Debbie Silkwood, Kenny's secretary saying,

[01:09:52] hey, they want to have lunch with you on the one of you free. I was like, okay, they're not going to

[01:09:57] have lunch with me to buy this thing that I show them. They're going to offer me a job. And at the time,

[01:10:03] to tell you the truth, I was like, hmm, I was just beginning to make a goal of, you know,

[01:10:11] the business sort of speak. It was a struggle, but it was, you know, we were getting work and we were

[01:10:18] kind of, you know, I still had the hopes in the back of my head that someday we would sell something

[01:10:22] with somebody. And what Kenny said, he goes, you know, look, you can, right now, you work on all this

[01:10:31] other stuff or all this stuff for other people. You struggle with, you know, doing stuff you don't

[01:10:37] want to do. And you got to have all, you got to, you got to do all this crappy work in order to do

[01:10:44] the five ideas that you want to do at any given time, because you can't afford to just do your own

[01:10:50] stuff, because you don't know if you're going to sell it. So, you say, why don't you come on board here,

[01:10:54] we'll give you a design team. You can do anything you want. You know, you know, how we work, you know,

[01:10:59] you can be the king of your team and do whatever you want to do. And, you know, we'll, you know,

[01:11:05] and it's one thing, you're focused on one thing. And what they really wanted me to do, this is,

[01:11:10] it was not pinball, they had not offered me a job designing pinball machines, they were offering

[01:11:14] me a job, they wanted to compete with Lauren Bromley. And they wanted to, they had taken notice

[01:11:21] of the redemption business. And they wanted to magnify games for the redemption business. So,

[01:11:27] I went, you know, I thought about it and it was an appropriate time, because I just got divorced,

[01:11:33] I needed a change of pace. And I said yes. And I went and the first couple of months,

[01:11:43] it was really funny, you know, they would, Kenny would walk in my office, I'd be working on a

[01:11:47] novelty game. And I was kind of the dark horse designer, because nobody gave a shit about

[01:11:55] novelty games. And they were, they were kind of the, you know, small potatoes, if it, you know,

[01:12:00] amongst the, you know, the pinball gods. Yeah, amongst the Adams families of the world,

[01:12:05] here you got a novelty game designer. Yeah, you know, it was like, yeah, whatever, you know. And so,

[01:12:11] those guys liked me. I mean, you know, Pat had a lot of respect for my stuff. He had seen it

[01:12:15] over the years and he had a lot of respect for my stuff. So, and Steve was, was a huge mentor to

[01:12:25] me when I first went there and, and throughout. And, and so, I think that, and I think that,

[01:12:35] because some of those guys had respect for my stuff, I think, you know, Larry kind of gave me the

[01:12:40] benefit of the doubt. And so, but every, every three weeks Kenny would come by my office and go,

[01:12:47] yeah, you know what, do you think, what do you think about pinball? And I said, I love to try my

[01:12:52] hand at pinball, I can't even do it. Yeah, you know, here's what I want you to do. It's like 20%

[01:12:56] of your time should be spent on a pinball. And that's, you know, which is like the most ridiculous thing

[01:13:01] on the planet, right? I mean, 20% of my time spent on a pinball. How do you do that? So, I would do,

[01:13:08] you know, I'd start thinking about a pinball or something. And then, and then next three weeks

[01:13:11] to go by and, and there'd be, you know, came with my, could you spend 40% of your time?

[01:13:17] Sure, he's the pinball. Finally one day he came in and he goes, okay, there's a whole production

[01:13:23] schedule. Could you do a pinball? Sure, sure, sure. I'd love to do a pinball. So, I brought in a guy

[01:13:33] who was my, my, you know, mechanical engineer midway, young guy named Tom Pipera, who went on to

[01:13:42] do Tactical Canyon as a designer. And Tom and I had been working together for years. He's great,

[01:13:49] he, you know, classically trained mechanical engineer, you know, really has, has made me look

[01:13:57] like a hero for years and made all my, you know, made all of my, my dream, you know, blue sky bullshit,

[01:14:06] a real and a lot of it and taught me a lot in the process, I think. So he's a good friend of mine.

[01:14:12] And I said, you know, can you say what do you need? And I said, why do I need this guy? He's

[01:14:15] going to be my project engineer. And the hired guy named Tom Uben, who was my software engineer.

[01:14:23] And we went off and running and then that first day, our first game was Corvette. And then the

[01:14:27] company was very focused on licensing. And so, and did you do Corvette because you were a Corvette

[01:14:37] fan or just because the license was available? I did Corvette because I was a huge Corvette fan. And I

[01:14:42] knew the, I knew the, the demographic. I knew the guys that bought the Corvettes and Corvettes are

[01:14:50] a way of life with some people. You know the Corvette hobby. It's very similar to the Harley

[01:14:59] hobby in that some of these guys have died in the wool. You know, they've got, you know, I know a guy

[01:15:07] up north that has a, you know, 5,000 square foot garage, basically, which is, you know, it's a shrine

[01:15:13] to Corvette and everything Corvette. And so my, my thought at the time, the, you know, the pinball,

[01:15:21] there was already conversations at the pinball market with Saust and my thought was, hey, what if we

[01:15:25] could put a Corvette in every dealership in the dealership waiting room? You could stick a Corvette

[01:15:32] pinball. And I pushed hard to, to do that. The very first obstacle in doing Corvette, by the way,

[01:15:40] is I went to see Roger Schrock was running license in department. Roger said to me, I said,

[01:15:44] Roger, I've got it. I figured it out. I know exactly what I want to do. And it's perfect because

[01:15:50] I'm, I'm a huge Corvette nut and I know cars. I'm way into cars and I want to do this. And I'm

[01:15:55] going to have a race trial. I'm going to have a big engine, you know, shake and have the ball and

[01:15:59] blah blah. And, and, and Roger says, yeah, there's just one problem with that. This Pat Waller has

[01:16:05] did John Corvette. Now I'm like, ah, don't tell me this. Yeah, Pat Waller has did John Corvette.

[01:16:12] So Ford Mustangs are still available though, George? Yes, yes. So, I, you know, I go sheepishly

[01:16:21] into Pat's office because Roger basically tells me, look, if, if you don't get clearance from Pat,

[01:16:30] you know, I mean, at this particular moment in time, your 11th man on the deal team, you know,

[01:16:34] nobody knows you, nobody gives a shit about you. You know, you're in the shark pool. There are some,

[01:16:40] you know, there's this big honk and great white shark. And then there's this, you know, there's

[01:16:46] this other big honk and great white shark. And then there's all these other, you know, tiger sharks

[01:16:50] and blue sharks and all these other sharks that live in that shark pool. And if you don't get

[01:16:54] clearance from the big boss, you can't have it. So what are they saying that you're the nurse shark

[01:16:59] or something? I was like the hell, I was like, I was a goldfish. So I went to see Pat and I said,

[01:17:07] hey, listen, I, and I'll tell you, I'm forever grateful for this because he really

[01:17:14] wielded such power that he could have just said, sorry. And he said, you know what?

[01:17:22] You're passionate about that and about this and it's good. And that's really good. And he said,

[01:17:27] it's your first game and you really need to make a splash if there's going to be a second game.

[01:17:32] So I'll make a deal with you. You can do this one, but I'm doing the next one. So I said,

[01:17:40] deal. So meaning, you know, if we ever go back and revisit Corvette and we do another Corvette,

[01:17:45] that Pat has did. So I went running back to Roger. I was besides myself. I said, Roger,

[01:17:52] Roger, I got permission. Let's do it. You know, turn the key. Roger, Roger. Okay. All right,

[01:17:57] I'll call Chevrolet. And, you know, so we got going. And that was, I mean, it was great. It was

[01:18:08] like Williams at that time was, I used to call him Street Gang. You know, basically it was seven

[01:18:14] street gangs. Every design team was a street gang. And some street gangs controlled more territory.

[01:18:20] There were also legions as amongst the street gangs. Do you have signs and stuff too and special

[01:18:27] code language? There was, you know, there was what every, I'm not using your ball popper because

[01:18:32] I've got my own. I would never touch that. I would never do things that way. So every game was like,

[01:18:37] you know, there was a, I mean, we used to say the competition is not down the street. It's

[01:18:43] across, you know, it's across the hall. You can just down the hall. That's the competition.

[01:18:49] Those guys over there, you know, yeah, whatever. You know, so they, it was a very competitive

[01:18:57] environment. And the only respect for anything pinball was what happened within those walls. And

[01:19:08] these were very competitive guys. I mean, you've heard, you've talked to these guys. You know,

[01:19:17] what was there? Now, was Corvette supposed to be designed as a wide body? Or, you know, it obviously

[01:19:23] wasn't? You lived a wide body for about three weeks. It never got off the ground. I don't,

[01:19:29] I don't even remember if we whitewooded a wide body. It began life as a wide body.

[01:19:33] Why didn't it stay that way? Only because that was everything in the house with a wide body.

[01:19:37] And then three weeks later, everything in the house was not. Somebody figured, you know,

[01:19:43] I mean, it was just, we were going into, you know, it was the beginning of the decline. I mean,

[01:19:48] I'm convinced that I was cheated by my timing. I would have had much greater success

[01:19:57] had I arrived five years earlier. I think I really told him, Mr. Boat. And it was an uphill

[01:20:03] battle. All the time I was there, you know, we lived with the specter of death, you know,

[01:20:09] right around the corner, you know, in terms of, you know, the business, you know, it was a shitty

[01:20:14] time. You know, it's like every, we couldn't have enough time replicating 1992, you know, can't do it.

[01:20:20] Can't seem to get there. My buddy Norm wants to know, since your name is Gomez, why you didn't

[01:20:28] decide in Adams family. Yeah, well, I think you'd never heard that joke before. Yeah. So, yeah,

[01:20:34] you know, it was a, it was a weird time in that, but it was, I have to say, it was, I have,

[01:20:42] I have such incredible, incredibly fond memories of that time. Um,

[01:20:48] fever cheese to say, you know, it's a fight to make these games and you've got to love the fight.

[01:20:53] And that's so true. It was, it was such a fight and it was such a struggle.

[01:20:59] Um, which was interesting because, you know, you'd think that, you know, you'd have, you have the

[01:21:05] resources, this enormous corporation and that, you know, they, everybody would be pulling in the

[01:21:10] same direction, but that's not the case. And so, um, it was, it was a struggle. There were,

[01:21:17] you know, other guys trying to knock you off and you can't get your, you know, can't get priority

[01:21:21] in the model shop and you can't get your stuff made and, and, uh, you know, it's like, I did that

[01:21:26] first, get that off your place to you. No, no, it's, you know, it's like, it was, it was, uh, it was great,

[01:21:32] but it was, uh, it wasn't so great. Quite the way you describe it though. Well, you know, you know,

[01:21:38] it's like, you can, you cannot, I have yet to run across that combination of personalities,

[01:21:46] that combination of talent, that combination. I mean, when I worked at Marvin Glass, it was

[01:21:51] incredible amount of talent in that place and, and, and, and, and in a lot of ways, Williams reminded

[01:21:56] me that, of that, uh, in that, there was a tremendous amount of talent. This is most talented guys

[01:22:01] that I've ever worked with. Um, I mean, it's, uh, it was, and it was, it was a fun, I mean, in,

[01:22:08] in spite of the, the hell, it was, it was, it was fun. I mean, it was, uh, it was competitive and it

[01:22:15] was, uh, energetic. I mean, it was so much energy in that building. You just can't imagine. I mean,

[01:22:19] it was, the engineering department there was, uh, and every day was an adventure. I mean, it was

[01:22:24] just, it was, uh, another high adventure day, Willie, you know, it was, it was because, you

[01:22:29] know, I mean, three o'clock in the afternoon Steve Richie was shut his door and play Led Zeppelin

[01:22:34] on his guitar for an hour. It is loud as, as his amplifier would go. Um, you know, and, and,

[01:22:41] you know, the shouting matches in the hallway over something that you think, you know, it's just a

[01:22:46] pinball machine. But, but the, the, the passion of these, these people brought to, to making this

[01:22:55] product, um, was, was just incredibly intense, just incredibly intense. In Corvette, the, uh, the

[01:23:05] dot matrix animations of the ladies were there was anybody's, you know, any women in anybody's

[01:23:10] lives, or is that just what your Adam Ryan came up with? One of them was, uh, one of them, actually,

[01:23:15] the girl that's looking at back at you from the play field and the girl who did the French

[01:23:21] speech was a girl that I was dating at the time. Um, uh, Laurie Hansen, his name, and, um, she was,

[01:23:31] I had, um, you know, I'd basically just gotten divorced, uh, right around the time that I started

[01:23:38] work at pinball. And then about a year later, I met her and dated her for a short time, and, and she

[01:23:44] was a flight attendant for American Airlines. Um, and she flew the international routes, and she

[01:23:50] spoke fluent French. And so when we came up with the notion of, uh, you know, kind of girls from

[01:23:56] around the world kind of thing, um, you know, we brought her in to do the French speech. And, um,

[01:24:03] so I believe it's her French speech that's in the game. And, and then, um, they, somebody in the

[01:24:08] art department, I think that the guy who's the art director at, or the art lead on the game, um,

[01:24:14] um, photographed her and used her image to, um, model the, and actually what's interesting is

[01:24:21] that Laurie's actually a brunette, but, uh, we determined that brunettes weren't going to get us

[01:24:26] as much mileage as blondes. And so there's a lot of blondes in that game. So on Corvette, was there

[01:24:33] anything that you designed into the game that couldn't, you know, got costed out or that you

[01:24:37] couldn't use that you were sorry? Yeah. Yeah. There was, uh, we had a four-speed shifter, like, uh, you

[01:24:43] know, imagine the shifter on a video game, uh, on an arcade video game, like the physical, you

[01:24:48] know, physical shifter. Right. And, um, actually, there, you know, there's half a dozen,

[01:24:53] and there's more. There's probably a dozen games on the planet that have that shifter, um,

[01:24:59] with the software to run it. Um, and we, that got costed out. Um, there, there was, uh, there was a big,

[01:25:10] you know, it didn't class like really fashion. It's kind of like, you know, nobody costed the thing,

[01:25:16] you know, when, when, when you had five months left to go in the design cycle, you know,

[01:25:21] some guy showed up, you know, four weeks before you were on the line with the thing that said,

[01:25:26] you're, uh, you're $52.35 over cost. Say what? Or no, it was better than that. You know,

[01:25:33] you're $500 over cost. What? You know, it's like, so, this is, then there's this scramble. You

[01:25:40] know, now you've got like all this shit designed in and you got, you know, and you've like taken

[01:25:45] care of all the ball traps or you think you've taken care of all the ball traps. Let me,

[01:25:49] let me correct myself before the other designers crucify me. Um, and, and, um, you know, you,

[01:25:57] you, uh, you know, there's a guy standing there with a clipboard, he says, you know, where's

[01:26:02] it coming from? And so you start looking for, you know, the first to go or the big fat targets

[01:26:08] of opportunity in a, you know, a big steel can on the side of your pinball machine with a,

[01:26:14] you know, with a four-speed shifter knob sticking out of the top of it and four switches or whatever

[01:26:19] is, is probably a pretty big target of opportunity. So, uh, that went and, uh, and then after that,

[01:26:27] I mean, you know, eventually you're down to the, uh, you know, you're taking out, you know, the,

[01:26:33] the proverbial drop targets and, uh, always the first to go. And, uh, and, uh, you know, then,

[01:26:41] it gets, then it gets stupid, you know, it gets like, you know, okay, this, this switch gate,

[01:26:45] you know, if we rewrite the logic, we, um, you know, there is a scenario where, where at the ball,

[01:26:52] you know, we sense the ball here and, uh, and then we see that switch open, so we know the ball's

[01:26:58] not there and then we use this other switch. And, you know, it's just, you go through that exercise

[01:27:05] and, you know, there's another dollar 50 at the cost of, you know, how many man hours of software

[01:27:10] engineering and, um, and thought. But they didn't care about that. They cared about just the hardware,

[01:27:17] right? Yeah, I think so. I mean, you know what, the thing is that, um, here's the great thing about

[01:27:24] Williams electronics at that time. And it was designed with King. And, uh, there's very few places

[01:27:32] on the planet where you can say that. Even in my current position, yeah, design is not King. There's,

[01:27:40] there are, there are factors in management that exert more power on the product, uh, than,

[01:27:49] at that particular moment in time and weight. I mean, it is, it is the reason that all of those

[01:27:55] magical products came to be that the fact that the passion was very, uh, you know, was almost

[01:28:03] undeluted. And so that's what, that's what will give you the Ureka product. The more you water that

[01:28:12] out of the equation, take the visionaries out, you reduce your chances to some extent, I suppose

[01:28:18] that there's an argument that says that you also increase your, um, you may increase your

[01:28:24] productivity. I mean, we were doing very stupid things. The street time mentality that I described

[01:28:29] created a lot of stupid scenarios. And, you know, why should there be five ball-poppers that

[01:28:33] basically do the same thing? You know, why should there be numerous technologies for the same

[01:28:40] event? Why should there be, you know, why isn't this code being shared? Why is this, uh, it's just a,

[01:28:47] just a bunch of stuff like that that we did that was very bad. Um, and, and also the, the spoiled

[01:28:54] children that we were, we didn't pay enough attention to manufacturing and the needs of

[01:28:58] manufacturing. We talked a good game, but, you know, it's like some guys, you know, some guys never

[01:29:03] showed up on the assembly line when their games were going first going out of it. That would not

[01:29:07] be me, by the way, but I mean, some guys, we just abandoned the game at that particular moment in

[01:29:12] time. You know, it's not my job on the designer. I said, no, it is your job. You know, it is your job,

[01:29:18] to chase it. And when shit blows up on the outside, it is your job to think about how to fix it.

[01:29:24] We were spoiled. And so with that, you get the good is you get some pretty,

[01:29:29] some pretty strong venom. You know, you get, you get like the stuff that, that, you know,

[01:29:35] is really potent. You get all the great ideas, all the great stuff. But with that, you also get,

[01:29:41] you know, like the fact that a designer can mandate something that perhaps is, you know,

[01:29:50] there's a better way to do it or a simpler way to do it, simply because he can exercise that power.

[01:29:56] So that was the good and the bad. And then when, when the company kind of started paying attention

[01:30:02] to the economies of, you know, of manufacturing, I think a little bit too late in some ways,

[01:30:09] we came to a lot of these conclusions much later. And had we had more time during the,

[01:30:15] the 12,000 event, we would have, well, we would have refined things for sure. Now,

[01:30:19] I heard Joe's interview the other day. And, you know, he said something that he did,

[01:30:23] it's very, which he's mistaken about. My vision of, of the 12,000 was not that it was a replacement

[01:30:32] for what he calls, you know, a, like from a canister, like, you know, whatever.

[01:30:37] The canister pinball is they'd like to call it. Yeah, absolutely. My vision was that this was a,

[01:30:46] another product line. And, but the reality is that that's not the way, you know,

[01:30:52] management saw it. And for whatever reason, maybe, you know, you have one shot and this is the shot.

[01:30:56] So, yeah, you mean you were a visionate, like, you'd still be building, you know,

[01:31:00] dot matrix style pinballs. And, you know, maybe you'd alternate with a pinball 2000 game.

[01:31:05] Why wouldn't you? I mean, it's like, you know, you, why, why, it's like, why wouldn't you have two

[01:31:12] differently priced product lines? And, not only that, but it would preserve,

[01:31:19] would eradicate the stigma of KEPP, which, you know, we were very afraid of with 2000.

[01:31:27] And yet, we thought we have to go in this direction because, you know, to try to hit the economics.

[01:31:32] But there's no, I mean, the notion that, you know, we were ignorant to that is just, you know,

[01:31:37] just plain wrong. I mean, we weren't ignorant to it. Well, you know, we knew what we had. And that's,

[01:31:44] and that's the, you know, that's the, the part that nobody talks about. You know, it's like,

[01:31:49] we did what we had, you know, we did with the time that we had, we did with the staff that we had,

[01:31:55] we did with the brains that we had. And, and it's like, you know, we're not, you know, for 30 seconds,

[01:32:00] do you think we're that ignorant to the business that we're in every day? I mean, really,

[01:32:06] it's, it's insulting, but, you know, let people say what they say.

[01:32:10] I thought that the whole pinball 2000, genre was just pure genius. I mean, I, you know,

[01:32:16] if you don't mind, can you kind of run through the scenario of how, that, you know, the, how

[01:32:20] hollow pin thing came up in your relationship with Pat and how you guys actually, you know,

[01:32:25] engineered this thing and then brought it in and showed it and what the reaction was by management?

[01:32:31] Yeah, um, sure. I know you told this story a thousand times, but believe me, it's worth hearing.

[01:32:38] Yep. Um, well, you know, um, combining mirrors are not a new thing. As a matter of fact,

[01:32:46] Martin Glass and Associates sold value a bunch of combining mirror ideas. Um, and Martin Glass

[01:32:51] and Associates didn't invent the combining mirror. Now mirror that combines two objects to appear

[01:32:57] such that they're in the same plane, if you will. Yeah, I have to say, did that on early gun

[01:33:01] games in the, in the 50s and 60s. You know, the old, in the 60s, you go through the

[01:33:05] pyrex of the Caribbean ride, which half a dozen of those things and that thing. So, I mean, it's not,

[01:33:10] it wasn't a new idea by any stretch. 1978, when I started working at, at, at, at Midway,

[01:33:15] and October of 1978, you know, space invaders had a, had a moon that was meant to appear

[01:33:24] like it was, and that moon was a plastic moon that was blended with the video with a mirror,

[01:33:31] with a piece of mirror. So, um, you know, it, it lets, uh, let's kind of put things in perspective.

[01:33:37] Kevin O'Connor, you know, the artist, Kevin O'Connor, during the, during the pinball 2000 project

[01:33:42] showed me a drawing that I did like way back when that essentially had the same identical I did.

[01:33:51] And he brought it to me like, he said, you remember this? And I, I actually hadn't even,

[01:33:55] I, we were already often running in, in the direction of pinball 2000, but it's like, my brain didn't

[01:33:59] even remember. I was like, I'm looking at the drawing, I was like, yeah, this is definitely my drawing.

[01:34:03] So, you put things in your mind and, and you know, you just, you store them or whatever. Um, it was,

[01:34:10] uh, you know, it was a shitty time. Well, you were given a, given a gun.

[01:34:15] Who were they pointing at? They were pointing at you guys either. Like you said, I told the

[01:34:18] streaming times that basically I was working on Monster Bash. And, uh, which I think is, is,

[01:34:23] is my best game ever, um, by the way. I think a lot of people would, uh, would agree, but

[01:34:29] a lot of people all that are Lord of the Ring fans may argue with you. Yeah, yeah. I, I guess so.

[01:34:35] I, uh, I just, I don't have that affinity for Lord. I wasn't that, uh, into the fiction of Lord.

[01:34:44] But, uh, um, I mean, and I think that, uh, you know, realistically, um, um, you know,

[01:34:51] peace gets, uh, doesn't get the credit he deserves for, uh, for Lord. Um, you know, because he is not

[01:34:57] for Keith. Lord wouldn't be what it is. Um, certainly Lord is not what it is because, uh, I stuck a ball

[01:35:03] rod in it, you know, um, there's a, there's a lot of stuff in Lord that, um, was very, very driven by,

[01:35:10] by Keith. I like Bash. I love Bash. And, um, and Bash was one of those magical, uh, moments in,

[01:35:17] in development of a product where, um, this, you know, the, you know, sun and the moon and the stars

[01:35:23] all line up, uh, in terms of the quality and enthusiasm of the people working on the product.

[01:35:30] Um, as a guy who, I'd say I've run a lot of design teams in the course of my career. I'm,

[01:35:35] I'm running a design team now. And, uh, I wish that I could, uh, with some magic, uh, recreate,

[01:35:45] uh, the chemistry that, um, uh, create, uh, incredible products, uh, consistently. Um, but, but you,

[01:35:54] but you can't. It's like saying that, uh, you know, every time up to that, you're going to hit a

[01:35:59] home run. Right. And a lot of it has to do with the, the personalities. No, the people involved on

[01:36:06] your team and the amount of effort that they're putting in and the enthusiasm for the thing that

[01:36:10] you're collectively building. And as the designer, your, your task is to unify the vision, um, and lead.

[01:36:17] You know, I've had, I've had, uh, uh, uh, mixed results. You know, when I interestingly asked

[01:36:22] myself, you know, why did this one, you know, why did I, you know, screw this one up? Why did I

[01:36:27] success with this one? Um, it's, it's a, uh, it's a formula that I'm not entirely sure, uh, you know,

[01:36:36] you can, you can recreate or, or predict. But Bash was one of those times, uh, um, you know,

[01:36:43] Lyman is, um, incredibly talented. And, uh, he was into the thing that we were building, uh,

[01:36:52] and, and, you know, Vince Ponderelli, uh, did a masterful job with the audio and he was way into

[01:36:58] it. And, you know, I think we had, you know, I, you know, you always know when you have something,

[01:37:02] because, uh, you're, you're, you're always trying to kick people off the game when you're trying to

[01:37:07] work on it. Um, uh, Chris Shipman, my mechanical engineer was, was brand new to the business. Uh,

[01:37:15] he had been, Mark Richie's mechanical engineer at Capcom when, when they were going, uh,

[01:37:20] when they were going on. And, uh, he was, uh, he had done a stint in the Peace Corps and then he,

[01:37:26] Mark was, uh, you know, with his first, you know, his first job was at Capcom with Mark. And

[01:37:31] when that whole thing blew up, I was looking for, um, Tom Cooper had said to me, I wanted design,

[01:37:36] I want to be a designer and I want to move into the front seat. And I said, okay, um, you can do so,

[01:37:42] with my blessing, I have, you know, and then I thought, I've got to replace Tom. So how am I going to

[01:37:45] do that? I called Mark and I said, do you have any good guys over there? And he goes, yeah, he said,

[01:37:49] this is the guy. So, uh, uh, Chris Shipman, uh, came on board. Um, a great guy. I think he's, uh,

[01:37:56] he's, uh, designing bikes over at, uh, uh, uh, SRAM, the, you know, the guys that make, uh, the grip shifter,

[01:38:03] um, designing bike stuff. But, uh, uh, yeah, it was Chris Shipman, Vince Ponderelia on the

[01:38:09] audio stuff, uh, uh, Kevin O'Connor on the art, uh, Lyman of course, co-designing and, and, and doing

[01:38:16] software. And, uh, um, so we, you know, we had a great time and, and three o'clock in the afternoon,

[01:38:25] there was always a crowd in Lyman's, uh, office to play the game. And, uh, you know,

[01:38:31] it's like a member of the struggle to, you know, uh, you know, screw stuff to the game around the

[01:38:37] play schedule. You know, I was, it was like, it was crazy. So, so I kind of knew we had something, um,

[01:38:44] back then. Bash, uh, it remains my favorite. Um, when I, you know, when I'm at home, I've got,

[01:38:51] you know, I've got all my games in my living room and, uh, um, and, and the ones that I, I,

[01:38:56] I also have a, a terminator, which is one of my favorites. Each masterpiece, he asked me, um,

[01:39:04] and I find that I'd play the terminator in the bash, um, more than anything.

[01:39:08] Did anything get costed out of Monster Bash? Uh, yeah. Actually, there was a ramp in front of Frankenstein

[01:39:14] that, uh, would, uh, raise up so that the ball would stride him a little bit higher. And, uh, how that,

[01:39:20] how that came to be is, it was actually driven by Chris Shipman, uh, much to Lyman's, uh, you know,

[01:39:27] this may because Lyman really liked that little ramp. He, every time, every time I talk to Lyman,

[01:39:32] he says, uh, you sure you don't have one of those ramps in your garage somewhere, because I

[01:39:36] stood up the software. And if you've got the ramp, I've got the software. And, you know, I'll be

[01:39:39] to the software if you give me the ramp. So, but, you know, Chris was playing the game one morning

[01:39:45] after having, um, uh, screwed down a new version of Frankenstein or something to play field. And,

[01:39:51] uh, he realized that the switch was being made when you hit Frank, even though for whatever reason

[01:39:56] that day the ramp was not working. And so he said, hey, we're still, you know, we're still scoring

[01:40:00] the hit and we're still hitting Frankenstein. So, you know, why don't we take out the $15 ramp?

[01:40:06] And so, uh, uh, we did. So, um, that was costed out. Yeah, great game. I mean, I own that game

[01:40:16] normal set game and they're just, I mean, you know, you like you said that's, that's a game at

[01:40:20] everybody plays. Yeah, Lyman spent easily one third of the entire software development cycle,

[01:40:27] maybe half the entire stuff development cycle, developing a damn fan of flip feature.

[01:40:35] I like every time I'm in there and I got to tell you, uh, he owes me big time because the

[01:40:41] number of, uh, sensor and array configurations that he made these groups of that white wood

[01:40:48] was never ending. Okay, now I want, uh, proximity sensor here and two IR sensors over there.

[01:40:54] Now I want a roll over switch and three proximity sensors. Now I want, and it was like, just

[01:40:59] making me crazy. I mean, Lyman, we got to build, game to build. Stop scrolling over, just like,

[01:41:04] no, no, no, it's going to be cool. It's going to be cool. You know, percentages, the thing, and, uh,

[01:41:09] that's, you know, um, yeah, but it was, it was all, it was all this fun. I like the Lyman's lamenting too.

[01:41:16] Oh, yeah, it's because, you know, he's always bitching, right? So that was my idea. I just told

[01:41:19] my, you know, I'm going to make a tune here. It's going to be right on the way with Lyman's lament,

[01:41:23] and then we're going to record you saying all that's, all that stupid shit you say. And when you

[01:41:27] get it, the game's just going to say all that stuff. He's always, you know, Lyman's, he's great to work

[01:41:34] with. You know, how he is. He pisses and mounds a lot. So when you're doing that, the pinball 2000

[01:41:44] gig and you had Playboy on the line, I mean, was that a license that you wanted or you just kind of

[01:41:50] got? Playboy was entirely, um, uh, like Sullivan. I mean, you know, it was like Sullivan wanted Playboy

[01:41:58] really badly, uh, had a vision for how the game, you know, was driven by the whole photo shoot concept.

[01:42:05] You know, he had had, uh, and they had the, the shutter sounds from a camera in the game and, uh,

[01:42:12] I think it would have been enormous. And, um, as it's in Moky's house, it was, it was in a monster.

[01:42:18] It would, it's a perfect theme for that platform. Yeah. Yeah. So it would have been a, um,

[01:42:23] tremendous theme for that platform. And so when you had, when you were at Stern then, was this,

[01:42:29] was this, was this him again, you know, driving that pony at Stern? No, you know, you know,

[01:42:34] first of all, I wasn't at Stern. I did it on the side and, and it was one of those things where,

[01:42:40] um, no, I think that, you know, I've always liked, I mean, I've always liked that license. I have

[01:42:45] fond memories of actually playing, um, Jimmy Patelice pinball, um, the Valley pinball from way back.

[01:42:50] Right. Um, and I never liked Stern's version. Um, the, I mean, the DADD East one.

[01:42:56] DADD East, that's it. Yeah. Yeah. The DADD East one, it sucked for a lot of reasons,

[01:43:01] but the main reason is it was when, uh, Hugh Hefner was getting married to one of the girls.

[01:43:07] And the whole theme of that whole Playboy machine was just, it just, it didn't hit, you know?

[01:43:13] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, uh, yeah, I don't know. Um, so, yeah, yeah, I think I think we were both equally into it.

[01:43:23] You know, I think we guessed wrong on how, um, acceptable it was going to be to just normal America.

[01:43:30] You know, and the reality is that, you know, it, it, it, mom and the kids are at the, at, you know,

[01:43:35] shopping for a pinball for the basement. Um, you know, maybe, you know, maybe DADD secretly wants to get

[01:43:42] the Playboy down there, but, you know, even with the, even with the, the targets with all the

[01:43:47] girls clothes, um, it, uh, you know, it's not going to happen. I mean, it's like, you know, there's just more,

[01:43:53] there's more appealing titles that sit that role and the reality is that that's the way that business is today.

[01:43:59] Uh, it's driven by, uh, home sales and, um, uh, Russian-Said driven, but it's certainly a big part of it is home sales.

[01:44:07] And, and so you have to kind of keep that in mind when you select the fame for the marketplace today.

[01:44:12] If I wanted to bring a Playboy machine into the basement, I could bring the ballet, you know,

[01:44:17] the 1978 version in, and I wouldn't catch any flack and nobody would really think twice about it.

[01:44:23] But if I showed up with the 2002 version of this, of the Stern Playboy, uh, you know, that would turn heads in the family.

[01:44:30] You know, sure would. Yeah. Although I think one of the greatest, uh, target concepts I've ever come up with was

[01:44:36] the notion of the three versions of the girls for each target, you know.

[01:44:40] Oh, yeah, yeah. And everybody of course wants the most risque version, even though they really can't have.

[01:44:45] Factory recommended. I always loved that line, you know, I was like, I love that, uh, all of the,

[01:44:53] the thing they printed out, you know, had the, you know, uh, sub-nuitity, full-nuitity, partial-nuitity,

[01:44:58] you know, and there was like a checkmark or something next to the thing that said, you know,

[01:45:02] full-nuitty. Factory recommended.

[01:45:06] Anyways, we never really did get to the pinball 2000 story.

[01:45:10] So, you know, I mean, it was, uh, okay, so I was working on Monster Bash, um, but the, you know,

[01:45:17] the pressure was really on. I did not believe in John Papaduch, who was credit, did a, uh,

[01:45:24] he did a lot to try to get me enthused about the version of pinball 2000, which he was working on,

[01:45:29] which was, uh, had a big 25 inch monitor in the, in the, in the back class. Um, and I'll tell you

[01:45:35] something, if you think that pinball 2000, as you know, it was expensive, that particular, um,

[01:45:42] version was, uh, you know, astronomical in cost. It was the biggest, basically the biggest

[01:45:48] dot matrix display on the planet, uh, in terms of how it was being used. And so you need to

[01:45:53] play it on the monitor, you play it on the play field. And that's the thing that bothered me. That

[01:45:58] was, you know, I was around. I was, um, I was at Midway when Valley was doing baby pack, all that stuff.

[01:46:03] I mean, I played all that stuff. I remember all that from the time. And I just, uh, I just didn't

[01:46:08] thank much of it. And, um, and so I, I didn't, I could not be convinced, uh, that that version was

[01:46:15] going to succeed. And I thought to myself, this is going to cause us to blow up for sure.

[01:46:20] So, um, Neil, an Acastro, I used to call him the demotivational speaker because, uh, his method

[01:46:27] of motivation was basically, um, you know, very depressing. And so, you know, he would come

[01:46:34] tell you that, you know, these, these boys, these, you know, these, these economics of the business.

[01:46:40] And if you, you know, you have to recognize this. You're spending too much money, you know,

[01:46:44] making enough money out there on the street. You know, this, you know, this company's a business.

[01:46:50] And, uh, business needs to succeed. And all those things are, uh,

[01:46:55] in and of themselves, all of those things are absolutely true. Um, in the way that they're presented,

[01:47:01] they can really kind of send you off the depend, you know. So, um, do you think it was something

[01:47:07] we were hit was like a subtle saying that he was kind of almost preparing you guys for the end?

[01:47:12] And, you know, subtle like, uh, uh, help me sharpen the edge of the guillotine. And, uh, let's see

[01:47:20] how your head fits right here. So, um, sorry, sorry to laugh at that, but it actually is funny.

[01:47:31] It's true, man. It's like, it's the truth. And anybody who was there will tell you that, that,

[01:47:35] that, that, that, that, if anything, that was the attitude. He was one of those figures in,

[01:47:40] in the history of our business that is never presented, uh, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a,

[01:47:49] from an objective light, uh, if you will. So, you know, he's either a bit Darth Vader or the

[01:47:56] nicest guy you know. Yes, the pinball company was kind of an albatross around the, the neck of the,

[01:48:03] uh, all the slot machine company. And yes, the, the slot machine company was the shiny new thing that,

[01:48:09] uh, was, uh, uh, showed, uh, enormous potential and, um, you know, was way sexier than this old

[01:48:19] you know, junky pinball company. There's no question about that. But the reality is that if,

[01:48:23] if we had figured out a way to make the, the pinball company, um, um, you know, really successful,

[01:48:32] why would you walk away from it? I mean, it, it, you know, it's kind of like, so from that perspective,

[01:48:38] I don't think that, I don't think that Neil was like, you know, uh, out to get us or anything like

[01:48:43] that. I think that, I think his methods, not particularly, uh, supportive, but I think that,

[01:48:50] I think in, in some ways, um, and yet, you know, you, I'd say that and at the same time, I'll tell

[01:48:55] you that, hey, you know what, he, he did do it with a shot and we did take our shot. So, uh, perhaps,

[01:49:02] perhaps he did support us. But now at, at Expo, you, when you made that emotional speech at the

[01:49:09] Expo seminars, you knew that, that the hatchet was dropping, right? I had, uh, yeah, I had, um,

[01:49:16] essentially, um, yeah, a little bird in the executive suite, um, that basically it said to me,

[01:49:24] you guys are done. And, um, and so, uh, uh, yeah, I mean, I, I knew and, uh, uh, did you tell anybody?

[01:49:35] I mean, you were telling us, but no, we weren't really listening in this, you know, I mean,

[01:49:39] I, I, I couldn't because I, I just thought, you know, I can't, it's kind of like my heart's broken,

[01:49:46] I, I can't break their hearts, too. It was hard and I, I knew, I mean, I just knew, I just, uh,

[01:49:53] I purposely stayed away the next day, kind of, I, I rolled in, you know, really late and I just

[01:50:00] couldn't even all the way there. I'm driving there going on shit, you know, I mean, what am I going to

[01:50:04] find when I get there? And, uh, um, it was a very depressing time, uh, and very, it was,

[01:50:11] it was really disheartening. I mean, we really did, um, we did a lot with what we had, um, and we could

[01:50:19] have done more, uh, had the, the thing that given more of a chance, I think, uh, it would have gotten

[01:50:25] better. We had, um, the other interesting thing that happened and nobody talks about is that the

[01:50:31] process of designing a pinball machines would also redesign in, within the context of designing

[01:50:39] some bucks 2000. So, um, and it was a process that, that needed to be redesigned because, uh,

[01:50:49] the street gangs, um, may have worked at one time, but they had sort of stopped working.

[01:50:55] And so what pinball 2000 did is it unified the engineering department. So instead of, um,

[01:51:04] seven, uh, you know, ten man brain trust, uh, you not had a 70 man brain truck because everybody

[01:51:11] was kind of thinking in the same direction. And, um, I have to tell you that professionally,

[01:51:17] it was one of the most rewarding times, um, in, in my career because, um, I led the creative on

[01:51:25] this. No decision in, in the course of that event, uh, was made without my, um, without consulting

[01:51:33] the amount of energy and talent that was brought to bear. Um, you know, you had, you had guys that,

[01:51:39] you know, you had that, that the cable guy coming up with ideas on, on how to fix his end of it.

[01:51:45] Right. And, and so, uh, it was a true team effort. Yes. And it was, and it was a, so, so in,

[01:51:53] in essence, you know, I think that what we missed out on is that, um, the process, uh,

[01:52:04] what somewhat changed, along with the product, um, I really believed that, you know, we,

[01:52:10] the system would have gotten better. The system would have evolved. Okay. I'm Henry Ford and,

[01:52:17] and, you know, here's, here's this four wheel, you know, engine powered contraption. And now,

[01:52:24] kill it. And, and guess what? You know, you, you'll never see a Mercedes SLR. You will have never

[01:52:30] gotten to that point. You know, there will never be an accident, DBS. There will never be

[01:52:36] anything that we've seen sent. There will never be a Porsche GT3. There will never be any of this stuff

[01:52:41] because you killed it with the first one. So it's kind of like, did you, you know, I mean, come on,

[01:52:49] everything else evolved. Why, why wouldn't that evolve? Have evolved. The other mistake, I think,

[01:52:55] that we made was the, the single product line thing. I think that, you know, it, this could have

[01:53:00] been the high end product line. The conventional, the conventional game could have been redesigned,

[01:53:06] to be a lot of the stuff that we cost it out of pinball 2000. I mean, we learned about the

[01:53:11] economies of manufacturing, economies of scale and manufacturing from about 2000. All of that

[01:53:16] stuff could have been applied to the conventional game. And, and that, those games would have been

[01:53:21] superior. In the pinball 2000, the wizard blocks. Was that really radically different than the

[01:53:27] Star Wars in your revenge? Revenge in Star Wars were very different. I was very upset with Star

[01:53:33] Wars, the title of truth. Star Wars to me was a step backwards in terms of interactivity.

[01:53:43] Yeah, I thought it was, it wasn't using the platform very well. It wasn't. It was, it was, but the

[01:53:49] problem is that remember, the guy who designed Star Wars was a guy who had like six months before,

[01:53:55] a month, a year before, was proposing showing you a movie on the back, or on the, or on the,

[01:54:01] on the, on what we know that the back glass and playing a game on the play field. And now,

[01:54:06] all he did was show you the movie in the play field. So, I'm, you know, I mean, I just think that

[01:54:12] I was, I was horrified every time that I saw the edges in the monitor. In the revenge, I thought to,

[01:54:21] to kind of preserve the illusion. And, and you preserve the illusion by parking a march, a

[01:54:29] march on, on a lane and hitting them with a ball and exploding them. That's how you preserve the

[01:54:34] illusion. You don't preserve the illusion by going edge to edge with a pink color and playing a

[01:54:39] movie in front of it. So, you know, I, you know, I was, I, Neil McCaster and I had a run in one time,

[01:54:48] and, and, and funny, for a long time, I didn't know what it was about. And then one day he

[01:54:52] explained it to me. And, um, we were in the Star Wars was developed in, like, as I'm sure you've

[01:55:00] heard in legendary secrecy, you know, it was like, you know, there was a very small cadre of people

[01:55:07] that, the team, and then a few people outside the team. I was allowed in that area and a few

[01:55:12] other people in management were allowed in that area, but nobody else was allowed in that area.

[01:55:16] None of the other designers, et cetera. So, um, there was a room in which Star Wars was being

[01:55:24] play tested. And I walked into the room one day. I was playing the game by myself, and while I was

[01:55:28] playing, Neil came up behind me and he started watching me play and he started praising the game

[01:55:33] and talking about how excited he was. But this was the next game that this was the, you know,

[01:55:38] this was the head out of the park and all this kind of stuff. That's why I'm telling you that

[01:55:42] regard, I mean, some, you know, everybody's got different opinions. My opinion is not that he

[01:55:47] had some, you know, draconian vision to kill this thing from the get-down. I think that he,

[01:55:52] maybe he was disappointed that we came up and we pulled a rabbit out of the head. I don't know,

[01:55:55] I mean, but I, but, but at that particular moment in time, what he was telling me was,

[01:56:01] you know, he was gushing enthusiasm for the Star Wars game and he standing behind me. And I was so,

[01:56:09] like, I was like, how can you say this? I mean, with all due respect to the guys that worked on

[01:56:14] the game, I thought it was, I didn't know what to say to them. I mean, I thought, I thought if you

[01:56:18] think this is a game, then I, you know, I don't know where you've been because this is not a game.

[01:56:25] This is like, I shoot a ball around and then you play me a movie. And, and there is no,

[01:56:33] even video games today with as cinematic as we've gotten.

[01:56:39] True gameplay is predicated on interactivity. It's not predicated on watching movies in a passive

[01:56:51] event. Playing a video game is an interactive event and playing a pinball game is an interactive

[01:56:58] event. Star Wars to me was lacking in interactivity. Right. I completely agree with you.

[01:57:03] I was just wrong. I walked out of the room and didn't say a word to him. And he thought I

[01:57:07] disrespected him. Like, you know, six months later, he said to me, you know, there was that time

[01:57:12] you dis me in there, I dis you in there. What are you talking about? And he said to me, you know,

[01:57:17] I was playing, we were playing Star Wars in that room. There was no one else in that room. You

[01:57:20] walked out with that saying word. Yeah, I walked out of that saying word. Nothing to do with you

[01:57:24] other than the fact that I couldn't believe what you were telling me. You're telling me that you

[01:57:28] thought this is the greatest thing to the slight spread. And I'm sitting there just disgusted with

[01:57:34] what the thing I'm playing. And of course, I don't have, I mean, I can, you know, I politely tell

[01:57:39] John, hey, John, you know, you can, you know, try to avoid the edges of the monitor. Can you, you know,

[01:57:46] do you really need to, you know, keep going into this movie thing, man? I mean, really, it's like,

[01:57:52] it's just, so anyway, um, well, then Wizard Blacks was probably a good thing then, right?

[01:58:00] From my perspective, it was a great thing. From my perspective, it was beginning to use the system,

[01:58:05] the way that I envisioned the system to be used, um, with a, you know, a minimum amount of edge to

[01:58:12] edge, with a concerted effort at trying, I mean, I did, you know, what you got to remember,

[01:58:18] I did the obvious with revenge. I mean, I did the obvious way. I didn't have time to do anything

[01:58:23] but the obvious. I stopped the stuff in the middle. I tried to put some stuff in the, along the

[01:58:29] sides, but there was a lot of, there was a lot of things that I wanted to experiment with that Pat

[01:58:35] probably could have had time to experiment that other designers could have, that John realistically

[01:58:39] could have had time to experiment with, but he didn't. And so, from that perspective, I think that,

[01:58:46] um, Wizard Blacks was probably a step in the right direction. Yes, I think so. I think that,

[01:58:52] that the notion, you know, it's kind of like, um, you got to look past the trip. You know,

[01:58:58] it's kind of like, you got to, you have to begin to deal with these things. When I play my revenge,

[01:59:03] I stop thinking about the Super Mirror. I stop thinking about the, I just play the game. And people,

[01:59:08] people come over and they watch, and they play the game, they love the game. They love the

[01:59:11] humor and, and the, you know, the diss and that. And pretty soon you're into it, and you've forgotten

[01:59:16] all about the hologram effect, whatever you want to call it, combining it as a whole thing. You

[01:59:20] just want to forget about it. It's like, you know, that's what's supposed to happen. What's

[01:59:24] supposed to happen is you're supposed to play the game. The game is supposed to entertain you. I had

[01:59:28] somebody over here the other day they were talking about, you know, we're playing the, the, the wave

[01:59:33] with the Bill Clinton speech, you know, and, you know, they were just, they were just cracking up.

[01:59:37] Public figure back then, you know, we took all the shots, we took everybody else that, with taking

[01:59:42] them, you know, great fun. Nobody had any issue with, with taking liberties at that. No, no,

[01:59:47] that's been done a lot. I guess that public figure is an all you can get away with it. Right.

[01:59:53] Yeah, no, I think revenge was amazing. I own a revenge and it's, and when new people come over,

[01:59:58] I like to show them that game because I'd like to see the reaction, you know, it's, it's unbelievable.

[02:00:04] But it's, I think, I think the system would have evolved. I think that, you know, I think that,

[02:00:12] I think the system would have evolved. I think that the magic would have been to keep two product

[02:00:16] lines. I think that the cost reduction and efficiency and, and, and reliability, things that were

[02:00:25] designed into pinball 2000 would have made their way. Certainly anything in the, in the, in the,

[02:00:31] in the bottom of the game, anything in the, in the, in the, you know, in the main cabinet would

[02:00:37] have made its way into the conventional line, the mechanical action line, if you will. And so,

[02:00:47] and I think there was a lot of stuff there. No, I think there was a lot of stuff there.

[02:00:50] Well, now, I heard that there was a, like, after the, the Wizard blocks in the Playboy that there

[02:00:56] was like a fifth game that was kind of like a haunted mansion type game. Is that true? Yeah.

[02:01:01] Yeah, there was some conversation about that. I can't remember was that Pete Petrowski or

[02:01:06] anyone whose group that was. That would have been a great theme. Yeah, Star Wars. I mean, you know,

[02:01:13] you got the big, who in a license? And you got, you know, you got the, you know, you got this,

[02:01:20] you know, super pin mom machine. And now, you don't go out and sell, you know, 15,000 of these things.

[02:01:29] And so, you know, that's, that's a kick this in the ass, really. I mean, that's, that's what,

[02:01:36] that's what did it. But I think we sold like 7,400. Almost 6,900 revanges, which is pretty strong

[02:01:43] run. All right. There you go. Yeah. And for, and that's such a strong run to kind of put it in

[02:01:47] perspective to go back to your Corvette in 1994. You sold 5,000 of those. And here you have

[02:01:55] something that's, you know, years and years later when the economics of pinball are way different.

[02:02:00] And you outsell the game back from 94, which is really interesting. You got to be proud. I mean,

[02:02:05] almost 7,000 games is an incredible number of games. I mean, since then, nobody sold that many games.

[02:02:12] That's true. You know, Gary, I love Gary. And I, and I love doing stuff for him. It's,

[02:02:19] it's a lot of fun. It's, it's really become, it's become my, my Sunday afternoon hobby. It's kind

[02:02:25] of like, you know, going to the garage and tinker with a pin mom machine kind of thing. And, and, but I,

[02:02:32] I think he stands to break that record the way that he builds games because, you know, he just

[02:02:37] keeps revisiting a title. The success of, you know, you mentioned Lord of the Rings, right? Which is my,

[02:02:43] my most successful, uh, Stern product. And, and I think it's maybe their more, their most successful game.

[02:02:49] I'm not entirely sure. Um, and so, uh, you know, it wasn't made in one run. It was made in, you know,

[02:02:57] and continues to be made. So it's kind of made on demand and, and if you will, um, sopranos, you know,

[02:03:03] it's like, you know, at tonight we will all watch the final episode of sopranos. And, uh, you know,

[02:03:09] I, I guarantee you that Gary is selling sopranos. Um, and so, um, you know, he may break any of those

[02:03:19] numbers with his methodology, which is very, very, um, very interesting methodology, which Williams,

[02:03:26] um, really resisted the notion of going back and tooling up an assembly line and doing it again.

[02:03:32] And we were always told that, you know, it costs too much money to do it, et cetera, et cetera. But, um,

[02:03:37] um, yeah, for Gary, it works. It sure does. It sure does. Um, obviously, you know, Gary's not, uh,

[02:03:47] the manufacturing behemoth that, uh, that, that, that Willie was from a business perspective,

[02:03:52] that, the beauty of having companies with, uh, very diverse product in your portfolio is that

[02:04:01] not all of, not every business, um, will, you know, consistently be successful. And so you can draw,

[02:04:08] if you can draw on, um, you know, the success of one business, one another business is soft,

[02:04:15] that I think that it makes sense. But you have to be committed to the businesses that you're in.

[02:04:20] You know, it's, it's like, um, I, you know, I could never understand when we got, when we had,

[02:04:25] when the GE management boys took over Bali in the early 80s, um, I mean, the, the, the notion of

[02:04:33] selling off Aladdin's castle and selling off distribution, when you basically had it, you know,

[02:04:40] coming and going on all ends, I mean, if you walked into a, when Atari had a, a hit, an asteroid,

[02:04:47] for example, um, Bali was profiting because Bali was operating the game and they were distributing

[02:04:54] the game. So it's kind of like, yeah, it's nice when the Bali product hits the home run,

[02:04:58] it's nice when you have a Pac-Man, or it's nice when you have a Tron. But what, what about when

[02:05:02] you don't? Well, guess what? Sega's got some, you know, Sega's got a run or, or say, you know,

[02:05:07] or Atari's got a missile command and guess what? You're, you're distributing and you're operating. So

[02:05:13] like, you know, who, who would, who would shoot this golden goose? Right? I mean, it's like, what,

[02:05:19] kind of idiotious use that? So, and, and, and in Willie's case, I think, so you got this video game

[02:05:28] company and the video game company has every capacity to grow into the business that it is, you know,

[02:05:33] that, that, that the home business that is in today and you have a slot machine company,

[02:05:39] it's allegedly slot machine company and you have a pay-moar company. So it's kind of like,

[02:05:43] Nursava. I mean, you know, yeah, shut this big it down to a trickle when a particular business is

[02:05:50] not necessarily explosive, but at the same time, don't, don't drop it off. It's kind of like,

[02:05:58] oh yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's, let's get rid of it, move on. Well, to me that says, you

[02:06:02] don't want to be in the business. You want to be in a different business. Right? I mean, it's,

[02:06:07] it's kind of like, but if you, you know, I don't know, you want to be a coin man, then, you know,

[02:06:13] stay in the coin business. That's great. But what's wrong with when your coin business is stocked,

[02:06:17] your slot business is strong or, or, you know, got to fit your, your video game business is big.

[02:06:25] But there's other factors driving that, right? I mean, there was a bunch of money made when the

[02:06:28] thing, when the video game company was spun off and that's what really was about. It wasn't,

[02:06:33] well, it was short, short term goals outweighed long term. Yeah, it wasn't about wanting to be

[02:06:39] in the business. It was about, you know, how much money can we make with it? Because we're in this,

[02:06:42] you know, when the, in the business of making a profit today and, and fuck everything else.

[02:06:47] Now, when you're building games for Stern, you're kind of doing this on the side because you

[02:06:51] still work for Midway, right? Correct. So like, when you did water the rings, was there, you know,

[02:06:58] compared to working for Willie as you put it, is, I mean, did they cost you out of a lot of

[02:07:04] things in order of the rings that you wanted in the game? Well, you know, at Stern, things are way

[02:07:10] tighter than they were at Willie. I mean, in terms of, they pay, they have to, they're small shop,

[02:07:17] they have to pay close attention to margins. I mean, their margins are pretty tight, you know? And so,

[02:07:23] you know, Gary and those guys, man, you know, they earn every dollar. I mean, every dollar,

[02:07:30] every dollar is hard fought. There's no, you know, nobody's getting rich over there. And, and,

[02:07:36] there's, there is, it, they have to pay attention. They don't, they don't have the luxury

[02:07:44] to go off and, and just, and just play. They have to be, they have to consciously design their

[02:07:50] games. You know, when I design a game for them, because, because of the nature of the fact that,

[02:07:55] you know, I'm not there every day, and I'm not working on this thing day and night every night,

[02:07:59] but I, it's basically, it's drawing in broad strokes. You know, it's, it's kind of like, there's

[02:08:06] a bunch of guys inside that, that really finish my stuff that really take it to the next level

[02:08:14] in terms of, you know, developing it, getting it ready for production, et cetera. And so,

[02:08:20] I don't have the time to, you know, to, to devote to it. The way I would, you know, the way I would

[02:08:28] like if that's all I, if that's, if that was all I was doing, I would, they would, you know,

[02:08:32] it would get a lot more attention. I think that, those products are a lot of fun to do, because

[02:08:42] they are, you know, they are done in a, sort of a low pressure kind of way. And so, from that,

[02:08:49] from that standpoint, they're, you know, they're very hobby-like for me, and I love them. I mean,

[02:08:54] I think it's, I think it's a lot of fun. There's a lot of really talented people that support me

[02:09:00] on the inside and, and take the stuff and make it producible and do a lot of things that I would

[02:09:07] otherwise have to do, if I was, you know, like when I was at Willis. So, you're giving them more,

[02:09:14] like raw ideas, and they're the ones that are actually refining it more so? They're doing a lot of,

[02:09:20] they're doing all of the engineering. They're doing, you know, they, you know, they still get,

[02:09:26] they get playfields from me. I mean, they are my playfields. And, and I definitely tinker with

[02:09:33] them, but there's, there's a whole crew of engineers that jump on that thing when it gets inside.

[02:09:41] Now, back to the pinball 2000 thing. When you were originally developing that,

[02:09:47] how, why did you bring Pat Lawler in on this? Why wasn't this just, you know, a solo thing?

[02:09:53] Well, Pat and I, the entire notion to go in that direction was spurred by a conversation

[02:10:01] that him and I had. So, you know, we had been called in this meeting as you've heard countless times,

[02:10:09] and we had been told basically, you know, this is the writing on the wall. And him and I

[02:10:13] walked out of there, and he was very concerned. He said, you know, he said, this, this may never get

[02:10:19] to fruition. You're talking about the Papaduke model. Yeah, because the problem with the

[02:10:24] Papaduke approach was that there was, there was a dissension in the ranks. All of engineering

[02:10:31] was not firmly in that camp. And that's what, in the Castro noticed. And that's what

[02:10:39] in the Castro came after. That, that meeting was, was basically about, you know, get, get with

[02:10:45] the program or get the hell out. And, and, and, you know, almost his word. I don't remember exactly,

[02:10:50] but it was like, okay, you guys don't, you know, you know what? You know, have a better idea.

[02:10:56] So, you know, that, that alone, you know, with guys like us, the head of phone is like, okay,

[02:11:04] you're too down to gauntlet. I don't have a better idea. I got, I got a, I got a better idea.

[02:11:08] I want to show you my better idea. How long did it take you to come up with a better idea?

[02:11:13] Um, well, you know, honestly, the, the, you know, we mentioned it in the conversation

[02:11:21] that we immediately had. We, we started talking about, right away, you know, we, you know,

[02:11:27] Papad was very concerned that this was never going to make it to, to, he said, you know, what, this,

[02:11:32] this thing is going to be exposed for, you know, it's going to be the Emperor's new clothes. And,

[02:11:37] and, and then they're going to pull the plug at that point. It's never going to see the light of day.

[02:11:41] And, um, so in that conversation, we started talking about, you know, remember in the 80s,

[02:11:47] when we were fooling around with all those mirrors and stuff, you know, what if we could, you know,

[02:11:52] revisit some of those ideas and then try to get the targets around the place here. So, I mean, the,

[02:11:57] the concept was not, wasn't like, we had to think about what we were going to do. We had to think

[02:12:02] about how we were going to do it. But, but, um, we kind of knew what we were going to do. Um, and so

[02:12:08] then, you know, he said, well, you know, you're working on monster batch. And then I, I'm not

[02:12:14] doing, I don't even, I don't even remember what he was working on. But, uh, he said, we're never

[02:12:19] going to do this here. The politics are just, um, you know, going to prevent us from doing it here.

[02:12:25] So he said, I've got a full shop in my house out in Murengo. And, and, you know, we should just

[02:12:31] go out there and just, you know, don't even tell people we're doing this thing. We should just

[02:12:35] fucking do it and bring it in. So I think the only guy that we told, I think tomorrow, knew,

[02:12:39] obviously we were doing it. And, um, so we went out there and, and we did it. It was, uh, I

[02:12:46] took us, I don't know what it was a month or, you know, it seemed like it was about a month and a half

[02:12:50] or I don't remember the time frame, but I would drive out there after work. And, uh, Patricia,

[02:12:58] that past wife would make a thinner and we'd go into the, we'd go into the shop and, and make stuff.

[02:13:03] And, um, I had a bunch of, uh, Amiga art that I had done for games back in the, um, in the days when

[02:13:12] I was pitching stuff. And I had, um, I had pitched the robot game and had these big huge robots. They

[02:13:17] were like, uh, they, they almost filled a 19 inch screen in terms of height. And, um, uh, so we hooked

[02:13:24] up my Amiga, um, you know, to, uh, to a 19 inch monitor and, um, and, and we went out to the store

[02:13:34] and bought some, uh, uh, limo tint, you know, like the stuff they used to tint, uh, uh, windows and limos.

[02:13:41] And we bought the, like, the lightest grade that they had. And, um, we had, Pat had an old cabinet

[02:13:50] there and we built a top box that a plywood puts the tall thing together. I had made, um, the,

[02:13:55] the thing that you've seen at Expo that I had made a little tabletop mockup, uh, in foam core when

[02:14:00] I was using a, uh, a ball thing that slide, a 35 millimeter slide from Johnny Nomonik that I had

[02:14:07] laying around like, uh, from the movie guys that they, they'd given me a bunch of, they'd given me

[02:14:11] a bunch of 35 millimeter slides when I was working on the game. And, um, um, I happen to have one

[02:14:17] sitting around in my office and I, and I made this little mockup and I took the slide and put it

[02:14:21] in the place of the monitor and, and I took a flashlight and chained it in from above and, um,

[02:14:27] and sort of proved that, oh yeah, you know, if you, if you met with this angle, you get this resultant

[02:14:32] angle on the image and, uh, and so, um, uh, that was the mockup for the big mockup that we made.

[02:14:41] And, and I always struggled, you know, we had, uh, uh, we called it monitor weightlifting, you know,

[02:14:48] because we were picked this thing up and then, uh, you know, we were jacked around with the angle

[02:14:52] of the, the monitor and, and then, you know, like the other guy would, like one guy's holding it up

[02:14:57] and the other guy's marking it with a pencil and, you know, my amiga, uh, took a shit in the middle

[02:15:03] of the whole thing and we had it like, I had the, all these goofy old, um, my head deluxe tank on,

[02:15:09] on, on amiga and for a while there, it looked like I was going to have to reproduce, uh,

[02:15:14] recreate the art because we had lost all the stuff and, you know, I had, one of the stupid, uh,

[02:15:20] amiga guru meditation errors and everything went south and, uh, I had, you know, I hadn't touched

[02:15:26] this computer in, in ten years or something and, and so it's had all these, and it held these

[02:15:31] quirky features. I mean, you know, we, we complained about computers today. I mean, it's like, we,

[02:15:37] we've forgotten what computers back then were. I mean, like, and then we finally, finally managed

[02:15:42] to get it, get it back up and, and running and, um, and then by then, um, I think it was, the

[02:15:50] pressure was mounting at willy and, and, it was a hell time for me because I was working on BASH and,

[02:15:58] you know, Lyman just wouldn't hear of anything but, you know, a hundred percent effort on the

[02:16:03] game. So I had to give a hundred percent to BASH and then fit this in on top of it and, and,

[02:16:08] and it wasn't, it wasn't pretty for me. It was like I, I felt like I had three jobs and it's, uh,

[02:16:14] it was making me crazy. Um, I, uh, the, the drive, uh, Pat lives way out in, in the sticks relative to,

[02:16:24] the big city. The drive was my, uh, my decompression time, really. I would do, and I, the other thing I

[02:16:31] started doing was, uh, which was really jacking with my schedule was, um, my engineer, uh, Chris,

[02:16:38] Chris Shipman, the guy that I mentioned earlier, uh, he would have to come in and work kind of around

[02:16:44] Lyman's hours because, you know, we had to optimize Lyman's time on the machine. And so if the

[02:16:49] machine was down for two hours while we jacked around, screwing mechanisms to the play field or whatever,

[02:16:55] doing our testing or, you know, shooting it or whatever, uh, then it was, it was two hours of

[02:17:00] Lyman couldn't mess with it. And it was only one white wood who would sit in Lyman's office and

[02:17:04] it was like the master white wood with all the crap on it. And, um, so Shipman used to come in

[02:17:10] like five in the morning and work until 10. Uh, let me, he worked a full day, but, but at 10 o'clock,

[02:17:15] he was back on his computer and off the play field because Lyman would come in at 10 and start working

[02:17:20] on the game. So, so I started keeping Shipman hours to get my stuff done. And so, so the whole thing was,

[02:17:27] was making me crazy because I, you know, I'd get up at five and, and go into work and, uh, and then

[02:17:35] at six o'clock when, you know, Lyman would politely let me leave. And, uh, uh, and I'd jump in,

[02:17:43] in my M3 and blast out the pads and, and, and, and that was my decompression time just sitting in

[02:17:49] the seat and, and, and, and listening to music and thinking about life until I got out there. And

[02:17:53] then I got out there and I'd work with Pat until 11 o'clock at night and then drive the,

[02:17:59] the Zillion miles home. So it, it, it sucked. It was not pretty. Tomorrow started feeling that, I think

[02:18:04] he, he got win that, you know, things really were going to accelerate and they were really going to

[02:18:11] do an evaluation pass on pinball 2000 or something. I don't know what, but on, on the

[02:18:15] POP-A-DOO version, which was ongoing. And he started pressing us and he basically, he called us

[02:18:19] one day and he said, I don't know where you are, but, uh, you need to get this thing in here now.

[02:18:24] And so, uh, uh, you know, we did that. Uh, everybody was kind of blown away and I felt bad for

[02:18:30] John because, you know, I kind of pulled a rug out from under him, but I, I, um, I really, you

[02:18:36] know, I had to do what I believed in and, and, and, uh, pinball 2000 as I, you know, it was what I

[02:18:43] believed in. When you introduced pinball 2000 and POP-A-DOOx saw it for the first time. What was his

[02:18:49] reaction? And, or, were you there to see his reaction? Uh, I know he was disappointed. I think that, um,

[02:18:56] you know, he worked, you know, he, I, you know, I liked John a lot and he worked really hard

[02:19:02] on what he was doing. I mean, he really poured himself into it. It's, it's not for any lack of trying

[02:19:09] that, that, um, you know, his idea didn't get picked, but yeah, there was, you know, I mean, there

[02:19:15] was a little bit of bad blood there for a little bit. Um, John's a professional and, and I think that,

[02:19:21] you know, he handled it very well. I think with, given the, the volatility of the guys in that

[02:19:27] engineering department, there's some other guys that would have been less grateful, um, to me had,

[02:19:33] had they been in issues. So, um, yeah, there was some, uh, definitely, I don't think he was real

[02:19:41] pleased with it. The guy, you know, came up to me shortly after that and said, you know what?

[02:19:47] You're right. This is way, uh, this is way cooler. We've changed, uh, you know, we've changed the

[02:19:53] future of pinball and, um, and he jumped on the bandwagon and did, did his thing. You know, from

[02:19:59] my background, my training, I should be the guy that's like all worried about the aesthetics all

[02:20:02] the time. You know, that's what industrial designers do. It's part of, part of the job that industrial

[02:20:07] designers is responsible for. Um, a, John, if you characterize all the designers in, in, in, in,

[02:20:13] in Finbal, uh, John is probably the guy who is most concerned about aesthetics and whose, whose work

[02:20:19] was most driven by aesthetics. Um, you know, my stuff, you know, I'm very, very concerned about

[02:20:25] aesthetics. Um, my stuff, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm very practical. I mean, my stuff has to work and, and,

[02:20:31] and do all kinds of things first.

[02:20:33] And then I worry about how I'm going to optimize aesthetics.

[02:20:38] Pat is very much, I think, he's the movie director amongst us.

[02:20:42] He's the guy that approaches it from the perspective

[02:20:46] of the complete entertainment experience kind of thing.

[02:20:50] He's the intensity and kind of he is the guy

[02:20:56] who's got his finger on fun.

[02:20:58] I mean his stuff is usually outrageously fun.

[02:21:01] Have you seen his Spider-Man?

[02:21:02] I saw very early on a few months ago, I was out at the factory

[02:21:09] and those guys let me shoot it.

[02:21:11] And it was a lot of fun then.

[02:21:12] And it was just a very, very crude whitewood when I saw it.

[02:21:17] And I think he actually had some really cool,

[02:21:21] really cool goblin toy that I think he had to cost

[02:21:23] to do some more I remember.

[02:21:26] But I love his stuff.

[02:21:30] His stuff is the stuff that I like to play more

[02:21:35] than anybody else's stuff.

[02:21:38] And I think all of the designers have,

[02:21:40] I mean, they all have a signature.

[02:21:43] They all have a thing they can turn themselves with.

[02:21:46] I think John starts with the aesthetics.

[02:21:51] I think that Steve is all about fun.

[02:21:55] And he's made some outrageously fun stuff.

[02:21:58] I enjoy, to this day, the game that I come home late at night

[02:22:05] and I light up the terminator and play that thing.

[02:22:08] And it's like I cannot walk away.

[02:22:10] And it's like it keeps kicking my ass and I keep coming back

[02:22:13] to it.

[02:22:14] And I can't walk away until I've lit it up.

[02:22:16] It's very addictive.

[02:22:19] He makes a addictive stuff.

[02:22:20] I obviously never saw the Papaduke one.

[02:22:22] But just the scenario as you played it,

[02:22:25] and if you want to measure history in the caveman,

[02:22:30] the godly caveman and the baby pacman scenarios,

[02:22:33] they didn't really play out so well.

[02:22:37] So he had that going against him.

[02:22:40] Yeah.

[02:22:41] I think every designer has a vision of what he wants.

[02:22:47] And what he wanted in about 2000 was just not something I like.

[02:22:54] But he certainly put his heart and soul in it

[02:22:59] just as much as I put my heart and soul into the thing

[02:23:02] that I do that I did.

[02:23:06] And that's been the nature of designing games forever.

[02:23:10] I mean, not everybody likes everybody's stuff.

[02:23:13] And so when you brought the hollow pin in there,

[02:23:22] and you just, who did you show it to first?

[02:23:25] And the second one, I've heard a guy talk about me.

[02:23:28] I didn't why I wasn't there for the first meeting

[02:23:30] was that the management meeting,

[02:23:31] giving the reaction of the different people and who saw it?

[02:23:36] I think what was cool about that event

[02:23:39] was that I saw the sparkle in people's eye.

[02:23:46] I saw, I saw in the cast who get excited about the thing.

[02:23:51] So I don't know, contrary to what people say,

[02:23:54] I didn't perceive that he said oh shit.

[02:23:58] Maybe he said oh shit after he thought it through, I don't know.

[02:24:03] But when we brought them in, Kenny and Neil

[02:24:06] and Jimmy Tatla and all those guys, everybody was like whoa,

[02:24:12] this is it.

[02:24:14] And so Pat and I, Pat had a red shirt, it was a shroud.

[02:24:22] So some sort.

[02:24:23] And we put this thing in the back of Pat's truck

[02:24:26] and brought it in and got it out there and set it all up.

[02:24:29] And actually it was in a room across the street

[02:24:32] from Willy, all around the midway side,

[02:24:35] in a building that I work in now.

[02:24:38] And we set the thing up in this room and covered it.

[02:24:45] The room that we set it up in, it was next to Kenny

[02:24:48] for the business office, once the company split off.

[02:24:52] And we set it up in there with this red, big red cover

[02:24:57] on it and then Pete, you know, and then, you know,

[02:25:01] you know, you've had and I've been around a while.

[02:25:03] And we learned presentations from some of the masters.

[02:25:07] Like I was talking about Dave Nutting, you know,

[02:25:10] playing the theme from 2001, bringing you

[02:25:12] into a dark room and sitting you down on a, you know,

[02:25:15] in a $1,000 recarrow seat out of his Ferrari

[02:25:20] and telling you a story before you began to play the game.

[02:25:25] And you know, you have to think back.

[02:25:26] And that was 1977.

[02:25:28] So Pat and I both learned from Dave, you know,

[02:25:31] it's the presentations of the deal.

[02:25:33] So we did a big presentation, you know, big, big,

[02:25:37] you know, this is what it is.

[02:25:38] And it's really going to see, you know, notice this,

[02:25:41] notice that.

[02:25:43] Who was in that initial meeting?

[02:25:46] Basically, you know, executive management,

[02:25:48] senior management.

[02:25:49] So Papa Duke and the rest of the teams weren't there yet?

[02:25:52] No, no, no.

[02:25:53] And then what happened is as soon as, you know,

[02:25:56] it was like DeMar and Pat and Kenny and Neil,

[02:26:04] I can't remember who else, but basically a fairly small crew

[02:26:07] and then they brought in.

[02:26:09] And then, you know, people started picking up a phone

[02:26:13] and calling people, you know, I want you know,

[02:26:15] come over here and some people started trickling in

[02:26:17] and we started doing, at the end of the day,

[02:26:19] we had done the presentation about 50 times.

[02:26:22] But yeah, it was something.

[02:26:26] Well, and then that was a complete ship in Gears.

[02:26:30] And, no, there was some, we moved pretty quickly.

[02:26:38] I mean, you know, in a very short period of time,

[02:26:41] we had decided on a theme, we had decided on a structure.

[02:26:47] The entire, you know, engineering team had kind of been,

[02:26:51] it was, I mean, DeMar, did a, DeMar and Pat,

[02:26:54] did just an incredible effort at kind of deploying resources

[02:27:00] and focusing all the different talents into the areas

[02:27:05] that they need to be focused into.

[02:27:09] Did now, the decision to use a PC, you know,

[02:27:14] a computer instead of a Williams generated hardware system.

[02:27:17] Did you agree with that decision?

[02:27:21] I did conceptually because what the vision was,

[02:27:24] was that the business was constantly evolving hardware sets.

[02:27:29] They were doing the R&D for us.

[02:27:32] So imagine that as graphics cards progress,

[02:27:35] we will be able to insert graphics cards into this platform

[02:27:39] and as computing power progresses,

[02:27:42] you know, different CPUs will go into it.

[02:27:44] And so from that perspective, it did see the next sense.

[02:27:49] It seemed like the most modular solution.

[02:27:54] It's a readily available solution.

[02:27:56] Funny to hear, I forget, I think it was the Joey interview

[02:27:59] where he says, you know, I can't believe a platform

[02:28:02] that's instantly obsolete it.

[02:28:04] Well, it's routinely obsolete by new stuff

[02:28:07] that fits into the same form factor.

[02:28:08] So, I don't know how it is that, you know,

[02:28:11] they think, yes, this specific chip is obsolete it.

[02:28:15] And this specific graphics card is obsolete it.

[02:28:18] But the platform is inherently modular.

[02:28:20] So, you know, that was the reason it was selected.

[02:28:26] It was like, yeah, the PC business is gonna do the R&D

[02:28:29] for us on our hardware.

[02:28:31] And not only that, it's done.

[02:28:33] It we start tomorrow.

[02:28:36] So, I mean, with the effort to program,

[02:28:38] now it was a challenge, mind you,

[02:28:40] because the operating system was written by Tom Uban,

[02:28:43] was going on, the creation of the operating system

[02:28:47] was going on concurrently with creation of the game.

[02:28:49] So, an app pose, oh, I'm kind of into problems,

[02:28:53] because a lot of the guys that were programming,

[02:28:58] like any environment, you're gonna have varying skill levels

[02:29:02] in the people that are manipulating your technology.

[02:29:06] The varying skill levels amongst all of the programming staff

[02:29:11] were, became a bigger killing heel

[02:29:15] in terms of some guys just didn't take to,

[02:29:19] they were used to stomping around in a software environment

[02:29:23] that was somewhat harmless or easy to recover from.

[02:29:29] And now we moved into a high level language

[02:29:32] and a new area that, a new operating system

[02:29:37] and with compilers that ran in a different way.

[02:29:41] And just, I mean, it was truly challenging for those guys.

[02:29:46] And when we went to London to premiere the thing,

[02:29:50] we were so far from stable, it wasn't even funny.

[02:29:53] I mean, I'm glad that the things survived the show,

[02:30:00] but they were pretty fluey.

[02:30:04] Did, no, there's gonna be a documentary

[02:30:07] that's gonna come out on pinball 2000

[02:30:09] that you were interviewed for years ago actually.

[02:30:13] It was that, is there account of that pinball 2000 scenario

[02:30:17] very accurate?

[02:30:20] Pretty much, there's a couple of things I take issue with,

[02:30:22] but pretty much, you interview 20 people

[02:30:26] about an event and you're gonna get 20 opinions.

[02:30:29] And so, I think for the most part, he's on the money.

[02:30:36] Now the other thing in pinball 2000,

[02:30:38] there's a big thing about Joe Dylan

[02:30:39] in the event from Mars.

[02:30:41] Can you tell me about that?

[02:30:44] Well, Joe passed away.

[02:30:46] Either, you know, Joe is a legendary Williams salesman

[02:30:52] and Joe passed away during that time.

[02:30:54] So it's just a tribute to Joe.

[02:30:59] Joe is, you know, he was,

[02:31:02] when I came up into business, when I was starting out,

[02:31:04] the ultimate compliment somebody could pay you

[02:31:06] with to tell you that you were a coin man.

[02:31:08] And I guess I will say that, Joe was most definitely

[02:31:13] a coin man.

[02:31:16] Now do you still have the original hollow pin

[02:31:19] that you used to demonstrate to management?

[02:31:23] I do not.

[02:31:25] I don't know what happened to that thing.

[02:31:26] I think it either got, what happened to that thing?

[02:31:31] The pad has it or it got auctioned off or,

[02:31:33] I might have gotten, might have gotten auctioned off.

[02:31:35] I'm not sure.

[02:31:39] Yeah, not certain, not certain what happened to it.

[02:31:41] I mean, we've all seen it.

[02:31:42] It somehow, I don't even remember how,

[02:31:45] but somehow it shows up in that documentary

[02:31:47] that you referred to.

[02:31:51] And there's images of us working on it.

[02:31:55] And I'm trying to think, I think that was after we had

[02:31:58] brought it inside in my office, somebody

[02:32:03] with more vision than us saying, I have to document this.

[02:32:09] And so there's an image of Pat and I fooling around with it

[02:32:12] in my office at Willie after we had brought it in.

[02:32:17] Now do you think that, like say that Stern was going to take

[02:32:20] a sharp right turn and they could get around it

[02:32:24] and they could actually put out a pinball 2000 like platform?

[02:32:28] Do you think that would work again today?

[02:32:30] No.

[02:32:32] Why?

[02:32:34] The pinball market has continued to compress.

[02:32:41] Since that time, in some ways, unabated.

[02:32:45] I mean, I think that the large part of his business model,

[02:32:52] of Gary's business model is getting machines into the home.

[02:32:56] And the other, I mean,

[02:33:02] as it is, I think that as I mentioned earlier,

[02:33:06] he struggles with his margins to make a profit and exist.

[02:33:13] And also, I mean, would a consumer pay another $1,000

[02:33:23] for that device?

[02:33:25] I don't think so.

[02:33:26] There's another thing that is driving home sales.

[02:33:30] And that is the nostalgia of a pinball machine.

[02:33:36] When you talk about a pinball machine to someone,

[02:33:38] what they picture is a traditional pinball machine

[02:33:43] with a back box and a lower cabinet.

[02:33:46] They don't picture pinball 2000.

[02:33:48] And they certainly don't picture interactive video

[02:33:51] on a play field.

[02:33:53] Right.

[02:33:54] Yeah, no, it's like when you watch a current movie on TV

[02:33:58] or whatever, and somebody's playing a pinball machine.

[02:34:01] You hear a lecture mechanical, things and dongs,

[02:34:04] even though they're playing a monster bass.

[02:34:06] Yeah, they're not even, yeah.

[02:34:08] I mean, that just goes to show you that,

[02:34:11] that is the kind of the man on the street perception,

[02:34:16] if you will.

[02:34:17] Perception, if you will have is,

[02:34:18] I want an old style pinball machine.

[02:34:20] And my, my, my friends, I'm 52 years old, right?

[02:34:23] So I have a lot of married friends with kids

[02:34:27] and basements and, and rec rooms and all that kind of stuff.

[02:34:30] And, and they, even, even my friends in the business

[02:34:33] that I'm in today, in the, in the video business,

[02:34:37] they make a clear distinction.

[02:34:39] You know, the video goes on the TV with the Xbox 360.

[02:34:43] And the pinball is the pinball.

[02:34:46] And it goes in the basement.

[02:34:47] You know, and I want all the lights.

[02:34:48] And I want it flashing.

[02:34:50] And I want all the stuff.

[02:34:52] I want the toys moving.

[02:34:53] And I want the ball.

[02:34:55] So it's two different things.

[02:34:58] I would not, I mean if Gary will never say this to me,

[02:35:02] but if Gary ever said, you know, this is direction I want to go in,

[02:35:05] I would strongly advise against it.

[02:35:07] Does it make sense?

[02:35:09] It made sense at that particular moment in time.

[02:35:13] And it made sense for Williams-Latronics,

[02:35:16] given who they were, as the leader in the industry.

[02:35:23] It doesn't make sense for the last remaining convalescent company on the planet.

[02:35:30] Now, all the games, what are you of that you did not design?

[02:35:37] Not your games.

[02:35:38] What's your favorite game that's not your game?

[02:35:41] Terminator 2.

[02:35:43] Okay, so there's nothing, Terminator 2 and Monster Bash.

[02:35:46] Too big one.

[02:35:47] Oh, no, no, I mean, I have a whole slew of them, right?

[02:35:50] That I did not design.

[02:35:53] You know, Defender of the video game.

[02:35:56] Actually, I owned a Defender Stargate for many, many years and a few years ago.

[02:36:01] I don't know what got into me.

[02:36:03] I think I was, when I was moving five years ago and I moved downtown,

[02:36:07] you know, I was going to have a lot of space and I sold off that Stargate.

[02:36:11] And for this day, I kicked myself.

[02:36:13] Pinball machines.

[02:36:15] I love Terminator 2.

[02:36:16] I loved the original Black Knight.

[02:36:19] I love Star Trek Next Generation Steve's game.

[02:36:25] I loved Bryant's game, Medieval Madness.

[02:36:31] I actually own one of those.

[02:36:33] I liked Papaduke's theater of Magic.

[02:36:37] I thought that was a great game.

[02:36:39] Which, you think of the circus Voltaire?

[02:36:41] I hated it.

[02:36:43] I hated it with a passion.

[02:36:45] Why?

[02:36:46] I don't know.

[02:36:47] I just hated everything about it.

[02:36:49] I didn't get it.

[02:36:50] George, I really, really, really appreciate your time.

[02:36:53] And I hope I didn't hold you too long here.

[02:36:55] Nope, it's fine.

[02:36:56] Okay.

[02:36:57] Do I leave any stories out or any asks, not asking any questions?

[02:37:01] Should have asked.

[02:37:02] Nope.

[02:37:03] I think you got it all.

[02:37:04] All right, George.

[02:37:05] Hey, I really appreciate your time.

[02:37:07] And again, thank you.

[02:37:08] No problem.

[02:37:09] Thanks a lot.

[02:37:10] All right, take care.

[02:37:12] I'd like to thank George Gomez for joining us tonight on Topcast.

[02:37:16] He has some amazing design stories about being a video game designer or toy designer.

[02:37:21] And then finally, a pinball machine designer.

[02:37:24] And how he came up with pinball 2000.

[02:37:27] So again, I'd like to thank George.

[02:37:29] I really, really do appreciate his time.

[02:37:31] It was great talking to him.

[02:37:32] And I hope you all come back and hear us again on Topcast.
