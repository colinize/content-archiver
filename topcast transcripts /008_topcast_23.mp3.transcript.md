[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:12] Today we're going to be talking to somebody that's been involved in the pinball industry since

[00:31] the 1930s clear up to the end of the 1990s.

[00:36] He was working at Gengkol starting at 1937.

[00:39] He also worked for a short time in 1959 at Bali and then went over to Williams in 1960 and

[00:47] stayed with Williams until they stopped producing pinball machines in 1999.

[00:52] This gentleman spans over 60 years in the pinball business.

[00:56] He has quite a few stories to tell.

[00:59] Special guest.

[01:00] Special guest.

[01:01] Special guest.

[01:02] Special guest.

[01:03] So I'd like to introduce Steve Cordack.

[01:08] Steve Cordack has been in the pinball industry since 1937 to 1999.

[01:15] Also Steve was unavailable to do this interview over the phone so we've got to take Topcast

[01:20] on the road and we went to Steve's house in Chicago to interview him.

[01:26] And now we're going to talk to Steve Cordack.

[01:28] When did you start working at Gengkol?

[01:30] 1937.

[01:31] Okay.

[01:32] And how old were you?

[01:33] If you don't mind.

[01:34] You don't have to answer that if you don't mind.

[01:36] Let me figure it out.

[01:37] I got to take good use.

[01:38] Let me get a chance.

[01:40] 11, 21, 31.

[01:42] That was 26 years old.

[01:46] Okay.

[01:47] And before that, I mean how did you get the job?

[01:51] I mean what did you do to get that job?

[01:52] I mean is it something that you want it to be in or you just have to fall into it or

[01:57] what gets that something we can talk about on this here?

[02:00] Is that okay?

[02:02] Sure.

[02:03] Yeah.

[02:04] I'm really interested in how you got.

[02:05] You're 26, 27 in your interview at Gengkol?

[02:12] Or it doesn't work that way.

[02:14] It was not that way.

[02:16] No.

[02:17] Let me tell you what happened.

[02:19] I was a depression kid.

[02:22] See when I graduated from high school in 1930 and went to college, I started getting

[02:29] back on an electrical circuitry and so forth.

[02:35] After a year I had to quit.

[02:38] I had to quit because I had to go to work.

[02:40] I had to go to work to provide food for my mother and father and our family.

[02:46] At that time we had nine children, nine children and my mother and father.

[02:53] And my father was working only one day, sometimes two days a week.

[02:57] My mother was working a couple of days a week in the Bell Telephone Company washing floors

[03:02] and cleaning floors and everything else to make a couple of dollars.

[03:06] And I had my brothers and I had to go out and try to earn a few bucks.

[03:13] Now there was a time, there was a time in high school in 1928 when I worked for Zenith.

[03:21] And at that time I was making $22 a week.

[03:27] Was that good pay for the time?

[03:29] Terrific.

[03:30] I was only got $20.

[03:32] But if I worked every day they gave me an extra $2 to an $1.00 and got $22.

[03:38] Then came the depression.

[03:41] When the depression came I worked many places for as much as ten cents an hour, worked ten

[03:50] hours and got one dollar.

[03:53] I learned then.

[03:56] Everybody always asked me what is the thing that affected your entire life?

[04:00] The thing that affected my background and life and entire life was the depression because

[04:06] I learned what it meant to have a dollar.

[04:10] So what happened?

[04:13] They offered me a job in a forest service and I said okay I'll take it for a year and

[04:18] see what happens.

[04:20] I did.

[04:21] They put me in a ranger station.

[04:22] I took care of twenty some lookout towers that handle fires all over the bitterwood range

[04:30] in Idaho.

[04:31] And it came close to the end and I said I can't stay.

[04:35] I cannot afford.

[04:36] They went off of me the job again.

[04:38] You got to answer by May 1st because that's when we have to have an essay with you're

[04:44] coming or not.

[04:47] I came in a winter time back to Chicago.

[04:54] I'm looking every day at good church every day praying.

[04:57] I could find a job.

[04:58] I'm looking for a job so I can stay in Chicago my family, my brothers, my sisters, my mother

[05:05] and father.

[05:06] I wasn't going to go to Idaho because if I go to Idaho they'll never see me again.

[05:10] Who else is going to come and see me over there?

[05:14] And this is the story that everybody in this three knows but you don't know.

[05:20] No.

[05:22] I was walking one day down Ashland Avenue and it was raining like oh hell I didn't even

[05:29] own an umbrella.

[05:30] I opened up a door to a vestibule, closed the door to get in on the rain.

[05:35] Woman opens the door she says are you looking for a job?

[05:39] Yes I'm looking for a job.

[05:41] Can you sat her?

[05:42] Yes I can sat her.

[05:44] They put me on the line and that's what I got introduced to pinball games.

[05:48] So that was the Ganko factory right there?

[05:50] Ganko factory building pin game games on Ashland Avenue.

[05:54] So you just literally stroke a lot.

[05:56] Bad weather and rain and in a street and you walked into it.

[06:02] Two and a half weeks before May 15th of April.

[06:08] That's how I did it.

[06:10] And what year was it?

[06:11] You said 37?

[06:12] 1937.

[06:13] So you were good at salary?

[06:17] I always had to learn it.

[06:20] I was really fast.

[06:21] Also you didn't really know how to solder?

[06:23] I had been having some electrical background.

[06:26] I had no trouble at all.

[06:28] It got so good.

[06:29] So what was your first job there at Ganko?

[06:32] Well see they put me on a line soldering but I was soldering very close to where the testers

[06:37] were testing the game.

[06:39] And it wasn't long that I recognized the game was real well because I had a background

[06:46] of circuitry.

[06:47] You know?

[06:48] And there was simple circuitry that these games were on and I went to playing a couple

[06:52] games how I could tell exactly.

[06:54] I was so close to the testers that every so often when they'd have a problem I put my

[06:59] head up.

[07:00] I said I know the problems.

[07:01] Can I show you?

[07:02] I showed them.

[07:03] They were surprised that I was working there as a solder.

[07:07] And here I was showing them what I was wrong with the games and I was able to correct them

[07:12] and fix them up.

[07:13] It wasn't long that engineering saw that.

[07:16] And they said this guy doesn't belong on the line.

[07:18] He doesn't belong.

[07:19] He's good enough.

[07:20] We need an electrical man.

[07:21] We need an electrical man in the department of engineering.

[07:25] That's where I started being learning about pin games.

[07:28] That's where I got to introduce with the most important guy in the world.

[07:31] Harvey Heiss who was the guy learning of that who taught me everything there was in pin

[07:36] games and at the same time I started an electrical then I had to add a help with all the pin

[07:40] games and I had one hell of a time.

[07:42] Now what was when you were doing the soldering?

[07:45] What were they paying you then for a 40 cents an hour?

[07:52] 40 cents an hour?

[07:53] Which actually wasn't bad back then.

[07:54] That was good.

[07:55] Well we really got it job.

[07:57] And then when you went into the engineering department did they give you a raise?

[08:01] Oh yeah.

[08:02] So you were doing okay.

[08:04] Yeah.

[08:05] And what did your family think about this job?

[08:07] They didn't care what that was.

[08:08] I did as long as I was working because somebody, every check I made I give turn to my mother

[08:13] so that she could buy food and stop for the family.

[08:17] I wish one of those things that I would get a check and even a week and grow a blow

[08:21] it.

[08:22] I give my money to, I give my check sign my check and give it to my mother to buy food

[08:27] and everything.

[08:28] And she'd give me a dollar, dollar and a half or something for driving a walkie just

[08:32] to, because I didn't have a car walking to the place for a place and spending a little

[08:38] bit of money on myself.

[08:39] And if I needed to choose or something she'd give me money so I could buy a pair of shoes

[08:43] for a buck and a half or something like that.

[08:46] So from 37 to the summer 6th, 1941, what, I mean were you in the engineering department

[08:54] basically other than your stint with soldering you were in the engineering department right?

[08:59] I was in the engineering department in Genko up to 1957, 1958.

[09:06] But when December 7th came and Japanese, you know, Bomproll Harbor, how much of that

[09:13] change everything at Genko?

[09:15] We had the greatest soldering group of people in the world that could solder real well

[09:22] and we started making walkie-talkies for the Marines and they used to able to solder

[09:28] in a three quarter in socket, 15, 20 positions to solder and still put the sleeves on there

[09:41] and never short out.

[09:42] That's how good the people were.

[09:44] That's so good that I used to train people how to solder, you know.

[09:49] And I used to take people off the street, women that used to come from along that had kids

[09:57] working in school and everything would come work between times and I would suggest

[10:02] teaching them that's how good.

[10:04] So now the war broke out.

[10:08] So the government says, we want you to take charge of all the soldering, we want you to

[10:16] take care of all the training of the people, all the jobs that we're going to get.

[10:21] So now they put me in charge of 800 people in our place.

[10:26] How many were working prior to the war?

[10:28] I had one.

[10:29] I had a lot to 600, 700.

[10:32] Really?

[10:33] Yeah.

[10:34] So this was a pretty sizable plan.

[10:35] Well we had quite a plan.

[10:37] Quite a plan.

[10:39] Now did you do any game design before the war?

[10:43] Oh sure.

[10:44] Sure.

[10:45] And what was your first game?

[10:47] Well the first game.

[10:48] The first game that I designed perfectly.

[10:50] Right.

[10:51] The first game that I had complete design of is 1947 and 1948.

[10:58] Okay so it was after the war then.

[11:01] So before the war Harvey was doing all the game design and I was helping him and I never

[11:08] had a complete charge but I had complete control of all the electrical work, all the electrical

[11:13] layout.

[11:14] I did all the electrical layouts of all the games.

[11:17] Did you have to draw the schematics too?

[11:19] Yes we had a lot of schematics.

[11:21] I still have some of them here.

[11:22] And you had to do all those drawings by hand?

[11:24] Yep.

[11:25] And that was you if that was doing that.

[11:27] Now tell me about Harvey.

[11:30] Harvey Heiss was with Gengko starting way back in 1931-32 and he was with them from the

[11:39] beginning and he worked only part time because he had a regular job.

[11:45] But then when they started to get into making pin games, real good pin games for the bars

[11:53] and so forth, they hired him completely, took him away from his job and that's where

[11:58] he started working.

[11:59] He started building nothing but pin games.

[12:03] That's why when I came in there in 1937 he was so glad to get somebody that was an

[12:08] dummy.

[12:09] You know how I was.

[12:10] I was so much about.

[12:12] I was really able to do that and at the same time he was training me and joining me

[12:17] what how he built games and what he liked about the games.

[12:20] What was the purpose of building games with certain features and why and everything.

[12:24] I had to learn all of that from him.

[12:26] Now what about the Gengsburg brothers?

[12:29] Did you know them?

[12:30] Oh Lou Dave and Meyer yes.

[12:32] Three of them.

[12:33] And were they nice guys?

[12:34] Oh everyone of them was terrific.

[12:36] And were they real smart guys or was they doing any game design or were they strictly

[12:42] management?

[12:43] They had big management, nothing else.

[12:45] Nothing else.

[12:47] But they were very very very smart.

[12:50] They were the smartest Jewish guys in the world.

[12:54] What they did is they gave us, what they gave us is anewity policies.

[12:59] What would happen is whatever you were getting paid there was a certain fee of a deal that

[13:05] they would give you on an anewity policy.

[13:08] They'd say well now this policy is worth so much.

[13:11] And we're going to put in so much and so much.

[13:16] Now you put in so much and so much we will duplicate that.

[13:19] Matching.

[13:20] Matching right.

[13:22] And the new policy was had big value a lot of higher values.

[13:28] And every time we got an increase another new policy.

[13:32] Every time we got an increase another new policy.

[13:35] And these policies would be worth only good money if you stayed with it for 10 years.

[13:45] So you did leave the place.

[13:46] Who the hell want to leave the place when you got these goddamn policies?

[13:50] 10 years.

[13:51] 10 years.

[13:52] Every time they get one, 10 years.

[13:53] Another one, 10 years.

[13:54] Another one, 10 years.

[13:55] So now you got these things.

[13:58] You can't believe how much money there was held into those new policies when we all decided

[14:10] when we all left.

[14:11] So basically they were they had almost a four savings program with a matching percentage.

[14:17] It's actually pretty cool.

[14:19] Pretty good idea.

[14:20] No other company had it.

[14:22] Interesting.

[14:23] Interesting.

[14:24] So during the war you're making walkie talkies.

[14:26] So all the pin game stuff is basically on hold, right?

[14:30] No way it could open games because we couldn't get material.

[14:33] We couldn't get silver contacts.

[14:36] We couldn't get the material for the blades.

[14:40] But they let you keep building it until you're out of the material that you had in stock.

[14:44] But there's no way that you could buy it to forget any addition of material.

[14:47] And when did the inventory run out of that?

[14:50] So about after one or two games, two games.

[14:53] So by early 42 you're basically full war making walkie talkies.

[14:58] Now when did the walkie talkies thing stop?

[15:02] Because that stop as soon as we got other jobs, we did a lot of other jobs besides that.

[15:07] Oh there's so many jobs that I can't even begin to tell you.

[15:10] You mean during the war?

[15:11] Yeah.

[15:12] Okay.

[15:13] So then after the summer of 45, the war is over.

[15:17] And after August of 45, when did production of pin games where you could get materials in

[15:23] inventory?

[15:24] 46.

[15:25] It was 46.

[15:26] So it took a good six months before you could start making games again.

[15:30] Well we were already making games in 45, we were selling them to a 46.

[15:34] I mean you had them all designed ready to go.

[15:38] And then you just had to wait until you could get the materials.

[15:41] So was that a rough time between like the summer of 45 and the start of 46 that kind

[15:46] of laps?

[15:47] And it wasn't because we were starting hiring people, more people for it.

[15:51] Because we were losing people that would slowly and then we started hiring more people

[15:56] and people that could be trained to assemble equipment that was very important that was

[16:01] different than city of soldering.

[16:03] Okay.

[16:04] Now in 46, what was the first game after the war that really started to sell good for

[16:10] Gengkull.

[16:11] Total roll.

[16:12] Okay.

[16:13] Roll down game.

[16:14] Yeah.

[16:15] The roll down game thing, Gengkull was really big on roll down games.

[16:20] Yeah.

[16:21] I mean what's the history behind that?

[16:22] I mean they had seemed like they made more roll down games than anybody else.

[16:26] I mean maybe United had a couple and nobody could, nobody could duplicate them.

[16:31] Why?

[16:32] Why?

[16:33] Because we were the only company in the entire industry that had worked everything on

[16:38] the coils were all DC.

[16:41] We're not AC.

[16:42] Everything was DC.

[16:44] With first of all with rectifiers.

[16:49] Yeah, the money and market fires.

[16:53] Yeah, right.

[16:54] They were before Son, they were the other one.

[16:58] The Selenium rectifiers didn't come in until after the war.

[17:01] Okay.

[17:02] That's when we were able to make them, really make it.

[17:05] And since I was in charge of electrical work, I was able to do tricks with the coils

[17:11] that nobody in the industry could do nowhere.

[17:15] Well, what was the big advantage at the time of the DC powered coils versus the AC?

[17:21] Well, first of all, we didn't have to have a motor to run all the equipment.

[17:25] I could run it just by the coils with relays operating to do the work that we wanted.

[17:32] How could I control it?

[17:34] No trouble.

[17:35] We learned how to put copper washers on either on a front end or on the back side of the

[17:39] relays.

[17:40] One place to hold it and the other place to delay it going in.

[17:45] So I had all kinds of effects on coils that I could have in the industry.

[17:50] We could do that.

[17:51] We were the only ones all the way to the end that had rectifier that had DC in that game.

[18:00] Yeah, it wasn't until the Selenies when the Williams and Bally started doing just

[18:05] selective coils DC.

[18:07] Now, why was none of the other companies because they couldn't afford to change?

[18:13] They couldn't afford to change because it would change all the coils, all the relays,

[18:18] all the step-up units, everything would have to be changed.

[18:21] All the coil stops.

[18:23] Yeah, the mechanics.

[18:25] I also noticed that chemical games ran at lower voltage, too.

[18:31] No, Godly was running at 25 volts for the Selenoy and Williams was largely at 50 and you guys

[18:37] were about at 20 volts.

[18:39] Yeah, we were around at 20 and 15 volts.

[18:41] Right.

[18:42] And that's because you just the advantage of the DC allowed you to do that.

[18:46] You were able to do tricks with them that nobody else could do with even DACs.

[18:51] Okay.

[18:52] Okay, so now I got to print out from the internet pinball database of all the games that they

[18:59] say you designed.

[19:01] And they say that the first one all you did was in the fall of 47 and that was the Bronco.

[19:08] No, that was triple action.

[19:11] Okay.

[19:12] I'm sorry, hold it, hold it, hold it.

[19:13] Bronco, will I say that again?

[19:16] They say that Bronco came out before triple action.

[19:20] Well, I had nothing to do with it.

[19:22] That wasn't your game.

[19:25] Yeah, I had a lot to do with it, but you see, let me tell you something.

[19:29] In 9th October of 1947, Godly came out with Humpty Dumpty.

[19:40] Right.

[19:41] Six flippers.

[19:43] Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two.

[19:49] Comes December.

[19:51] No, comes December.

[19:54] Next week of December, Harvey Heist is hospitalized, cannot design a game.

[20:01] And they came to me and said, you've got to design a game.

[20:07] And our show is the last week in January.

[20:11] That's only four, five, seven weeks away.

[20:16] We have to, you have to design a game for us for the show.

[20:21] And that's when you did triple action.

[20:23] So then I started working on a game.

[20:26] And everybody else asked to me, why didn't you put the flippers in, where God made

[20:32] put them?

[20:33] They had two here, two here, two here.

[20:36] And it was selling like all hell, no trouble at all.

[20:40] It was making tremendous money.

[20:43] I said, well, when I started building the designing my game, I said, I couldn't afford

[20:48] to put in four or five or six flippers on a game.

[20:51] I was taught by Harvey Heist to be as conservative as I could be.

[20:56] I said, I only put, I'm going to put only two flippers at the bottom.

[21:01] And I put them at the bottom of the game where they have been ever since.

[21:05] During this time, I know you weren't working at Williams, but Williams started using impulse

[21:12] flippers, you know, where you press, it didn't matter if you press the right side or the

[21:16] left side, right?

[21:18] You press either one.

[21:19] Both flippers flip, but they just go up and come now, up and now real quick.

[21:23] You know, you just press them and they just impulse up.

[21:26] Where God lead, and just without everybody else, you could hold the flipper buttons in and

[21:31] you could keep, you know, there was an end stroke switch on the coil and you could hold

[21:36] the flipper, you could hold the flipper up.

[21:38] That's what we did.

[21:39] We did too.

[21:40] Right.

[21:41] Yeah, everybody but Williams did that.

[21:42] Any idea why they would have done that?

[21:45] I don't know.

[21:46] I'm just curious if you knew those more fun, I trapped in a glove with a single flipper.

[21:51] That's where I thought too, but they made it, you know, so that you basically couldn't

[21:54] do that.

[21:55] And I know that was before, you were long before you were at Williams, but I thought maybe

[21:59] you had some insight to why Williams used these impulse flippers.

[22:03] No, that wasn't when Harry Williams was there because I started in 1960.

[22:10] Right.

[22:11] And then that was when Harry was going out, you were coming in, right?

[22:14] Yeah, right.

[22:15] And then we came to the game design.

[22:17] That was where, that's where, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

[22:21] Harry Mab was there.

[22:23] Uh, he's the one that designed the flippers for Gottlieb.

[22:25] Right.

[22:26] And he was, he was old.

[22:27] He was already 70 some years old and what just he didn't, he didn't, was losing it.

[22:33] And they wanted another one to replace him.

[22:35] So they stuck me in her and they gave me a green goods salary and I says, OK, I'll take

[22:40] it.

[22:41] I know that in order to get in her.

[22:42] So that's how I got involved with the Sam Stern.

[22:46] Now during the 50s with Genco, was there any particular game that was really memorable?

[22:53] Be it pinball or arcade because you also helped work on Genco had some unbelievable arcade

[22:59] games during that period too.

[23:01] Their gun games, more ram-a, um, two player basketball, um, champion baseball.

[23:08] Just a high-five baseball.

[23:10] At this point, Steve has a three-ring binder with pictures and information on all the games

[23:16] he designed for Genco throughout the 1950s and I kind of go through it.

[23:20] Space car is gun game.

[23:21] That's all pin games after that.

[23:25] There it is.

[23:26] What's his map?

[23:27] It's his partial.

[23:28] Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no.

[23:30] The reason I see partial is because that's the one that was started by Harry Mab's before

[23:35] he left.

[23:36] Oh, OK.

[23:37] And he had trouble getting complete.

[23:39] Uh, when he left, and since he started it, I kind of like to always put it on there

[23:43] and say something that, at least, at least he had something to do with it.

[23:47] Right, right.

[23:48] OK.

[23:49] Now, Genco quarterback, I've been trying to find that game forever.

[23:52] Do you like to see what it looks like?

[23:53] Why do you have one?

[23:55] You have a Genco quarterback?

[23:57] You're giving me that look.

[24:00] I don't know what that means.

[24:01] I'm glad to keep taking pictures first of all.

[24:05] So you can now, the Golden Nugget and the Silver Chest.

[24:08] Those were rolled out, right?

[24:09] Right.

[24:10] OK.

[24:11] Sky Gunner, that was a gun game.

[24:12] Really cool looking gun game.

[24:14] Yeah.

[24:15] Um, I don't think I've ever seen Night Fighter and Vader I've seen.

[24:19] Um, shuffle pool.

[24:20] What was shuffle pool?

[24:22] That one I'm not familiar with.

[24:24] Reflected.

[24:25] See, you see these like, pull to pull, pause here?

[24:28] You shot.

[24:29] And whatever you knocked out, they reflected on here from the top.

[24:35] So the pull balls were not were underneath this deck and the player didn't see them.

[24:40] And then through reflective light, they reflected down on this almost like a mirror type surface.

[24:45] That's correct.

[24:46] Right.

[24:47] So this is like pinball 2000 in 1953.

[24:49] That's right.

[24:50] Right.

[24:51] Look at that.

[24:52] Now, did you design the entire?

[24:53] I had something to do with this with myself with Harvey Heist.

[24:58] Huh.

[24:59] Now, that's, I'm already seeing this game, the shuffle pool.

[25:04] That's really cool.

[25:05] There's a lot of other games you didn't see.

[25:08] Well, so we got Genko Golden nugget rolled down, silver chest rolled down.

[25:13] Just to clarify, a roll down game is a sort of slanted long play field that uses like

[25:19] three inch balls.

[25:21] And you basically roll the ball down this long play field.

[25:25] And at the end of the play field, there's holes that you're trying to actually aim for.

[25:30] And it's largely a gambling game.

[25:33] If you want some more information on them, you can hear about the roll down games that

[25:37] rob burqons that were made by Genko in the 1950s in our Rob Burke interview.

[25:44] Skygun Knight Fighter.

[25:45] Invader.

[25:46] Those are all gun games.

[25:47] Shufflepool, we just looked at.

[25:48] Matchpool was probably similar, right?

[25:51] Two player basketball, rifle gallery.

[25:53] Big top rifle gallery.

[25:55] Wild West.

[25:56] 1955.

[25:57] Skyrocket rifle gallery in 1955.

[26:00] European two player basketball.

[26:04] Quarterback, both 1955.

[26:06] Tournament pool, deluxe tournament pool, super big top rifle gallery in score pool in

[26:11] December 55.

[26:12] So you did most of this stuff.

[26:14] It was 53 to 55.

[26:15] That's right.

[26:16] Here.

[26:17] Oh, keeps going.

[26:21] Sorry.

[26:22] Ha, should have known.

[26:25] Should have known.

[26:26] The list did not end there.

[26:29] Yeah.

[26:30] Okay.

[26:31] So then 56, you're in deluxe tournament pool.

[26:35] I'll talk about that just a second.

[26:38] I mean, that king size tournament pool, super deluxe pool, baseball pool, grandma fortune

[26:44] teller.

[26:45] So the pedestal grandma fortune teller in high fly baseball in 56.

[26:49] You did both of those, right?

[26:51] And then marks, marks, marks light, which was a magnesium top pool game.

[26:57] Big fair rifle, David Krakat.

[26:59] That's a cool gun game.

[27:01] Official skill ball, official skill ball, two player and six player, circus rifle gallery,

[27:08] rotation pool, gypsy grandma, which was the horoscope gypsy grandma, the one in the

[27:13] more squared off retail cabinet.

[27:17] Another David Krakat junior model, super 21.

[27:21] Oh, there it is.

[27:54] I guess I'm not sure if something.

[27:55] No, wait, here's a picture of probably the most famous arcade game ever made.

[28:02] I mean, really, the Genco 2 player basketball.

[28:06] Probably the most fun too.

[28:07] I have one of these.

[28:08] This game is unbelievably cool.

[28:11] What I mean, not only because it's head to head, but it blew away the Chicago coin version.

[28:17] Because basically the Chicago coin version, the guys, you couldn't turn them.

[28:21] The machine turned the guys and the only thing you could, you could vary was timing and

[28:26] how hard you pulled the shot on this one.

[28:28] You can aim them right and left.

[28:30] You can shoot for the opposing players baskets in the top upper level baskets and the lower

[28:35] level that have variable points scoring.

[28:37] This game was genius and was we know that this is this is your baby.

[28:43] We built work done it.

[28:44] Harvey and you.

[28:45] Yeah.

[28:46] Okay.

[28:47] Who can't just remember there was a time period of time here when Harvey Heist was gone.

[28:57] And now we had either talked about it or did it tie it together and then we finished it

[29:02] up with it.

[29:03] Now look at this.

[29:07] This one right here.

[29:08] What is it?

[29:09] I don't know.

[29:11] You're going to tell me, the orange.

[29:15] I'm not sure what that is.

[29:16] Looks like a roll down style cabinet.

[29:20] But that's flying aces.

[29:23] Now who owns that game?

[29:27] Somebody owned it and sent that to me.

[29:30] Wow.

[29:31] I've never even seen that game.

[29:34] Now look at there it is.

[29:36] Space age.

[29:37] Oh that one there.

[29:39] This is another incredibly cool game.

[29:42] I had this.

[29:43] I had everything to do with everything.

[29:45] Space age?

[29:46] It's the one game I've never been able to find.

[29:48] It's not a space age.

[29:49] It's motor animes and space age.

[29:51] Space age is this one you see?

[29:53] Right.

[29:54] And then I have here.

[29:55] This one right here.

[29:57] This is the one that I enjoy.

[30:08] I enjoy more than anything else.

[30:12] Right here.

[30:13] What the motor rammer?

[30:14] Here it is.

[30:15] Oh yeah.

[30:16] Motor rammer?

[30:17] Classic game.

[30:18] Yeah.

[30:19] Boy is that a great day.

[30:23] I didn't look at Genka all the way across.

[30:26] Okay.

[30:27] What else do you want to know?

[30:28] Okay.

[30:29] Let's back up and talk about the two player basketball.

[30:32] Okay.

[30:33] You have any good story.

[30:34] You want to hear it?

[30:35] Let's sit down.

[30:36] We don't need to be standing up for this right?

[30:38] Yeah.

[30:39] One of these games and one of these I gave him is my brother-in-law.

[30:42] He still has it.

[30:44] He's got a baseball pool.

[30:45] That's one I've never seen.

[30:47] Neither did this Robert Burke.

[30:56] Robert Burke's never seen this one either.

[30:57] Yeah.

[30:58] When he saw this he almost passed out.

[30:59] He said, where's this game?

[31:00] I said, it's something to Chris Delic and Chicago.

[31:06] That is really cool.

[31:08] That's incredible.

[31:09] I mean, you made this game and you gave it to your brother?

[31:15] Yeah.

[31:16] No, we made about a half a dozen of these games and I figured what else to use is just

[31:20] giving it a selling it.

[31:22] I can give this to put it packed it up and I gave it to my brother-in-law.

[31:26] And did you mean you only made six in total?

[31:28] That about it does.

[31:29] No, I don't know how many we made.

[31:30] We didn't make too many of them.

[31:31] Let's say we made a hundred of them.

[31:33] Okay.

[31:34] Oh my God.

[31:35] I don't even see that flyer.

[31:38] Did you see that from when you were there?

[31:44] I found this along my junk file.

[31:47] Wait, hold on.

[31:48] We made the game but Chicago read it on the bottom.

[31:51] We gave it to his brother.

[31:52] Yeah, it says it.

[31:53] Yeah, it says it.

[31:54] Again, called massage-a-matic.

[31:55] Again, called product manufactured by Chicago Dynamics, which is of course Chicago coin.

[32:01] Right.

[32:02] Now this was a coin-operated massage thing.

[32:05] I mean, what is this exactly?

[32:09] I don't know what the hell it was.

[32:12] One of our designers made that and then it was turned over.

[32:18] Now what about...

[32:21] This is another kind of interesting one, jumping jack.

[32:23] Oh yeah, we made that.

[32:25] We made it out of a bottle.

[32:26] It was just like a slot machine.

[32:27] It was like a gambling game.

[32:29] Okay.

[32:30] Huh.

[32:31] And then the shuffle pool.

[32:33] We talked about that.

[32:34] The Genko 2 player basketball.

[32:35] I really want to talk about the Genko 2 player.

[32:38] Genko's new moving style swinging player.

[32:42] What's this all about?

[32:46] Somebody on the East Coast said, you guys are bragging about swinging everything else.

[32:52] Now we'll show you what it looks like, have something like this.

[32:58] So who's brain child was this?

[32:59] Somebody on the East Coast.

[33:01] And Jim Jersey.

[33:02] Okay.

[33:03] And then we've got the Wild West Gallery.

[33:07] You better look at this because they may not have this thing in another month.

[33:13] And here is the quarterback.

[33:15] Yep.

[33:16] That's the one you were talking about.

[33:19] Yeah.

[33:20] And this game, incredibly hard to find.

[33:24] And then the horse go pedestal grandma.

[33:26] I just want you to know there are a lot of those games that are hard to find.

[33:31] The Mortar Ram, of course.

[33:34] Showboat.

[33:36] Gun club, gun game.

[33:38] Not to be confused with the Williams gun club.

[33:40] Pinball.

[33:42] Fun fare.

[33:44] Which we just, I just bought a fun fare.

[33:46] Yeah.

[33:47] That's kind of a cool game.

[33:49] Yeah.

[33:50] Space age though.

[33:52] That is something.

[33:53] That is awesome.

[33:54] That is something.

[33:55] That is something.

[33:56] And it's built in the Mortar Ramacamp cabinet.

[34:01] But I mean, this was your baby, Space Age.

[34:03] Yeah.

[34:04] Right.

[34:05] Now, why the Mortar Ramacamp cabinet compared to using, you know, whatever a different

[34:10] design?

[34:11] Well, because we had to do, I had an automobile here.

[34:12] I had to do something to be able to ride around and do something on there.

[34:16] See?

[34:17] So I had to use something here.

[34:18] The same thing I did that with, when I did that to the other one, what's the other one

[34:24] that I made?

[34:25] A Mortar Ramacamp cabinet.

[34:27] Jet pilot.

[34:28] I see the Space Age had a puck in here, seeing.

[34:31] Right.

[34:32] And you push the puck into all these different places.

[34:34] And then it spits it back out.

[34:36] Yeah.

[34:37] And you got to take it to the next location.

[34:38] Right.

[34:39] The next location.

[34:40] And what there was one, two, there was five.

[34:41] Yeah.

[34:42] Five spots in your head.

[34:43] I was living in a amount of time to do this.

[34:45] And in the location you had to do it.

[34:47] You couldn't do it.

[34:48] Right.

[34:49] In order.

[34:50] Right.

[34:51] Right.

[34:52] I've heard that this, I've only known one of these.

[34:56] I've only ever seen one.

[34:58] You know, that I don't know who owns it now, but Larry Beis I had one of these.

[35:02] Is that right?

[35:03] Yeah.

[35:04] And it was just, he sent me pictures and I was just like, aw.

[35:07] And I guess there's another one in Europe too, that I've seen pictures of.

[35:11] But those are the only two I've ever seen.

[35:13] Now, Mortar Ramacamp, you see a lot more of.

[35:16] But the Space Age, now, did you do have anything to do with Jet Pilot?

[35:20] Jet Pilot was also in this style, in the Mortar Ramacampan, but it was a jet fighter that

[35:27] went around in circles and landed on the cities.

[35:29] Right.

[35:30] Or was that Harvey's?

[35:31] I don't know.

[35:32] I can't remember because he did a lot of ourselves, you know.

[35:36] Flying aces.

[35:37] Only four units know to exist.

[35:40] Huh.

[35:41] Wow.

[35:42] See, this here, you see this, main name here?

[35:45] Skrewlaw?

[35:46] Right.

[35:47] In 1948.

[35:48] Yeah, that was the, you know.

[35:49] I'm a turn of sound.

[35:50] Then it was played well, made good money, and there's not too many of around anymore,

[35:57] you know.

[35:58] Right.

[35:59] Yeah.

[36:00] Good game.

[36:01] I'm listening.

[36:02] Okay.

[36:03] So, now, two player basketball.

[36:05] Explain what, where did you guys come up with that?

[36:09] Well, two player basketball game.

[36:11] Well, I think it was just one of these crazy things that did, hey, basketball is a popular

[36:17] team theme.

[36:18] Let's do something on basketball, you know.

[36:20] The baseball everybody is making baseball, baseball, baseball, does make a basketball game.

[36:26] So we made a basketball theme and put it together and it cost us a lot of money to make

[36:30] those little characters that were down in the bottom there that could pick up the ball

[36:35] and throw it.

[36:36] Right.

[36:37] And the secret of the whole thing was how to hit that ball to go into the hands of the

[36:42] guy to shoot, you know.

[36:43] Right.

[36:44] That was something that Harvey Heist was good at.

[36:46] Harvey Heist developed, but we had a man called Harry Thompson, the H-O-M-P-S-O-N, a German

[36:55] mechanical engineer.

[36:58] Was he terrific?

[36:59] He just figured out how to do the thing and help us put it together.

[37:05] Yeah, because there's a center tube where the balls come out and it alternates right to

[37:10] left, right to left, really ingenious little mechanism.

[37:14] Simple, but ingenious.

[37:15] You know what I mean?

[37:16] But it works.

[37:17] Oh yeah, works good.

[37:18] That's the one at Parkback Pop and then you bingo, you toss it up there to try to hit it.

[37:22] Right.

[37:23] And if you put it in your opponent's basket, your opponent gets the points, which I thought

[37:27] was genius, you know.

[37:29] Because if you make a bat, because you are not only rewarded for a good shot, you are

[37:35] also penalized for a bat shot.

[37:38] That's correct.

[37:39] You had points for the other man.

[37:40] And that's right.

[37:41] Which was, I thought, was just genius.

[37:43] I think that was a really good kick out of that.

[37:46] And that game sold well, right?

[37:47] Yeah, sold very well.

[37:49] Okay.

[37:50] Now, the gun games that you did, I mean, tell me about those.

[37:55] I mean, what?

[37:56] Well, what happened is we got to a position, a situation one time where we thought we could

[38:02] make, when we saw a original layout of some games with ballers pop, you can stuff like

[38:12] that.

[38:13] We figured we could make a gun game with guns and shoot for something that's moving around,

[38:19] you know.

[38:20] And that's where we started.

[38:21] And we started getting our biggest pride for us at rifles.

[38:25] So we got in touch with Remington.

[38:27] And Remington was going to, it was said that they would sell us the, then because we could

[38:32] use not one or two of them, but hundreds of them see.

[38:36] Right.

[38:37] So they said, well, we'll sell you rejects.

[38:41] And the me, we don't even know if they were rejects, but because we got, we paid only

[38:47] $14 for the rifle.

[38:49] That's all.

[38:50] $14 for a finished rifle that was welded so that you couldn't put the shells into it.

[38:56] You mean so the bolt couldn't lift up?

[38:58] That's bolt was welded closed.

[39:00] Right.

[39:01] Right.

[39:02] Right.

[39:03] And did it have the trigger mechanism and everything?

[39:04] Well, we put the trigger mechanism with the switch.

[39:07] You guys did that.

[39:08] Okay.

[39:10] So you're doing these gun games and get coated a bunch of the classic ones.

[39:14] Oh, we started them making.

[39:16] We were making one game after the other.

[39:18] So it was unbelievable how the number of games that we built.

[39:23] We had a real good run of games.

[39:26] Right.

[39:27] Where, where, where, where other companies were making baseball games and baseball games and

[39:34] stuff like that.

[39:35] We decided to stay with the guns because kids loved the shoes.

[39:39] Oh, yeah.

[39:40] And then the best thing was the characters that we had in shooting and got to a point where

[39:49] one time we even pattened and I had the pattened on that too.

[39:54] We were shooting a rolling ball.

[39:56] You follow?

[39:57] I mean, you're right on a rail or something.

[39:59] Yeah.

[40:00] No.

[40:01] Let's see.

[40:02] The ball would come up.

[40:03] And then when it would let go, you could, you could, it would roll down and you could shoot

[40:08] it there.

[40:09] Then it would crawl about in the other direction and you could shoot it.

[40:13] If you could hit the ball, it was at work right at that position.

[40:17] The ball would drop down.

[40:19] Drop down.

[40:20] And that was something that I had a pat.

[40:22] And I own patten on it.

[40:25] Huh.

[40:26] And then we started making something that was even more exciting in my idea.

[40:31] We made pipes going around.

[40:33] You know, I'm going to, you're not going to have pipes in the pipe would drop down.

[40:37] Five pipes, you know, five pipes going around.

[40:40] If you knocked it it wouldn't down.

[40:42] You knocked it down.

[40:43] When you knocked all of the down, down you got a special scar.

[40:47] Huh.

[40:48] Okay.

[40:49] Now, what, tell me about Mordorama.

[40:53] That was your baby or Harvey's?

[40:54] Well, Harvey has, and I started putting it together.

[40:58] And when he left, I finished it and then I made the follow up to it, you know.

[41:03] Right.

[41:04] The space age.

[41:05] Yeah, right.

[41:06] Now, you used like a 57, I want to say Dodge for the car, you know, in Mordorama.

[41:16] That drove around.

[41:17] I mean, how did you guys come up with, I mean, just like, say, we're going to go down the

[41:20] store and get some toys?

[41:21] No, we could have thought we could have, we could have, we could buy, you know, there

[41:25] were the, all these things were not available, you know.

[41:27] Right.

[41:28] We grabbed it we could get.

[41:29] We grabbed it we could get it was the big enough to be able to put it something in

[41:33] material into it, you know.

[41:34] Right.

[41:35] And then we got to do it on.

[41:36] And it was just, it's interesting how the steering wheel actually moves the front wheels

[41:43] right the left.

[41:44] Right.

[41:45] And then you got control for forward and back.

[41:46] That's right.

[41:47] And you're trying to move basically to the different lighted playfield inserts throughout

[41:53] the game.

[41:54] We need to talk about people today telling what we did.

[41:56] They don't believe it.

[41:57] They can't see.

[41:58] They can't.

[41:59] I like to see that.

[42:00] I like to see that.

[42:01] It's hard to visualize if you've never seen one.

[42:02] That's right.

[42:03] I believe you.

[42:04] Tim Arnold has one and I played it.

[42:07] He has a motor ram.

[42:08] I know.

[42:09] Where were you there?

[42:10] That was maybe three years ago.

[42:11] I see.

[42:12] You know, he's got a motor ram.

[42:13] Now, I don't know if he has it at the pinball hall of fame.

[42:17] That I don't remember.

[42:18] But so, but he's got one, you know, and Burk has one.

[42:23] Burk has a motor ram.

[42:24] Yeah.

[42:25] And he bought that from from Mr. Faze.

[42:27] So okay.

[42:28] So now, what about the baseballs?

[42:32] The high five baseball, the champion baseball, and then the quarterback, which used the champion

[42:40] baseball cabinet, but the guy actually kicks the ball.

[42:45] Yeah.

[42:46] Yeah.

[42:47] Tell me about those.

[42:48] Well, you see, how do you feel?

[42:49] Highest was good at something like that.

[42:52] And when he came to mechanical layout, you know, and he was good at coming up with kicking.

[42:57] And boy, he'd worked like a dog and get it working.

[43:01] Get it working.

[43:02] He'd stayed day and night in the place just to get it working, you know.

[43:06] And that took time.

[43:07] You couldn't just say, put it together and have it, you know.

[43:11] If you just want to remember the greatest baseball games were made by Harry Williams during

[43:16] the, for Williams, you know.

[43:19] Right.

[43:20] When when when I joined when I joined when I joined Williams and STEM Stern was,

[43:29] Sam Stern was the in charge.

[43:33] Every, every spring, he had to come up with a new baseball game.

[43:37] We made game, game, game, game, game, spring came, another new baseball game.

[43:43] Spring, spring, spring, another new baseball game.

[43:46] Then they got so good.

[43:47] They started making one for the spring and one for the fall, you know.

[43:52] And baseball games were selling like all hell because it was a popular deal, you know.

[43:58] But to be honest with you, I think the Genco baseballs are way better than the Williams.

[44:04] Yeah, we had one heck of a tie.

[44:06] Well, the unique thing about high fly and champion is that kind of like two-player basketball.

[44:12] You see the same ball.

[44:14] It goes up the tube and then rolls down a little incline and then you actually have a

[44:19] miniaturized wooden back that actually you swing and it's like it comes off the railing

[44:28] and free falls to in front of the bat, like real baseball.

[44:32] Like almost like, you know, it's kind of like a T ball almost type thing, you know.

[44:40] And I just thought it's so ingenious.

[44:42] And that was that you were Harvey that was Harvey.

[44:47] Okay.

[44:48] And so you did that on high fly, which is basically a pinball style cabinet.

[44:52] And then you went to champion and which is sin cabinet is your quarterback.

[44:57] That thing is huge.

[44:58] That thing is a monster.

[45:00] I did all the electrical work on that.

[45:02] That's where the fun came in and waking something like that.

[45:05] Work, you know.

[45:06] Right.

[45:07] The quarterback, the only one I've ever seen is gold that Cleveland Queen had won.

[45:16] I see.

[45:17] And I don't know who bought it.

[45:19] Oh, I know who bought it.

[45:20] Papa bought it.

[45:21] That John Papa guy bought it.

[45:23] And that was about a year ago because Paisak dug it up.

[45:26] And that's the only one I've ever seen.

[45:28] You know, was that one?

[45:29] That's good.

[45:30] Yeah, that's a hard game to come by.

[45:32] Okay.

[45:33] Now what about the horse go grandma?

[45:35] You know, the horse go grandma and the pedestal grandma.

[45:37] Was that your baby too?

[45:39] That was the Harvey and I worked on that together.

[45:41] And my wife made all the dresses for these things.

[45:44] Oh, really?

[45:45] Yeah.

[45:46] She made all the dresses for the grandma.

[45:48] Oh, that's great.

[45:50] She was good at that.

[45:51] You know, she was good at that.

[45:52] You know, no.

[45:53] The hat on the grandma.

[45:56] Was she modeled after anybody?

[45:57] No, not that I know.

[45:59] Okay.

[46:00] I didn't know that maybe, you know, you know, because I imagine you had to have that

[46:04] made, right?

[46:05] Yeah.

[46:06] Yeah.

[46:07] And I think I'm not going to have that model or something, but those are among, after

[46:11] post-war, those are the most animated fortune tellers that anybody made.

[46:16] Right.

[46:17] Absolutely.

[46:18] And the cutest too, because they weren't huge.

[46:20] That's correct.

[46:21] It was nice.

[46:22] And it looked good too.

[46:23] Oh, yeah.

[46:24] Really, really good looking.

[46:25] And you had the microphone on the front glass, which was just a wood thing made to look

[46:32] like a microphone, but it was really, it's funny because I have one of the pedestal

[46:36] ones at my house.

[46:37] And it's got that microphone.

[46:38] I see people like trying to talk into it.

[46:40] And I'm like, no, no, it's not really a microphone.

[46:44] You can't hear it yet.

[46:45] But it was well enough implemented to track the thing.

[46:50] Yeah, it did.

[46:51] Track the tension and people actually think it's a real microphone.

[46:54] Like, you should see it.

[46:55] They're trying to talk to the, you know, to the one foot tall lady in the eye of the

[47:00] glass.

[47:01] It's hilarious.

[47:02] So now in 58, Genko bought out by Chicago coin, right?

[47:08] Say that again.

[47:10] In 1958, after a state fair, Genko got bought out by Chicago coin, right?

[47:18] No.

[47:19] Okay, tell me what happened then.

[47:20] What happened is they transferred all of our Genko engineering staff into Chicago coin

[47:29] and we manufactured gun games under our Genko name, right?

[47:34] In Chicago, at Chicago.

[47:36] They had nothing to do with it.

[47:38] We were working separately and getting the same salary that we were getting as we were

[47:43] working for Genko.

[47:44] Well, it got to a point where after a year or so, they just couldn't afford to pay us

[47:52] anymore.

[47:53] And at the same time, they liked our gun game so well that they started building

[47:58] game, gun games, you know, right game.

[48:01] We were good at making gun games, you know, and they grabbed the gun games and they started

[48:06] making this gun games, you know.

[48:08] And so they decided to let us all go.

[48:11] That's when the big change took place.

[48:15] So what, how did this marriage between Chicago coin, because it's like, Genko just kind

[48:21] of 58, 59, Genko just kind of evaporated.

[48:25] Yeah.

[48:26] I mean, why did, I mean, I don't understand.

[48:28] How did that happen?

[48:29] Or why that happened?

[48:30] I mean, so you're basically designing gun games for Chicago coin.

[48:36] No, for Genko.

[48:37] For Genko, but Chicago coins making them, I guess I'm not the only one.

[48:41] And they sure they were making it, they were making it there for us at the place.

[48:45] They had this best step for making it.

[48:48] Okay.

[48:49] Okay.

[48:50] And so then, you know, but after 58, 59, you've seen there's nothing by Genko anymore.

[48:56] So they just basically absorbed you guys and then let you go.

[49:00] Well, see, 58 is one that we weighed our last, when I made my last game.

[49:06] And when I made my last game in July of 58, they let us go.

[49:13] They did let you go.

[49:14] Yeah.

[49:15] So I, within, we had a problem.

[49:17] I had a very, very serious problem.

[49:21] There were four of us, myself, my electrical man, Berrington, my mechanical man, Mary Thompson

[49:36] and Joe and John Murphy, who used to take care of our equipment on the line.

[49:41] You follow me?

[49:42] Right.

[49:43] So they let us go.

[49:45] But now everybody wanted to hire me, the pinball, pinball, you know, everybody wanted to

[49:52] give me a hell of a salary to start.

[49:54] I wouldn't go anywhere.

[49:56] Everywhere I went, I said, if you want me, you're going to take all four of us.

[49:59] You're going to take the whole society.

[50:01] All four of us are in the whole flanting.

[50:04] You'd be surprised that one of the first businessmen who were good at making gun games, the

[50:08] first place I went to was to Seabird.

[50:13] And the reason I went to Seabird is because they were making, they made some real great

[50:23] gun games at one time.

[50:25] But when they made a gun game that they had to burn a thousand of them in their backyard

[50:31] because it wouldn't sell.

[50:32] And it was called Kuhnhant, a Rakhoon going up.

[50:37] Up the poles.

[50:38] Up the pole.

[50:39] They couldn't sell them.

[50:40] And the south, how are you going to sell a Kuhnhant game in the south, you know.

[50:44] So what happened?

[50:45] They didn't break it.

[50:46] So when I went there and I knew they blew it, I introduced myself to them.

[50:52] So I have a staff of guys that know how to make gun games, real good.

[50:57] And we like to hire out to you to make gun games.

[51:01] Well they were very, very serious about it.

[51:03] They were glad.

[51:04] But after a serious consideration on the board of directors, they said they had such a

[51:09] bad reputation.

[51:10] They didn't think they could sell another gun game no matter what happened.

[51:14] They were sorry they couldn't take the scene.

[51:16] Right.

[51:17] And in the Kuhnhant I think was 55 or 56.

[51:21] And it was a rail light game, which means it was basically the guns of big flashlight.

[51:26] And then the Kuhns had little sensors in them.

[51:29] And then it had like a jukebox amplifier.

[51:32] And it actually made sound.

[51:34] You're like when you hit a Kuhn, it squealed.

[51:36] You know.

[51:37] And through this jukebox amplifier.

[51:38] And it was a tube amplifier, which was incredible because they think probably had to warm up when

[51:43] you turned it on.

[51:45] You know.

[51:46] Okay so you go to Seabird and you want your whole design team.

[51:51] You want to bring your whole design team with you.

[51:53] Yeah.

[51:54] I didn't want to even think about making another gun game.

[51:57] So that's a care of it.

[51:58] So that ended that real quick.

[52:00] Well the next person that contacted me was Linda Rant from United.

[52:07] And he wanted me spedly to design games because he was pushing.

[52:14] He was the guy that was doing most of the pushing games and he didn't have time to do it.

[52:18] He wanted somebody to take care.

[52:20] Took me up there to his body and he hasn't done anything.

[52:23] Sorry.

[52:24] And he introduced me to the babes that were there.

[52:31] Because United had designed some gun games.

[52:33] Not as good as your games.

[52:34] I know it.

[52:35] And he wanted to take the hire me.

[52:39] He said he'd hire me but he wouldn't take the other three guys.

[52:43] And he said then he had me in time.

[52:45] Well real offer to me and I said sorry but I feel so responsible for it.

[52:50] I can have no trouble getting a job.

[52:52] These guys will have a hell of a job getting jobs in you.

[52:55] Where are you going to get after all these years that they worked with me at Ganko and

[53:00] Kasey.

[53:01] We're so good.

[53:03] Now how did you end up in Williams?

[53:05] I made a man.

[53:07] So what happened?

[53:10] I didn't know where else to go.

[53:15] So I went over to see my good friend at Valley.

[53:21] I went to his name.

[53:23] My home.

[53:24] My home.

[53:25] No, no, no.

[53:29] What the hell was the charity?

[53:36] See Duran was at United.

[53:39] Of course Harry was at Williams.

[53:42] I don't know the name of the Valley guy.

[53:45] Because during the 50s Valley really wasn't making, they made some arcade games but they

[53:51] really weren't making too many pinball games.

[53:53] They were mostly doing the bingos.

[53:56] Big time into the bingos.

[53:58] You know the first to one ball and the five ball.

[54:01] I think it was just a second.

[54:04] I went over to see this friend of mine.

[54:06] He was running.

[54:07] He's the owner of Valley.

[54:08] I went over to see him.

[54:10] I said I have a problem.

[54:14] I have a problem.

[54:16] What's your problem, Steve?

[54:18] I got three guys with me who, and that's four of us.

[54:25] But when we laid off from Genco and I'm trying to get a job, I have no trouble at all because

[54:32] of my background in the pin games.

[54:34] Everybody wants me.

[54:35] But nobody wants to take these three guys.

[54:37] You know what he said to me?

[54:39] I'll take all four of you.

[54:40] Really?

[54:41] I'll tell you.

[54:42] And you're going to start working on some gun games for it or something.

[54:45] But in the meantime, I said very good.

[54:48] Okay.

[54:49] I've got a job with Bill Donald.

[54:53] That was his name Bill Donald.

[54:57] Sure.

[54:58] Bill Donald.

[54:59] And I hate it when I had it and put me on the job.

[55:02] And I'm like, we are working.

[55:03] Okay.

[55:04] So you were going to battle him in just a second.

[55:06] Now this is the end of 58.

[55:08] Right.

[55:09] The end of 58.

[55:10] So I'm the 58 and I'm there.

[55:16] Just three quarters, almost at the end of 59.

[55:20] Okay.

[55:21] Oh, you're 359.

[55:26] In the meantime, Harry Williams is being brought up by Sam Stern.

[55:37] Sam Stern's got this guy, the guy that originally built the four six flippers for Godly working

[55:50] for him.

[55:51] Oh, man.

[55:52] Oh, man.

[55:53] Harry, man.

[55:54] Yeah, man.

[55:55] And he was old already and not been doing it very well.

[56:01] And in these situations, they never approach a guy.

[56:07] That they want.

[56:08] They send somebody.

[56:09] You know, somebody who leaves his to me, hey, Steve, why don't you call up Sam Stern?

[56:14] He's been looking for a designer and he says, and he might be interested.

[56:22] Why don't you call him?

[56:23] I said, no, I don't want to call him.

[56:24] I said, well, listen, he can't call you.

[56:26] You know, that's not the way to do that.

[56:29] Why don't you just call him and talk to him?

[56:31] Okay.

[56:32] I call Sam Stern.

[56:35] He gave me a terrific offer, a terrific offer.

[56:38] And of course, I didn't get the kind of salary I would like to have gotten when I went to

[56:42] Belly and order to get these four guys in, you know.

[56:47] So I said, I don't know, yeah, I haven't got a contract with Belly, but I was hired by

[56:53] Belly here I am.

[56:55] So this was now already the beginning of 1960, 1960.

[57:02] I went over to Bill O'Donnell.

[57:09] This is Bill, I got a problem.

[57:10] Oh, you got another problem again?

[57:11] What's your problem with this time?

[57:13] As it's Bill, you know that when I came here, I came here with this group of guys.

[57:20] We built a couple of games for you and I basically pin games as a background.

[57:26] And I was given a very good offer by Sam Stern.

[57:31] And I told him, whole, because I was not very honest with him.

[57:35] And I said, he didn't contact me.

[57:38] I just heard that the man that he had working for was going to be leaving.

[57:44] And I just contacted him to find out if there's a possibility for me to have any games with

[57:49] him.

[57:50] And he made me a very, very, very good offer.

[57:54] He said, Steve, I tell you what I'll do.

[57:56] You go ahead and take that job.

[57:59] But don't you dare take any one of the three guys that you brought here with you.

[58:04] Oh, this is the perfect skin closet.

[58:06] They were three guys.

[58:07] They got the reading, got themselves working in that place.

[58:11] And did you know they worked there for years and years and years and each one of the guys

[58:17] retired from Belly?

[58:19] And he let me go to Williams.

[58:26] And I started working there in February of 1960.

[58:33] So what was your first game that you really remember in 1960 that you designed?

[58:39] I worked on that.

[58:41] You saw that in the picture.

[58:43] Yeah, right, right.

[58:44] It wasn't the first game.

[58:46] Right, the Space Clier.

[58:47] Right.

[58:48] It was the Balls of Pop-Up.

[58:50] I only did that because they already had a good reputation in the Balls popping.

[59:02] And Sam Stern said, we wanted to make another one.

[59:04] I said, well, can I make it in my own self?

[59:07] And on the inside do what I like to do.

[59:09] I did.

[59:10] And I put buttons on the side.

[59:12] So when the ball was balanced, it bounced off the buttons and do some scoring, too.

[59:16] You know.

[59:17] And he liked that.

[59:18] So they made that game.

[59:19] They made it a good.

[59:21] So the meantime I was working and getting together to make pin games because very bad because

[59:26] maps were really already working on one game, Christmas that I told you about.

[59:32] And he couldn't get it finished.

[59:34] He just didn't get working and everything else.

[59:36] I was trying to help him out on that thing.

[59:38] And the meantime I was starting working on my own game.

[59:42] And the first game I made was Bubble.

[59:45] Now Bubble is in that funky cabinet.

[59:49] The drink cabinet.

[59:50] Because it's got like a bench where you can set your beers while you're playing pinball

[59:55] that the Space Age cabinet in his Williams called it.

[59:59] What did you think of that cabinet design?

[01:00:02] Did you like that?

[01:00:03] What?

[01:00:04] The Space Age cabinet.

[01:00:05] I was only interested in making a game.

[01:00:06] Okay.

[01:00:07] So you had nothing to do with the cabinet.

[01:00:09] No, I didn't.

[01:00:10] Okay.

[01:00:12] First year that I'm there in 1960, I made the Space Glider.

[01:00:17] And I was working on it with the maps on his Christmas, you know.

[01:00:24] And he finally said, I got a quit.

[01:00:27] I'm going.

[01:00:28] He went to Hollywood and Florida and I visited him several times, you know.

[01:00:33] And then what happened is I came out with the first game of Bubble in 1961.

[01:00:41] And in 1961, I made one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine games with

[01:00:51] Christmas.

[01:00:52] In 1962, I came out with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

[01:01:03] games.

[01:01:04] You're making a game a month almost.

[01:01:05] Oh sure.

[01:01:06] Because what are we making?

[01:01:07] We're making only 300, 400 games of a run.

[01:01:13] And then they make the who are sure with the run.

[01:01:15] And they send everybody home until the next game was ready and then the after they were

[01:01:19] to go.

[01:01:20] Huh.

[01:01:21] Now, at this time, Harry Williams was gone at this point, right?

[01:01:26] Yeah.

[01:01:27] Because basically you replaced him really in the game.

[01:01:31] So you never really had to work with Harry, right?

[01:01:35] Yeah, but I want you to remember that, that the money that Sam Stern paid Harry Williams

[01:01:46] for the company made him very embarrassed.

[01:01:50] So he kept them on a design deal when he was working at California and he would occasionally

[01:01:56] send me a drawing or something.

[01:01:59] I never used it except one.

[01:02:01] And I was good enough to build my own games.

[01:02:04] This is the hell with this guy.

[01:02:05] I didn't want to use his games.

[01:02:07] And I kept all those drawings of his and they're all filed away, you know?

[01:02:13] And I went ahead and kept going.

[01:02:16] And then I had one of the people that was an engine and it was a design engine and putting

[01:02:22] games for production was Norm Klank.

[01:02:25] Right.

[01:02:26] And he said, Sam Stern says, you can't keep doing yourself all these games here.

[01:02:32] 1963, I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine games.

[01:02:38] Well, I said, what the heck?

[01:02:39] I got it.

[01:02:40] I got it.

[01:02:41] I got to get to hell out of this thing, catch somebody to help me because I can't keep

[01:02:45] going the way I'm going, you know?

[01:02:46] Right.

[01:02:47] So then, and then what I got is I got Norm Klank to build games.

[01:02:53] And then he started making games and we alternated after.

[01:02:57] Why everything worked out very good.

[01:03:00] Now when Harry left the company, he started Southland engineering in California.

[01:03:05] He worked in it with that, yeah.

[01:03:07] Right.

[01:03:08] How did Sam Stern feel about Harry doing that basically leaving the company, but then

[01:03:13] he opens kind of a competing company.

[01:03:16] But he didn't even make it in the game.

[01:03:18] Right.

[01:03:19] He made arcade games.

[01:03:20] And he, well, for instance, Williams Minigolf was really modeled after Southland engineering

[01:03:28] little pro.

[01:03:29] Yeah.

[01:03:30] Do you know the story behind that at all?

[01:03:32] No.

[01:03:33] Okay.

[01:03:34] And so Sam Stern didn't have any problem with Harry doing this.

[01:03:37] It was okay.

[01:03:38] That's right.

[01:03:39] Okay.

[01:03:40] So these guys were on good terms.

[01:03:41] See, I got, and I was on good terms with Harry Williams too.

[01:03:44] And it's how I got to California, I visited him.

[01:03:47] And I got to visit with his wife because why he, this was his third wife that he married,

[01:03:53] you know, and she was a Polish extraction.

[01:03:56] My wife was from Poland.

[01:03:58] So they were both, when they got together, they spoke Polish like two people that knew each

[01:04:03] other for a 10 year.

[01:04:05] And every time we went to California to visit my daughter, we go after Harry Williams died,

[01:04:12] we went to head to the visitor.

[01:04:14] She's still alive in Palm Springs.

[01:04:17] Okay.

[01:04:18] We'll be right back with Steve Kordak in a moment after these messages.

[01:04:51] Some pinball machines were hurt during the Finball Pins vids, but they were all get your

[01:04:54] terrain and DVDs on Coinup goodness now.

[01:04:56] All right.

[01:04:57] We're back with Steve Kordak of Genkko and Williams with some more stories to tell.

[01:05:03] So now during the 60s, was there any particular game or era that was your favorite when you

[01:05:10] were designing?

[01:05:11] Because at the end, if you add up all the games you designed, you designed over 100 pinball

[01:05:16] games.

[01:05:17] I'm not talking about arcade games or gun games, just pinball games.

[01:05:21] You designed over 100 games from Genkko all the way through Williams.

[01:05:26] So was there a particular era that you really liked or a feature or a design or something

[01:05:32] that stands out in your mind as something you're really proud of?

[01:05:36] Well, the first thing I was most proud of was the trip election that I made for Genkko

[01:05:40] with the two flipers at the bottom of the game.

[01:05:42] That was number one.

[01:05:45] The next thing I was most proud of was when I made Space Mission and Space Odyssey, we

[01:05:51] made a record run of games that I designed.

[01:05:56] Sold the Pigeas out of that game.

[01:05:58] Man did that take off.

[01:05:59] A four player game.

[01:06:01] My next four player game was the one that you're really big and proud of.

[01:06:12] Oh, yes.

[01:06:13] But I was just a sprig, not more proud of the game after that.

[01:06:18] But the four player game right after that.

[01:06:21] And you know what was that game?

[01:06:23] Grand Prix.

[01:06:24] 12,000 of them.

[01:06:27] 16,000 of one game.

[01:06:29] 12,000 of the next run of four player game.

[01:06:33] That's the kind of a good reputation I had for making games.

[01:06:36] Well, Grand Prix is a great game.

[01:06:38] I personally like Grand Prix a lot better than Space Mission.

[01:06:42] I like Grand Prix.

[01:06:43] I think Grand Prix is a great game with those scores on either side going up and you build

[01:06:50] them up, go build them up and you went to the whole to pick them up.

[01:06:53] Right.

[01:06:54] And you got some big things.

[01:06:55] I can tell you what exactly how the game was going.

[01:06:58] Oh, yeah, yeah.

[01:06:59] I'm real familiar with the game.

[01:07:00] I had the two spinners on either side.

[01:07:04] The nice tight pop bumper nest in the center and you build the bonuses up the side, drop

[01:07:09] it in the kick out holes, the grab it.

[01:07:11] And it was also interesting in that it was a game of incredible score.

[01:07:17] It was almost score inflation.

[01:07:18] I mean, you would get a score of five, six, seven, eight hundred thousand.

[01:07:24] You don't wear Space Mission or any of those other games.

[01:07:27] If you got over a hundred thousand, you were pretty darn good.

[01:07:31] You know, so but I'm Grand Prix, man, you could really get the points going on back in.

[01:07:35] I love that game.

[01:07:36] So I had great, that are you asking me, those are mine.

[01:07:40] Then about the last game, the last game, the last full game.

[01:07:45] I'm not talking to the redemption game.

[01:07:49] Right, no ticket act tall, right?

[01:07:51] That's the thing, right?

[01:07:52] The last game that I built for Williams, and my estimation was one of the great, great

[01:08:02] games of the industry.

[01:08:04] And this is something that you have to understand when I tell you the deck.

[01:08:11] That was Pocorino.

[01:08:12] Pocorino.

[01:08:14] Why is Pocorino's the great game?

[01:08:17] It was a wide body game, and it had 11 carry over features on this game.

[01:08:26] Four player.

[01:08:27] And if a four player, no matter what player was on, if he had whatever position he left

[01:08:33] his last game, man, 11 features on there, he'd get it back when it all went on.

[01:08:41] Right, it carried over to the next game.

[01:08:44] Money carried over features on Pocorino.

[01:08:47] Just remember that, that game, that it took so much money in Minnesota that the guy almost

[01:08:54] ran it in these games themselves by an allocation.

[01:08:58] I mean, just Pocorino.

[01:09:00] Only Pocorino, that was my last game in 79.

[01:09:03] How many games did they make of Pocorino?

[01:09:05] I don't know, I don't know.

[01:09:06] But the production wasn't as high as they Grand Prix, right?

[01:09:09] Of course not.

[01:09:10] Grand Prix was that one really rocked and rolled, so the space mission.

[01:09:14] Now you were the inventor of the swinging target, right?

[01:09:17] That was yours.

[01:09:18] Yes, right.

[01:09:19] How did that come about?

[01:09:21] Well, because that came about in the early 60s, right?

[01:09:25] That's right, right, right.

[01:09:26] Yeah, but the best thing that I have in my design was that the turning feature, when

[01:09:36] one quarter of the way around, one target to be up, and turn around, you hit it, then

[01:09:41] it moved to 40.

[01:09:42] You were talking about like, oh, it was almost like a 45 record album with two posts sticking

[01:09:46] out of it, and you hit it and it spins around, is that what you mean?

[01:09:51] No, no, no.

[01:09:53] It was a...

[01:09:54] What game did they use it on?

[01:09:57] I'm trying to think, just a second.

[01:10:00] Just a second.

[01:10:01] There are a couple.

[01:10:03] What these unpause, while we figure this out.

[01:10:06] Let's see.

[01:10:07] What we need to talk about is Adibol.

[01:10:09] Adibol came out what in, I want to say 60?

[01:10:13] It was a pretty early game of yours, right?

[01:10:15] Yeah, we couldn't make it.

[01:10:17] Why?

[01:10:18] God, they wouldn't let us.

[01:10:22] Aww.

[01:10:24] Did they...

[01:10:25] Just before that, they came with the feature Adibol.

[01:10:28] Right.

[01:10:29] And they used on their flipper series.

[01:10:31] Yeah, but I, yeah, but I said, they can make it...

[01:10:34] Why don't we call a game Adibol?

[01:10:36] When they saw our game on location, Adibol, they called against the person, and told

[01:10:41] them that they would not let us use the word name Adibol.

[01:10:46] Right, and Adibol was like 1961, and you changed the name to Skillball.

[01:10:51] That's correct.

[01:10:52] Okay.

[01:10:53] But, how did...

[01:10:54] I mean, were you basically kind of, copy and got leave at that point, or did you come

[01:10:59] up with this on your own?

[01:11:00] No, we didn't.

[01:11:01] No, I didn't.

[01:11:02] We just came up with the Adibol because it was a good feature.

[01:11:05] Right.

[01:11:06] So you hadn't seen it anywhere else.

[01:11:09] No.

[01:11:10] Okay.

[01:11:11] Interesting.

[01:11:12] And was that your idea of the Adibol?

[01:11:14] Yeah.

[01:11:15] Yeah.

[01:11:16] Okay.

[01:11:17] And so it got changed to Skillball.

[01:11:19] How did that...

[01:11:20] Did the game run well?

[01:11:21] Yeah.

[01:11:22] It worked out very good.

[01:11:23] It turned out very good.

[01:11:24] Yeah.

[01:11:25] I like that game.

[01:11:26] That's kind of a cool game.

[01:11:28] The other one, what was the one I was looking for?

[01:11:31] I'm going through here, Jolly.

[01:11:33] Okay.

[01:11:34] Three coins.

[01:11:35] Okay.

[01:11:36] Oh.

[01:11:37] Okay.

[01:11:38] Here we are.

[01:11:39] Um.

[01:11:40] A.

[01:11:41] Four roses.

[01:11:42] Marty.

[01:11:43] Big deal.

[01:11:44] Well, you can't get that photo with the...

[01:11:45] Four roses?

[01:11:46] Well, I don't know.

[01:11:47] This is what you were talking about with the...

[01:11:49] Yeah.

[01:11:50] With the spinner.

[01:11:51] It is.

[01:11:52] There it is.

[01:11:53] So you hit that and she turned around.

[01:11:55] Quarter.

[01:11:56] You know.

[01:11:57] Right.

[01:11:58] Okay.

[01:11:59] So it's kind of like a...

[01:12:00] Oh.

[01:12:01] Kind of like a Roto target, but laying flat.

[01:12:03] I had like a record.

[01:12:04] I would have water.

[01:12:05] I would have one, two, three, and four.

[01:12:07] Or I would have one thing, two things, three things, and a star and another one.

[01:12:13] And if you...

[01:12:14] Star was there, you hit it, you know.

[01:12:15] Right.

[01:12:16] And this is cool.

[01:12:17] This is a single player reverse wedgehead.

[01:12:18] This was a game.

[01:12:19] This was one of the greatest games we ever sold to South America.

[01:12:26] Really?

[01:12:27] Yeah.

[01:12:28] Huh.

[01:12:29] I mean, did you design games specifically for other countries?

[01:12:32] No.

[01:12:33] It just kind of how it worked out, right?

[01:12:35] Right.

[01:12:36] Okay.

[01:12:37] Now the swinging target.

[01:12:39] How did you come up with that idea?

[01:12:41] Wow.

[01:12:42] That was something doing something different.

[01:12:46] And we pat into that and we kept it.

[01:12:49] Yeah, because that started in the early 60s and went all the way through.

[01:12:53] You got...

[01:12:54] You used that on SpaceMachem.

[01:12:55] You're...

[01:12:56] You know.

[01:12:57] And with the sidekickers.

[01:12:59] You know, if you got the ball into the sidekickers at the right time, it would nail the swinging

[01:13:05] target just right and then you would advance the lights right in front of the swinging target

[01:13:10] for the big points.

[01:13:11] Now, here's another classic that you did, the Heat Wave.

[01:13:15] Any good stories about Heat Wave?

[01:13:16] Yeah.

[01:13:17] Tell me about that.

[01:13:19] 1964.

[01:13:21] Reverse wedgehead, single player, classic E-M, classic E-M with the thermometer in the back

[01:13:27] glass.

[01:13:28] So you had back glass animation.

[01:13:29] Yeah.

[01:13:30] That was something new and something different.

[01:13:31] Everybody liked it.

[01:13:33] So I said, well, that's another one we made later on, another one, a comfortable one

[01:13:37] to make.

[01:13:38] Yeah, Heat Wave is a real good game.

[01:13:40] I'm trying to see what other ones.

[01:13:43] Oh, oh, tell me about...

[01:13:44] Oh, ah.

[01:13:45] I don't know if I'm in a club.

[01:13:47] Let's do what I'm looking for.

[01:13:48] Ski Club and Alpine Club.

[01:13:50] My friend of mine, he loved...

[01:13:52] That's his favorite two-thirty E-M's.

[01:13:54] Well, he likes the out of all version.

[01:13:55] I think what Alpine Club is the out of all I believe.

[01:13:58] He likes that game.

[01:13:59] He really likes that game.

[01:14:00] This is a particle.

[01:14:01] No, okay.

[01:14:02] Now, particle used in the back box, you had like a...

[01:14:09] You know, where the separate little ball that kicked up and then went down kind of randomly

[01:14:13] between 100 and 500 points.

[01:14:16] Was that your idea?

[01:14:17] Was that your idea?

[01:14:18] Yeah.

[01:14:19] And why...

[01:14:20] I mean, that kind of was really random.

[01:14:21] Yeah, but I didn't make any of those because it was not a good idea.

[01:14:26] The delay game by having them watch and look at something that's happening in the back

[01:14:32] with the back glass.

[01:14:34] This is one of those things I'm going to talk about.

[01:14:37] Hotline.

[01:14:38] Yeah, no, why didn't you ever say that to the guys doing the not matrix games?

[01:14:43] You know, in the not matrix games in the 90s, you know, where the everything kind of stops

[01:14:48] and they do the little animations on the not matrix?

[01:14:51] I know it's really cute and it looks real pretty, but it stops the whole game.

[01:14:55] You know what I mean?

[01:14:56] You know what?

[01:14:57] But it's never been a game like this made, like mine.

[01:15:01] Hotline.

[01:15:02] It would...

[01:15:03] This would be H O exactly.

[01:15:07] And imagine that.

[01:15:09] Imagine these buttons would light up at I and E so you could shoot at them and knock them

[01:15:15] all out.

[01:15:16] Right.

[01:15:17] Well, just to explain to people what it is is you've got a matrix in the center of the

[01:15:20] play field with a bunch of roll over buttons that light and it actually spells out.

[01:15:25] Hotline.

[01:15:26] Hotline.

[01:15:27] And it was probably your most complicated electric mechanical game ever.

[01:15:32] It was a spec, right?

[01:15:33] And how?

[01:15:34] But it was correct.

[01:15:35] But you just did you decide?

[01:15:36] I did.

[01:15:37] I did.

[01:15:38] I did.

[01:15:39] I came up with that idea.

[01:15:40] And were you the guy that designed the electronics for it too?

[01:15:43] Oh, sure.

[01:15:44] So you did all the electronics for it?

[01:15:46] So when you designed a game, you're not only designed for it.

[01:15:49] You're not only designing the shots, the layout.

[01:15:53] But electrical work.

[01:15:54] But also all the electrical work.

[01:15:55] You're doing that too.

[01:15:56] Right.

[01:15:57] And you could do this in four weeks from dead start to production.

[01:16:03] In four weeks.

[01:16:04] How could you do that in four weeks?

[01:16:05] Well, that was different games than this.

[01:16:07] It was not like these.

[01:16:08] They were more simpler games at that time.

[01:16:11] They were.

[01:16:12] So at this time, because this was 1966, you're saying you weren't designing 10 games in the year.

[01:16:17] Yeah.

[01:16:18] I remember we were talking Williams.

[01:16:19] Now, you're talking about the game I'm talking about.

[01:16:22] Now it's going to Genko games.

[01:16:24] Now that Genko games were simple and easy to make because it was DC.

[01:16:28] Right.

[01:16:29] These were not DC.

[01:16:30] Genko games were DC.

[01:16:31] These were all AC.

[01:16:33] Now, in the early 60s, I think about 63, Williams changed from 50 volts for their solenoid voltage down to 25.

[01:16:43] Like, gotley.

[01:16:44] What?

[01:16:45] And why did they do that?

[01:16:46] Did it was just like a shock?

[01:16:47] Only because we were able to redesign the flip-free since the coils in such a way that it didn't have to take that much voltage to operate.

[01:16:58] Yeah, but what would be the advantage to doing that?

[01:17:00] Well, you wouldn't remember.

[01:17:01] If it was DC, if it was 20 volts DC, it would be like 40 degrees AC almost.

[01:17:07] Right.

[01:17:08] Right.

[01:17:09] So, did you ever say to Williams, we should go DC?

[01:17:12] No.

[01:17:13] You just knew it wasn't going to happen.

[01:17:15] I had enough trouble making games without worrying about electrical.

[01:17:19] Because I would tell them what I want and I give them the layout of the game of electrical wiring to the game to somebody else.

[01:17:27] Now, beat time.

[01:17:31] When you design beat time, which is kind of has the bootles, which was to take off on the beetles at the time.

[01:17:39] Right.

[01:17:40] I mean, how did you feel about that?

[01:17:41] Yeah, that was pretty good.

[01:17:42] I'll tell you what, there was a story behind that.

[01:17:45] I think they released 3000.

[01:17:50] That was a good run.

[01:17:51] Right, good game.

[01:17:52] Yeah.

[01:17:53] And then Sam Stern comes to me and says, well, I don't know.

[01:17:59] I think we could sell many more of these.

[01:18:02] But I don't want to release only a couple hundred more.

[01:18:05] I said, Sam, how far are you?

[01:18:07] I'd release another thousand of these games.

[01:18:09] I know a good game when I build one.

[01:18:12] He said, what are you talking about?

[01:18:15] I've already got 3000 sold.

[01:18:18] That's good for me.

[01:18:19] We work on the next one.

[01:18:21] He said, I just been with the only real estate when I was a couple hundred.

[01:18:24] I released a thousand.

[01:18:25] He said, well, if I don't sell them, would you pay for them?

[01:18:29] Yeah, I says I'll pay for them.

[01:18:31] Really?

[01:18:32] Yeah.

[01:18:33] But he still didn't do it.

[01:18:34] So he released a thousand.

[01:18:35] And he sold all a thousand which he had more.

[01:18:39] So what happens if he didn't sell that thousand?

[01:18:42] Yeah, that was the way it was.

[01:18:44] You were bluffing him.

[01:18:47] You were bluffing him.

[01:18:48] The game was a good game.

[01:18:49] Oh, yeah.

[01:18:50] And with the tie-in to the Beatles.

[01:18:53] Sure, it was attractive.

[01:18:55] Right.

[01:18:56] Now, did you get into any legal trouble with the tie-in to the Beatles?

[01:18:59] Never.

[01:19:00] Never.

[01:19:01] Nothing.

[01:19:02] So nobody from the Beatles contacted you.

[01:19:04] No, no.

[01:19:05] Boy, that was the old days.

[01:19:06] Okay.

[01:19:07] Now, talk about the horsey games.

[01:19:09] Derby Day came out first.

[01:19:12] And that was the one where the horses were in the back box,

[01:19:15] opposed to the play field.

[01:19:17] What, I mean, tell me about that.

[01:19:20] I mean, you, obviously Williams had, you know,

[01:19:23] they came up with Hayburners in 1950s.

[01:19:25] Why?

[01:19:26] Nobody else had had that.

[01:19:27] Right.

[01:19:28] Nobody else did horsey games.

[01:19:29] At least not in a pin game fashion.

[01:19:31] So what made you, you know, go back to the 50s and kind of like,

[01:19:35] bring this design back and decide to re, you know,

[01:19:38] to re-release this?

[01:19:39] Well, because, because we still had the,

[01:19:41] a lot of those goddamn units laying around them,

[01:19:45] maybe 50, 60 units laid out.

[01:19:47] And there was a lot of equipment in that dog on the thing.

[01:19:50] I thought I'd give it a shot and see what happened.

[01:19:52] And worked out real good.

[01:19:53] It sold well, right?

[01:19:54] Oh, sure.

[01:19:55] Okay.

[01:19:56] Because then you had Hayburners 2 that came out,

[01:20:01] which again was a similar, well, actually,

[01:20:04] it was the same unit in the back box.

[01:20:06] Yeah.

[01:20:07] Two player, I had the horseies, slightly different play field.

[01:20:12] So you must have done really well with Derby Day

[01:20:15] that you bring out Hayburners 2.

[01:20:17] But the one, well, you want to remember the Hayburners,

[01:20:20] you look at the bottom and the new type of the flipper.

[01:20:24] I heard you're flipper.

[01:20:25] I have the three inch flipper.

[01:20:26] Now, were you responsible for three inch flipper?

[01:20:28] That was your idea?

[01:20:29] No, I don't know if it was my idea, but it's there.

[01:20:32] Right.

[01:20:33] Right.

[01:20:34] Now, how did you feel about the three inch flipper

[01:20:36] versus the older two inch?

[01:20:37] Well, it was nice, but more fun to control.

[01:20:40] Yeah, it was easy.

[01:20:41] So it was something I was very proud of.

[01:20:44] So it was unbelievable.

[01:20:46] The constellations across the top.

[01:20:48] Right.

[01:20:49] And then I also made another one for Italy called Planet.

[01:20:53] I see that.

[01:20:54] I see that.

[01:20:55] Now, you like this game?

[01:20:56] I've never even seen it.

[01:20:57] I like that game.

[01:20:58] I've never even seen either of these.

[01:21:00] Much less played them.

[01:21:01] Now, what about Olympic hockey?

[01:21:03] Tell me about Olympic hockey.

[01:21:04] Well, Olympic hockey, what happened is I made that game

[01:21:08] and Sam Stern didn't want to make it.

[01:21:11] He says, I don't like the game.

[01:21:14] I says, well, for crying a lot, I played like a son of a gun

[01:21:17] that's baking good.

[01:21:18] So what happened?

[01:21:19] Sam Stern was fired and went to a webbele or somewhere.

[01:21:25] And when he went out, I decided to have this game set up.

[01:21:29] They set this up and they sold us, goes like, game like,

[01:21:32] oh, hell boy.

[01:21:34] So he denied you making this?

[01:21:36] Now, when you say that, no, no, no, no, I had it, but I had it made.

[01:21:40] Oh, you did?

[01:21:41] But they said that, no, I don't like the game.

[01:21:43] I think we're going, let's go and make another one.

[01:21:45] Okay, so, on Olympic hockey, the, it's got back box animation.

[01:21:51] We're the puck goes back and forth between it.

[01:21:54] And it's basically a solenoid that pulls in with a canvas belt

[01:21:59] that goes around on two rollers and pulls the thing back

[01:22:04] and it's got limit switches for a goal on each end.

[01:22:07] And depending on which bumper you had, either the one's team scores

[01:22:11] and move the puck to the right, or the other team scores

[01:22:13] and moves the puck to the left.

[01:22:15] Kind of an ingenious back box animation thing.

[01:22:17] I thought it was pretty neat, my side.

[01:22:20] That was all your design?

[01:22:21] Yep.

[01:22:22] Now, when you designed a game in Williams, did you make whitewoods?

[01:22:26] I mean, how did this, how did this, how did the whole design process work back then?

[01:22:30] We used to make it dozen games.

[01:22:32] And with, without soap screening or with soap.

[01:22:35] All, all finished games.

[01:22:37] Okay.

[01:22:38] And, and, and set them up and start testing them to see how they played.

[01:22:42] Play them day and night.

[01:22:43] Got people, keep paid them to stay day and night and can't make records of the games

[01:22:49] to see how they scored, how, how many free games they got on the way we set it.

[01:22:55] And we, the, the, the determined how I was doing it, how well the material on the game

[01:23:00] would stand up, the new material that might be in the game, whether it would break down,

[01:23:05] it wouldn't break down.

[01:23:06] And that, to retest to that, we would send maybe four or five of them on location.

[01:23:12] Then, then, let the location see what happens.

[01:23:15] After they got on location and spent a couple of weeks there, and they were still working good

[01:23:20] and didn't break down, then we went into production.

[01:23:23] So, that whole process, how long did that take?

[01:23:26] Oh, that took time, that took time.

[01:23:29] Now, were you always doing it that way?

[01:23:32] Not, no, what we did, we were doing that for the last,

[01:23:37] oh, about the last eight or ten games.

[01:23:45] So, during the early sixties, you didn't put stuff on, like, have a test location to actually test games.

[01:23:51] You used to have them, do we do it?

[01:23:52] And with those, we only sent out a test, we did do the testing inside the house.

[01:23:56] Oh, you didn't do the testing inside the house.

[01:23:58] Okay, so, who was the guy that played two, three, four hundred games of Olympic hockey or whatever?

[01:24:03] We used to pay the guys that worked in the shop.

[01:24:07] You mean, on the line, the line guys?

[01:24:09] People put people, then minds coming and playing games.

[01:24:14] And we have all these games lined up in a place where it was not an engineering room,

[01:24:21] but away from production, and we playing those games.

[01:24:24] And they would keep like a log book of each game.

[01:24:27] What the score was, there was a sheet there for them to keep a log on it.

[01:24:31] Right, what the score, if they got a match, if there was any anomalies during the game,

[01:24:36] that kind of stuff.

[01:24:37] Yeah, right.

[01:24:38] Pretty cool.

[01:24:39] Huh.

[01:24:40] Now, then you did Winner, which Winner was a little different.

[01:24:45] There was another horsey game, but instead of having the horses in the back box,

[01:24:48] it was actually under the play field.

[01:24:50] And I wanted to make it out of Plexiglass, nobody wanted me to make it.

[01:24:53] They said, you're crazy.

[01:24:55] The ball will ruin the plastic on top of it.

[01:24:57] Nobody will be able to see the gun, I don't think, underneath there.

[01:25:00] I said, let me worry about that.

[01:25:02] I screamed the Plexiglass on the underside.

[01:25:06] Right, for the graphics.

[01:25:07] And put it graphics and put it on there and put it on location.

[01:25:11] And when all the beaten-data took the balls never seemed to show any wear.

[01:25:15] Yeah, I've never seen one that you couldn't see the horses.

[01:25:18] It seemed to work really well, actually.

[01:25:20] It's pretty amazed.

[01:25:22] Huh.

[01:25:23] So now we're getting into kind of the 70s.

[01:25:25] And I see this thing called match race.

[01:25:27] What was match race all about?

[01:25:29] Match race looks like some sort of horse game.

[01:25:31] It almost looks like a gambling game.

[01:25:33] Yeah.

[01:25:34] But it's not really a pinball.

[01:25:35] It's not a pinball at all.

[01:25:36] It's kind of an upright game.

[01:25:38] How did this game work?

[01:25:39] I haven't heard of it before.

[01:25:41] Match race.

[01:25:42] That one.

[01:25:43] And the only have, you don't have a flyer.

[01:25:46] Did you make this game?

[01:25:47] Yeah.

[01:25:48] You did make it.

[01:25:49] Was it one of those ones you only made a few of?

[01:25:51] That's right.

[01:25:52] Okay.

[01:25:53] Okay.

[01:25:54] And then, okay.

[01:25:55] Now, in Darling, and you did this in Jubilee.

[01:25:58] There's two guys.

[01:25:59] Two games in Jubilee and 18.

[01:26:01] Right.

[01:26:02] And then, in the center, it's got that upside down U,

[01:26:05] where you knock the balls over one side of the other

[01:26:07] to get the special or the same player should get.

[01:26:10] Was that your idea?

[01:26:11] Yeah.

[01:26:12] And what was the thinking on that game?

[01:26:15] How was that?

[01:26:16] That was really good.

[01:26:17] It was so good that we made a novelty model too.

[01:26:22] This was the game I was talking about.

[01:26:24] Star Action and, again, triple action, the William version.

[01:26:28] It had in the center, it had a plastic plan.

[01:26:31] Platter with two poles sticking up.

[01:26:34] And the Williams reused that design in a Rabian,

[01:26:36] Tales of the Rabian Knights in the 90s.

[01:26:38] Yeah.

[01:26:39] Papa Duke.

[01:26:40] Yeah, that was a Papa Duke game, I believe.

[01:26:42] But you were the one that came up with this design, right?

[01:26:45] What was the thinking behind this?

[01:26:47] We just come up with something.

[01:26:49] So I'm a little different, a little animated.

[01:26:51] Dream about it.

[01:26:52] Right.

[01:26:53] And then Skylab had the same Jubilee style thing in the center.

[01:26:58] A little chief.

[01:26:59] I see that game a lot.

[01:27:00] People like that game.

[01:27:01] Which one?

[01:27:02] A little chief.

[01:27:03] Oh, yeah.

[01:27:04] People really like that game.

[01:27:06] Black gold.

[01:27:07] That's an adipolism, isn't it all, and then space mission.

[01:27:10] I have the space, I have the two player.

[01:27:13] This is a classic game.

[01:27:14] That's a beautiful classic game.

[01:27:16] Now, the space mission space Odyssey commemorated the Soyuz,

[01:27:23] or the US Russia meeting in space of the space station.

[01:27:28] What was it?

[01:27:29] Soyuz versus our, I guess you'd call it our lamb.

[01:27:32] I forget what it means.

[01:27:33] Yeah, something like that.

[01:27:35] I mean, when you design this game, did they put the art on after you design the game?

[01:27:41] No, I went out and got the picture of the Soyuz and the sea from Texas.

[01:27:49] I got it from them who were at that time working on the giant, the giant, the two in space.

[01:27:58] And I gave that to the artist and they copied it.

[01:28:01] And they know nobody ever complained about it.

[01:28:04] Huh.

[01:28:05] Now, I see you have a Liberty Bell shuffle alley in here.

[01:28:08] What's up with that?

[01:28:09] Do you design the shuffle alley?

[01:28:11] Yeah, I have something to do with it.

[01:28:13] You remember what you do?

[01:28:15] I don't know.

[01:28:16] I just had something to do with it.

[01:28:18] Okay, no, here's one.

[01:28:20] Contact you.

[01:28:21] Don't see that game much.

[01:28:22] Well, yeah, that's the then F to that is the solid state game.

[01:28:26] Yeah.

[01:28:27] Where is that, is that Polcarino there?

[01:28:30] Okay.

[01:28:31] Let's talk about Polcarino.

[01:28:32] So, ten carry-over features, which meant if you were trying to accomplish something in a game and you didn't make it,

[01:28:40] it would remember on the next game.

[01:28:42] That's correct.

[01:28:45] And was that the first game to have that many carry-overs?

[01:28:48] Yes.

[01:28:49] Never made that many carry-overs.

[01:28:51] Have that many carry-overs.

[01:28:53] Okay.

[01:28:54] And you're saying that game did really well on location.

[01:28:56] Very, very well.

[01:28:57] Later, I called Steve up and asked him an additional question on the phone.

[01:29:01] The transition from a lecture mechanical to solid state in the late 70s.

[01:29:07] What was your take on that?

[01:29:09] You had designed all these 70s, you know, 60s and 70s machines in the 50s,

[01:29:16] all of the lecture mechanical, and then they came out with the computers, you know, around 77.

[01:29:21] I mean, what was your whole take on that?

[01:29:23] How did you feel about that?

[01:29:24] Well, the biggest and greatest thing that happened after is the slippers.

[01:29:28] I think the slippers were the greatest thing to change in the business.

[01:29:31] The next thing that was the greatest thing that happened in the business was the introduction of solid state.

[01:29:36] Why?

[01:29:38] We were able to do something on the game that we never could do in the lecture mechanical games.

[01:29:45] We could not make a two-player or a four-player game and carry-over features.

[01:29:50] There was no way we could do it without putting unbelievable numbers of relays and step-up units and so forth.

[01:29:57] But when we got into solid state, hell, we could carry over anything.

[01:30:03] That's one of the reasons why I told you about that pokerino.

[01:30:07] I was able to carry over 10 features on pokerino, any player playing, four players playing, two players playing, three players playing.

[01:30:16] But I never could do that in an electro mechanical game.

[01:30:20] So, to you, that was, I mean, but from a designer point of view, did it make, I mean, was it, did it make your job easier or harder?

[01:30:30] It made it easier because I could put features on a game.

[01:30:34] I could put more features on a game that would be more exciting than it would have been to have make it just a single player and forget about carrying over features on a single player game.

[01:30:45] Because what happened now that I've got solid state, hell, I could carry over all the number of features that I wanted to and it saved me money.

[01:30:58] Because I didn't have to go ahead and put the type of equipment that would have been necessary in the lecture and in fact I couldn't do it in an electro mechanical game.

[01:31:07] Now, how did you feel, you know, when you were doing the games though, within electro mechanical, you did everything.

[01:31:13] You did the point field design, the shots, the targets, the point values.

[01:31:18] I have to do it. I went out for that too. I had no alternative.

[01:31:21] But now you had these software guys basically doing all that for you. So, I mean, how did that, were you okay with that?

[01:31:29] Oh, sure. I didn't have no problem. I had no problem. I enjoyed working with anybody and everybody would help me with my games if I could get them to help me.

[01:31:40] And if they were able to help me electro mechanical mecca, electrically because of the solid state, I was glad to have them help.

[01:31:47] What about this game rat race that they, there was a cocktail table with no flip out.

[01:31:52] I'll tell you what, we had all kinds of problems with that we didn't build it. And so, Matt Tracer was a rat race.

[01:32:02] Rat race, yeah. Rat race. They didn't have, they just didn't have what it took.

[01:32:10] Yeah, some of these game numbers like on honey, you sold 6,000 honey's.

[01:32:15] You know what I mean?

[01:32:17] Jubilee's. 7,000.

[01:32:19] Do you know why honey was such a popular game?

[01:32:22] No. Because it was the first time, first time in the industry that anybody ever put a drop target in front of an eject hole.

[01:32:33] Over to hide it until you knocked it down. That's honey, unhoney.

[01:32:37] Right. I can tell you that because I remember that very well.

[01:32:40] Now what about superstar, 1972? They sold almost 4,000 of those. That must have been a good run.

[01:32:47] Yeah. Okay. And then Jubilee sold over 7,000, which of course had that reverse to you feature where you knocked the ball side to side.

[01:32:56] Skylab, same type of feature for you. You sold a lot of those, 3600.

[01:33:01] Starpool, you sold almost 7,000 Starpools in 1974.

[01:33:07] That's a pretty good run. I mean, all these games, you got some good runs.

[01:33:11] Now the black gold doesn't look like you really made that. It was a one player.

[01:33:16] We didn't make it. Yeah, I mean, it said, yeah. What happened with black gold?

[01:33:20] We didn't make it black gold. Why?

[01:33:22] We just didn't meant the name did go over it for about half an hour years.

[01:33:26] So did they get converted into something else? No.

[01:33:30] Little chief, you sold a crapload of those. Oh my God, 6300.

[01:33:34] And then you hit the home run with the space mission, space Odyssey, at like, basically 16,000 on those.

[01:33:41] And Grand Prix, almost 11,000. You hit the home run on that.

[01:33:48] Yeah, Liberty Valley, you didn't real well with that. The pinball Liberty Valley.

[01:33:52] Big deal. Now big deal, you sold over 7,000, big deals. These are good runs.

[01:33:57] Well listen, I had a reputation, I had some great run games.

[01:34:04] They made money on my own being on those games.

[01:34:08] Right. Any time they made anything over 2,000 games, they were cleaning up.

[01:34:13] Yeah, they were dancing in the streets, basically.

[01:34:16] You know, because that was... That's why Harry Williams little let me go.

[01:34:22] I would not Harry Williams with Sam Stern.

[01:34:25] Now, after 1978, 79, when you finished Pocorino, you basically didn't design any more games.

[01:34:35] You told Ticketack Toll... That's correct.

[01:34:38] Why? Well, because we had a chance to build something for redemption.

[01:34:44] Everybody was looking for redemption, tough redemption.

[01:34:47] And I came up with that idea on Ticketack Toll.

[01:34:51] And they sold, I don't know how many, couple hundred.

[01:34:54] And everybody I've talked to, they're looking for more of them.

[01:34:57] Because it's such a great playing game for such an easy, cheap price.

[01:35:02] Right. Yeah, I talked to Cameron Silver about it.

[01:35:05] And he said that he had some friends that had some in Location in Australia.

[01:35:09] And they said they'd still make hundreds of dollars a week.

[01:35:13] And he said they'd do great. But they said that they couldn't...

[01:35:16] You know, the... I guess the sales picture for like a redemption game is different than a pinball game

[01:35:23] that you have to be able to make that game over a longer period of time and sell it more slowly.

[01:35:28] Where Williams was used to just make as many as possible in a short of time as possible and sell them in math.

[01:35:36] You see, that's the reason why it's making so much money in Australia.

[01:35:40] And what I would say is because they didn't make it to give tickets, you know.

[01:35:45] There was a way that they figured out how to make a payout on those games.

[01:35:49] Oh, okay.

[01:35:51] Got to be a good payout game. Gotcha. Gotcha.

[01:35:54] But now, why did in 1979, did you basically stop designing games?

[01:36:00] What the hell? Because you know why? Because I let everybody out.

[01:36:04] Everybody else take over. And we're now, we're in the real solid state.

[01:36:09] The real solid state programs of games and everything else.

[01:36:14] And we had guys coming in like Steve Richie, a couple other good guys.

[01:36:25] And they were all making games that were really, really, really big games, you know.

[01:36:32] And that's what they wanted. That's what they wanted.

[01:36:35] And I was not interested in making the type of games they were making, all the wire farms and everything on it.

[01:36:41] That's not my idea of making good spin game.

[01:36:44] I don't like those type of games and I'm not going to design.

[01:36:48] But I was in charge of the whole damn place and up until I retired.

[01:36:53] Yeah, you were head up in more engineering, right? Right.

[01:36:57] Okay. And so from 1979 up to when you retired in like 2000, right?

[01:37:04] I retired in 1890, I retired in 1990, 1990, something.

[01:37:11] Up to then, you basically let these, let the youngsters as it may be design the games.

[01:37:18] And Larry Demar and I.

[01:37:21] Right. Because Larry was head of programming or something, right?

[01:37:24] Or whatever. Right. Larry was the head programmer as a movie.

[01:37:28] He was good night. I said, you take care of this thing.

[01:37:31] I'm just going to sit back and watch it.

[01:37:33] Huh. And Williams had, I mean, they weren't putting pressure on you to bring you back.

[01:37:37] Come on, Steve. Let's do a, let's kitchen and do a game.

[01:37:40] Oh, they always wanted me to build a, come on, Steve, one more game.

[01:37:43] This is, you've got enough guys here. Let them, right.

[01:37:46] You're making games. You're getting real good games with all these wire farms and wires and everything.

[01:37:52] Ramps and stuff, right? Ramps and stuff. I'm not going to make no games like that.

[01:37:57] Now, what about multi-ball? What how did you feel about multi-ball?

[01:38:00] There's a lot of those like the Steve Richie games or all large or like multi-ball games.

[01:38:05] But none of your games were ever multi-ball games.

[01:38:08] You know, I made the first one.

[01:38:10] Which one?

[01:38:12] 1963. Beat the clock.

[01:38:15] That has multi-ball?

[01:38:18] Come on. Let me see this. Let me see this.

[01:38:21] It's like you thought you had a fuller fellow asleep.

[01:38:25] Oh, I must have followed sleep on this one.

[01:38:27] With two balls on the play field at the same time.

[01:38:30] No, no, that is the first game that was built with two balls.

[01:38:35] Huh, and it was a manual ball load game.

[01:38:39] And so you would lock a ball?

[01:38:42] Yeah, and then get a second ball?

[01:38:44] Yeah.

[01:38:45] Now, how did that work? I've never seen this game.

[01:38:48] Well, the uptown town, if you didn't see it, there's your multi-ball game.

[01:38:52] And then beat the clock.

[01:38:54] Cool. Huh.

[01:38:56] If you locked the ball, see there was two inject holes.

[01:39:00] There were two holes on here.

[01:39:02] If you've shot the ball and you could put one here or one here,

[01:39:05] then you got the second ball.

[01:39:07] And then you were at the idea, it was to try to put the ball in the other one.

[01:39:10] So they have two of them together.

[01:39:12] Navier got something really big.

[01:39:14] And then it kicks them both out.

[01:39:16] Gotcha.

[01:39:17] Now, how can we never reuse that feature?

[01:39:21] I mean, like a lot of it.

[01:39:23] Because after that, everybody started making multi-ball games and wood and health care.

[01:39:27] See, you know, everybody's in that business.

[01:39:29] Yeah, ballet in particular really got a lot of mileage out there.

[01:39:33] Yeah, yeah. But what the heck?

[01:39:35] It was not a bad idea.

[01:39:37] No, it was a great idea.

[01:39:38] I think it's pretty cool, actually.

[01:39:40] You did some games with zipper flippers.

[01:39:42] You want to talk about zipper flippers at all?

[01:39:44] No.

[01:39:46] Didn't like that feature.

[01:39:48] Huh.

[01:39:49] Okay.

[01:39:50] So, now, so you had no problem in the 80s just letting these guys run with the ball.

[01:39:54] You know, the Steve Richie's of the world.

[01:39:56] Oh, design in the game.

[01:39:58] Steve Richie, Pat Lawler, Ward, Pemberton, Nardman, say all these guys that I had working it.

[01:40:11] And Mark Richie was the next group.

[01:40:14] And Barry Ausler was there too.

[01:40:17] Right.

[01:40:18] I brought Barry Ausler from the blind and started him and showed him how to build games.

[01:40:23] And he should see the number of games that he built.

[01:40:25] Oh, yeah. He built some great games.

[01:40:27] Now, tell me about that.

[01:40:28] You bought Barry in.

[01:40:29] Yeah.

[01:40:30] Okay, now, why?

[01:40:31] It was he could frame because not because I needed somebody to help me make games.

[01:40:36] There was, you didn't have enough designers.

[01:40:38] That's a panic.

[01:40:39] Huh.

[01:40:40] Now, why Barry though?

[01:40:41] He's the same thing with Mark Richie.

[01:40:44] Okay.

[01:40:45] Now, why these guys?

[01:40:46] Why these guys?

[01:40:47] Because I liked the way he'd worked on the line.

[01:40:49] He was a good tester.

[01:40:50] And I figured I could talk to him.

[01:40:52] I see if I can't talk to a guy and tell him what he'd do right and wrong.

[01:40:56] That's why I got rid of Pompidook.

[01:40:58] I can't talk to him and tell him what the hell he was doing right and wrong.

[01:41:02] Guys like that, I don't want, I never had working for me.

[01:41:05] You know, they don't at least take suggestions from me.

[01:41:09] They're out, you know.

[01:41:11] So, now, when Barry Azzard came in and Barry started making games, he went ahead and...

[01:41:24] Okay, let's start this back up.

[01:41:30] Okay, so you like Barry.

[01:41:31] You got a whole folder here on Barry.

[01:41:33] Oh, Barry made a lot of games.

[01:41:35] Started in 1978 with Phoenix when all the way up to 1996 with Junker.

[01:41:40] Okay, so now Barry was working on the line.

[01:41:43] He was a tester.

[01:41:45] He was a tester.

[01:41:47] So now, did you go to him or did he come to you looking for it?

[01:41:50] I went and picked him up.

[01:41:52] You did.

[01:41:53] And what did you see in Barry that said, hey, this guy can design...

[01:41:57] It's going to be a game designer.

[01:41:59] I could talk to him.

[01:42:00] That was the only thing.

[01:42:02] You could just...

[01:42:03] You could do communication.

[01:42:04] That's all, yeah.

[01:42:05] But how did you know that he would design games?

[01:42:09] Well, because I broke them in.

[01:42:11] I taught him how to make games.

[01:42:13] So, you brought him under your wing then.

[01:42:15] Absolutely.

[01:42:16] I spent time with him showing how to make games.

[01:42:19] And let's write and what's wrong and everything else.

[01:42:22] Yeah, so he had some that, you know, Phoenix, I got Phoenix.

[01:42:25] I actually have that game.

[01:42:26] I kind of like it.

[01:42:27] Phoenix, time warp.

[01:42:29] They're kind of just there.

[01:42:30] Laserball.

[01:42:31] Okay, but he hit it all on with Gorgar.

[01:42:34] Yeah.

[01:42:35] Gorgar was a serious game.

[01:42:36] That really did well.

[01:42:38] It was the first talking machine.

[01:42:40] Right.

[01:42:41] Okay, and then he did Solar Fire, another really good game.

[01:42:44] Boy, people have a lot of people left.

[01:42:46] So, let's keep going.

[01:42:47] Jumble Lord, another popular game.

[01:42:49] Keep talking, names.

[01:42:50] Time fantasy, cosmic gun fight.

[01:42:54] Ooh, defender.

[01:42:55] Okay.

[01:42:56] But he had a home run.

[01:42:58] The Joust.

[01:42:59] I love that game.

[01:43:01] The head to head, Joust.

[01:43:02] Whose idea was that?

[01:43:03] His.

[01:43:04] That was all his?

[01:43:05] Oh, sure he got that at a point.

[01:43:07] We got there.

[01:43:08] He was doing it going so.

[01:43:09] That's a great game.

[01:43:10] In Space Shuttle, of course, was the game that allegedly saved Williams.

[01:43:15] That's the one that was really good.

[01:43:18] That was his game.

[01:43:20] Yeah, that game he hit a home run with.

[01:43:23] And Williams hit a home run.

[01:43:25] Because they sold comment.

[01:43:27] Another one that he hit the home run.

[01:43:29] And then he hit the home run.

[01:43:30] And then he hit the home run for a godly, but for a belly.

[01:43:32] And everybody else that you know that?

[01:43:34] Right, because everybody wrote on the code,

[01:43:36] Coltshares of it.

[01:43:37] Because the pinball basically was on an upswing.

[01:43:39] Right.

[01:43:40] And then all the other companies got to ride on that.

[01:43:42] On that.

[01:43:43] Okay, pinball.

[01:43:44] Talk about pinball.

[01:43:46] I don't know.

[01:43:47] That's a killer game.

[01:43:48] Yeah.

[01:43:49] I like that game so much.

[01:43:50] I bought one from my daughter.

[01:43:52] But pinball was also, didn't Python?

[01:43:55] And you know, Python and you all have something to do with that too?

[01:43:58] Yes.

[01:43:59] All right, well.

[01:44:04] Do you want to call here?

[01:44:06] Okay, turn these back on.

[01:44:08] Okay, so now pinball was Barry's game.

[01:44:11] And I mentioned Python and you kind of had a negative reaction there.

[01:44:16] But what was up with Python?

[01:44:18] You didn't like Python?

[01:44:19] Python was very tough to work with.

[01:44:21] I heard that.

[01:44:22] Very, very, very tough to work with.

[01:44:25] Kind of a crazy guy, right?

[01:44:27] Well, I would say more than that.

[01:44:30] Fire.

[01:44:31] You know, he left and got married with a beautiful girl from Romania.

[01:44:35] You know that, don't you?

[01:44:36] I don't really know much about it.

[01:44:39] She took everything and left them.

[01:44:42] Oh, really?

[01:44:43] Oh, man.

[01:44:44] And then fire, that was another great game.

[01:44:46] Space station fire?

[01:44:47] Yeah, fire.

[01:44:48] That did well, right?

[01:44:49] I mean, that was a really good game.

[01:44:52] I own one of those for a longest time.

[01:44:54] I'll show you something.

[01:44:59] Space station, another good one.

[01:45:01] Cyclone, no.

[01:45:03] Now cyclone was a killer game.

[01:45:15] Now fire was Barry's game.

[01:45:18] But it basically had something to do with the Chicago fire in the early 1900s, didn't it?

[01:45:24] Fire 1900s?

[01:45:26] Yeah, didn't it have something?

[01:45:28] It did that happen in 1800s.

[01:45:31] 1800s.

[01:45:32] Okay, that almost the whole city burned down.

[01:45:34] That's right.

[01:45:35] Right, and this kind of comrade level, you want to say.

[01:45:38] But it was basically that theme around that.

[01:45:41] Well, do you know why I like this?

[01:45:43] Why?

[01:45:44] Because I was brought up in an era where I used to chase after fire trucks.

[01:45:52] And at my time, this is what they used to be.

[01:45:56] I'm talking about, I'm talking about 1915, 1617.

[01:46:05] This is the, didn't have no fire trucks like we have today.

[01:46:09] This is what they used to have.

[01:46:11] I was just chasing with these big kennels on it.

[01:46:13] I never could have figured out what the hell they were.

[01:46:15] They'd come riding with the noise and making it everything else.

[01:46:18] And you'd chase after them like a, further to see what the hell they were doing.

[01:46:22] And that's how I got, and as a small kid, I was a kid.

[01:46:25] I was five, six, seven years old down the street.

[01:46:28] I'd run after them.

[01:46:29] And I remember seeing these.

[01:46:31] Now, when Barry did this game, was this your concept or his concept?

[01:46:36] His concept.

[01:46:37] Did he know what the tie is?

[01:46:39] The one that started.

[01:46:40] I give credit to him for everything.

[01:46:43] I helped him with everything.

[01:46:46] But I eased it one.

[01:46:48] He's got to give him credit for that.

[01:46:50] Now, what about Cyclone?

[01:46:51] Now, another huge hit for him.

[01:46:53] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:46:54] Jokers, I see that game all the time.

[01:46:56] Police force.

[01:46:57] See that game a lot.

[01:46:59] Bad cats.

[01:47:00] This was like the last single ball game, but this was a really famous game.

[01:47:05] I mean, really cute game.

[01:47:07] But there he are.

[01:47:08] You see, you're seeing games of a guy that they went ahead and knocked off and laid off first.

[01:47:14] I've heard of all the people.

[01:47:15] I was so damn mad I could almost scream.

[01:47:17] Well, why?

[01:47:18] Why would they lay it down?

[01:47:19] Why would they decide that they get rid of somebody they really laid him up?

[01:47:25] He was responsible for the damn company being on a business.

[01:47:29] Yeah, Harley Davidson, too.

[01:47:31] That was a huge hit.

[01:47:33] Hurricane.

[01:47:34] Yeah.

[01:47:35] Not so much, Dr. Hew.

[01:47:36] That was a big seller.

[01:47:37] You saw the pod of Dr. Hews.

[01:47:41] Dracula.

[01:47:42] Great game.

[01:47:43] Great game.

[01:47:44] Really dark, though.

[01:47:45] Really dark game.

[01:47:46] Puppie.

[01:47:47] We don't even want to talk about that one, though.

[01:47:50] We did dirty Harry.

[01:47:52] And who done it?

[01:47:54] And Junkyard.

[01:47:56] And then in 96, that was the end, right?

[01:48:00] They laid off Barry.

[01:48:03] And you were mad.

[01:48:06] Yeah.

[01:48:07] Because he was the guy that you brought up.

[01:48:09] Did you bring up anybody else?

[01:48:10] Yeah, Mark Richie.

[01:48:12] Who did any of them?

[01:48:13] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:48:14] It's Mark Richie.

[01:48:15] Yes, Steve's brother.

[01:48:16] Sure, yeah.

[01:48:17] Now, why Mark Richie?

[01:48:18] I don't know, but I don't know how the hell we ever got him into January.

[01:48:22] He found himself in engineering.

[01:48:24] And I helped him in a lot of games.

[01:48:27] I had helped him with a lot of games that he had trouble with.

[01:48:30] And he was good.

[01:48:31] He was good, but he just didn't have the...

[01:48:36] Well, I don't want to talk about it.

[01:48:38] That's fine.

[01:48:39] He did some great games, though.

[01:48:40] Well, he did some good games.

[01:48:41] I mean, the Indiana Jones is a classic.

[01:48:43] Oh, hell, yes.

[01:48:44] Yeah, great game.

[01:48:45] Great game.

[01:48:46] Yeah, actually, all the games he did were really, really good.

[01:48:49] I have an Indiana Jones.

[01:48:50] It's great game.

[01:48:51] It really is.

[01:48:52] I mean, who else did you bring in?

[01:48:54] I didn't bring anybody else.

[01:48:56] Just those two guys.

[01:48:57] And those are the two guys.

[01:48:59] Well, it doesn't sound like you got along quite as well with Mark and you didn't interfere.

[01:49:02] I see.

[01:49:03] I got in some people that you wouldn't believe.

[01:49:05] You know, you know Mike Stroll?

[01:49:08] No, I don't.

[01:49:09] Well, he's the president of the company.

[01:49:11] And when we started working in Salted State, the company wanted to get somebody that had a Salted State background.

[01:49:18] So we went to California to one of the big Salted State companies.

[01:49:26] And we met this guy that I thought was going to make it.

[01:49:30] And I recommended him.

[01:49:32] And they brought him in and tried him out.

[01:49:34] He turned out good.

[01:49:35] And he was the president of the company for several years.

[01:49:39] Mike Stroll.

[01:49:40] Okay.

[01:49:41] Who else?

[01:49:42] Any other people like that?

[01:49:44] No.

[01:49:45] How about any of the artists that you brought in?

[01:49:49] I had nothing to do with it.

[01:49:51] Nothing to do with any of the art.

[01:49:53] Okay.

[01:49:54] Interesting.

[01:49:55] So what did you take a pinball 2000 when that came?

[01:49:59] It was good.

[01:50:02] But we're going into something that the regular pinball players never really enjoyed playing.

[01:50:11] I used to get so many calls from old-time pinball players.

[01:50:15] One of the health Steve, are you going to have a game made it?

[01:50:18] Like you used to make a drop target and stuff instead of all this wire farm and everything.

[01:50:23] And it takes me five games to learn what the health game is doing.

[01:50:27] So I played the game three, four, five times.

[01:50:29] I still don't know what the hell is doing, you know?

[01:50:32] And they don't, they don't like that.

[01:50:34] So I was responsible for helping make the last game before they went into the video games in the back.

[01:50:42] And that was Cactus Canyon.

[01:50:44] Great game.

[01:50:45] I love that game.

[01:50:46] And I was responsible for making Cactus Canyon.

[01:50:50] I like to drop the individual drop target.

[01:50:53] I was responsible for that.

[01:50:55] Because the front office said we have one more game to make before we get to this thing.

[01:51:01] And three guys are going to make presentations of games of forest.

[01:51:06] And I want you to decide which one we're going to use.

[01:51:09] All three guys came up with working white wood models.

[01:51:16] And I talked to these guys about that I knew, listen, good and drop targets.

[01:51:21] That's all I get targets, put in drop targets, put the dead track guides on that search end.

[01:51:26] Drop target was for put drop targets in the game, making with drop targets.

[01:51:31] All three guys presented games.

[01:51:34] The front office, OK'd one model, not Cactus Canyon.

[01:51:42] Really? What was that?

[01:51:43] They asked me, I said, I would do Cactus Canyon.

[01:51:47] Why would you do Cactus Canyon?

[01:51:49] You've got to stick it on the old rock because it's the kind of games that people want to play.

[01:51:54] Well, after a lot of kicking around, a lot of kicking around, they decided to go and Cactus Canyon.

[01:52:01] And son of a gun, they got so damn many of them that even today that got their game in sunny for a thousand dollars if you can find one.

[01:52:10] You get a thousand bucks for it.

[01:52:12] It's cool game.

[01:52:13] I really like it. I own one. I own a Cactus Canyon.

[01:52:16] I think the bad guy concept with the targets where you got to kill the bad guys.

[01:52:22] Yeah, I like that.

[01:52:23] That was a terrific one.

[01:52:26] And that's what I said is going to go over now.

[01:52:30] And for now, it was always says to me, geez, we missed the boat.

[01:52:34] We should have made more of it.

[01:52:36] Well, what the hell? I was telling you that time, this was what the people outside looking for.

[01:52:41] What people that were used to play in games are looking for.

[01:52:45] Now, what were the other designs that got rejected?

[01:52:48] No, there are those guys crappy stuff like stuff that Steve Richie was making and all the other guys.

[01:52:55] You know why are forms in a bunch of crap in there?

[01:52:59] I never enjoyed playing games.

[01:53:04] The reason is that is because I don't want to have to take 5-6 games to find out what the hell is shooting for.

[01:53:13] Oh, yes, but we light up these things and tell you what you should be going for.

[01:53:20] Well, that's good. But what do I do to get these things?

[01:53:26] So the guy that designed cactus canyon was Matt Coriel, who was a complete newcomer, right?

[01:53:34] And he was the one that made the presentation to you?

[01:53:39] He did not make the presentation. He was the one that was going to make the games and I said make it with a goddamn drop target.

[01:53:46] Okay. So he didn't actually come up.

[01:53:49] He wasn't one of the three guys.

[01:53:51] And that model that had no drop target.

[01:53:54] He said, you make a lot of that has drop targets and reworked the goddamn game and that's what Cache the Scania came up.

[01:54:00] I gotcha.

[01:54:01] Okay. Interesting.

[01:54:03] Huh. Now, when Pinwall 2000 came and Waller and Gomez come in with their hollow pin,

[01:54:11] and I'm sure you were in that meeting when they showed it to the engineering group, what did you think?

[01:54:20] Well, I was going to get to give my opinion. I was waiting for everybody else to say everybody was crazy.

[01:54:26] Oh, great game. Well, well, well, well. Okay. It's a great game.

[01:54:31] So you didn't really like the concept so much?

[01:54:34] Two compliments there to see the game off the line. You know, they took pictures with me off the back.

[01:54:40] Right. The last one coming off the line.

[01:54:42] So I took a picture with me of that.

[01:54:45] So that's why I was still in charge of the department.

[01:54:49] But Pinwall 2000 just wasn't your thing.

[01:54:53] Now, what about the cast role?

[01:54:57] I mean, which one?

[01:55:00] Neil or Ritzlou?

[01:55:01] Neil.

[01:55:02] The youngster.

[01:55:04] The young, the cast role.

[01:55:06] What's your feeling?

[01:55:08] I'm not looking at what?

[01:55:09] About Pinwall 2000 in the cast role and the whole management and how they reacted to it and ended up closing it, you know, before it even really got it going.

[01:55:19] Just let me tell you something.

[01:55:21] There's a lot of stories about Neil.

[01:55:24] And if I haven't got anything good to say, I might want to see you look okay.

[01:55:29] Come on. One hit or some knocks on Good Stories.

[01:55:33] I'm sorry, but I have to be very honest with you.

[01:55:36] That's fine. That's fine.

[01:55:38] So, yeah, you know, you can't add anything to like, were they cutting for Pinwall, you know, to close Pinwall?

[01:55:47] I don't know. I don't know.

[01:55:50] You know, but maybe when they made a couple of those later on games with the video jobs, it turned out pretty nice.

[01:56:00] I like it. I like it.

[01:56:02] Was that revenge?

[01:56:05] Revenge from Mars?

[01:56:07] No, no. It's Star Wars Episode One.

[01:56:09] Good.

[01:56:10] Wizard blocks?

[01:56:12] Revenge from Mars. Good. Keep going.

[01:56:15] That was basically it. I mean, there was playboy, but that didn't get very far out of thing.

[01:56:19] Revenge from Mars. I think that was the one that was so good.

[01:56:22] Yeah, I like the revenge.

[01:56:23] Revenge from Mars.

[01:56:24] That was, I think that was the best of the whole bunch.

[01:56:27] Right.

[01:56:28] But as far as the game is starting, I have to go by what, what Front Office was responsible for, for the problems that we ran into, in the major problems that we ran into Pinwall.

[01:56:44] And it was not the designers.

[01:56:47] It was the Front Office that was responsible for it.

[01:56:51] So you think the problem really was not anything that you guys were doing.

[01:56:55] It was the Front Office just wasn't giving you the support that you guys needed to really make this at all.

[01:57:01] It's a different thing. It was not the support that they did.

[01:57:05] Yeah, let's put it like this.

[01:57:07] They wanted to do something that we as designers didn't necessarily think was necessary.

[01:57:16] You can't make a pin game, every pin game with so many new features on it that it crossed Sodor Gondy much money that you can't sell it, you know.

[01:57:26] Right.

[01:57:27] And there was a demand for it, demand for it, demand for it, demand for it, which just didn't make sense.

[01:57:34] So the whole pinball to the end.

[01:57:36] So the whole pinball to the end.

[01:57:37] If you talk to people who are were designing the apartment and that, there's a lot of people that won't tell you.

[01:57:43] They won't talk too much about it because they just don't want to, you know, commit themselves.

[01:57:49] Right.

[01:57:50] Now I don't want to either.

[01:57:52] Hmm.

[01:57:53] Well, you know, it's kind of hard to get the...

[01:57:56] You know, one of these days you won't get the answers one something.

[01:58:00] Yeah, it's hard to get the answers. Nobody wants to tell the story.

[01:58:03] Well, that's because we all work for the guys.

[01:58:07] Right.

[01:58:09] Right.

[01:58:10] So there isn't really much that you can say then in that regard.

[01:58:12] Nothing good.

[01:58:13] I can say much about it for publication.

[01:58:16] So now I'm telling you how I will...

[01:58:20] I lived to this evaluation.

[01:58:23] So what happens that we went to the...

[01:58:26] Nick Coleman went into the...

[01:58:28] Dying.

[01:58:29] And a quarter was a great back.

[01:58:32] But it was a great back.

[01:58:34] Is it?

[01:58:35] We had to get off the dime.

[01:58:36] You know why, don't you?

[01:58:37] No.

[01:58:38] Because the damn dime after the...

[01:58:41] Those times, the silver times, we get so dark on thin.

[01:58:44] They wouldn't even register.

[01:58:47] They got right or jammed.

[01:58:49] We had to go into quarters.

[01:58:51] So now what do we do with the quarters?

[01:58:53] Oh, okay.

[01:58:54] So we had to make a quarter.

[01:58:56] We'd give you three games for the quarter.

[01:59:01] So now we get games all played a quarter.

[01:59:06] Well, we got away from it now.

[01:59:08] But all of this...

[01:59:09] Adjustments.

[01:59:10] No more adjustments.

[01:59:11] Almost quarter.

[01:59:12] Because we had to, because we're charging more for the games.

[01:59:16] Quarters working all right.

[01:59:19] Then we try to help to get half an hour.

[01:59:23] Where the hell you got half an hour.

[01:59:24] You may have no half a dollar, so you have to put a dollar in it.

[01:59:27] Right?

[01:59:28] So now we started putting dollars into the games to play so many games,

[01:59:32] so many games, so many games.

[01:59:34] And finally, the thing goes,

[01:59:36] Pat, because the dollar coin...

[01:59:38] The dollar coin, yeah.

[01:59:40] Not the dollar coin.

[01:59:41] The dollar acceptor was screwed up.

[01:59:44] All the bill accepted.

[01:59:46] Oh, it's slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly going to Pat.

[01:59:51] And there I am.

[01:59:52] First of all, the charge of designing vice president.

[01:59:56] And I was president finally of the game designing it to the department.

[02:00:01] And for a while at Williams, I was even on the board of directors

[02:00:05] and had tried to help get the games going.

[02:00:09] And everything was working all right.

[02:00:11] And we had like, totally under 70's, we had a great run of games.

[02:00:14] Because games were playing only for a quarter.

[02:00:17] But the games were still not too badly charged.

[02:00:22] But then we get it going.

[02:00:24] More expensive, more expensive, more expensive.

[02:00:27] Shit today.

[02:00:29] Guy doesn't get it. He does.

[02:00:32] He's not getting his money back in two or three years.

[02:00:35] That they're paying $4,000 for a game.

[02:00:39] So it's just surprising.

[02:00:42] And all hell that even Stern is able to last it.

[02:00:46] But he isn't making games like he likes them.

[02:00:50] But he has a cheap help.

[02:00:53] And he's got, I don't know, designers.

[02:00:55] He must be paying them just to know what games that he can make.

[02:01:01] And stuff like that.

[02:01:03] I go there once in a while.

[02:01:05] I know all the guys that are there.

[02:01:07] So I kind of hate to get involved.

[02:01:10] Because they ask me, why don't you make it again?

[02:01:13] You used to make so many great games.

[02:01:16] I don't want to get involved.

[02:01:18] Now, when Williams moved production,

[02:01:21] from California Avenue to Wachigan,

[02:01:24] how did you feel about that?

[02:01:27] Well, they only used it.

[02:01:30] The data is because they had to use...

[02:01:38] They had to do it with the unionized help?

[02:01:40] Yeah, unionized help especially.

[02:01:42] We didn't have to.

[02:01:44] They had three places that they were looking for.

[02:01:47] One of them, they almost per bought what I choose,

[02:01:50] which I discouraged them to buy.

[02:01:52] I won't tell you what the hell it was at.

[02:01:55] But the Wachigan deal was good because they could get people from Wachigan.

[02:01:58] And I don't only have people from Wachigan.

[02:02:00] They had them from Wisconsin coming in from Racine and working at this place.

[02:02:05] So basically the move to Wachigan was a union-busting move?

[02:02:09] Oh, yeah.

[02:02:10] It was.

[02:02:12] Because they didn't want to use unionized help anymore.

[02:02:15] Interesting.

[02:02:16] I thought that was the case.

[02:02:18] Once again, I asked some other Williams guys and they all...

[02:02:21] Oh, what do you want?

[02:02:22] There was a lot of people that went over to the work there, you know?

[02:02:26] Right.

[02:02:27] Right.

[02:02:28] So this is the story and the history of paintball,

[02:02:33] slow decline, and going down the drain.

[02:02:39] Do you think it'll come back?

[02:02:41] No.

[02:02:43] Why too late were intensive?

[02:02:45] The reason it won't come back is because we don't have the people out there that played the paintball games.

[02:02:50] Players are missing.

[02:02:51] Yeah, there are great paintball players that win their early shows that are playing our great...

[02:02:56] when we're at the shows that great paintball players in there.

[02:03:00] But they're not the kind of guys that go to a location and play that they got there and guess.

[02:03:04] We're earning on location.

[02:03:06] We're earning on paintball games on location today.

[02:03:08] Tell me.

[02:03:09] Right.

[02:03:10] Very few points.

[02:03:11] See, you go today to see a paintball games that you can play.

[02:03:14] Right.

[02:03:15] All right, Steve.

[02:03:18] Well, thank you very much.

[02:03:20] I appreciate you having me open.

[02:03:22] I'm a lot of fun.

[02:03:23] I just...

[02:03:24] I'm just glad that I got a chance to talk and tell you how I feel about some of this business.

[02:03:29] Do you have games in the basement?

[02:03:32] I have two of them.

[02:03:33] Can I photograph them?

[02:03:35] Come on.

[02:03:36] Well, you want me to do a cantball or a graph.

[02:03:37] I've got so much crap out of it.

[02:03:39] I can't see them.

[02:03:40] What came to you on the VJ?

[02:03:42] Jokers and Indiana Jones.

[02:03:45] Also, you got one berry and one mark game.

[02:03:48] Yeah.

[02:03:49] Not only that, I had four more, but I already gave them away to my kids.

[02:03:53] I got a comment I gave away to one of my kids.

[02:03:56] And I had the one that had the card game either...

[02:04:01] The poker game, which either is a nine ball or a reformation or a poker ring.

[02:04:08] No, no, no, it's another game.

[02:04:11] And then I had four of the greatest games that Harry Williams ever built.

[02:04:20] First of all, his first game, Suspense.

[02:04:23] Brand new.

[02:04:24] I built a...

[02:04:25] I also had the first game that he ever had a wire form on it.

[02:04:29] And I had the first game that he ever built with a disappearing jet bumper.

[02:04:34] Oh, oh, gosh.

[02:04:35] Oh, gosh.

[02:04:36] Yeah.

[02:04:37] I'm not sure.

[02:04:38] I've got a C-Wolf II with the same feature.

[02:04:41] I don't know if some of these that are showing in Liddellas Vegas.

[02:04:45] Oh, all to the pinball hall of fame.

[02:04:47] Yeah, because you had pinball circus, right?

[02:04:50] That was your...

[02:04:51] I mean, that was Python design game, but you had the pinball circus.

[02:04:58] And you gave that to the pinball hall of fame or loaned to them at least.

[02:05:03] So, tell me about the pinball circus.

[02:05:05] How did you feel about that game?

[02:05:06] It was a terrific game.

[02:05:08] It was.

[02:05:09] Except that the guy that laid out the bottom of the play field was not a pin game layout, man.

[02:05:13] Who laid out the bottom of the Python?

[02:05:16] Python.

[02:05:17] Okay.

[02:05:18] And it was only laid out like a pin game player makes a game at all.

[02:05:24] It would have been even better.

[02:05:26] But it's a great game.

[02:05:28] It's a great, great game.

[02:05:30] Right now, that game is taking into one dire play in...

[02:05:35] In Los Angeles.

[02:05:40] And there were two of those made, right?

[02:05:45] They need to have dollars a piece.

[02:05:47] So, where's the second one?

[02:05:51] You're not telling me, Ari?

[02:05:53] No, I know where it's at.

[02:05:54] But you're not gonna tell me, Ari.

[02:05:56] Okay, good for you.

[02:05:57] Just check it.

[02:05:58] I gotta keep you honest.

[02:06:00] All right, Steve.

[02:06:02] Thanks.

[02:06:03] I'd like to thank Steve Portack for allowing Topcast and I to come into his home to interview him for our show.

[02:06:10] It really was nice to see the man and person, opposed to doing this over the phone.

[02:06:15] It was a great time and a great interview.

[02:06:17] A guy that's just got tons of pinball history and tons of stories to tell since he's been in the business for 60 years.

[02:06:25] Steve is also going to be celebrating his 96th birthday in the next month or so.

[02:06:31] So, we're really happy to have him tell us all these great stories.

[02:06:36] So, again, thank you, Steve.

[02:06:38] And until there next time on Topcast, I'll look for you soon.
