[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.Marvin3M.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:18] Today on Topcast we're going to be talking to another Gottlieb designer.

[00:23] Somebody that started designing him all machines when he was eight years old

[00:27] and made his own machine when he was 12 and actually did a college project

[00:33] with a pinball machine and right out of college got hired by Gottlieb.

[00:38] So this is kind of an amazing story of how somebody that was in

[00:42] into pinball right from a very very early age and was able to make his dream come true

[00:47] and start working and designing games at Gottlieb.

[00:51] Special guest.

[00:52] Special guest.

[00:54] Special guest.

[00:55] I'd like to welcome John Osborne to Topcast tonight.

[01:01] Again John worked at Gottlieb during the 1970s and 1980s and he designed such great games as

[01:08] haunted house, the three leveled game.

[01:10] So we're going to be giving John a call right now.

[01:19] Hello.

[01:19] John?

[01:20] Yeah.

[01:21] It's Clay.

[01:21] Hi, Clay.

[01:22] How you doing?

[01:23] How you doing?

[01:23] How you doing?

[01:23] How you doing?

[01:24] Let's talk about your first tidings into pinball.

[01:28] I mean, you know, before you were at Gottlieb or whatever when you were a kid,

[01:32] were you a player or anything?

[01:34] Oh yeah.

[01:34] Yeah.

[01:35] I can remember my father holding me up like it was the balls rolled out.

[01:41] And there was just always something that there was something

[01:44] a whole different world than that glass somehow.

[01:46] And I like pinball right right from the start.

[01:49] I used to try to make things out of old doors or shirt boxes and with holes and

[01:55] or something like that.

[01:56] You know, try to get that sensation of ball rolling down a plate field and going into a hole.

[02:01] So you mean you were like designing games in your kid?

[02:05] Well, the first game I ever actually, the first thing I put together that was something like a

[02:10] game was, I think I was in the seventh grade and I took an old door.

[02:16] And for an arch, I used a piece of garden hose curved at the top.

[02:22] And I just had in mind some holes and balls falling to a hole and like push two wires together.

[02:28] You know, it lasted about 10 minutes but it was something to do at the time.

[02:32] So it kept the sensation of pinball.

[02:34] Never went into a cabinet or anything like that.

[02:36] It was just playing around.

[02:38] And how old were you at the time?

[02:40] Oh, probably about 12.

[02:42] Well, that's actually pretty cool.

[02:44] When I was, I remember when I was six, we went to a place that had a lot of games.

[02:49] It was a big bear, a resort in California.

[02:53] I'm not sure if this was the first time I had had this happen,

[02:57] but it was a major event because there was like three arcades in this town and it was not

[03:00] much to do because it rained and so we spent a lot of time in the arcades.

[03:04] And I remember noticing the differences.

[03:08] There's the way that, you know, on this game the ball comes up on the right of the shooter.

[03:11] On this game that comes up on the left and this game has a drop shoot.

[03:15] This game has a push shoot.

[03:16] This game has a little push shoot.

[03:18] And they were so different and I think that might have been the time

[03:23] that I noticed that some games had something really cool.

[03:27] Have these buttons on the side of the cabinet?

[03:30] Well, what, now what error is this?

[03:32] Are we talking this is the early 60s?

[03:34] No, the 50s.

[03:35] The 50s, okay.

[03:37] Okay, for some reason I didn't think you were that old.

[03:40] Anyway, it was just really interesting to walk up to a game and you know,

[03:43] does this game have flippers or not?

[03:44] You got to kind of reach around and see.

[03:46] And I think, I think, that was also the first time I had ever seen a bingo.

[03:52] And well, here was something that, you know, I looked at this game and I thought,

[03:56] there's nothing on it but it holds and it has these wavy springs along the side.

[04:00] Well, at that time wavy springs that an old game, you know, like in the 30s or something.

[04:05] Right, right.

[04:06] And, you know, what's going on here?

[04:08] They had all these games lined up.

[04:09] They all looked the same except the back glasses were different.

[04:13] And I remember my mom said, don't don't play these games.

[04:16] And they tilt too easily.

[04:18] Which is funny because she was not a tilt there at all.

[04:20] But I guess she couldn't get anywhere with them.

[04:22] And I'd play one month in a while and I think,

[04:24] you know, what's going on here?

[04:26] And maybe the ball hits that double flag spring.

[04:29] Maybe that'll do something, but I knew it wouldn't.

[04:32] So I just, I didn't get it.

[04:34] Where were you growing up?

[04:36] Where, where, what state was this?

[04:38] In Southern California.

[04:39] In Southern California, okay.

[04:41] And they had pingos in Southern California, huh?

[04:43] Uh, yeah.

[04:44] I don't know whether they paid off.

[04:45] I mean, whether you did anything with them, I have no idea.

[04:48] This was not LA County at the time.

[04:51] Okay.

[04:51] This was San Bernardino County.

[04:52] So that, that probably made a difference.

[04:56] And then when I was like in the junior high year,

[04:59] there was a famous peer, uh, uh,

[05:02] attraction in Long Beach called New Pike.

[05:06] And that was one of those great old amusement park peers

[05:08] that just had, they must have had 30 arcades there.

[05:11] They must have had a thousand games on that, on that pier.

[05:14] And then I, I know they had pingos there too.

[05:17] And it was just, only now I was old enough to,

[05:20] I, I walk up to a game and I hear this, this, this motor running.

[05:23] So I'm not going to play that game.

[05:25] Something stuck.

[05:26] I'm going to lose my money.

[05:27] And I still didn't know what was going on.

[05:29] Because there was just way too much stuff to read on the back glass.

[05:32] Way too much stuff to read on the instructional cards.

[05:34] And so again, pingos were just, what is going on here?

[05:38] Were those, you think those pingos were paying out then?

[05:41] Well, of course they paid out.

[05:43] I mean, they paid out replays.

[05:44] But what the location was doing with the replays, I don't know.

[05:47] Right.

[05:47] Maybe nothing, you know, maybe nothing.

[05:49] You just play them off.

[05:50] Right, right.

[05:51] And, uh, and then when I got a bit older and I could drive,

[05:54] I'd go down to my coin row, which is, which used to be the place on Tika Boulevard

[06:00] and downtown LA where all the, all the old line distributors were.

[06:03] And, um, yeah, I'd hang around there and they'd give me old stuff.

[06:07] I got a lot of old stuff just by hanging around there.

[06:09] But there'd be some old games like this would be in the late 60s.

[06:13] And here they have these old games from the mid 50s or so.

[06:17] And you know, they don't, nobody wants them.

[06:19] So how much is this flipper game?

[06:20] Well, this game is $50.

[06:21] Well, there's a baseball game over there.

[06:23] That's $75.

[06:25] Well, here's this game with all the holes and it's $400.

[06:28] What?

[06:29] Now what's going on here?

[06:30] And I asked them, I'd say, well, we can't talk to you about that because it's gambling.

[06:35] You're under age.

[06:36] So it took me 15 years to find out what thing goes wrong about.

[06:39] And I've always had a soft spot for gambling in ball.

[06:42] Hey, Kacha.

[06:44] Oh, no.

[06:44] So now how did you get from Southern California to Chicago?

[06:49] Oh, well, uh, you know, I always wanted to.

[06:50] I was always interested in this.

[06:52] I did have a game when I was a little kid.

[06:53] We had a, a valley vogue.

[06:56] But when I was about seven to eight years old and then when I was just going in the junior high,

[07:02] I really wanted a game.

[07:03] I knew what was going on.

[07:04] I wanted a flipper game.

[07:05] And my dad found one for me.

[07:07] It was, I still have it.

[07:08] It's Chicago Coin Sally in 1948.

[07:12] And I acquired a few games here and there.

[07:14] But so I was interested in this.

[07:16] I, I built a couple of things and you know,

[07:19] fixed up and collected and whatnot.

[07:21] But then, uh, as the end of college started to approach, um,

[07:25] I wanted to work for one of the game company.

[07:28] I did stay out of school once semester and work for Port Tal Distributing in downtown LA.

[07:32] I'm going, whoa, which was the Gottlieb and Rocco Distributing.

[07:36] And yeah, what I wasn't going to do that for living,

[07:38] but I just, I wanted to work, work there for a semester,

[07:41] heading back into school because the draft wanted me in the worst way.

[07:45] This was during Vietnam.

[07:46] Right.

[07:47] And what, uh, what were you studying in school?

[07:50] Engineering.

[07:51] And what school was this over now?

[07:52] This was, uh, well, uh, I went to college and junior college down in Santa Monica.

[07:58] And then I went to, uh, got my degree at Fresno State College.

[08:01] Well, okay.

[08:01] Which is now Fresno University.

[08:03] But yeah, you know, mid in the, in the central valley,

[08:06] from my senior project to get my degree,

[08:08] I built a game from scratch, a full size game, which I still have.

[08:12] I built it from, uh, ironically, a bingo cabinet.

[08:16] We, uh, Fresno is an extremely rural at the time.

[08:19] It was still is when you get out of town.

[08:21] And I met somebody who actually said he had two old tin ball machines in his barn.

[08:25] And I'm living in the dorm at the time and my roommate said,

[08:28] let's get them.

[08:28] There was two of them.

[08:29] So we brought two games up to this shoebox size dorm room.

[08:33] And, uh, one of them I fixed up for him.

[08:35] They were both the same bingo of valley beauty.

[08:38] And the other one, I started taking a part.

[08:40] This was going to be my game.

[08:43] So I established all the realies and, you know, stuff like that.

[08:46] But it mostly the cabinet.

[08:48] And, uh, that was my senior project.

[08:50] I built it completely from scratch.

[08:52] I even made my own wire because I got wire out of the machine, of course.

[08:56] And, uh, you know, old wire is all, all turns yellow.

[08:59] So I would take, I needed, I needed a wire safe with a unique color.

[09:04] So I take this yellow wire, stretch it out to the length I want,

[09:06] and start putting bands on it with marks a lot.

[09:09] I made my own wire.

[09:11] But it was, it's a real game.

[09:13] It's a full size game.

[09:14] The only thing that's not legitimate about is it's a novelty game.

[09:17] And there's no replay.

[09:18] Because I didn't want to add that to the things of all the circuitry and things I had to do, you know.

[09:24] So on this game that you made for your project,

[09:26] what did it have any unique features or not so unique?

[09:30] What features did it have?

[09:32] Well, it was, uh, the shooter's on the left.

[09:34] I wanted to put the shooter on the left.

[09:37] And, uh, as it's called, fell paw.

[09:40] And, uh, mostly it's just standard game parts, you know,

[09:43] little, little Williamsville golly, a little new, little old kind of thing.

[09:46] And, uh, I've got just some arrangements of some post at the top, uh, and a,

[09:51] and a spring near the gate that's, it's from the bingo to kind of pay homage to the bingo.

[09:56] So there's a row of yellow posts at the top.

[09:58] Other than that, it's just the pop bumpers and kickers and flippers.

[10:02] The flippers are horizontal again, because I, rather than,

[10:05] then angled down, I wanted that, that wanted to, you know, again,

[10:07] the homage to the old game.

[10:09] And I built it to play to use the one and one eight-inch ball.

[10:13] Oh, a larger ball.

[10:14] Yeah, the old style ball.

[10:16] Yeah.

[10:17] Huh, now why did you use the larger ball?

[10:19] Because that's what was used in old games.

[10:21] I wanted to, I just wanted to do that.

[10:23] Huh.

[10:24] Even though it kind of slows down the play a little bit.

[10:27] Yeah, it's froze down the play, but the large balls, uh,

[10:30] in a way, have more bounce because they're more momentum.

[10:33] Right.

[10:33] More momentum.

[10:34] More momentum.

[10:35] Yeah, there's more weight.

[10:36] So when they hit something, you know, yeah, it can get a bit of bounce.

[10:39] Yeah, you know, there's, there's, there's pluses and minuses to both sizes.

[10:42] And they're, they're just completely different.

[10:45] Right.

[10:45] We had a game to behave.

[10:46] Anyway, so that was my senior project.

[10:48] And I started sending out resumes and they were,

[10:51] I had no way, Nia.

[10:54] He didn't, very helpful to me.

[10:56] Anytime I would write, took out me with some old questions and the Rod History,

[11:00] or I work and I get parts and everything,

[11:02] I usually got a letter from Wayne.

[11:04] And I must say he was, he was very kind to me.

[11:07] He really was.

[11:08] He brought me along.

[11:09] And then when I came time to write resumes, I, um,

[11:12] I sent a resume to Gottlieb and to Williams and the Valley.

[11:16] Now, in those days, when you wrote out of tight,

[11:18] tight, that resume, you had to leave a white space up in the upper left hand corner.

[11:24] So you could staple your picture.

[11:26] That is in a picture with a resume.

[11:28] Right.

[11:28] That's really another time and then.

[11:30] Yeah, sure it is.

[11:31] So I, I never heard from Valley.

[11:35] Williams said that I had to go down and I forgot what, what it was.

[11:39] It was from,

[11:40] remember I didn't quite understand they,

[11:42] they wanted me to go down to their distributor and talk to somebody down there first.

[11:48] Their distributor was truly, in fact, it was right across the street from Port Tal.

[11:51] I, I never, I never did it.

[11:53] But then Gottlieb and Gottlieb, they said,

[11:56] we'd like you to come and talk to it.

[11:58] When can you fly out?

[12:00] Really?

[12:01] Can you imagine that?

[12:01] This was at a time, you know,

[12:03] when they said that the employment picture for grad was not that good.

[12:08] And here Gottlieb wants to fly me out and interview me.

[12:12] Man, that was, that was an amazing weekend.

[12:14] Was Gottlieb paying for the airfare, too?

[12:17] Yep.

[12:18] Really?

[12:18] Yeah, they said,

[12:19] I've said, you know, when would be a good time for you?

[12:21] And we'll have tickets waiting at the airport in Fresno.

[12:25] And we'll set up set up the time and we'll meet you.

[12:28] Wow.

[12:29] Yeah, that's what I said.

[12:30] Well, in all those three companies,

[12:33] did you have a preference of which one you wanted to work for?

[12:36] Yes, I wanted to work for Gottlieb.

[12:37] I always had a, you know, a soft spot for Gottlieb.

[12:40] I never did even, I never rode to Chicago Coins because, uh,

[12:43] I didn't know about the company or anything.

[12:45] And I had the Sally game and everything.

[12:47] I was good products.

[12:48] But every time I got a letter from them,

[12:51] uh, it was written like, I don't know,

[12:55] like people that didn't couldn't write or something.

[12:56] They, they really wrote like they,

[12:58] no, they wrote my letters like my children.

[13:02] I wasn't sure what was going on there.

[13:04] They wrote these garbled letters full of misspellings.

[13:07] Uh, the, uh, I got the same letter,

[13:09] in different times, I got a letter from the same person

[13:12] who actually spelled his name differently both times.

[13:15] So, I don't know if I want to get involved with this.

[13:19] I think they were really bad with the typewriter.

[13:21] I think that's what that was.

[13:22] I can't.

[13:24] So, you went right, the company's letters.

[13:28] And what were you asking them?

[13:30] Oh, the, uh, the, I guess the standard deal then,

[13:34] you know, you would, you would say that, uh, you know,

[13:36] you're graduate in, uh, in engineering and you'd be interested in employment and,

[13:41] and, no, no, I mean, you said that you wrote letters in Wayne Nions would respond to them.

[13:48] What were you asking?

[13:49] Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[13:50] Well, uh, one time I was, um, I was building a game that I was copying.

[13:55] There was a bunch of games down at this new pipe place.

[13:58] And I, I say that because I think there were strictly local.

[14:02] They were, there was a big cabinet with a glass on top,

[14:04] and you would split pennies underneath the glass.

[14:07] And on, on the play field were, were, were, were rings,

[14:10] metal rings set into the surface.

[14:12] And if a penny contacted the ring and the center of the ring,

[14:16] it would pay off.

[14:17] They actually pay off in pennies.

[14:19] Okay.

[14:20] And then the, the, the play field would slide, would tilt up,

[14:22] and all the pennies would slide off and would come back and you start fresh.

[14:25] You could only get like three or four or five.

[14:28] So I, well, I need to build one of those.

[14:30] I, I, I could build one of those.

[14:32] I almost did, but one of the things I needed was, uh, half in the little, in the scoreboard

[14:37] to say what, how much you at one, you know, you know, inserts like play field insert.

[14:42] Right.

[14:42] And I had no idea where to get those.

[14:44] I didn't know, I didn't have a gotty catalog at that time.

[14:47] So I wrote to him and said, where can I get these?

[14:49] And he would, he wrote back and say, well, just, you know,

[14:51] if danger catalog, you could go down to Porto and over it through the distributor,

[14:55] things like that.

[14:57] And when I was building SouthPaw, I was not sure how I was going to grill all the holes

[15:02] for the pop bumpers.

[15:03] I know, I, I, I knew I catalogs by then.

[15:06] And I knew this was a complicated profile here.

[15:08] I might, I'm not going to do this, you know.

[15:10] So I asked Wayne and he sent me a drawing.

[15:13] He actually sent me a gotty drawing of that, of that profile in the wood.

[15:18] I felt like I had a piece of the company in my hand when he did that, you know.

[15:21] Huh.

[15:22] So he sent you a thing where you could make a template from it.

[15:25] Right.

[15:25] Exactly.

[15:26] Interesting.

[15:27] Wow.

[15:28] So, well, Wayne and I, I mean, it's hard to believe that this guy,

[15:31] you know, was designing games, running the, you know,

[15:35] running the engineering department and writing new letters.

[15:38] Yeah.

[15:39] Yeah, he's a busy guy.

[15:41] Yeah, I sure was.

[15:43] Well, what are the things I think he, he liked so is,

[15:46] is, what, let's see, from about,

[15:49] oh, I was about in junior college for a few years there.

[15:52] I was writing him letters, writing everything on our teletype.

[15:55] I was very interested in teletype and I got,

[15:58] if that time were surplus, was very common.

[16:00] And I had a teletype set up and I couldn't,

[16:04] but I couldn't transmit to him or anything,

[16:05] but I would actually use the teletype as a typewriter, you know.

[16:09] Well, it's all capital letters.

[16:10] You can't back up.

[16:11] You can't, you can't strike out, you know.

[16:13] And I would tell him that this is,

[16:15] I'm writing this on a teletype.

[16:16] Well, when I met him, it turned out he had been in the signal

[16:19] cord during the war as a teletype specialist.

[16:24] So that was, that was great, Fr.

[16:26] He knew exactly what was going on, you know.

[16:28] You were, you were ringing every bell, weren't you?

[16:30] That's so, yeah.

[16:32] Yeah.

[16:33] Wow.

[16:33] So now, okay, they fly you out.

[16:36] And, you know, how did that go?

[16:39] It went real well.

[16:40] I stopped over in Denver and then landed and they said they'd

[16:45] take me, and they said to take the shuttle bus to the hotel.

[16:49] It used to be a hotel, literally right next door to the plant,

[16:52] in North Lake.

[16:53] And I waited and waited and waited.

[16:55] Nobody, nobody came.

[16:56] This turned out to be, this was a real,

[16:58] Ricky Tiki hotel.

[17:00] I finally took a cab and he, he picked me up that evening.

[17:04] And we went out to dinner to a real nice

[17:06] steakhouse in Elmer's.

[17:08] And that night I also met Bob Smith.

[17:11] It was the operations manager who used to be the chief

[17:14] engineer before Wayne.

[17:16] And, you know, I brought pictures of my collection and

[17:20] pictures of the stuff I built, pictures of South Pond.

[17:23] And we just chatted and I think we really hit it off.

[17:26] One of the things they did ask me, which I really

[17:29] would not prepare for at all, was, are you color blind?

[17:32] I guess they'd had some experience before with bringing people into

[17:37] engineering that, whoops, couldn't tell the difference on the wires.

[17:41] Nobody, nobody found that.

[17:44] Yeah, I got a friend that saw, he's got that problem.

[17:48] And he has a really, really hard time with,

[17:51] well, he can't read the colors off any wire because he's color blind.

[17:56] Oh, yeah.

[17:58] You know, so I guess, well, you know,

[18:02] a game, a little bit of dies by colors.

[18:04] You know, we had something like, like 78,

[18:07] or I forgot, almost like 80 wire combinations.

[18:12] Right. A lot of wires.

[18:13] No two were alike.

[18:15] Right, right.

[18:17] So now, you spend the weekend at Gottlieb,

[18:20] you know, talking to these guys.

[18:21] And did they make an offer right then?

[18:25] Yeah, yeah, they did.

[18:26] They said they were real pleased with me.

[18:28] If I'm real pleased with them.

[18:30] And then they made me an offer, which was actually more than what I asked for.

[18:37] What, what do you mean, you mean, you, they asked you for salary requirements,

[18:41] and then they beat your salary requirements?

[18:43] Yes, they, they say, well, we usually start our engineers office,

[18:47] and then they mentioned that salary that was at the trifle higher.

[18:50] I couldn't believe it.

[18:53] So you up didn't move all the way to Chicago?

[18:56] Yeah, now they did not, they didn't pay for the move.

[19:00] They didn't pay for the move.

[19:02] And we agreed that I would start to feel like the day after Labor Day.

[19:07] This was, this was in May.

[19:09] I was there on May 5th and 6th.

[19:14] And I was going to graduate that June.

[19:16] Now, what year was this?

[19:17] This was in 72.

[19:20] So what was your first day at work like?

[19:23] Well, it was the Tuesday after Labor Day.

[19:25] And I came in and asked told the receptionist, you know, who I was,

[19:31] as I was waiting, that I'm here to see Wayne Niles, and Wayne came out,

[19:35] and he just said, but I was there for the plant tour.

[19:38] They wouldn't take me in.

[19:39] He wouldn't take me into the engineering department.

[19:41] The engineering department was always locked.

[19:43] And he, even then, you know, he let me look to the window,

[19:46] but we couldn't go in.

[19:47] That was on a Saturday.

[19:50] So then I got to go in, of course, and he introduced me around,

[19:54] and I don't remember every detail of that first day.

[20:00] So did you have an office and stuff?

[20:03] At the time, yes, in fact, I shared Wayne's office,

[20:07] because one of the things he said he wanted,

[20:10] he wanted someone who could write a new instruction manual.

[20:15] You know, that manual that had been around that instruction and service manual

[20:19] was a catastrophe.

[20:20] They said it helps a lot of people.

[20:22] But, you know, as a writer, I looked at that thing,

[20:24] and again, I just, it's hard to know what to say.

[20:27] They need some time.

[20:29] And he had seen my, the report I did for my senior project,

[20:33] which was like the history and development of pinball.

[20:35] He had to turn in something in writing, you know,

[20:37] to get the degree.

[20:39] And he had seen that, and they liked my writing.

[20:42] So that was one of the first things I did,

[20:44] was to rewrite the service manual.

[20:47] Do you still have a copy of that?

[20:49] No, no.

[20:53] Why not?

[20:55] I don't know how I wish.

[20:56] I don't even have a copy of the report,

[20:59] the report that I wrote.

[21:00] That it teaches in it and everything.

[21:04] It seems like you saved everything else along the way.

[21:07] Yeah, I said everything else, right.

[21:09] But then they kept, they kept rewriting it and,

[21:14] you know, saying we want this and we don't want that.

[21:16] It was a big book.

[21:17] They wanted something much bigger than just a little,

[21:20] pamphlet that they had.

[21:21] And I picked it down and put it up.

[21:23] I put it down and pick it up now and then,

[21:27] then I got to doing other things.

[21:28] One of the first things I started doing was running cable.

[21:33] And whenever we do an engineering sample,

[21:37] which is the first time the drawings and the documentation

[21:41] is tested to make a game that still builds an engineering,

[21:45] we have to run a cable to see if the cable,

[21:48] if you see if the run is or right.

[21:50] And I remember doing that running,

[21:52] because we had wirewax and stuff in engineering.

[21:56] So I did that.

[21:57] I ran cables and this just general stuff.

[22:00] Let's see.

[22:01] What else?

[22:01] I think I did some drawings.

[22:03] I did some of that stuff.

[22:05] Didn't have an office stuff.

[22:07] So how did you get to, you know, designing your first game,

[22:11] which apparently forgotly was pro football?

[22:14] You know, hit the deck.

[22:15] Oh, well hit the deck came by myself.

[22:22] We had a room, a small room off of engineering,

[22:25] where we had games that we would play,

[22:29] because we had to test the games.

[22:31] We had to play the crap out and we'll see if they were any good.

[22:34] And say, Ed Krivnsky would bring in a game and, you know,

[22:37] here's a new game that needs to be played.

[22:39] We set up playing sheets and start playing it and evaluating it.

[22:42] Well, it might turn out that, say, this roll over over here is too tight.

[22:49] Can't get at it.

[22:50] What we need to do is move these posts over a little bit.

[22:53] So Wayne would tell me, okay, go ahead and do it.

[22:56] Go ahead and, you know, make change.

[22:58] Some of them were pretty involved, like they'd say,

[23:01] you know, we need to add a roll over here.

[23:03] That's going to do this new function.

[23:05] Well, the roll of play fields,

[23:07] and put it all the wiring, add a relay, you know,

[23:09] make it, you still build it like a real game.

[23:13] So, and then we had a, like, red line of the schematic.

[23:18] So some of the changes were pretty substantial.

[23:20] I did that for a while.

[23:22] And then we had a guy that was working on his job

[23:27] was making light box test fixtures,

[23:30] which was just, we just used a bottom board and put on a roll of lights

[23:33] and a roll of, like, just contact blade that you got

[23:38] by hand, and you plug this into the light box

[23:41] and it would test all the wires,

[23:42] but it's particularly in a single player light box.

[23:45] It would test all the decogon units, test the tilt switch,

[23:48] test every wire, every light.

[23:50] It was pretty simple, but, you know, that was his job.

[23:54] Well, one day when I wasn't there, I guess in the evening,

[23:57] today he and Wayne got to do a bigger argument.

[24:00] The next day he told me, he had to let this guy go.

[24:03] So this is going to be, in addition to your other duties,

[24:06] he said, you're going to be building light box test fixtures.

[24:10] That was my first real, real responsible job.

[24:15] And then I did that for a few years and then another guy

[24:18] that did all the foreign games that he was going to leave.

[24:23] He broke me and on his job, that was a very responsible job.

[24:26] Because our foreign games, we did not have one of those one size

[24:29] fixed ball cables, like the other companies.

[24:32] We had specific modifications for a specific country.

[24:36] And we had like run-in chain sheets and addition deletion sheets.

[24:41] And so like the game for France is only for France.

[24:45] Game for Germany is only for Germany.

[24:48] So that was a pretty responsible job.

[24:51] And it was some time around there, I think Wayne said,

[24:54] because I had been helping with the modifications of games and

[24:57] making suggestions about, you know, this game might play a little better if.

[25:00] And what do you think about this, Eddie?

[25:02] You know, he said, yeah, go ahead and make a change.

[25:04] Wayne said, you want to try to design a game by yourself?

[25:09] I said, yeah, sure.

[25:11] Well, go ahead and do a single player.

[25:13] And that's how Hit the Deck was born.

[25:15] Now, on the internet pinball database,

[25:19] they talk about Pro Football as you and Ed Khrinsky designed that game.

[25:24] But you're saying that that was an Ed Khrinsky game

[25:26] and you had a smaller role to play in that?

[25:29] Well, look, you know, I get, I have to,

[25:32] I get them confused.

[25:34] There's Pro Football and there's Grinire,

[25:37] which is which, do you remember?

[25:38] Yeah, Grinire is the two player that came out in 1977.

[25:43] And Pro Football was the wedge head that came out in 73.

[25:46] Right. The single player was Eddie's and that was there when I came along.

[25:54] And then a few years later, Wayne said to me,

[25:58] we need a two player version of Grinire or Pro Football, whichever.

[26:03] And he said, you know, I want you to make it.

[26:07] Okay, fine. Well, that game did have one thing in it that I thought was really, really bad.

[26:12] If you shoot the ball at the, I'm probably going to get this wrong.

[26:16] I don't remember exactly, but I think if you shoot the ball at the very target,

[26:20] and when the very target pushes the ball out, it will push it out.

[26:25] No, no, I strike that. That's not right.

[26:27] It is possible for the ball to go out the out-roll over,

[26:31] which gives you a full touchdown while the motor is running from scoring something else,

[26:36] and you don't get the touchdown.

[26:38] No, it was it.

[26:39] Yeah, you got cheated big time because the roll over would be hit while the motor was running from

[26:44] something else. Right.

[26:46] And that really, that was one of the worst things I ever saw in a game.

[26:49] And I said, I'm sorry, I could have said, if I ever, in a position to design a feature like that,

[26:54] I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen. And here Wayne Hensley, this game,

[26:57] it says make a two-player version of this.

[27:00] And so I did, I put a feature in there that would delay that roll over if the motor was running.

[27:06] I never told Wayne about that either tool it was done.

[27:09] In case you said, no, I don't want you to add another relay,

[27:12] because there was a lot of relay in that game, you know, being a center shooter multiple player,

[27:15] and there's a lot of circuitry for that.

[27:17] Well, and they counted the relay for the, for costing, right?

[27:21] Well, we counted everything.

[27:23] Excuse me. That was something else I had to do in the early days, yeah.

[27:28] When a game was accepted and we made the engineering draw,

[27:30] and made the engineering sample, we had to count the connections.

[27:36] That was a play field would have so many hundred connections, the light box would have so many

[27:39] hundred connections and so on. We count, that was four. I think that was for staffing.

[27:44] You know, how many people they needed out there on the soldering line?

[27:48] Because I think each person just sold it on a few, a few wires and then we'll go.

[27:51] They started on the same wires.

[27:54] And we counted, you know, one wire was one, and then 18 gauge wire was one and a half,

[28:00] and two 18 gauge wires was two and like that, and we kept it running total.

[28:07] Interesting. No, of course we counted the relay.

[28:09] They counted all the hardware naturally, you know.

[28:12] Now, how did they draw schematics? I mean, that would seem like, I mean, which came first,

[28:17] the chicken or the egg? The schematics or the game?

[28:20] Well, sort of, let's see, well, when I laid out a game, I have to, I think, I'm trying to think,

[28:27] because you're right, they both sort of had to happen at the same time, because when I would lay

[28:30] out a game, I'd lay out a play field that I thought was going to work, and then either before

[28:37] F-Ride real, it didn't matter. But for me to wire that game, I had to have schematics.

[28:44] So I would just start, you know, when I would do a hand sample like that, I would omit most of the

[28:51] tilt circuitry, you don't need all that stuff. You don't need the coin circuitry and all that stuff.

[28:55] But you do need some anti-tilt. You need tilt.

[28:59] And I would just hand draw it. You just hand draw it, and when I would, as I would build up

[29:05] the schematic, I would put the wire colors on, and then I had a table of all the relay and the

[29:11] motor, and as I would add a color, I would write that color on say, have a yellow green wire on

[29:17] the N relay, well, I put, under the N, I put yellow green, so that I wouldn't use the same color

[29:22] twice, because you're not allowed to do that. That was one thing that makes games, or least

[29:27] got any games, more serviceable, you never have the same color wire on the same component,

[29:32] unless it is the same wire. Right.

[29:35] And, you know, I just gradually build it up by that time, see when you lay out a play field,

[29:42] you have to have some idea how it's going to play. I mean, where are you going to put the hats,

[29:45] where are you going to put the lights and things, you have to have some idea what you want this

[29:49] target to do. And having that in mind, then you start with the schematic. So, there's sort of both

[29:57] built up together. Now, how did Gottlieb, like, as far as the wires and the wire colors,

[30:04] did they die their own cloth-colored wires to get those colors?

[30:09] Well, no, we didn't. There was the wire company that we bought from that did, which is

[30:14] very typical. Most wire companies have the ability to do that. I'm not sure if it was made in

[30:19] the basic colors, and then the local wire company just added the tracing and the modeling.

[30:25] I don't know. I don't know whether wire industry was at that point.

[30:29] Because I heard that Gottlieb, when they went to the PVC covered, plastic covered wiring,

[30:37] that Gottlieb actually had wire strippers that they could put the wire colors on the wires.

[30:42] That's right. We went to South of the state. We couldn't use the cotton anymore because of all

[30:47] the connectors, where IDP. We went to plastic, and I guess it was decided high up,

[30:54] there's no way we're going to get plastic in 100 colors like this. We bought all white.

[31:01] This wasn't here. This was the Fargo facility. They bought a three-stripe machine.

[31:10] I guess they had to use all the stripes. I don't know what they did that on purpose or what,

[31:14] but it worked out pretty well. The body color was always white. The first color would be 0, 0, 0,

[31:21] which would be three black stripes. Then 001, which would be black, black, brown.

[31:28] You had all your colors except for white. Interesting.

[31:35] When you did hit the deck in Neptune, which was the, one, Neptune was the adipol, and hit the deck

[31:41] was the replay, you used black score reels. Was that like a first?

[31:46] The black score with the red numbers.

[31:50] Right.

[31:51] By that time, South of the state was known in the industry.

[31:56] Merco had made their game and Bally was sniffing around. We knew it was coming.

[32:03] I think somebody got their idea to do these drum units to look like digital display.

[32:12] We weren't really trying to fool anybody. It was just to kind of jazz up the game.

[32:21] They hit the deck in the Neptune. Did you actually, when you designed this game,

[32:26] did you come up with those themes or were the themes handed to you or how did that work?

[32:30] No. In this case, no. The theme, there was no theme. In fact, I don't remember if I had any

[32:35] theme in mind for that. I usually don't because I'm not that good at it. I realize that any game

[32:42] couldn't have just about any theme. The only one I specifically set out with a theme was

[32:47] Blue Note, but that was a little later. No, I just made a game, made a single player game,

[32:52] and then I let the art department and management come up with a name.

[32:57] Did you pick the artist? It seems like all your EMs were used Gordon Morris as the artist.

[33:07] Who was doing it? He was the only one doing it. He wasn't at the company. He was over it at poster.

[33:16] They would just send over, you know, it would be a key play. Gordon would come up.

[33:26] We would let him know the theme, and he would come up with some artwork and he sent over a key

[33:31] plate, and then we would make a light box insert to match the key plate. Now, what is a key plate?

[33:41] A key plate is a backlash that is like a red wash on it, but it's transparent. It's like a transparent

[33:51] red paint on the back of it, and all the outlines of the artwork is there. In other words,

[33:57] like the circles, the five circles where the ball and play is going to be, the opening for the

[34:02] replay. In other words, it's like having a light box backlash that you can look right through

[34:06] and see all the light balls on the other side. This tells the person making the light box insert

[34:13] where the artwork is, where the illumination lights have to be, where the match lights have to be.

[34:18] It's like a single black line sketch of all the artwork on the back of the backlash.

[34:26] Okay, so then you can make the insert panel and then what you give the insert panel to the

[34:30] cabinet company and they take it from there, right? I'm sorry, what now?

[34:36] When you did that, then somebody in engineering would make that insert panel, right?

[34:40] Right, right. So yeah, our two-and-die person would make the light box insert that would

[34:46] match the key plate. And then is that handed off to the cabinet company and they would take it

[34:51] from there? No, most of our light boxes were standard. When I began working on a game, I would find

[35:00] an empty single-player light box, I'm sorry, empty single-player cabinet in engineering. So it'd be an

[35:06] empty cabinet, but a single-player light box in place because they were all wired safe. Thinking

[35:13] of a safe single-player, two-player, four-player, four-player, four-player, whatever. For engineering

[35:18] purposes, you could just plug into an existing light box. So you'd have to go to the light box every

[35:22] time. But once the key plate was done, then it would go back to Gordon and he could do the real

[35:30] artwork. And I think the, yeah, I guess the light box would have to go to the woodworking. I'm

[35:40] not sure where that came from. Now that you mentioned it. Now tell me about Strange World.

[35:47] That's what you did, right? Yeah, that was the second one I did. Well, there's really not much

[35:53] to I'm always, always striving for something different. I don't know what I'm after, but I'm

[35:59] trying to, you know, strenuously try to have something that doesn't look like the last game or

[36:05] the game before it. And so that's why it looks like it's such a huge positive arrangement. That's

[36:11] the only explanation. I wasn't, you know, you don't have any theme in mind or, you know, any,

[36:16] any setting up to accomplish anything in particular except novelty at all. All right, we're going to

[36:21] take a little break from talking with John Osborne of Gottlieb and we'll be back right after these

[36:27] messages. This portion of Topcast is brought to you by Pin Game Journal. Covering the World of

[36:33] Pinball is them online at www.pingamejournal.com. All right, we're back with John Osborne of Gottlieb.

[36:41] Yeah, now what about rock star and blue note rock star being the out of all version of blue notes?

[36:46] Well, blue notes, again, you know, time to make another game. And I've always been

[36:53] in mechanical musical instruments, automatic piano, music boxes, that sort of thing. And at that

[36:58] particular time, I was getting very interested in piano tuning because you can't work on a

[37:03] player piano or a nickelode, you know, having some knowledge of piano. piano, you've got to be

[37:09] able to do some degree of tuning. So music was on my mind at that time and I thought, you know,

[37:14] not be kind of any type of maybe like a scale, maybe eight target someplace, one for each note,

[37:19] something like that. And I laid it out, when I laid it out, I had the theme, the musical theme in mind.

[37:25] And that in that case, that followed through, you know, the Dolores Me thing for each target.

[37:31] And that's that they like, so they kept that theme. Didn't I write you about that?

[37:36] No, no, no, you didn't.

[37:38] Okay, all right. Well, this game did have a feature on it, but I really wish they had the

[37:43] captain. I realized now they probably could have used a flipper button, but at the top of that

[37:49] play field, there's three roll overs and they're not mandatory. You can miss them, but you usually

[37:54] don't. And you know, just ABC. And when I laid the game out, I had the free hats up there,

[38:01] along with three, I guess three red hats above that and a big yellow hat above that.

[38:08] And when the ball is at the shooter, I added a button to the front of the cabinet. So you could press

[38:13] that button and one of those yellow hats would light, you know, would just toggle as you press the

[38:17] button. The idea where these were five, they were five thousand points. The idea was you could call

[38:23] your shot. So you press the button until the hat that you want is lit. And when you shoot the ball,

[38:29] the button shuts off. There was a runway switch up near the gate. Again, they can start like

[38:34] bingo, you know, with the ball switch. And if you got in that hole, if you got in that roll

[38:40] over, you got your five thousand points. And then the hat went out, or even if you didn't get it,

[38:44] the hat would go out. The only time that feature worked was when the ball was at the shooter,

[38:48] so you could, in effect, call your shot. They didn't want to keep that there. I think they

[38:53] didn't want to custom-candet with that button in the front. And at that time, I don't think

[38:58] anybody had thought of the idea of using the flipper button for something like that.

[39:02] Well, that feature didn't survive. That's kind of a cool feature and it's one that,

[39:08] of course, was the mainstay of 80s and 90s and even present-day pinballs.

[39:13] I know, I know. It was so simple, just a relay, just an A.S. relay.

[39:19] But they didn't want to do it.

[39:21] So, was there any other features or ideas or even games that you presented to them that didn't

[39:28] get made? Oh, most of us made lots of games that didn't get built. Right from the start, I'd

[39:34] always been intrigued with what I call the subway unit, where the ball would go in a hole and

[39:40] come up someplace else. And I made a couple of games like that. They just, you know,

[39:44] had a lot of new hardware and new tooling and I just never came along. And then one day,

[39:51] I got the bright idea of using the ball return. The ball return, you know, about the way it sort

[39:57] of angled in a knee fashion. Well, how about if I straightened that out and then screwed that

[40:02] underneath the play field or something. And I tried it and they liked it. They really liked it.

[40:08] That's the game they became volcano. Oh, okay.

[40:12] The subway unit. And I didn't want to have a flap over it. They wanted to put a flap over.

[40:17] I really didn't like that because that did compromise the quality of the game. Sometimes the balls don't

[40:22] get out of there. And by not having the flap there, it was possible to shoot the ball into the

[40:27] into the hole. It was like like a pocket in the mouth kind of shot, which I thought was really nice.

[40:33] They didn't, they they want to put a flap over it. But that was the first subway unit.

[40:39] And then another one that I wanted to try was multiple balls. Not like balls of pop,

[40:45] nothing like that. But just maybe maybe two balls. And that was a force two. And where I did that,

[40:52] that was the old system one. I just put a kickhole right next to the shooter. So the out hole would

[40:58] kick the ball into this hole. And then the hole would kick the ball into the shooter. Well, that's

[41:02] what the extra ball was. And they liked that. That worked out. They didn't stick with that plan.

[41:09] I think they felt this might not work long term. They came up with something else. I forgot to

[41:14] hold the extra ball like that. But the force two was my game. And that was the first multiple ball

[41:20] game we made. Yeah. Now force two had a boatload of drop targets. That game's actually really fun

[41:26] to play. But none of your other games really had drop targets. But force two had a bun in several.

[41:34] I know no reason. Somebody asked me that recently. That's the funny thing you should say.

[41:38] I think if somebody asked me recently was the reason that my games don't have drop targets is

[41:44] because they told me to not spend so much money. Well, nobody ever said that. There was no real

[41:50] reason. I think I remember making some with drop targets that didn't get taken. They just

[41:55] just didn't. I think it was just coincidence. I think I was trying for it seems like every game

[42:02] that we made had dropped targets. So let's build a game without drop targets.

[42:06] Right. Well, Ed Khrinsky's signature trademark was drop targets, I guess.

[42:12] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now, how come you know during the 70s you didn't design more games. I mean,

[42:20] more games of yours weren't made? I don't know. They just decided that they didn't want these

[42:27] particular designs. I didn't design that often because I had other things to do. You know, I was not

[42:33] solely designing. Right. And that was pretty much Ed Khrinsky's role, right? Right. Yeah.

[42:39] Right. Okay. Almost made a game. You remember what's that game?

[42:45] Singalong, swing along that had the multiple hole kicker. Yeah, that would be, yeah, that'd be

[42:50] Melody Sweiss. Yeah. That game. Right. Yeah. I saw that in a catalog and I thought, you know,

[42:56] really we could do something with that. So I built a game with an extra window. Now there was

[43:02] a set of three holes that had four holes. I was up at the top of the play field and was angled

[43:06] and there was better being straight across. It was angled, sort of angled down slightly.

[43:13] And so it would kick from one hole, one hole, one hole. And then the last hole was a regular

[43:17] kick hole which kicked it down to a flipper. This was at the top of the play field. That was a

[43:22] good game. In fact, we're going to make that game. They were actually going to build that game.

[43:26] I don't remember either the rest of the play field, but of course, I surrounded the row of holes

[43:32] with some posts. You know, I was getting that that mentioned a bingo in there.

[43:37] And that feature worked really well. I had it. So anytime you got into a hole,

[43:40] it would either light or not light it would toggle. And the idea was that if you lift them all up

[43:45] and gotten the first hole in every hole that was lit, that would be a special.

[43:50] So that didn't happen very often. You know, that worked out real well. In fact, that's it.

[43:54] They were going to build that game and they were going to call that game on a house.

[43:57] And why didn't they build it? I don't remember why they didn't build it. I don't recall.

[44:05] Well, speaking of haunted house, now how did you get to designing haunted house?

[44:10] Well, we had gotten the game from Valley. I think it was called Genon. They had a

[44:15] bird. They had a tube over the play field that would carry the ball from here to there.

[44:21] And sort of like a double decker. And we didn't think it was very much, but it seemed like,

[44:26] you know, this could be something we need to at least address. And Gil, Gil Pollock,

[44:34] who got us in the Christie's office one time and he said to John Burris, he said,

[44:38] I'd like you to design a two level play field, a two level game. And he turned to me and said,

[44:43] I want to design a three level game. And I think John's game was Mars.

[44:50] If that's the Mars god of war, I think that was the game, the two level game.

[44:54] Or Black Hole. Black Hole. That's it. That's it. That's his game.

[45:01] And then mine was the haunted house. They wanted a three level game.

[45:05] So what challenges did the three level game present to you?

[45:11] The loaded question, right? Yeah, in fact, I wrote an article about that game.

[45:19] Well, just everything. You know, they said they did not want to make a special cabinet.

[45:24] That was the first thing. I didn't want to go and do an extra deep cabinet if they could help it.

[45:29] And well, first thing, you know, what are you going to do? You're going to have two levels below the

[45:33] play field. One above, one below. You know, you have to start thinking as not only as a designer,

[45:39] but you know, how are you going to engineer this thing? Are you going to put it together?

[45:43] If you have a play field above the main play field, then you're not going to see the ball for a while.

[45:48] Well, you know, what about that? Why are you going to deal with that?

[45:51] And, well, you know, what I ended up with for the handsample was pretty much what the final game was.

[45:59] Not much what you see. I thought to accentuate the fact of the three levels,

[46:05] the first thing the ball should do is decide which level to go to.

[46:09] So that's why there's those three holes up in the upper right hand corner of the play field.

[46:13] Left hand corner of the play field.

[46:15] Right, where you can go down, you can go up where you can stay on the main level.

[46:19] Right, right.

[46:21] And some of the problems I had was determining the size of the window for the lower play field.

[46:27] If it's too big, you got nothing on your main play field.

[46:31] If it's too little, you're not going to have enough viewing distance.

[46:35] So of course, like all issues in all engineering, it's a compromise.

[46:39] And I couldn't, for the same reason, I couldn't have kicking rubbers on the main level because kicking rubber

[46:45] stands out from the rubber line and that's like where the window would be.

[46:49] I thought about designing a new kicking rubber for that.

[46:52] But I had so many new things in that thing.

[46:54] And this is going to be a hardware nightmare.

[46:57] I better not venture into that.

[47:00] Yeah, I mean, like you had the trap door, that was a feature I've never seen before.

[47:04] Yeah, that was something new.

[47:07] And the vertical up kicker.

[47:13] The vertical up kicker thing, the fuck is it maybe?

[47:16] No, no, the target is right in the middle.

[47:19] You know, that it takes you to a lower level.

[47:21] Oh, the one that kind of like disappears?

[47:23] Yeah, that looks like a spot target.

[47:26] Right, right, right.

[47:28] That was something else I had thought about for years about some kind of roll down target.

[47:33] What could we do if the target bit of drop or just bounced the ball?

[47:37] What if the ball just pushed it down?

[47:39] But the problem is, no then what?

[47:41] Well, you got the ball inside of the target.

[47:43] Now what are you going to do with it?

[47:45] Well, now this thing came along and I thought, this is it.

[47:47] Now I'm going to use this thing.

[47:49] And to make it a surprise, I put it in between two regular targets.

[47:54] And it worked better than I ever thought possible.

[47:58] I mean, people would come in for management and they would hit that thing, not knowing what it was, you know?

[48:02] And the ball just disappeared.

[48:04] It just vanishes in front of a player.

[48:06] That was an excellent feature.

[48:08] In fact, I got an international patent on that roll down target at the time.

[48:14] Now how come they never use that again?

[48:17] Because it would probably take a two level game.

[48:20] Oh, yeah, of course.

[48:22] You know, it wasn't a two way that too far after that that, you know,

[48:25] the company, the whole industry started to go downhill and they just wasn't the will to make ambitious games like that.

[48:32] I always suspected that in spite of it's success, I had a hard house lost money.

[48:38] I don't know.

[48:39] It would take almost like a forensic accountant to really determine whether it did or not.

[48:44] But I, I, I, I bet management was glad to see the end of that game.

[48:48] You mean because it was just too expensive to make?

[48:51] I think so.

[48:52] You know, we had to have a, we had to move the bottom board.

[48:55] The power supply panel couldn't be where it usually was.

[48:58] So that meant a new cabinet, all new jigging for the, for the cabinet.

[49:01] Everything about that game was, was special and it was just like I said, it was so much new tooling.

[49:06] It was a, it was a beautiful game, but it was a heavy, over featured freak in terms of production.

[49:14] Now, did you ever think about making that game a multi ball game?

[49:19] No, no, no, no.

[49:21] No, no, no.

[49:22] It would have been, control would have been so difficult.

[49:24] It would have been just impossible.

[49:27] You might, might feeling where, is that if you're going to have a complicated play field,

[49:31] you better have a very simple play technique.

[49:35] On the other hand, you can have a very simple play field, and you can have a very complex play, like a bingo game.

[49:41] You know, but to have both, you're just going to play this, never going to understand the game.

[49:46] The play will never figure out what the heck you supposed to do.

[49:48] That's the way games are now.

[49:49] You can't understand what it is you're supposed to do on the first or second play.

[49:55] So, my, I want to interaction between the three play fields, but, you know, keep it simple, so you know what it is.

[50:01] What the heck is going on?

[50:03] Well, when they reprogrammed it, I think they took a lot of that out.

[50:07] They added a lot of stuff that made the game way too complicated.

[50:11] Now, what do you mean they reprogrammed it?

[50:13] Well, at that time, when we started doing Call of State games,

[50:18] whoever designed the game was responsible for programming.

[50:21] It's just like we were responsible for the wiring, you know, for making the rule.

[50:27] Well, at that time, when the haunted house era, thinktantor era,

[50:33] somebody got the bright idea that someone else, other than the designer, should do the programming,

[50:39] because they would have a fresh perspective.

[50:42] Well, I don't think it worked out like that at all.

[50:45] We had a guy doing programming that just loved complexity.

[50:49] He just more complicated the software the better.

[50:53] And they let him program these games.

[50:56] And there's some games, I mean, look, look at thinktantor.

[50:59] I remember when that game came out, they actually issued an instruction sheet.

[51:03] They ate in a half by 11 sheet.

[51:06] So the operator told me, tell them how the game works.

[51:09] I mean, it was just madness, you know, it was ridiculous.

[51:13] And haunted house wasn't that bad, but I'll tell you, there was some parts that came in there.

[51:17] So the day I don't understand how they work now.

[51:21] So I think a simple game with that kind of a complex mechanical aspect would have been back.

[51:29] I guess they gained it pretty well anyhow.

[51:32] Well, now, was it, I mean, how did you have it simplified?

[51:37] Like the basic premise to me of haunted house is on the main plate field.

[51:42] You've got those numbered five targets that you have to hit in order.

[51:48] You know, was that part of your design?

[51:51] I really don't remember how that game is supposed to play.

[51:55] You know, I assume you don't have your own haunted house, you didn't keep one.

[51:59] No, you know, I don't know, you can't keep one.

[52:03] I never knew anybody who had a new game, unless they got it through the distributor.

[52:08] Yeah, I remember these games are commercial items. They're commercial equipment.

[52:13] And, you know, how much of the game cost? Well, it depends on where you buy it.

[52:18] I say how much of the car would, but just to take a game off the line and take it home.

[52:22] No, that didn't happen.

[52:24] Because every game is going to be sold to a distributor.

[52:28] What about the engineering samples? What happened to those?

[52:32] Those would usually just get thrown in the dumpster.

[52:35] Well, we had a, we had a, like a compactor.

[52:40] And they would just chuck everything.

[52:43] Because, you know, the beat goes on.

[52:45] Here comes another game next week, another game after that.

[52:48] You just can't keep that stuff. So, it's just all that stuff gets trashed.

[52:52] Man, you didn't bring home an engineering sample?

[52:55] I did not. I can't believe you.

[52:57] But, you know, at the time, it just seemed like another game.

[53:00] It seemed like here's something that's good for the company.

[53:02] And now what? What are we going to do next?

[53:05] You know, and we just, we just move on.

[53:07] You got to remember, this was today.

[53:09] We weren't building games for collectors.

[53:12] Right.

[53:13] I know. It's so easy to say that, oh, I had one.

[53:17] Now, there is one game I really would like to find.

[53:21] Because there's only six other minigisters.

[53:23] The game called Grab it.

[53:26] Never hear that?

[53:27] No, who made that?

[53:28] I made it.

[53:29] G-R-A-B-B-I-T.

[53:32] We had all these video cabinets around.

[53:34] Even all video stuff was invented, though.

[53:36] We had these cabinets that thought, well, you know, do something.

[53:39] But they come sort of an upright game.

[53:42] And I made, I eventually made something like a kicker catcher.

[53:46] Or these balls, like, small little bit bigger than the chinklet balls,

[53:50] would drop from the top and go all through these tags and pins.

[53:53] And you had a catcher, like a pan, along the bottom of the play field

[53:57] that you moved back and forth with a crank.

[54:00] And you had to catch the balls.

[54:01] You didn't catch the ball with the score, you didn't catch the ball with the score.

[54:04] And there was the rollovers on this vertical play field.

[54:07] You could score and invent things like that and whatnot.

[54:11] And I did all the engineering on that.

[54:14] I did all the documentation.

[54:15] That was great.

[54:16] That was a lot of fun.

[54:17] But they liked it.

[54:19] They said, well, let's build some prototypes.

[54:22] And you know, you go ahead and give up for prototypes.

[54:24] We'll set up a prototype line in one corner of the factory,

[54:28] which has been done before in the old days.

[54:30] And that's how the one ball games, those daily racer games,

[54:33] were built in the early 1930s.

[54:35] Just over in the corner there.

[54:37] And we got artwork.

[54:40] The artwork was a picture, a lot of pictures of balls dropping from the sky.

[54:46] They're falling into a trash can.

[54:48] They're falling through a pizza with a guy's carry,

[54:51] like something like that.

[54:53] And the name of the game that they chose was grab it.

[54:56] And they set up a production line.

[54:58] And I think they used the system two.

[55:01] Yeah, must've used the system two.

[55:04] And we built six of them and we put them on location.

[55:08] I don't know who handled it.

[55:10] I don't know if it was in our distributing or who it was.

[55:12] But they put them on location.

[55:14] Of course they didn't set the ball on fire,

[55:17] but it was the last they ever heard of them.

[55:20] There's those six games probably still in the Chicago area.

[55:25] Now the vertical up kicker that moved the ball from the lower play field on

[55:30] haunted house back up to the you know the main play field. How was that a

[55:35] challenge to design? Yeah that was I knew that was gonna be a problem because

[55:40] you think about the lower play field flipping away from the player by the time it

[55:45] gets to the out hold down there it's very far away from the mid-level and so I

[55:51] did some experiments I I set up a bench a bench prototype of this thing and

[55:56] just see you know I keep it all straight up like that and I think I try to

[56:00] pop up a coil and he might it was pretty strong he might it was gonna work and

[56:04] it was pretty reliable. I might know now of course I should have had a special

[56:10] coil made it was like 120 volts something like that but that was the

[56:14] silly teal of the game certainly we found we found the operators were calling

[56:20] and saying that the ball would would pick up and then fall right back down and

[56:24] of course it would try again the process and would just keep triggering them.

[56:26] Well as the coil get hot the why the resistance of the coil goes up and it

[56:32] becomes weaker and weaker and pretty thin it says the vicious circle. The cure

[56:38] for that was to have direct wiring the all the solenoids in the game of course

[56:44] were driven by my transistors on the transistor PC board well there's always

[56:49] losses in that there's always voltage drop across the transistor so not all the

[56:53] power reaches the coil. So what we did we put a relay right next to the up

[56:58] kicker and on that relay we have huge tungsten points like we had on our

[57:03] DC pop-upers and kickers and we have the PC driver board operate that relay

[57:09] coil and then we had you know the so the wiring was local for that solenoid

[57:13] but there was no losses and that seemed to fix it that that seemed to do it

[57:18] because I recall I don't know if we set out kits or you know told our

[57:23] distributors what to do I don't know what was done in the field but from a

[57:27] certain point on we made all the gains with that auxiliary relay. So when you

[57:33] design this game it's got what like eight flippers do they like come to you

[57:37] and say eight flippers you know how much that's gonna cost? No they never did

[57:42] they never when they saw this they may but oh they they were very impressed by

[57:46] and they could tell you know they could tell by looking at it this is gonna be

[57:49] an expensive game and no they didn't they didn't say anything you know you

[57:53] told me it's all a three-level game with lots of features no they never said

[57:57] you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done that so they never did

[58:00] that. So they didn't try and say look you've got four flippers on the main

[58:05] plate they'll can't you just make it two? No no we never tried to edit me like that

[58:10] now did they you know in the in the back box you had that kind of lightning

[58:17] effect behind the behind the you know the screen glass. Yeah. Now who's idea

[58:24] was that? That was probably Rich Tracy the artist. For me it was just another

[58:29] light box you know again like I said we have standard light boxes and

[58:32] engineering and I just plugged into a standard light box. Rich Tracy our artist

[58:37] probably was the one who dreamed that a few dreams at the name too or he decided

[58:40] they were we're gonna use that name that we work of using another game with a

[58:45] kickers we're gonna use that on this game then there was yeah that's really

[58:47] out of my hand. So did you think that that haunted house title and theme fit the

[58:54] game while? Yeah I did I thought it was pretty cute you know it was a basement

[58:58] and the attic and everything I thought Rich did a real good job of the way it

[59:02] looks. Now what about the music? Who did the music? We had another guy that was

[59:08] brought in a couple years before to do sound and voice. Our name was Craig and

[59:14] he did that we had it and that was pretty much all he did he did the speech and

[59:18] things like that that was his speciality. Yeah because the music is really

[59:23] really cool in that game. Yeah yeah he did the music for Rocky and close

[59:31] with counters and things like that so yeah that was considered to be a big

[59:35] selling point at that time. Now the game did not have speech or it didn't talk

[59:40] was that something that you could that you could have had in it? I suppose it was

[59:46] a standard standard system yeah but that it wasn't you just didn't think of

[59:51] needed it? Well it really wasn't my decision you know I think they probably wanted

[59:55] to get this thing into production because it was so much tooling to be done they

[59:59] thought you know we've got enough here we don't need to go need speech I don't

[01:00:03] know I just have no memory of that decision being one way or the other. Now tell me

[01:00:08] about the trap door mechanism and how you came up with that. Well the trap door was

[01:00:13] based on a part that I actually found it was I can't remember what it was but it

[01:00:20] was some kind of device where it was a floor or something that was released it

[01:00:27] was released and pulled on the shaft and something I had the tool room built

[01:00:33] something based on this that I want to use it again it looks so cool and now I

[01:00:38] had a place to place to put it because if I open the trap door now I got a

[01:00:42] place for the ball to go it's like that rolled down target I have I have a

[01:00:45] destination for it now. Yeah I'm working on a got-leaved game from 1952 right now

[01:00:52] it's called Happy Days and it has that trap door where that's how it releases the

[01:00:57] balls to the ball tray it's really kind of it reminded me a haunted house.

[01:01:02] Really? Yeah why it heard something like that you know it had been used but I

[01:01:06] wasn't sure where it was okay that's the first clear explanation I've had of

[01:01:10] that thing. Yeah it's a pretty neat little feature. Yeah so now the the other

[01:01:17] thing that I noticed on on haunted houses you use these lighted posts where you

[01:01:22] know up along that upper ball arch on the left hand side there's like a two

[01:01:27] or three posts that have light bulbs underneath them what was up with that?

[01:01:31] Well that again something I had found in the archives of Godly I found a

[01:01:38] post that looked like a baby bottle nipple it was a post but didn't have a

[01:01:43] screw down the middle it had it it flared out and and you would install it from

[01:01:48] the other side of the playfield and it was flanged and the flange had

[01:01:53] screws holds in it. He screwed the underside of the playfield and that way you

[01:01:57] could put a light in it and again it's not you know why not that really looks

[01:02:01] cool and it's dark up in that corner I was going to buy a new one it's going to be

[01:02:04] dark up in that corner so I thought here's something I can try and if they don't

[01:02:09] like it it doesn't change anything. They want to take them out with regular

[01:02:12] posts there is not going to change the way the gameplay so I just put it in

[01:02:17] there as a little kicker and I'd tell you the truth I was surprised when they

[01:02:21] said yeah we're gonna we're gonna do that we're gonna make new tooling for those

[01:02:23] posts I was surprised that they bought that because again it's more money it's

[01:02:29] more doing. Yeah that whole game is amazing I mean it's got drop targets it's got

[01:02:35] you know the trapdoor it's got your your escape target I mean it's just got

[01:02:40] it's got new everything. Well that was kind of the idea yeah yeah it's rolling

[01:02:45] everything from the kitchen sink. Well I mean it came out really well. Well I'm glad

[01:02:52] you think so I guess everybody is kind of a kind of a cool game but if you

[01:02:56] need can certainly in the number of lippers it has. Right right. No that came

[01:03:01] to you know all around it's a great game too. Well I'm glad you like it yeah

[01:03:08] thanks. Well I mean there was nothing I mean even to this day there's there's

[01:03:12] no like three-level game that you know I mean maybe there was another three-level

[01:03:17] game I don't know but there's nothing like haunted house haunted house kind of

[01:03:21] stands you know it stands it all by itself I mean that's that that's like

[01:03:25] the of the 80s that's almost like the pinnacle you know. Well excuse me

[01:03:32] probably everybody in the industry looked at that and they thought are you kidding

[01:03:35] there's no way we're gonna think that kind of money into a game what got me to it.

[01:03:38] Well it was it I will say that it was it was it it's a complicated game to

[01:03:42] repair you know. Yeah yeah it's tough to repair we started hearing about that

[01:03:46] right away people you know they repair when they can't get up the power supply

[01:03:49] you gotta take out the lower playfield to do any work on it yeah. Well I mean

[01:03:56] I can always put the upper playfield up against the back box and then I can

[01:04:01] take the lower playfield and kind of swing it around so it's leaning against

[01:04:06] the upper playfield you can get at it it's just you gotta jump through a couple

[01:04:10] hoops right right and you know they weren't used to that in every other game

[01:04:13] those bottom boys right there you know I just more more work more labor and you

[01:04:17] know more time charging by the hour to fix those games. So other than like the

[01:04:23] vertical up kicker were there any other big issues that when that game went out

[01:04:27] that you that you first heard about as far as reliability. No I said roll down

[01:04:32] target and the trap or other stuff's pretty simple really I mean I'm glad everyone

[01:04:36] takes a clever novel but mechanically they're pretty simple you know turn around

[01:04:40] where that trap door is is there a role under yeah there is. It was laying

[01:04:45] that out I realized I wanted a large area so the ball would get in there easily

[01:04:49] but so how you're going to sense the ball because you don't know where the ball is

[01:04:52] going to be so I used a roll underwire for it would pretty much cover the whole

[01:04:56] width of the passage my idea originally was that it would be a surprise but the

[01:05:01] idea was you'd shoot the ball in there and at the last second the ball is

[01:05:04] whipping around it hits the roll under and suddenly the trap door open. Again

[01:05:09] another surprise for the player right and it doesn't always do that sometimes

[01:05:13] the ball just rolls around comes out and the roll under gives you you know

[01:05:16] 5,000 points or whatever but once in a while the trap door opens and bang the

[01:05:20] balls on the lower level before you before you even realize what happened and

[01:05:24] if you've set everything up then the trap door is open right right but you know

[01:05:28] it's open you see it's there right right because it uses like a flipper coil

[01:05:33] so they can you know with an end of stroke switch so it can actually hold the

[01:05:37] trap door open without burning the coil right yeah yeah now what about the

[01:05:42] pop bumpers the pop bumpers on the left side of the main playfield they seem

[01:05:46] very you know lonely as it may be well you you could see I didn't have a

[01:05:52] lot of room there because of that big window and where the where the upper

[01:05:57] playfield came down there there just wasn't a lot of room to put stuff head

[01:06:02] had some pop bumpers and have some action on the middle playfield all right it

[01:06:06] was sort of out of necessity you know that they are where they were now how

[01:06:12] much when did you want to leave of the got leave company that was in a four

[01:06:20] February of 84 now why didn't you design anything after hot house I remember

[01:06:33] that they they got under a cost cutting thing and one of the things that they

[01:06:37] wanted to try was to build a game completely with like oh parts you can

[01:06:45] believe that this is where management was at that time so we had a guy come in

[01:06:50] from like oh you know we set up something where you can have all the parts you

[01:06:54] need and all this and they told me to pick an old game that wasn't too

[01:06:58] complicated and I picked a single player sequence game with a playing card

[01:07:04] scene anyway I took that because it looked like we have a pretty simple layout

[01:07:09] and that civil society even more took out some of the sequence numbers and

[01:07:13] laid it out and built the whole thing with like a part and of course it was

[01:07:17] a disaster it played like it was underwater so that didn't get built another

[01:07:23] thing that I I thought would would work it was what I called the variable

[01:07:28] flipper this was a flipper that a single flipper that is on a slide that

[01:07:33] rotates back and forth across the cross the play field and you move it with a

[01:07:39] joystick on the cabinet and we rotate the joystick this flipper would slide

[01:07:43] back and forth and then there was a button on top of a joystick to operate flipper

[01:07:46] put that in the game that look right here we're gonna do it fact they actually

[01:07:51] started making tooling for that and you know by this time management was just

[01:07:56] aimless they would start something and then abandon it and they wouldn't tell us

[01:08:01] what was going on and they just wasn't a whole lot of stuff going out by that time

[01:08:06] and this was this was the Coca-Cola company was owned

[01:08:12] Gottlieb at this point yeah yeah so they were away because so you went through

[01:08:18] you went from the Gottlieb company with Judd running the company to Columbia

[01:08:23] pictures to Coca-Cola and now we're obviously you know there must have been

[01:08:28] some transitions there only in the the president you know Judd left and we got

[01:08:34] um what's his name?

[01:08:38] Bob Loom and I don't know who where he came from he was a Columbia person or

[01:08:44] what but he was kind of a cool fish I just you know he wasn't doing anything

[01:08:50] I think what it was just once Judd left you know in Alvin wasn't so involved

[01:08:56] and waiting at retire that they all sort of happened at once and all this

[01:09:01] institutional memory went with these people I mean truly the industry was

[01:09:07] changing I don't think there was anybody who really could tell them how the

[01:09:11] industry was changing that's one thing but the other thing was is nobody was

[01:09:15] caught long with that institutional memory nobody knew what to do with with

[01:09:20] pinball and the company just ripped it they they came in one time they came in

[01:09:25] to design a e-ball game in a cabinet understand it's cabinet in fact I used

[01:09:32] the variable flipper for that that was a good day they played the crap out of

[01:09:36] that why didn't they build it I don't know you know it just stated I built a

[01:09:41] baseball machine I built a pitching unit like well not a motorized pitching

[01:09:47] unit but a solenoid driven one and I used smaller balls and I had like the

[01:09:51] classic baseball game holds along the back of the play field you know the big

[01:09:57] hole in the little hole and I did a man running unit in light from the playfield

[01:10:02] and that worked really using the smaller ball a regular bat a regular flipper

[01:10:08] was really was like a baseball bat it would really whip that ball across play

[01:10:12] field and again everybody engineering played that game to the play field was

[01:10:17] just black and they'll just I don't know why you know I just I just don't

[01:10:21] remember hmm I think they were concentrating a lot on video we were sending

[01:10:27] all their setting the the talent and the attention over the Bensonville

[01:10:31] were pinning everything on mock three which was a good game but not pinball so we

[01:10:38] did try a few things we did try some arcade pieces but they never made it so

[01:10:45] what was the final straw that major leave in eighty or in yeah 1984 I didn't

[01:10:50] leave I was laid off I was thinking I was actually a

[01:10:53] sniffing around of a job I had my my hand in with some employment places and

[01:10:59] and then now they they called me in and you know told me they had to lay me

[01:11:03] up because of you know the conditions and I worked out okay because I've been

[01:11:10] there 12 years so I got about 15 weeks of pay you know that was too bad but

[01:11:17] that was the end and then I guess about nine months later they bolded right and

[01:11:22] then they got bought out by the distributors and change names with a my star or

[01:11:27] whatever it was no that was that was a premiere premiere yeah yeah got me

[01:11:34] premier yeah now we we had did my star at that time oh oh so you went through

[01:11:41] that transition too yeah my star was a Colombian name all right right right right

[01:11:46] my bad yeah they like that word they had remember they they had rastar which was

[01:11:51] race dark and they had some other star name and then they we came along and they

[01:11:56] called this my star we call we called it no star because you know being

[01:12:01] divisive about it because any of us new company history knew that any time

[01:12:06] again it seemed like any time like a game company changes name as the kiss of

[01:12:10] death like the Chicago coins so then where do where do you go after godly after

[01:12:19] godly by god hired a place in California that made plastic holes in tubing we

[01:12:26] made like swimming pool vacuum hose and vacuum cleaner hose so I'm still

[01:12:32] still an engineer I still got doing a drafting and designing and some electrical

[01:12:36] work yeah so your time at godly I mean did you did you really enjoy in what if

[01:12:45] they were still open today would you still be working there boy I don't know you

[01:12:49] know you just don't know because when I think about all the places I work since I am

[01:12:56] much better an engineer for having seen other industries you know I know about

[01:13:02] things that I would never know about if I just stayed at godly of course on your

[01:13:07] hand you know I would still be a godly so who knows you know maybe they do it for

[01:13:12] the best I don't know there's the industry is gone there's no doubt about it now

[01:13:18] you know there's just nothing left so I don't know I never I never thought about

[01:13:26] going to work for Williams or somebody else like that at the time right did you

[01:13:32] did you put out a resume to Williams or Valley at that time I don't think so I

[01:13:37] think I also had one of those non-complete contracts that wouldn't let me do

[01:13:44] that those turned out to be illegal but I think at the time I don't think I ever did

[01:13:49] interesting I don't think Williams was in all that great shape even nobody was in great shape

[01:13:56] that time right yeah was kind of an industry downturn then yeah you know I just can't

[01:14:01] imagine you know we've got to go out of business and you mean Williams is gonna hire

[01:14:05] and that's just isn't seem likely and then plus they were way downtown you know come on

[01:14:10] I really appreciate the time it's it's been great I mean you know your your stories I

[01:14:21] really like them I mean you got some really I mean just the way you got into the industry

[01:14:26] and you know went to college like you know it's just amazing how you how you actually got into this

[01:14:33] did you ever you didn't you never heard any of my talks at the expo learning them did you know I

[01:14:39] guess they didn't because I go to expo well you know I've been going to expo maybe the last five

[01:14:45] years and and you know I I don't think I've ever seen you there yeah I think it's been about five

[01:14:50] years since the last time I was there I may go this year but they've been kind enough to ask me

[01:14:55] to speak the last couple of times I went about you know the got me days and that that was a lot of fun

[01:15:00] that was that worked out real well well yeah how was the got me blanch lady what do you mean how

[01:15:07] well I mean how you know they they mean lunch for you guys every day right yeah it's in the cost two

[01:15:12] dollars a week two dollars and I mean even then that was the bargain we know that with that was

[01:15:18] cheap even then and the funny thing that the lady in the front office also were involved in this

[01:15:24] they only had to pay a dollar which was funny I don't know because I don't I look at those

[01:15:31] ladies I don't see how they could do this they found a premise of somehow they ate less

[01:15:36] she said that's sure wasn't the case that's great now what it was was she was that's all she did

[01:15:45] she came in and cooked that's not bad as we could snow it in the morning you know she cooked right

[01:15:49] from seven o'clock right right to noon and yeah there's only for the front office people and we

[01:15:56] only had a half hour for lunch because you know where are you gonna go you didn't go anywhere

[01:16:01] and it was she did it was a real real food in some ways it was it was like dinner it was almost

[01:16:07] too much sometimes but it was pretty good and you had to be on a good side because she was she

[01:16:13] was she was touching she you know she could be proud she would see fortunately she liked me she

[01:16:17] was German and I guess she had been through a lot of bad troubles during the war I guess they

[01:16:23] had tortured her or something she you know she she had a lot of a lot of stories a lot of bad times

[01:16:30] during the war that she was she was practically family she was you know almost and remember the

[01:16:36] Galilee family they loved her so much and then when the company we engineering moved to the back

[01:16:42] back of the building and started getting much bigger and you know when management started to

[01:16:47] outnumber the people on the floor they cut that out they they said they said to like people in my

[01:16:52] level they said well we're gonna give you an hour for lunch but you're not getting liars anymore

[01:16:58] so that that that I think only the very top people got got that anymore

[01:17:03] who did she develop the menu or did she or did you have some influence on that oh no she

[01:17:08] she would she would cook whatever she you know felt like cooking every day would be something

[01:17:12] different she had a certain repertoire you know we knew we knew we could we could smell like

[01:17:18] workshop well if you lose this workshops you know that sort of thing you know she had a she had a

[01:17:22] good rotation so they had a pretty sizable kitchen there got libe um it was uh yeah I was about

[01:17:30] the size of maybe a small a small like a strip pipe kitchen in a home you know you know

[01:17:36] another stove and covers and there was like a cook window now the other side of that cook window

[01:17:42] the small room where we all sat there was about about six round table and how long

[01:17:49] did she've been working at got libe oh forever you know you have to ask way that forever

[01:17:57] I've never heard of a company that had their own personal club no I haven't either that

[01:18:01] was that was pretty cool you know even the time that was a very impressive thing yeah well cool

[01:18:08] John hey and thank you again I really do appreciate the time okay I'd like to thank John

[01:18:16] Osborne a got libe for joining us today on top cast we really do appreciate his time and I love

[01:18:22] hearing his stories on how he was designing his own games as a kid all the way up to you know

[01:18:27] doing the haunted house for godly some great great stories and thank you very much John and I hope

[01:18:33] you'll all be back again to hear another episode of top cast
