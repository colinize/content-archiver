[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:11] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:20] Tonight on Topcast I'd like to welcome an artist that worked for Valley starting in 1976.

[00:25] He worked with other classic artists like Dave Christensen and then soon became the art director at Valley.

[00:32] He also did such a classic pinball artwork as Evil Canoeble, 8 Ball, Lost World, Playboy,

[00:40] Future Spa, Paragon, Space Invaders, Zenon, and Centaur.

[00:45] After Valley he did some games for Game Plan and Williams and then settled in in 1990 at Denees doing games such as

[00:53] Fan of the Opera, Back to the Future, Chuck Point, Batman, Hook, Royal Rumble, Golden

[00:59] Eye, and Twister.

[01:01] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[01:07] I'd like to welcome Paul Ferris to Topcast tonight.

[01:11] Again, Paul worked at Valley as an artist and a art director from 1976 up to about 1983 and then he did some work for Williams and Game Plan.

[01:22] And ultimately ended up doing work for Data East from 1990 up to 1996.

[01:28] Paul's done a lot of famous pinball artwork and we're going to talk to him tonight here on Topcast.

[01:33] So we're going to give him a call right now and see how he's doing.

[01:36] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[01:46] Hello?

[01:48] Hi, Paul, it's Clay.

[01:50] Hey, all right.

[01:50] You're an artist by trade obviously, but how did you get into art and how did you get into pinball?

[01:57] Okay, well, yeah, it's a little bit interesting.

[02:00] I went to college, was an art major in college, but then when I got out of college I was a teacher first.

[02:07] I was a high school art teacher and wrestling coach, football coach.

[02:13] I was a suburban high school here in Chicago area and in the wholesale high school.

[02:19] And I was doing that for about, I ended up teaching for about seven years.

[02:26] So that's how I started out as an educator.

[02:28] I always planned to go into commercial art, but then I enjoyed the teaching and coaching potential.

[02:33] I wanted to do that, so that was my way of kind of putting both those things together.

[02:39] And I actually enjoyed a great deal when the opportunity to get into pinball came up.

[02:46] I was a little reluctant to go do it because I enjoyed teaching so much.

[02:51] And actually, I'm back in education too, so I'm finishing my career as an educator and still doing work as an artist,

[03:01] but going back to teaching and coaching, which is for one of my first love.

[03:06] Now, where did you go to school?

[03:08] I went to North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, which is pretty close here now.

[03:17] And it was a small liberal arts college here in Naperville, Illinois, and I at night school.

[03:22] I actually have, in past years, I've actually coached wrestling over there at different times too.

[03:29] So it's been kind of an important part of my life after graduating from there.

[03:36] Now, how did you, were you always a pinball fan or how did you actually get into pinball?

[03:40] Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

[03:42] I, in the Chicago area, pinball wasn't even legal back in the time when I was growing up.

[03:49] So I hadn't even been around pinball as much.

[03:52] It was an interesting thing.

[03:54] When it went to Bali, it had just become legalized in the Chicago area.

[03:59] So it wasn't even something I'd seen them, but we just went around much.

[04:03] And they were, but the way it actually happened, I was, as I said, I was an art teacher.

[04:11] And then in the summer, I was, I was going to art fairs and I was selling my paintings and working as a working artist in the summer.

[04:19] That was my summer job.

[04:20] It was going very, very well.

[04:22] And my brother had run into Bill O'Donnell Jr., who is, at that time, his dad was the president of Bali.

[04:33] And he had, they were childhood friends and they were catching up on what, you know, what's your sister doing, what's your, you know, your folks.

[04:40] And that kind of stuff, and he said, asked about me.

[04:44] And my brother told me I was teaching and I was coaching and I was also having been, having a very successful summer job selling my artwork.

[04:55] And it just kind of, it's kind of a little light bulb and Bill's head.

[05:01] And he asked if, if I would want to come and talk to him.

[05:08] Because I guess at the time at Bali, they were doing all their artwork outside.

[05:17] They were sending all their artwork to be done outside with the exception of one artist that was working there.

[05:21] And it's a guy, his name you might know, his name is Dave Christianson.

[05:25] Sure.

[05:25] And he was, you've been doing some very, some nice work for them.

[05:31] And, but other than that, they were sending all their work out to advertising poster, which was a company that did everybody's artwork at the time.

[05:40] And they had this, Billy had this vision of bringing all the art department, or bringing art department into,

[05:47] and doing all their own artwork.

[05:49] So it would give it a little more of a unique style.

[05:51] And he was looking for someone that could do more realistic, a little bit less stylized stuff.

[05:58] At the time, it was kind of, more of a more cartoon approach, I guess you'd say.

[06:04] And he just remembered that I used to, he knew me as a kid and he remembered that I used to have this, you know, this ability as an artist.

[06:12] And we just learned if I was still doing any of that stuff.

[06:15] So that's how the seed was planted by Billy with, through my brother.

[06:22] And he contacted me and asked me to come in and see what I wanted to interview or talk about doing this.

[06:29] And I actually was very, very fond of teaching and coaching.

[06:33] I mean, I was, I just had no love of lifestyle.

[06:35] It really enjoyed working with kids.

[06:37] And so I was a little reluctant to even consider leaving it.

[06:41] But I did go in and interview, showed my artwork.

[06:46] And it wasn't even the pinball type so much.

[06:50] It just showed an ability to do, I was pretty much into drawing sports figures.

[06:57] And I could, I could draw people and portraits and that kind of work.

[07:01] And I actually could wish to be selling a lot of landscape paintings.

[07:04] And so not necessarily a pinball art, but it the ability to do realistic work was the main thing.

[07:11] I think you saw.

[07:12] And he also, Billy was trying to, as I say, set this art department up.

[07:16] And again, he thought somebody who was a coach, teacher might have the, I don't know,

[07:23] use a term stability if the right is the right word, but you know, artists can be kind of free spirits.

[07:28] And he was trying to come up with a pretty stable group of people.

[07:33] And any actually was thinking about bringing something in that could, that could set up in our department

[07:37] and be a coming art director.

[07:38] So I went in and interviewed and actually was not real excited about doing in the beginning.

[07:44] And then my wife and I sat down and talked about it.

[07:47] And ultimately, after a couple different discussions, I ended up going to Bali and kind of changing

[07:56] careers.

[07:57] And it was, as I said, a little bit nervous about it because I really loved what I was doing

[08:02] before.

[08:03] And I was pretty successful as a coach.

[08:06] That was one of my first loves was wrestling.

[08:08] So I went in and as we talked about what the possibilities were being, I guess the

[08:16] carrot that Billy held off for me was that not only would you be an artist doing Fimbal

[08:20] art that eventually within a fairly short time they wanted to set this art department

[08:26] up and I would be the art director.

[08:29] So that was the thing that kind of made it look kind of exciting to do.

[08:35] And I was not that familiar with Fimbal art at the time.

[08:38] So I had to kind of go out and kind of get caught up and see what the current look was.

[08:42] And when I saw Dave's work, that definitely encouraged me that they were serious about

[08:47] trying to kind of give it a little bit of a different look to Fimbal and actually make

[08:55] it more illustrative.

[08:56] And at that time, this was in the middle 1970s, about 1975, 1976 and we were around there

[09:05] when I was talking to them.

[09:08] Actually, record album covers, it's hard to even imagine.

[09:12] There used to be record album covers, but that was what were a lot of the best graphic

[09:16] art was being done.

[09:19] So for me, what to try to take artwork and for Fimbal and make it more like the record

[09:25] albums and some of the more labry illustrations that were being done at the time.

[09:30] So that was what seemed appealing to me.

[09:33] So that's how it all started.

[09:35] I went there and resigned from teaching and took the leap of faith and went to Bali and

[09:42] worked as a staff illustrator with Dave Christians and myself.

[09:48] And even at that time, there were still a few projects that were still going to advertising

[09:54] poster.

[09:55] But again, the plan was to start hiring our own artist and develop an in-house art department.

[10:04] And that's what we did.

[10:06] So you're was your, you know, I'm just looking at the internet, Fimbal Database and it

[10:10] says that your first product was the 1976 Knight Rider.

[10:14] Is that correct?

[10:15] That is correct.

[10:16] Because I did some work on, you get familiar with the process because the one thing I didn't

[10:22] have experience with was I was a fine art painter, as I said, an illustrator.

[10:29] But with Fimbal, you had to do work with ink and then with these, they have to cut the

[10:35] separations for stencils, the screen stencils for every color and there's a hand done

[10:40] process.

[10:41] You know, you didn't do it as a painting.

[10:42] You did it as an ink or what they used to call RubyLift, which is where you cut these

[10:47] with a knife.

[10:48] You actually cut these stencils for all the colors.

[10:50] So that was a little bit new for me.

[10:53] So I worked on a slot machine and I worked on a little bit of a Pimbal piece that went

[10:58] to Europe, but you know, just to kind of get familiar with the process.

[11:03] And then Knight Rider was my first Pimbal machine.

[11:08] And I think that right after I get to remember the chronology, but I think right after,

[11:13] and actually in Knight Rider, I actually, for models on the game, it was a truck driver

[11:17] and it was a, there's a waitress serving coffee to a truck driver, a big truck is all

[11:25] during the CB radio craze that was going on at the time.

[11:30] And I used my assistant wrestling coach who was the truck driver and a couple of my former

[11:36] students who were the waitress and some of the people on the glass.

[11:39] And so I just had a little bit of fun with it kind of like that and enjoyed the process

[11:43] of kind of bringing some people from my former life into the piece.

[11:48] And then we actually did a minor license for that for the CB radio because this was

[11:55] just when license games were starting.

[11:57] Tom Neiman from Valley was very instrumental in developing this whole idea of tying a

[12:04] license scene into the Pimbal.

[12:08] And I think the first one they did was Wizard, which was based on the movie Tommy.

[12:14] And that's one day of Christianson did with Ann Margaret and Roger D'Altry.

[12:20] So they were just developing this idea of license games.

[12:22] So in the Knight Rider game there was a CB radio company that kind of had there.

[12:28] We used their particular CB as part of the graphics in the back glass.

[12:34] It was like a minor license project.

[12:39] So that was the first one.

[12:40] And then after that I think it was Evil Can Evil if I remember right?

[12:43] Yeah that's correct.

[12:44] And now on Evil Can Evil that was obviously another license thing.

[12:49] And you must have been pretty happy that game sold 14,000 units.

[12:53] And here you go from working in high school to being like your artwork is being seen.

[13:00] God it's prolific you know?

[13:02] Yeah that was that's the thing that I think is one of the wonderful things about doing

[13:07] Pimbal Art and it came to me a little bit later when I got up to do and I think it was

[13:14] a playboy game.

[13:15] I started to get my first European travel, first European trip and I would walk into a

[13:20] bistro in Paris and there's my artwork right inside the bistro.

[13:24] It was very kind of overwhelming at first because here's your end.

[13:30] And one thing that's about Pimbal Art is a large piece of art.

[13:33] So a lot of illustrators who were very successful have their work in magazines and things but

[13:38] you just wouldn't be seen by that many people that size.

[13:42] So it was a large billboard artwork so that was a lot of fun to be able to have that experience.

[13:48] Now how did you do with the Evil Can Evil that you just worked from pictures or did you

[13:51] actually meet the man?

[13:52] Actually met the man.

[13:54] First of all we worked from pictures to do most of the concepts that in the early days

[14:01] what would happen you would send them whoever the licensed person was you'd send them sketches.

[14:06] But generally they would either come in or you would make a trip to make a final presentation

[14:10] to make sure they signed off and everything and we're happy with it.

[14:15] But I did all the artwork first as sketches that they approved, as managers approved.

[14:21] And then we actually did the final blast.

[14:25] This was really sort of funny.

[14:28] And before they were getting ready for production, Evil was in Chicago.

[14:32] Evil Can Evil came into Chicago and he was going to go and do a jump at the Chicago amphitheater

[14:38] and he would jump over a tank of sharks with his motorcycle.

[14:43] So that was a big kind of a big, one of his bigger publicity jumps.

[14:48] But he came into the factory and to Values, the corporate office there and came up to our

[14:53] department and looked at the glass and it was happy with everything.

[14:57] The only thing he was not happy about was I had done this graphic at the top of the

[15:04] glass showing that he was jumping over this series of buses.

[15:11] And I had the trajectory of the motorcycles incorrect as he told me.

[15:17] I had it in a complete arc but he actually said no, no, the last two cycles of this jump

[15:23] was kind of a sequential, you know, several motorcycles in a row that you would light

[15:27] up with individual lights and it would look like he was jumping over these buses.

[15:33] But he said that because the way I had the real wheel of the motorcycle, he would crash

[15:38] if I didn't have the front wheel up higher as he landed on the far side.

[15:42] So I made that adjustment kind of a good adjustment in terms of the graphic because it was

[15:49] more accurate.

[15:50] But the ironic thing is the next day he jumped at the amphitheater and he had, did you get

[16:00] he, and by sharks?

[16:01] Yeah, you remember the story when he actually, I don't know if you heard of that, but he

[16:04] was doing a practice run and he crashed and went to the hospital and never made the jump

[16:10] and they actually had a live broadcast of this jump.

[16:13] And I remember Teletel's Valleus and Jill St. John were the commentators.

[16:17] They were going to be talking, you know, as a host of the show about evil, because he

[16:22] was jumping.

[16:23] They had to fill this whole hour because he wasn't there because he had missed the tank

[16:27] or something and then it had a crash.

[16:30] I mean, he was alright, but he had still had to go to the hospital and recover, so he

[16:34] never made the jump.

[16:35] So after telling me he would crash, I thought it was a little bit strange that he had that

[16:40] happen to him.

[16:41] Yeah, a little bit ironic.

[16:42] A colorful guy.

[16:44] Now the one after that you did was eight ball and now this glass is a little bit controversial.

[16:51] Well maybe it wasn't at the time.

[16:52] I don't know.

[16:53] Tell me about that.

[16:54] Well, there's two things we're going on then.

[16:58] This is sort of what was interesting.

[17:01] Yes, I mean, you're talking about the fact that it kind of looked like Fonzi.

[17:04] I mean, that kind of thing is that.

[17:07] Kind of looks like Fonzi just kind of.

[17:10] Yeah, I mean, it was meant to be kind of, we, first of all, I don't want to minimize

[17:15] eight ball because eight ball turned out to be, I think, for the longest time the most

[17:19] popular pinball ever made.

[17:21] Yeah, 20,000 units.

[17:23] Talk about a hit.

[17:24] And it was a hit, but it was funny.

[17:26] I mean, in my mind, I was developing at this time.

[17:29] This was one of the more major contributions that we made as a company toward pinball

[17:38] graphics.

[17:39] In terms, it was at the time I was pushing very hard to get the company to try to do this

[17:45] four-color process printing.

[17:46] Now, nobody was doing that at the time.

[17:48] And it was, it ended up being a major contribution to pinball because it made it possible to do paintings

[17:54] on glass as opposed to just doing these ink drawings, which are kind of, I call it the

[17:58] kind of coloring book approach or comic book approach, which is where the old pinballs

[18:02] were done, where you did a very elaborate pen and ink drawing.

[18:05] And they needed these build in solid colors of separations.

[18:10] But if you had 14 colors on a glass, that would mean 14 different operations.

[18:17] You know, the screener screened that color on the glass and it was pre-labor intensive.

[18:22] The four-color process, which is how they do, you know, almost every magazine cover or

[18:27] you know, poster you've seen.

[18:29] It does it with four colors.

[18:32] And but it gives you the ability to reproduce photographically, basically, what you paint

[18:39] it.

[18:40] So I was really pushing hard to do that process.

[18:44] We were in the process developing the equipment.

[18:45] We were in the process of ordering, setting up the so-called department all during that time.

[18:51] And they said that, okay, you can do the next game you do after eight ball.

[18:55] You will be our first four-color game.

[18:57] So I was very excited by getting onto that.

[19:00] And then Norm Clark, who is our engineer and charge of pinball design, had come up with

[19:06] a pool theme.

[19:08] And again, pool themes were very common.

[19:10] Norm had done games in the past about pool and he knew they were going to be very successful.

[19:14] And it was one of our first fully electronic games.

[19:16] That was the other thing that made a huge difference in terms of it.

[19:19] It was a good game coming at the right time.

[19:23] And then the fact that it was fully electronic, coming emerging from the Electro Mechanical

[19:29] age to the electronic age, this was going to be our first full run electronically.

[19:35] So I was just trying to get through that game.

[19:37] And I try to remember, I think it was Tom Neiman and I were talking about what kind of

[19:41] theme we want.

[19:42] We came up with this idea of kind of doing a without a license, but a happy day type of theme.

[19:48] You know, the guy playing pool and the leather jacket.

[19:52] So that's all we did.

[19:53] And again, it wasn't meant to be exactly him, but it was meant to be a guy like you know.

[19:59] And he was a caricature himself.

[20:02] The fancy character was that black leather jacket guy in the 50s look in a pool.

[20:09] And then kind of keep it a little bit cleaned up so we make it as a sort of shop so it

[20:12] wouldn't look too dingy.

[20:14] And then there was actually a little bit of controversy even about you know, trying to

[20:18] promote the kind of a wholesome kind of graphic for pinball at the time because it just

[20:24] become, it becoming legalized in different places and Chicago was one of them.

[20:28] So they wanted to keep it sort of wholesome and appeal to families and that kind of thing.

[20:33] So yeah, that, so we just made it look close to it.

[20:37] And again, this is one of those friends thing.

[20:39] There's been games about like Tribolt and some other things that have guys that kind of

[20:44] look like the disco figures and not enough by our company.

[20:48] But so anyway, that's what we did.

[20:52] We just did kind of a caricature of a 50s, 50 type character, you know, was the idea.

[20:59] Did any, did you get any repercussions, you know, any legal repercussions from this?

[21:03] Oh no.

[21:04] And again, we would know this stuff if we did it.

[21:09] And again, you don't do this stuff in a vacuum either.

[21:11] You know, you do the artwork and then you know, you present it to marketing and they all

[21:17] have to kind of weigh in on it.

[21:18] If anybody thought something was too close or too, you know, this might not be good from

[21:23] a whatever point of view.

[21:24] If it was a negative image, like you certainly didn't do, there was a game called Old Chicago

[21:29] that there was some concern about because you didn't want to do gangster type themes,

[21:33] you know, I'm right.

[21:34] There was some sensitivity to that because of the industries, some things that might have

[21:38] been in the past in the industry and so on.

[21:41] So these were, these were, these were things that were always represented to marketing and,

[21:45] you know, all the exact addition and they all felt it was pretty, it was pretty benign.

[21:50] So, but I do, I don't know how true this is and I have never asked Tom to even about

[21:54] it but he, he used to go out to Hollywood at various times and supposedly somehow he

[22:00] was out there for a trip and talk to somebody who knew Henry Winkler and Henry Winkler said

[22:07] something, you know, you really arrive when you see yourself on a pinball machine or something

[22:10] like that.

[22:11] But this was in it pretty much in its infancy when the whole idea of having a celebrity

[22:16] on a pinball was not that, wasn't done, you know, nobody did it except for Tommy.

[22:23] Tommy was the first one or I should say wizard.

[22:26] And at the time that I was doing eight ball, I'm pretty sure, actually right before I did

[22:32] eight ball, Dave Christianson did, it was doing Captain Fantastic, which was a legitimate

[22:39] license from the movie built off of wizard.

[22:43] And so this was kind of when the whole idea of license characters was kind of being ushered

[22:49] into the industry, you know, so it was kind of a new territory, you know.

[22:52] So, no, there was no legal, except that I've heard that Winkler made the comedy thought

[22:58] the guy looked like him.

[22:59] So, at the time I just thought that was kind of kind of an interesting coincidence but

[23:06] not, there was no problem because different, different era now and also it developed into

[23:11] a different, where that were celebrities actually wanted to be on pinball machines because

[23:15] pinballs were just becoming kind of like the, you know, the, you know, we call it Nintendo

[23:21] or Xbox and all that crazy of today.

[23:25] Well, this is what pinball was at that time, you know, it was becoming this huge phenomenon.

[23:30] It was, as you can see the growth of the games, they went from, they sold 7,000 units

[23:36] that would be good and they all said to go to 20,000 or even, I think, wizard did 10,000.

[23:41] That was a huge jump in production so that, you know, there was a, starting to be an

[23:45] acceptance that tying these into license things was a good thing, you know, was a great thing

[23:51] to promote, help promote the game.

[23:52] I think before that time people just felt that we make a game, we'll sell, I don't care

[23:57] who's on there, you know, it will make any difference.

[23:59] And then Tom was able to promote people.

[24:01] You know, I might get, the game itself might get you the first 6,000 but the promotion

[24:06] part of it might get you the next, you know, the next 5,000.

[24:10] And in terms of the recognition of the license property on there.

[24:13] So that was a pretty interesting time to be around that.

[24:17] Well, even the girl on 8 ball, on the 8 ball glass, even kind of had a resemblance to

[24:22] the, well, she was certainly a more riskier, larger, breasted version of the girl on Happy

[24:30] Days, you know, I mean, did that have any sort of impact?

[24:33] No, well, I mean, just the fact that there was a kind of a sexy girl, you'd hang out

[24:37] at the, I think the only thing about her that I, if I remember right, was, some people

[24:43] are saying about the show, I didn't look like the girl on the show, but she was, I had

[24:47] a pink blouse or something, her name was Pinky or something, if I remember right.

[24:51] And so that was the only, you know, maybe stretch there, but it wasn't a, I mean, I, you

[24:59] know, if I wanted to make it look exactly like it, my would have made it look exactly

[25:02] like it, but it was more of a style and the same thing with her.

[25:06] It was more, because it was a, it was a popular show, if I remember right at the time, it

[25:09] was a pretty popular show.

[25:11] But the danger, and this has happened, even with evil cannibal, I can go back to that

[25:15] in a second, but the, you know, the danger of doing a television show is, you know, you're

[25:21] doing a pinball piece that's maybe a year, you started a year before it ever comes out

[25:26] as far as graphics and, you know, packaging and all, we, we, we didn't work on them for

[25:30] a year, but it took that long from maybe six to eight weeks to do your graphics and, but

[25:34] they had to have the whiteboard, which is the game itself without any graphics, and they

[25:39] had to be played and tweaked and refined and show us about a year from concept to final

[25:45] production.

[25:47] And if you're, you know, if a TV shows all of a sudden went into tank or got, you know,

[25:52] that canceled or in the, like in the case of the, of evil cannibal, we had a, we're doing

[25:57] a home game at the time, from Montgomery Awards, or, or, never going to have it, the first

[26:01] home pinball.

[26:02] And our first home pinball was going to be an evil cannibal thing, because we had the

[26:07] license, we'd already been popular with, you know, the public, so there was kind of a

[26:11] built-in awareness about it.

[26:13] Well, about, I think it was about two, three weeks, maybe before production of that game,

[26:19] when we'd done the graphics already and it was all finished, evil cannibal had a, a run-in,

[26:26] I guess was, we were going to say, with his manager and, or, I think, or someone else

[26:30] was medical with his manager.

[26:32] And actually, when after him with a baseball bat, and it was in big, you know, big,

[26:36] big, yeah, yeah, that doesn't help the product marketing, does it?

[26:41] No, it's not, it's not the most positive, everybody is very conscious of trying to keep

[26:45] a very positive image of, for pinball, you know.

[26:48] And, you know, as they got more and more comfortable, as it got more and more popular,

[26:54] it was able to graphically reflect maybe a little bit more, you know, male themes, I

[26:59] would say, is always pretty, pretty predominantly male audience, where it always has been.

[27:04] But in those days, they're pretty conscious of trying to keep it whole sum as much as

[27:09] possible, and that was something that they couldn't do.

[27:11] So I had just hired another artist to start building this department we had, and I had

[27:17] him do a replacement game, I think it was called Galaxy Ranger, if I remember right,

[27:24] which was, I really had no license tie in, but they felt that, again, Midway was actually

[27:30] going to be making this game.

[27:31] Midway was a company that we own, but was not in the same facility, but they were going

[27:35] to do the manufacturing of this home pinball game.

[27:38] And the exactly over there were very nervous about evil, Kanibos, so they wanted nothing

[27:44] controversial at all, no license to tie in, they have any problems with.

[27:50] So we quickly redid this graphic, redid the play field, and Kevin O'Connor was the artist

[27:57] that did that, by the way, and he did a great job, and it was just one of those things you

[28:01] have to be able to adapt to, and that's kind of the danger of a TV show.

[28:04] You can get the license to a TV show, and then your production schedule is set up, and

[28:09] you may not be able to work it into the production schedule, you know, until the following summer

[28:13] or something, and that TV show might be on the down slide.

[28:17] That kind of helped him a $6 million man when we did that team.

[28:19] That was kind of on the, you know, going the other direction, but on the air, I think

[28:23] for six or seven years, it was successful, but it was starting to get a little tired

[28:27] by the time you get the deal all done.

[28:30] It can affect, you know, how long it's going to stay on the air, or affect its popularity.

[28:35] So, how was it working with Dave Christianson?

[28:39] It was great.

[28:40] He's an interesting guy.

[28:41] I don't know if you ever talked to Dave, or he's a very interesting guy.

[28:46] And again, he didn't, first of all, they had determined that they really liked his artwork,

[28:51] and I'll say this about Dave.

[28:52] Dave might be one of the best line artists I've ever seen.

[28:55] I mean, ever, ever, into what a pen.

[28:58] He can do magical stuff.

[29:00] He used to illustrate manuals.

[29:03] What do you think?

[29:04] Yeah.

[29:05] Right.

[29:06] Yeah.

[29:07] He's an ex-exploited part, you know, of a carburetor and things like that.

[29:11] He just does a magnificent work.

[29:14] All drawn, you know, not on a computer.

[29:18] I think computers weren't even part of graphics at that point.

[29:21] Right.

[29:22] So, he was excellent.

[29:23] And again, his artwork is what motivated me to say, again, I wasn't raised playing

[29:29] pinball, and I'm thinking in my head of pinball, kind of stylized, Jerry Kelly type artwork,

[29:36] which I'm not saying was better, but it wasn't my style.

[29:40] I wanted to do something much more realistic, much more illustrative.

[29:44] And Dave's approach was much more in that direction.

[29:47] You know, he always had a whimsical sense of humor, maybe kind of a twisted sense of humor

[29:52] at times.

[29:54] But the work is what made me think, you know, this is a serious, this whole direction of

[30:00] pinball art could be changing, and it would be a great place to work.

[30:03] So that had a lot to do with me, but to come there.

[30:06] I don't think he wasn't.

[30:07] He was very good to me.

[30:09] He didn't know.

[30:10] He kind of looked at me a little bit as an adversary, I think, when I first came in, because

[30:14] he kind of had his own way of working.

[30:17] The one thing that was, the good thing about Dave was he did this beautiful work.

[30:21] The bad thing was it took him a long, long time to do it.

[30:24] And they were trying to get these games turned out.

[30:28] You know, as productions were going up, the electronic pinball was coming in, that's

[30:32] the whole idea about setting up this art department.

[30:35] So when I went there, I wasn't an art director, but I had to kind of get a lay of the land

[30:40] a little bit and get to know the other technical people because there were several artists

[30:44] doing different slot machine art work.

[30:46] And this whole thing was going to have to come together under one roof, basically.

[30:51] So I'm sure Dave saw me as maybe a potential adversary.

[30:54] And, you know, again, he was a very interesting guy that kind of, you know, the personality

[31:02] of the artist that was concerning the executives there, that's why he wasn't asked to be an

[31:07] art director because he was more of a, they saw him more as a kind of a lone wolf, you

[31:13] know, great with graphics.

[31:14] And this is not rock that boat.

[31:16] Let's just let him keep doing what he's doing and do well.

[31:18] And so that caused a problem between you two?

[31:22] And they did.

[31:23] And so it was fun to work with them.

[31:24] I'd say it was challenging at times because he wasn't, you know, a typical, you know,

[31:30] kind of five type of guy, you know, who just come into his work and go home.

[31:33] And, you know, so there were clashes, I would say, at times, but also I had a commencement

[31:38] respect for him.

[31:40] And especially his work, because if his work hadn't been what it was, I probably wouldn't

[31:44] have thought that this was a good move from me from a career standpoint because I wanted

[31:49] to do more realistic, illustrative work.

[31:52] And as I said, his work, you know, was leaning toward that direction, you know.

[31:58] Now when you did Lost World, now that game kind of had a different artistic feel to it.

[32:05] Tell me about that one.

[32:06] And that was my, I mean, again, if I was looking back at my career at Valley, that was sort

[32:10] of the, you know, a major turning point, not just for me, but for the whole pinball business

[32:16] because of this four color artwork process.

[32:19] It enabled us and me, because I was the only one there that was really a painter.

[32:25] As I said, Dave was a graphic artist that used the traditional method and did continue

[32:30] to do that style later too.

[32:32] I mean, he didn't change his style for the four color process, but it did allow other

[32:37] artists that we were building in this department to do airbrush and to do oil painting and

[32:41] to do all those things and capture that with the four color process.

[32:45] And that was a major time because it wasn't just doing artwork.

[32:48] We were setting up equipment to do this four color screen printing.

[32:54] I'm glass with ultraviolet ink, so these were inks that could be, when they printed the

[32:58] art, they would immediately get cheered by ultraviolet lamp.

[33:01] This was all new technology at the time.

[33:03] And then, and then immediately dried.

[33:05] So you didn't have all these drying time problem that was, that was slowed down the process

[33:11] and printing.

[33:12] And the press has themselves that they bought to, to make the artwork instead of doing 250

[33:17] impressions in a day, which is what one person could do is doing a buy-in.

[33:22] They could do 500 impressions an hour.

[33:25] So it was a tremendous cost savings to Valley and that was one of their, what made it so

[33:31] attractive to them.

[33:32] And I was glad that happened, but to me it was all about being able to come up with painted

[33:37] artwork and transferring that to glass.

[33:39] And nobody was doing that at the time.

[33:41] So last year, I was actually a piece I had presented to the executives there to promote this

[33:49] idea of looking into this alternate screen printing process.

[33:52] And so all during the time I was doing 8 Ball and trying to get on to go to do Lost World,

[33:58] we were building up this art department, screening department to do this UV printing.

[34:04] So we went to the trade show, the AMOA show that year.

[34:10] And our two pieces on the floor were 8 Ball.

[34:13] And I think there's a third one.

[34:16] And we might have a third piece.

[34:17] I'm not sure if it was Mata Hari.

[34:18] I don't know my chronology right now, but I think Mata Hari, which is a beautiful game,

[34:22] and that was done in the conventional.

[34:24] Right, that's Dave.

[34:25] Yes, and he had done it.

[34:27] To me, that's one of my favorite pieces of his, and graphically.

[34:30] And that was done in the old way.

[34:32] We had 8 Ball, which was done in the old way graphically.

[34:35] And then we had Lost World on the floor of the show.

[34:38] They kind of introduced it there.

[34:41] And you know, you didn't use to do that.

[34:43] They didn't want to bring out a game too early and show it to distributors.

[34:46] And then had distributors wait till I'm in a path on this game so I can get 8.

[34:50] So I can get Lost World.

[34:52] So they were sometimes a little reluctant to put a game on the floor of a show and get

[34:58] to worry about the anticipation for the next game and hurt the chances of the game preceding

[35:02] it.

[35:03] But in this case, it was a great move because it did a couple things.

[35:08] It showed this direction of Valley's artwork.

[35:11] And I was just standing on the floor.

[35:12] I didn't have any badge on or anything at the booth.

[35:16] And I was just standing along there watching people play the game and listening to talk.

[35:19] And I remember two distributors coming by and saying, we had just gone into first places,

[35:26] the manufacturer, Pimballs.

[35:28] We were on the rise.

[35:30] And I remember hearing two people say, well, no wonder, Valley's in first place.

[35:35] Look at the artwork on that game.

[35:37] And so they didn't know what the difference was.

[35:40] I don't think.

[35:41] But they recognized it was different.

[35:43] And that was certainly gratifying to hear that because we were banking a lot that this

[35:49] would be not only a production benefit, but it would be a graphic and a move us away

[35:55] from the crowd of other Pimball machines in terms of look.

[35:59] So that was the whole motivation for it.

[36:00] I had a lot riding on it.

[36:04] And I actually, the piece you saw is lost.

[36:06] World was actually a, I had done a small version of that as a sketch and a little painting.

[36:13] And we did all of our sample classes with this new process for that game.

[36:18] And make sure it all worked okay.

[36:20] And then we moved in to doing that as our first four color Pimball machine.

[36:25] Now when you did Playboy, though, that's back to the old style, though, isn't it?

[36:30] It is.

[36:31] And buddy, buddy.

[36:32] That's what's unique about a four color.

[36:34] That's what I was also trying to, and I was also trying to make sure Dave understood

[36:37] this, too.

[36:38] You can do artwork that has a lot of that same quality in four color process.

[36:43] Because then as you think about magazine covers or album covers, some of them were very simple

[36:48] and graphic, some were much more subtle and blended colors and more realistic, bleeped

[36:54] done.

[36:55] Because the four color process just reproduces whatever image you photograph.

[37:00] It starts out as a photographic process.

[37:02] Nowadays, it's a desktop technology.

[37:05] You have a little scanner.

[37:06] You have a scanner photograph or you scan a painting and then you reproduce it.

[37:10] It's kind of like an inkjet print.

[37:12] That's kind of what all of this was like in the beginning with all of the computers.

[37:15] This is when scanners were laser scanners to scan your artwork.

[37:19] It was pretty new also.

[37:21] They had these huge scanners that were very expensive to get your art, get them scanned,

[37:26] but they could reproduce anything.

[37:28] So what I did with Playboy was the center figures.

[37:31] I don't know if you've seen it or not, but it's got the character Hefner with two girls

[37:36] and then a bunch of little vignettes around the edges.

[37:41] That was all done as a painting.

[37:43] Then the outer borders, there's a bunch of mirror on it and there's some graphic Playboy

[37:47] club keys and other kind of an art deco border to it.

[37:52] All that was done using the four color process but doing it as solid colors.

[37:57] I think you would have a simple graphic.

[37:59] I combined it to.

[38:01] I don't know if you know the story about that game, but when we presented the artwork and

[38:06] I was thrilled to be able to do it because it was going to be my first major license.

[38:14] The reputation of Pimball artists, some Pimball artists, especially Dave, of course, was you

[38:18] do these sort of elapsed with sexy women and that was sort of part of the theme of what

[38:24] Pimball was kind of emerging into in terms of graphics.

[38:28] Nothing inappropriate, but attractive women, it would be attractive to a male audience

[38:32] because it was so predominantly male.

[38:34] I was like excited about doing the project.

[38:36] We sent the graphics to Hefner and I had done all my research, of course, and what do

[38:43] you do for a PG rated Playboy without nudity and without anything inappropriate.

[38:51] I did it as a montage of the Playboy lifestyle and the clubs and they had resorts at the

[38:58] time.

[38:59] Just kind of like what Playboy I thought would advertise for their image.

[39:05] It was a positive image.

[39:06] It was not done any way.

[39:07] It's a sleaze here.

[39:08] When Hefner got it, we got this conference call and they called me in and there was four

[39:16] of them.

[39:17] I was the executive in there.

[39:18] I think Billio Donald was the Natalemann and Brush here and down Brit who was the operating

[39:23] officer at the time.

[39:24] They were all in the office and they were listening to Hefner.

[39:29] He was all excited about doing the Pimball.

[39:30] Matter of fact, he was criticized for being more excited about working on the Pimball machine.

[39:34] Then he was his hotel in Atlantic City that was going up.

[39:38] He was much more of a game player than he was really a casino person.

[39:42] He was his own executives.

[39:45] This was a distraction.

[39:46] He was going to be working on people on a Pimball.

[39:49] But his complaint was that the graphics were fine.

[39:54] It wasn't criticized in the style, but he said the way it was done was much more about

[39:58] the Playboy lifestyle, which is what we were trying to do.

[40:01] It was missing what he really wanted to see in the Pimball.

[40:04] What it came out to be was he wanted to be in the middle of it.

[40:07] He wanted to be a picture of him as the Playboy icon.

[40:14] And thinking about it, it was a good move by him because he was about promoting that

[40:20] that playboy is.

[40:22] He is a playboy.

[40:23] Not just his company, but he's the front man.

[40:25] He's the image of what people, the lifestyle of playboy, is to have this wonderful setting.

[40:32] He had just moved out to California at that time to the Playboy Mansion West.

[40:40] He asked if we could rework it.

[40:44] He asked for, at the time he was dating a girl named Sandra Ciodor.

[40:47] That was his current.

[40:48] He had broken up with Barbie Benton and was called dating, but he was seeing the girl

[40:54] named Sandra Ciodor.

[40:55] She was a playmate.

[40:56] She was a playmate of the month.

[40:57] Maybe he played me as a year.

[40:59] I can't remember if he was a year.

[41:00] He was one of the girls he wanted to see in this picture.

[41:06] I can't remember if it was me or if it was him that came up with Paddy McGlyre who was

[41:11] playmate of the year that year.

[41:13] She's now Jimmy Conner's wife, the tennis player.

[41:17] Those are the two girls he wanted up front to be surrounding.

[41:22] I need sight of him.

[41:24] So I read the graphic and we actually took it out to him, which was a tough trip.

[41:30] He was teaching high school a year and a half earlier and I was in the playboy mansion

[41:35] with Tom Neymann walking around.

[41:38] It was quite an adjustment to my sense of reality, but it was fun.

[41:44] He was very pleased with it.

[41:46] He actually, when we presented the artwork, at the time James Conn was staying out there,

[41:51] almost got permanent resident at the time.

[41:53] I think he'd gone through a divorce.

[41:55] I remember him coming into the room and was very excited about it.

[41:59] He actually helped on another trip.

[42:04] We went out there after we got the glass approved.

[42:06] We did the artwork for the glass.

[42:08] I'll go to the other trip in a second, but we had this large promotional pinball tournament

[42:15] based on the playboy game as they were playing another game.

[42:21] I think it might have been eight ball in the tournament.

[42:24] When they were going to unveil the playboy pinball at the playboy towers in Chicago to present

[42:32] to the general public, available to the world, the next great pinball by Valley.

[42:38] It was going to be a playboy.

[42:41] All the playfield had gotten done.

[42:42] We've screened it all because you have to do a playfield to actually put a game together

[42:46] because it has to be all screen printed and then top coated and all the plastics and all

[42:50] the rest of the game.

[42:51] But the back glass had only been approved.

[42:54] Again, you couldn't do a quick photograph, blow it up and put it on the back glass.

[42:59] You had to really do the artwork.

[43:04] The party was going on at the playboy towers.

[43:06] I was back at Valley on the northwest side in my little studio there.

[43:13] Getting trying to get this back glass done to put on the back on the game.

[43:16] It was a race against time to get the glass done, get it down to the ballroom on the

[43:24] game and then ready for the unveiling.

[43:26] It was maybe 15 minutes before they unveiled it where I rushed over there and they had

[43:33] a security guy come to the door to get it to bring me into the room.

[43:36] They kind of headed on the stage and from the back of the stage they had it all covered

[43:40] up.

[43:41] When they got the glass in, I think about 10 minutes later they unveiled it.

[43:45] It was a great applause and a great reception.

[43:47] That was a little tough.

[43:51] I don't know.

[43:52] Today it would be a lot tougher to pull it off physically.

[43:54] There have been terrible all nighters to get that thing done.

[43:58] It was a great success.

[44:00] Then we went on to do the final painting course.

[44:05] He was very pleased with it.

[44:06] I remember him sitting right next to him and he was really happy the way he was depicted

[44:09] and how he had captured him.

[44:12] He made a couple of comments on the girls.

[44:15] I looked at it.

[44:16] I was surprised too.

[44:17] They weren't to concern how I painted their face but they wanted to make sure that I had

[44:21] done a good job with their figures and their torsos.

[44:25] They actually found a theater or thank me for the cleavage that I gave her because she

[44:28] didn't think she had as much as she would like to have had.

[44:31] There are some things like that.

[44:32] There are a little side things that happen in the process of getting an acceptance of

[44:38] your artwork.

[44:39] You did great with it.

[44:41] They sold over 18,000 of them.

[44:43] You got to be just plain thrilled at that.

[44:46] Well, it was huge.

[44:47] Again, that again was the second, if I remember right now, again, this is good stuff.

[44:50] It's a little foggy after a few years.

[44:54] I think that was the second major all electronic pinball we had.

[45:00] All those things came together.

[45:01] None of us know, well, what if it wasn't playboy or what if it hadn't been electronic?

[45:05] What has done as well?

[45:06] All those things just happened to be hitting at the right time.

[45:09] The market was ready for that.

[45:10] It was a great theme.

[45:12] There's a little controversy again and there's some concern doing a playboy game.

[45:16] You're trying to come through this wholesome, as possible image, but be hip and be current

[45:24] and be have impact.

[45:25] Again, appeal to a majority of the audience was male and younger male.

[45:34] All those things they had to consider.

[45:37] In retrospect, it was a great theme.

[45:40] A little bit of controversy, some comments, I think, from some distributors would get

[45:44] things from some parents, I think, at different things.

[45:50] But it basically was very successful.

[45:51] Yeah, to fill that many games, it's a classic game.

[45:54] It's a very Jim Patler.

[45:56] Did the design on it?

[45:59] He was a very good designer.

[46:02] He was very important in the process.

[46:07] It just turned out to be a very, very good game at the right time.

[46:10] What about future spa?

[46:12] What was the story behind that?

[46:13] That's kind of an unusual theme.

[46:17] Well, it is.

[46:18] I have to think back to some of the stuff as almost like yesterday, if someone, you have

[46:25] to remember what influenced what and why things happened the way they did.

[46:29] I do remember that one pretty well because we had come out with these wide body games.

[46:36] I probably, I'm going to jump back for a second to Lost World for a second.

[46:40] We came to the show with Lost World.

[46:45] We had a copy right on it.

[46:47] Another manufacturer, which you probably are unsure of, maybe with Atari, had just gone

[46:51] into the pinball business.

[46:54] They had a game.

[46:57] We didn't know this.

[46:58] They had a game coming out that was kind of a fantasy theme or something, but unbeknownst

[47:02] to us, their game was going to be named Lost World.

[47:08] By us being on the floor, because ours was done, the two things had no connection at all,

[47:15] except that they both had come up with this name, Lost World, even though they were not

[47:18] even the theme anywhere, nearly the same.

[47:23] Because we had ours on the floor when it caught with copyright, that meant they had to go

[47:27] back and change the name of their game.

[47:29] There was a little bit of a sense that we did the right opportunity to do that for preview

[47:36] in the game.

[47:39] In terms of Atari, their game was larger.

[47:42] They had what we called the wide body game.

[47:44] This was a new attempt at a different product, slightly larger.

[47:52] There's some purist would say it doesn't play the same.

[47:54] The geometry is not the same as conventional size pinball and all that.

[47:58] We were coming out with our series of wide bodies.

[48:03] I believe we made three.

[48:04] The first one was Paragon, which is one of my favorite games that I got to do.

[48:08] I really enjoyed.

[48:09] I named my company Paragon after I left, I became a freelancer and formed my own company.

[48:16] That was a fun game.

[48:17] Then we had future spa and space invaders.

[48:23] You did Paragon before future spa?

[48:26] As I remember, yes.

[48:27] Now, let's talk about Paragon then before future spa.

[48:32] Again, from my point of view, a bigger camsist, because it was a wide body, so more places

[48:40] to do artwork, we decided I suggested, because Lost World was a game that I think because

[48:50] Playboy followed Lost World, if I remember.

[48:52] They wanted to get into Playboy and they could have sold many more Lost World than they

[48:56] actually did.

[48:57] They sold 10,000 Lost World, I believe, or 12,000, something like that.

[49:04] The feeling was, because the graphics made a difference.

[49:06] It was a new looking theme.

[49:08] They really realized once they got into it, that they had scheduled it to only be, we're

[49:12] going to cut it off at 12,000, because we want to get into Playboy and you have promotional

[49:17] deadlines, you have to hit and all these things to make this all work.

[49:22] They really didn't realize the full run of Lost World that they might have.

[49:26] So I suggest, let's come in with a kind of a graphic sequel.

[49:30] People are used to this look in the sort of sword and sorcery.

[49:35] There was an artist at the time, and I'll be honest.

[49:38] I used his book of Guinein Frank Frisetta, who was doing a lot of movie posters and more

[49:47] of them.

[49:48] He did more comic books and Conan the Barbarian type book covers and very dynamic sword

[49:56] and sorcery fantasy style artwork.

[49:59] Very rich, exciting stuff.

[50:02] I showed that to marketing before I even started on the sketch for Lost World to show them

[50:06] the direction I wanted to go.

[50:08] Nobody really done that stuff yet, especially in that painted look, because it wasn't capable

[50:14] of being done.

[50:15] So I moved to, I wanted to do a bigger and better version of that style with Paragon

[50:25] and you just kind of revisiting the same characters that run in glass.

[50:29] You might call this sequel.

[50:32] So that's how we got into Paragon.

[50:35] Then I came up with a name Paragon.

[50:36] It was sort of a bit my project.

[50:38] I used myself as the character, as a wrestling coach and a weightlifter.

[50:44] I sort of did a fantasy version of the Barbarian guy and created my own mythology for the game.

[50:52] So there's a story in my head.

[50:54] And to kind of show you how, when you do graphics, you have to have some reason to put something

[50:58] where you put it.

[50:59] It can't just be color.

[51:01] This was almost like a visual comic book, the whole Paragon thing.

[51:05] And we created the winged lion as a character for the game.

[51:11] And then my wife was, she was gracious enough.

[51:15] And this was when I was 29 or 30 at the time.

[51:18] So we're still pretty young.

[51:21] Modeled for the female character and the glass and the play field.

[51:26] So it became a kind of a very personal project.

[51:28] It was a lot of fun for me to do.

[51:30] But I have no, I have no like it a lot too.

[51:32] And I actually, one of the paintings I've got hanging up here in my studio that I really

[51:36] still like a lot.

[51:38] So the gal, the gal on Paragon is your wife?

[51:41] She's my wife, huh?

[51:42] Wow.

[51:43] It's a pretty good looking.

[51:44] Yeah, she's great.

[51:45] She's great.

[51:46] I mean, we were high school sweethearts and she still looks great.

[51:50] She says, I don't agree with her as much.

[51:52] She says it's her from the neck up.

[51:55] And then I, you know, it was my fantasy from, but she was actually very attractive and

[51:59] still is.

[52:00] So it was, I mean, you know, when you do a muscular character, you have a chance to make

[52:07] the muscles a little bit more ripped.

[52:09] And then you have a chance to do the figure a little more curvaceous on the females and

[52:13] stuff that's just doing a fantasy art.

[52:17] But at the same time, that's how she looked and she, you know, we took, she was, I have

[52:22] a stuff lying at home.

[52:23] I put on the photograph and then I took polar rides of her, you know, she had to get

[52:29] in this frightened pose as if a lion was about to attack her and in my living room.

[52:36] You know, so this was kind of a, looking back on it, it seems kind of silly now, but

[52:40] it was fun at the time.

[52:41] And she was, she's an accountant and a financial planner by occupation.

[52:45] So she's not necessarily a very flamboyant artsy type, you know.

[52:50] And so to kind of contribute this way was, was unique for her, but it was fun.

[52:55] And it's, now I get, you know, people call me and talk to me about Pimbal Art and different

[53:00] games.

[53:01] They all want to know if it's true that if it was my wife and you know, absolutely

[53:04] it's true.

[53:05] Now, how, now let's go back to the future spot.

[53:09] Now what was the thinking behind that one?

[53:10] Okay, well that was one.

[53:13] And again, I have to remember how the sequence of the thing, that project was given a day

[53:17] after I was working on Paragon, then they were going to come up with version number two

[53:22] of, in a wide body.

[53:25] And again, I was, we had Kevin O'Connor there at that time, I believe.

[53:28] And he was also doing games called Supersonic, I think was right around there.

[53:34] When the SST was flying between here, that was a big deal at the time.

[53:39] So he was working on that game.

[53:41] Dave was going to be working on Future Spa.

[53:43] I was finishing up Paragon, as I remember.

[53:46] And what was the Paragon, the inspiration for Paragon actually kind of came out of a,

[53:52] back in the, this would have been, let's see, early, early, yeah, I guess early 80s and

[53:56] late 70s.

[53:57] There was a television commercial that was promoting health clubs.

[54:02] It was actually Chicago health clubs then, ironically, Valley ended up buying out that whole

[54:09] health club chain.

[54:10] It was big tannies and all across the country.

[54:15] But having no relationship at that time, there was this great commercial they were running

[54:20] that was sort of a, what's the spa the future going to be like?

[54:23] And they had these kind of people in space suits and just kind of, you know, trying to envision

[54:32] this future of a spa, you know, our health club and trying to, you know, basically promote

[54:37] that they were that was who Chicago health clubs was.

[54:41] And so that kind of was the inspiration for what if we did some, it's a current theme.

[54:46] You're always trying to find something that's kind of hot in the public at the time.

[54:50] It's just another card game or another pool game or another cowboy theme, which has been

[54:56] popular in the 50s and 60s.

[54:58] So you're trying to come up with something that's current and kind of in the public awareness,

[55:04] you know, it's hot right at the time.

[55:06] But if it's too hot or too short lived, you've got a very dated pinball by the time it comes

[55:11] out, you know.

[55:13] So you know, this was one that Mark and you thought might be kind of a fun approach and

[55:16] you kind of, because it seemed like this whole direction going toward more refined health

[55:21] clubs and more, you know, where they actually would become, you know, places to meet people

[55:27] and single places and they were kind of envisioning these elaborate, which is what's, you know,

[55:32] all happened, lifetime fitness and all these other things of today.

[55:34] It's kind of a future spot was supposed to be about.

[55:37] But it was also at the time, again, there's a lot of Star Wars, where the movies that

[55:42] were popular and all this re-emergence of science fiction movies and fantasy movies and

[55:49] that was also very popular.

[55:51] So you kind of try to combine those elements.

[55:53] The reason it ended up being two people working is because Dave actually did the playfield

[56:01] and the cabinet and I did the back class just because of time frame.

[56:07] Right.

[56:08] He, as I said, he takes a lot and it was, again, it was a wide body pinball machine.

[56:11] So there's much more work to do to get more space to cover.

[56:15] And we were kind of running out of time and after I finished up Paragon, they decided

[56:20] they weren't going to hit their production date that they needed to hit for the prototypes

[56:27] they would send out on future spots.

[56:29] So that's why I jumped in and did the back class.

[56:32] And the back class is actually my brother is the male figure, my sister-in-law is the

[56:38] female figure.

[56:40] I've got my brother-in-law's down doing curls in the lower part of the glass.

[56:44] My secretary is in it.

[56:46] I mean, I just, you know, I can't grab anybody that was willing to be famous for a short

[56:51] time without really being famous and put them on the glass.

[56:56] And I did the glass.

[56:57] We tried to make the marriage happen and we don't have the same style.

[57:01] But it was still fun to do, but it was definitely done that was not the intended way to have it

[57:07] done.

[57:08] It wasn't because I wanted to jump in on that.

[57:09] It was because we were just going to run out of time.

[57:11] And it's kind of funny that the way you do a come-on machine, usually you do the back

[57:13] class first in terms of concept and you present that to a licensed figure or you get all

[57:20] your approvals based on the back class, you know, how these are picked like I said with

[57:23] Playboy the way it works.

[57:24] But that's the last thing you usually do in terms of production.

[57:28] You would do all the cabinet, the pinball, the play field, the plastics and decals and all

[57:33] other stuff first.

[57:35] So they could build the game and then the glass would be the last thing they just have to

[57:38] put that out at the end.

[57:39] So your sequence would kind of start with the concept of back class, but then that's

[57:45] the last thing you actually finished.

[57:46] So that's why that was, you know, I was able to pick that up and they finished the play

[57:50] field, I finished the back class and we got done on time.

[57:53] Now was that four color process or old school?

[57:55] That is four color process.

[57:57] And again, that's a fairly bright game too.

[58:02] I mean that's better.

[58:03] The argument about four color process and it's a fair argument that you, when you do a

[58:06] four color game and you're saying you're going to do a solid red and four color process,

[58:11] it won't be as bright as just screening a solid red.

[58:13] And sometimes we actually did, we would actually do like in Playboy, I would do my painting

[58:19] and then where I had solid pink, I wouldn't make that out of the painted artwork.

[58:23] I made that just with a solid print of pink screen printing ink.

[58:29] So it would be a more vibrant.

[58:32] So that was, you know, sometimes you had to combine those two.

[58:34] So it would be more than four color, probably be a fifth color, which was okay because

[58:39] you didn't really make the manufacturing process, it'd give them much more labor intensive

[58:46] but it was still a way you could pop up the colors a little bit.

[58:50] So when we did Futures by, we intentionally designed it, even though it's all four color

[58:55] process, I used some pretty strong contrasts with colors around the reds and yellows to make

[58:59] them pop.

[59:00] It would look like they're a little more vibrant to it.

[59:03] As you wanted it to be more muted, that's a nice thing about four color process, you

[59:07] could go all different directions.

[59:10] Whereas the conventional way was a little more comic book like it was a little more,

[59:15] you know, always going to be fairly bright colors or solid colors.

[59:18] So, yeah, that's how, you know, the four color process on the back class and it was conventional

[59:27] art as all the play fields were.

[59:29] But I worked at Valley, we never did a four color process play field.

[59:34] Because the question there was, and again, it goes back to what was being done in the

[59:38] industry.

[59:40] At the time, advertising posters still was screening everybody's play field.

[59:45] They were not doing the glasses anymore and they weren't doing the plastics and they weren't,

[59:49] but they still had everyone in the business, never four manufacturers in Chicago.

[59:54] And actually pretty much the world, you know.

[59:57] They were all being done advertising poster because they had this, what we were led to believe

[01:00:02] was a miraculous top coat that nobody else could do and they had a proprietary system to

[01:00:07] make it happen.

[01:00:08] And, you know, value art was very concerned about, you pull that from a poster and we do

[01:00:15] it ourselves.

[01:00:16] You know, you have nobody to fall back on.

[01:00:18] It doesn't work if we start getting complaints from the field that the play field, or the

[01:00:23] excuse me, the pinball machines, play fields are eroding or shipping up or whatever.

[01:00:29] So they were very concerned about that.

[01:00:30] But we were at that time still testing and anticipating doing our own play field.

[01:00:37] But at that time we didn't do any four color play fields.

[01:00:39] We did a lot of games with the four color glass.

[01:00:42] But we didn't do the play fields while I was still alive with still at Valley.

[01:00:46] Those came up later.

[01:00:47] And actually I got to give credit to Dade East and those guys were continued.

[01:00:53] They were going moving forward on doing four color play fields.

[01:00:57] Right, right.

[01:00:58] Dade East was the first company to do four color process on the play field.

[01:01:02] Right, that's correct.

[01:01:03] And I was doing work for them at the time and it was actually, I'd hoped it was going

[01:01:08] to be jumping away ahead now.

[01:01:11] But I was doing a game, let's see, was a golden eye.

[01:01:16] And that golden eye was a four color play field.

[01:01:19] But I was doing Frankenstein for them, which was a Mary Shelley Frankenstein based on

[01:01:22] movie with Robert De Niro and Kenneth Branagh, which is one of my favorite games.

[01:01:29] And I really wanted to do that as a four color play field.

[01:01:32] It really fit the theme and it would have been a great one to do.

[01:01:35] They just weren't sure if they, again, they were still kind of experimenting to make

[01:01:38] sure they could do all this.

[01:01:40] But that was the one we made a big push for to try to get it visualized at the

[01:01:45] three four color.

[01:01:46] And then the next game I did for them was the first James Bond with Pierce Brosman, the

[01:01:51] golden eye movie.

[01:01:52] And we did that as a four color play field.

[01:01:54] So that was a lot of fun to see that finally emerge.

[01:01:58] Right.

[01:01:59] You know, it's a four color.

[01:02:01] It just takes a much, it takes good equipment.

[01:02:04] It takes a very good, you can't reject a lot.

[01:02:09] You have to be very, you know, keep the process very even or you can, the colors can shift

[01:02:14] to the blue side or the red side and look distinctly different than your original.

[01:02:18] If you don't have really good manufacturing controls in place and with play fields,

[01:02:23] I mean, it's a fairly expensive thing to, you know, to reject and then refinish and

[01:02:28] start over again.

[01:02:29] So from a manufacturing standpoint, it wasn't as attractive to do it in four color and

[01:02:34] take a chance on having a lot of rejects.

[01:02:37] Originally, it wasn't as attractive, but then they worked that out.

[01:02:41] And part of it is, you know, depending on how large the runs are, if a run of a game

[01:02:47] is, you know, these 20,000 games, it seems like it'd be great, but you have much more

[01:02:52] potential for rejects, you know, so that, in the game runs became a little smaller, became easier

[01:02:56] to monitor and to control.

[01:03:00] Now, what about jump back to the Ballad days?

[01:03:04] What about space invaders?

[01:03:06] And that was in the, another white body.

[01:03:08] Yes, it was.

[01:03:09] And it was, and again, you know, this was the sort of definitive set the record straight

[01:03:14] kind of thing.

[01:03:16] There was a, we got the license to do, let me put it back up a little bit, even before

[01:03:21] that came out.

[01:03:23] When this is, let me try to think if I have my timing right on this.

[01:03:28] I know it wouldn't like.

[01:03:30] Okay.

[01:03:31] Sometimes there are different licenses that were coming up at potential licenses, and

[01:03:35] then you would pass on them.

[01:03:36] Or you, for example, we passed on as a company, we passed on Indiana Jones.

[01:03:42] We got a script from Spielberg and to do a video game on Indiana Jones.

[01:03:50] But when we got the promo material and we looked at all the theme of the game with the

[01:03:56] pre-production artwork and it had a guy with a whip and it just, you know, it didn't

[01:03:59] say, I don't know, how's this going to really, how's the, you know, the Star Wars generation

[01:04:04] going to like this sort of 1940s type, you know, serial cliffhanger type storyline, you

[01:04:11] know, it's just going to go over, you know.

[01:04:13] So there was some, and then we also were presented with a, from Walt Disney, the movie Tron.

[01:04:19] And it was very progressive, you know, it was the first digital computer graphics on the

[01:04:25] screen where you actually had computer images that were part of the artwork, you know, part

[01:04:28] of the graphics and, you know, very progressive and the sound is so exciting.

[01:04:32] And so they, they chose Tron, which turned out to be not, not a usually successful movie,

[01:04:38] but very, you know, very pioneering because it was using all these graphic images for

[01:04:42] the first time and passing on Indiana Jones.

[01:04:45] And sometimes those things come back, you know.

[01:04:48] But with Space Invaders, we had this hugely successful video game.

[01:04:53] This is again, when the rise of pinball, I'm just going to be the rise of video games,

[01:04:58] we're replacing, not replacing, but becoming more and more popular.

[01:05:03] And Space Invaders was hugely successful of the video game.

[01:05:08] So because we had that license, I think it was our own Trotato, I believe it was Trotato

[01:05:12] that made that game, that's I remember, right?

[01:05:16] Through them, we had the license to that team.

[01:05:18] So let's do a Space Invaders thing.

[01:05:21] A year before that, we had gone out to California to listen, and I say, we, it was Tom Neiman

[01:05:27] myself, I think that was the only two that were there.

[01:05:30] Tom Neiman was head of marketing, and I was the art director at that point.

[01:05:34] And we went out to listen to Proposal by 20th Century Fox on a new movie they had coming

[01:05:39] out called Alien.

[01:05:43] I think that was the working title at that point, but they told us all about the movie.

[01:05:49] It's going to be kind of a truck driver and space kind of thing, grungy, not the slick

[01:05:53] Star Wars thing.

[01:05:54] And the whole premise, and they had a new director from England, it was doing commercials, but

[01:05:58] it's all you do, you have a new vision to this thing.

[01:06:01] We never saw the creature that they were going to be using in it until the very end before

[01:06:06] we left, they showed us a kind of a wax model of a dial type thing of what an action figure

[01:06:11] kind of thing or what creature is going to look like.

[01:06:13] And they were being very protective about the way, even the way they shot the movie,

[01:06:18] so you didn't see a guy in a rubber suit that they didn't want anybody to think that

[01:06:22] that's what it was.

[01:06:23] And it was just before computer graphics, of course.

[01:06:26] So everything was a scary guy in a rubber suit and they were trying to avoid that cliche

[01:06:30] 20th century fox was.

[01:06:34] So when he showed me the dollar, I recognized the style because I had a book back in my

[01:06:43] studio of a guy named HR Geeger, was his the artist name.

[01:06:48] And he was at that time, had some recognition for doing these very bizarre biomechanical

[01:06:57] creatures and women for some rock bands.

[01:07:01] He was doing a couple different things who else who he did, but he did several album covers.

[01:07:06] And again, album covers were very hot graphically at the time too.

[01:07:09] So I was very aware of this artist in his book, which actually is a book that really

[01:07:18] Scott looked at when they were trying to come up with a creature design is the same book

[01:07:23] of HR Geeger's work, which is pretty disturbing in some ways, but very cool and very unique

[01:07:29] at the time.

[01:07:30] I had tried to talk Valley into doing a game based on that style.

[01:07:35] We're always trying to capture something that was in the public.

[01:07:40] You couldn't just walk in, say, I want to do this wonderful impressionistic game and

[01:07:45] they just turned you loose to do it.

[01:07:46] You had to come up with, I would like to do something maybe in this sort of like this

[01:07:51] or in this style, or you kept trying to stay current or stay hot with some of the themes.

[01:07:58] So that's how we would sometimes propose things.

[01:08:00] We'd show somebody else's work or style.

[01:08:03] If you said Star Wars style, that would ring a bell and it would sound good.

[01:08:06] So you're always trying to pitch something based on something that the executives could

[01:08:10] relate to.

[01:08:12] So we did the, I knew about the Geeger artwork.

[01:08:19] I loved it.

[01:08:20] I've been trying to, as I said, trying to talk the family people into doing it.

[01:08:26] A theme like that, something like that.

[01:08:28] Not necessarily space invaders at the time, but then we got the space invaders.

[01:08:35] Anyway, we went home.

[01:08:37] They told me to go ahead and do space invaders and I said, what can I do?

[01:08:41] The Geeger looks stuff because of the, I've been talking to them about it already and

[01:08:45] so yeah, as long as it isn't as disturbing as some of the stuff that they saw in the book,

[01:08:50] let's go with that, but then try to create a space invaders theme because it seemed to

[01:08:54] all tie in.

[01:08:55] Well, the problem was, the characters that are in his book look very much like alien.

[01:09:02] I guess where they got the idea for alien.

[01:09:05] So you evolved from the Geeger model, not from alien.

[01:09:11] But the timing, and then again, I was, I said, look, this should be even better.

[01:09:16] Let's do alien.

[01:09:18] This would be, and I'm going to back up once again.

[01:09:22] Actually they didn't have space invaders license yet.

[01:09:23] They hadn't decided to make it a game yet, but they knew about aliens.

[01:09:26] They knew about my presentation of the Geeger type artwork.

[01:09:31] So that was, that preceded space invaders as far as doing it as a pinball machine.

[01:09:37] What ended up happening, they came down and told me they have passed on, they're going

[01:09:40] to pass on alien, but why not do the space invaders theme with that look, with the, not the

[01:09:46] alien look, but with the Geeger look.

[01:09:48] Right.

[01:09:49] So that's how I began the space invaders' graphic look.

[01:09:55] And if you ever saw Geeger's work, all of his work is that biomechanical creature type,

[01:10:03] human robotic kind of combination kind of thing.

[01:10:10] So that's what we use as sort of the graphics for.

[01:10:12] And then we, and I was all into coming up with the, and I was actually still hoping that

[01:10:17] they may change their mind and go with alien, but they just, again, they, I forgot what

[01:10:22] the, the license was, it was up at the time.

[01:10:24] I think it might have been, it might have been $6 million dollar man, maybe.

[01:10:29] There was, there was another license at the time that they, they were going to go with

[01:10:33] that rather than, than alien, that's why they couldn't, they couldn't do too many licenses,

[01:10:37] you know, at the same time.

[01:10:38] Otherwise you dilute one for the other.

[01:10:40] Right.

[01:10:41] That was a thinking.

[01:10:42] So you want to put all your promotion effort into the, the license game.

[01:10:45] So you don't want to have too many, you know, crossover licenses or, or overlapping licenses.

[01:10:52] So for some reason they pulled the plug on, ever even doing alien, to go ahead with the,

[01:10:57] the Geeger look and that will be space invaders.

[01:11:00] And so that's how it all evolved.

[01:11:02] You know, I thought I had made it different enough from alien.

[01:11:06] I made it much more like kind of the characters from his book.

[01:11:08] It was more of an homage to him, the Geeger and his style than it was.

[01:11:12] Because, again, I had, I had done, only seen a little tiny dollar of the character.

[01:11:17] I had a lot of images of aliens.

[01:11:19] But then when it came out, I think 20th Century Fox felt that, that we actually took from that,

[01:11:25] um, need a little dial and we tried to, we tried to rip it off, but that isn't really what happened.

[01:11:30] Although I, I can see where, um, I mean, there was enough similarity in that style that, um,

[01:11:36] that they had, they had a, they had a case, they could, they could make a case for that.

[01:11:39] That was never the intention.

[01:11:40] We were, I was hoping they were going to do alien.

[01:11:42] I have the alien turns out to be one of my, um, one of my favorite movies of all time.

[01:11:47] Did, did they make a case of the whole thing?

[01:11:49] Did, did they bring any action against her?

[01:11:51] You know, I think they did.

[01:11:53] I think, but what, what I, um, and this is what I know about it, they, they, you know,

[01:11:57] they brought me in.

[01:11:57] They wanted to, they, they went over the sequence again, so to make sure that they felt that we,

[01:12:01] you know, this was, there was never anything intentional.

[01:12:03] Um, they had, and I was working right with, um, isn't that, I don't know, a, uh,

[01:12:09] consultant that was working with, um, with Bill O'Donnell and John Britz at the time,

[01:12:14] you know, so they could make sure that they were, you know, the way the sequencing worked.

[01:12:17] Because it was kind of a confusing thing that happened.

[01:12:19] And they didn't know what we had seen.

[01:12:20] They thought we had seen a whole bunch of pictures of this creature.

[01:12:23] And we had, they were, I, I still got the original, um, synopsis.

[01:12:27] They sent us with a photograph from the stage and the different characters, the characters,

[01:12:31] you know, Sigourney Weaver and all those characters.

[01:12:33] And, but there was, there's nothing on there about the creature.

[01:12:35] The only thing we saw of a creature was a slide for about 10 seconds of a doll.

[01:12:40] And the, in a doll was, uh, wasn't even the color of the creature.

[01:12:44] And so, but I, but I knew because of this HR Geeger that this was going to be something special.

[01:12:50] I mean, this was going to be, I was very familiar with this work.

[01:12:53] It was kind of a fan of his.

[01:12:55] I actually even now, as I look up here in my studio, I've got a huge life size head

[01:12:59] of the alien character in my studio.

[01:13:02] Because it's, you know, it's one of my, I thought it was a very, um,

[01:13:06] you know, very dynamic movie that was very, you know, a turning point in terms of how movies

[01:13:10] were done about space things, you know, much more realistic and, um, you know, tried to avoid the

[01:13:16] man, the rubber suit idea that all worked.

[01:13:18] And he's one of my favorite directors now.

[01:13:20] So, um, but the, the, the action is, I understand that.

[01:13:24] And I think it was just what happened was, and this is in the days, this is what I understand now.

[01:13:28] So, I don't know how accurate all this is because we just went on about our business and kept on working.

[01:13:33] And, um, the, you know, you're always, sometimes you're close in those things where you're close to being,

[01:13:40] using something that looks like something else.

[01:13:42] But that's sometimes the like the thing with a fine-tuthing that wasn't so much to try to reproduce fine,

[01:13:47] the, it was to kind of reproduce that feeling, you know, something that were popular.

[01:13:51] And now it's much more, you know, carefully, because nobody really cared that much about pinball

[01:13:55] art in the past.

[01:13:56] I think if it was, if you look back, there's always been themes that were kind of representing American culture at the time.

[01:14:03] That weren't necessarily rip-offs or something that somebody looked like.

[01:14:06] But as the artwork got more and more realistic, that potential existed.

[01:14:10] So, now about this time, Dave Christensen really seemed to be kind of out the door now.

[01:14:17] What happened to Dave?

[01:14:19] Um, let me think.

[01:14:20] See, it's hard for me to remember exact timelines of things.

[01:14:23] And, um, the, um, the, uh, was that about this?

[01:14:28] It was about that time.

[01:14:29] I guess it might have been.

[01:14:30] He did, but he did a game called, um, something like, um, Aula Parisian or something like that.

[01:14:36] Right.

[01:14:36] It was kind of a European theme.

[01:14:39] Yeah, it didn't get made.

[01:14:40] What's that?

[01:14:41] It did not get made.

[01:14:43] Oh, okay.

[01:14:43] I remember him working on it.

[01:14:44] I think that might have been the last.

[01:14:46] Um, I don't want to say too much here because there's some personal issues and things that were affecting his, um,

[01:14:54] you know, just affecting life, um, for him in general, you know, there was kind of a tumultuous time for him.

[01:14:59] Um, but in also, he really never, um, he did a game called, um, another hot rod game.

[01:15:05] What's the name of that?

[01:15:06] Yeah, a Nitro Ground Shaker.

[01:15:08] What's it called?

[01:15:08] Nitro Ground Shaker.

[01:15:10] Yes.

[01:15:11] And that one he did as a, at the four color process game.

[01:15:15] And, um, but he did it in his, his method and then went back and did, you know, paint it.

[01:15:20] Actually painted the, the solid colors and, um, it was well received as I remember.

[01:15:25] And it was, um,

[01:15:27] um, amazing artwork.

[01:15:29] Oh, yeah.

[01:15:30] I mean, he, he, he, again, the work, the work was never a question with him.

[01:15:34] It was more things were getting, um, his life was affecting things in, in terms of his work.

[01:15:41] Um, we were moving to, um, we're, we're going to move our location to Bensonville.

[01:15:46] So we were changing locations.

[01:15:48] He lived in the city.

[01:15:49] Um, there were a number of things that were going on.

[01:15:51] He was, he was getting kind of, um,

[01:15:54] um, different chanted, I guess would be the way.

[01:15:56] And again, I have to, in his, in his defense, you have this bunch of young artists coming in with all kind of new ideas.

[01:16:03] You know, he didn't know Star Wars from, from Adam.

[01:16:06] You know, he was, he has a whole different sensibility about what,

[01:16:10] what his, what he would like to see on games.

[01:16:12] And I know I think it was always, it wasn't always wrong either.

[01:16:15] I mean, it was, it was left current and pop.

[01:16:17] It was more classic, I would say.

[01:16:19] Right.

[01:16:19] A lot of European influence.

[01:16:21] Some, um, growing pains going on just in terms of a department that was, went from, uh, you know,

[01:16:26] a couple of artists to, um, I think we ended up with 23 people at, um,

[01:16:31] at the full size of the art department.

[01:16:32] Yeah, Dave, Dave was kind of, um, you know, at least that's kind of my impression.

[01:16:38] I mean, was that maybe impacting his work a bit?

[01:16:42] Well, you know, this is, this is one of those things you want to be, um,

[01:16:45] yeah, you want to be careful.

[01:16:47] Right.

[01:16:47] I do.

[01:16:48] Because I, I, if I still have a tremendous respect for him, I just say, um,

[01:16:51] he was going through some things that I know he had, he had gotten, uh, robbed and,

[01:16:55] and, um, people, he got mugged at his house and, um, all these things were kind of going on.

[01:17:00] And, um, they were impacting, um, impacting what he would do.

[01:17:06] And again, it was, he's kind of a cantankerous guy.

[01:17:09] You went on a good day, you know, I mean, it's, they call him mad dog.

[01:17:11] I mean, that was his, his nickname, you know, and when you meet him, I don't

[01:17:14] think he ever met Dave, but, um, if you meet him, he's kind of this, um,

[01:17:18] kind of quiet, nebyshy type guy, you know, in terms of how your first impression is,

[01:17:22] but he can be, he can be, you know, like his artwork reveals.

[01:17:26] He can be all over the place and very, very colorful.

[01:17:29] But I don't think in Dave's case, he wasn't really meant in his, in his mind,

[01:17:34] I don't think he ever accepted the idea of being part of a whole,

[01:17:37] department team, you know, like a whole valley team kind of thing.

[01:17:41] It was always a little tough for him and, um, and again, I think that,

[01:17:45] I don't think he was ever really comfortable with the direction that some of the whole

[01:17:49] movie business was going and, um, he, you know, he wasn't, he wasn't going to see those movies.

[01:17:53] He wasn't part of that in his own head.

[01:17:55] He wasn't embracing that, you know, and so it's kind of like sticking yourself,

[01:17:59] you know, with great talent, but maybe not, coming up with ideas that would, um,

[01:18:06] be different.

[01:18:06] Yeah, that were some of the other people were coming up.

[01:18:08] But again, that all the designers were young guys at that point.

[01:18:10] And I say young, I'm talking about, you know, 30s, early 30s, late 20s, early 30s.

[01:18:15] And that's what the kind of majority of the, um, the people that were doing a lot of,

[01:18:18] even, you know, Tom Neiman at the time, he's, I'm 61 now.

[01:18:22] And Tom is, um, younger, he's four or five years younger than I am.

[01:18:26] So that was where, that was the marketing motivation and where some of the,

[01:18:29] um, perception of what would be good teams.

[01:18:33] That's where that, that's where that was coming from.

[01:18:34] A lot of that, or our brainstorming in the art department,

[01:18:37] did a lot of it too.

[01:18:38] And again, so he was kind of, I think he fell himself kind of a maverick, you know,

[01:18:42] but it was getting difficult sometimes.

[01:18:45] The problem with when you're successful like that, you really have to hit your deadlines,

[01:18:49] you have to be able to turn things out much more quickly because there's a,

[01:18:52] you know, you're, you're producing much, many more games,

[01:18:56] building a whole new factory just to produce games because it was so popular at the time.

[01:19:00] It was the top dog of, you know, at the entertainment world at that time.

[01:19:05] And that's just as, as the video games were coming in.

[01:19:07] And so I think that all had an impact, you know, um, I don't think he was ever, um,

[01:19:13] thrilled about going out to, um, to Bentonville, which is where they're going to move all of this,

[01:19:17] um, out near, or hair airport to do, uh, the whole art department was moved out there.

[01:19:21] The flat machine art department stayed.

[01:19:24] Actually, um, I was, I was in charge of all of that and that got to be sort of difficult to do

[01:19:29] because you have these, um, I think we had four artists working just on flat machines.

[01:19:33] And we were the number one manufacturer of flat machines at the time.

[01:19:37] Um, and again, that art certainly was not the same,

[01:19:41] did not fill the same kind of artistic challenge, um, that, that the pinball stuff did.

[01:19:46] And it was more, you know, um, done, um,

[01:19:50] right, that's the, you know, supply, supporting the product.

[01:19:53] Right. And so that stayed in, in, at the downtown office in Valley at, um, in Chicago, I should say.

[01:19:59] And then the pinball division moved out to Bentonville.

[01:20:01] And that's, I think, when, when Dave left, um, um,

[01:20:06] and I, I know he did a, um, he did a second, uh,

[01:20:10] fireball, fireball classic.

[01:20:12] Right. That was, that was also done in four color process.

[01:20:16] So, I mean, his work was, was, um,

[01:20:21] they could go in either direction.

[01:20:23] Yeah, he could go a lot, he could do the, you know, the, the line ink stuff, or the four color.

[01:20:28] And he, um, and he did a good job with it, but I just don't forget,

[01:20:31] we're embraced because I think you thought, well, first of all,

[01:20:34] when you, when you paint a glass, it's a lot faster than when you do,

[01:20:38] uh, the labored ink drawing and then you,

[01:20:40] you know, all the screen separation, he did all his own separations.

[01:20:44] What I, one of the things I did when I started this department is I brought in two artists

[01:20:48] before I even hired Kevin O'Connor to do, to be production artists, to, to take our ink drawings

[01:20:54] and then cut the separations from our color.

[01:20:57] And that, that became kind of a standard in the industry, everybody, you know,

[01:21:00] very, really with the artist who was the inker, like in comic books, you have an inker

[01:21:04] and then somebody that does the, the color work and so we kind of, um,

[01:21:08] did it like that. Um, Dave would actually do all of his by hand.

[01:21:12] And so they were really craft, they were, you know, beautifully crafted.

[01:21:15] Right. So I'm not knocking them at all.

[01:21:17] It just was, from a production standpoint, it was, um,

[01:21:20] Yeah, it didn't work as well.

[01:21:21] Well, yeah, I just slowed the process down at a time when they, you know, they were,

[01:21:25] you know, you didn't want to slow anything down because it was, it was, things were going great.

[01:21:29] Right. You hired, uh, what Margaret Hudson, she was your production artist.

[01:21:32] Right. She was my first, she had Margaret Hudson and a, and a woman named Mary Beth Bush,

[01:21:36] Mary Beth worked with Dave and, um, and, uh, but again, um, that didn't always work out because he

[01:21:42] wanted, you know, Dave was a very controlling guy. He wants to, you know, if, if I've got a shade

[01:21:46] on this particular person's arm, I want it to be the way I do it and that the way it looks on

[01:21:51] any, he didn't even work with color sketches much at all. So, um, Mary Beth worked on

[01:21:56] flat machines as well and became, uh, she ended up becoming the advertising person in-house that

[01:22:01] did, uh, took care of all of our brochures and it was very good graphic art and just, we brought

[01:22:06] that in-house. We took that away from outside agencies and did it all in-house and she took care

[01:22:11] of all that and that, that's how she evolved. And Margaret ended up becoming, she still does, um,

[01:22:17] you know, when there was our pinball play field to do for some people that still do it.

[01:22:21] Um, she still does that. I mean, she still does the hand separations. She still, she did a couple

[01:22:25] of, um, actual games herself. Um, so she developed, uh, you know, she was a, um, an art major from

[01:22:32] Southern Illinois University and so she was, you know, had a- had some illustrative ability,

[01:22:36] but she was very good with detail and- and very- and I knew that whoever's going to take

[01:22:41] the role of doing the screens for someone who does very detailed art was going to have to,

[01:22:46] you know, appreciate detail herself and she did a very good job and really, you know,

[01:22:49] developed a career out of it. I mean, she- she could always do the- the production stuff and as well

[01:22:54] as the- the- the back-lasts and the illustration part, um, later on she was able to do that too.

[01:23:00] Okay, we're going to take a little break from talking with Paul Ferris, the artist that worked for

[01:23:05] Balli in Data East and will be back after this message. The Pin Game Journal is a proud sponsor of

[01:23:11] Topcast. It covers pinball like no other publication can. The Pin Game Journal is America's only

[01:23:17] pinball publication. Whether you're looking for new games or the classics reports on industry

[01:23:27] got, Pin Game Journals for you. Their website is at pingamejournal.com.

[01:23:32] Alright, we're back with Paul Ferris, the artist for Balli in Data East. We're coming up on the- on

[01:23:38] the big dogs of your career here. Man, I mean, Xenon was like- that's a- a stellar game. You sold

[01:23:45] man, you sold a lot of them, 11,000 of them. I mean, what saw- did tell me a little bit about the

[01:23:49] development of that game and the artwork in it? Okay, actually, that was going to be our first

[01:23:56] voice game. Is there a member? It was- and the thing that made unique is the first female voice in

[01:24:02] the- the industry. I think the Williams had come out with a game at that time with a male voice at it

[01:24:08] and- yeah, that'd be Gorgar. Right. That kind of- you know, I'm trying to remember all these

[01:24:13] specific games and timing, but- so we- we actually went- Tom Neiman and I went out to the East Coast

[01:24:19] and met with a young lady who was- her name is Suzanne Chiani and she- she's actually become

[01:24:27] fairly famous in the New Age music realm and electronic music and- and she was- she was doing

[01:24:36] digital logo type things for movies. I think she did the Columbia Pictures found logo

[01:24:42] when you see the woman at the end of the picture, the movie or the introduction of the movie,

[01:24:46] you'll see this woman holding her, you know, holding a- a toward kind of like a liberty or- I

[01:24:51] guess it's Columbia actually, but- and there would be a- there's a sound that goes along with that

[01:24:57] and she developed that and she was in the business of doing a lot of those things for different

[01:25:01] major corporations and- so she's pretty clever lady and it was actually her voice. It was the

[01:25:07] voice on there and she came up with some of the sounds for the- for the game itself. So we

[01:25:12] know we had a female character that was- had to be developed and it just was a- that was one of

[01:25:17] those projects you got to kind of come up with your own idea kind of like Paragon and Lost World

[01:25:22] and some of those other ones and- so we kind of came up with this- I mean I didn't ever- I've

[01:25:28] never really actually articulated what it was but it was sort of an alien type woman but very sensuous

[01:25:33] and- and sort of enough futuristic society, you know, that was sort of the- because the game had

[01:25:39] this transport tube on- on the actual play field so we had to try to tie a theme into that.

[01:25:47] And the name was sort of trying to come up with something that was sort of exotic sounding and

[01:25:52] and you know very futuristic and you know we used this something from the periodic tables

[01:25:57] and it was a xenon gaff and- so it just kind of- it was a fun project and it said- it- it obviously had

[01:26:05] um you know different sounds to it sort of sensuous sounds at times and then the female voice

[01:26:11] which was unique for the business at that time. You're always trying to come up with a new- I'm

[01:26:16] going to call it a gimmick but- each game had its own sort of special feature you try to play

[01:26:22] up and of course the two things on that were the physical transport tube which was the second level

[01:26:28] a little bit and this is I think right before we actually started to do two level play fields and

[01:26:34] some of that kind of stuff. Right. And um and it was- yeah I was- I really enjoyed the game and

[01:26:41] it was either goes- you know an attractive package and um and again it was one of those- when you

[01:26:47] have a license property that you have to do you're- you're restricted by the licensee. I mean he-

[01:26:53] the licenseeor I should say as you know they- they give you stuff they tell you how the you know

[01:26:58] like with Playboy I mean we've done a piece of artwork that we would have probably used but

[01:27:03] then Hefner as a licenseeor came in and modified it for their preferences and which was fine

[01:27:09] actually it turned out to be a great piece but um with a with our own piece we know we could- we

[01:27:14] just had to kind of please all the designer and the marketing and the executives involved and

[01:27:21] and that one that one went over pretty well. Now the girl on the on the back glass was there and

[01:27:28] did you use any particular model or anything? That one I didn't you know use that- and I as you

[01:27:32] know as I've told you before I you know if you use members of my family or people I knew that one

[01:27:37] I actually didn't um I just sort of created out of my out of my head um she had sort of somewhat

[01:27:44] alien proportions in her head size and sort of this blueish skin color and um but what we did do

[01:27:51] at the AMOA show um we got a model and actually interviewed models that looked somewhat like

[01:27:58] the girl and created a costume created and she was you know she was at the game she was

[01:28:04] alongside the game in the show and um and it was so in the brochure you'll see a uh a girl that

[01:28:10] looks somewhat like the girl in the glass but the girl in the glass was created first then we

[01:28:15] kind of did a little search to try to find some way to kind of a similar appearance. Have you ever

[01:28:19] put um drawn yourself in any back glasses? Yeah I did um Paragon those are uh Paragon a

[01:28:26] lush world was not but the characters were created um I had a full bearded beard at the time and

[01:28:32] was I think I mentioned that I was a weightlifter powerlifter wrestler you know that kind of a

[01:28:38] physical type guy and um so that's why I use my wife and I on Paragon um and that's the only one I

[01:28:45] say that I ever use myself to be you know to be virtually look like me but um

[01:28:51] the other times you know my my kids and my and some friends you'd have them pose for you in a pose

[01:28:58] that would be appropriate for the you know particular back glass throwing but it's more for the

[01:29:02] anatomy and the and the motion and the action it wasn't necessarily for their likeness you know um

[01:29:07] but uh yeah Paragon Paragon is the only one. Do you own any pinball machines today?

[01:29:14] Oh yeah I have um I have six I believe um I have um I have a lost world because that was very

[01:29:23] very important to me and and it was in terms of the industry about that whole printing process

[01:29:28] that made it possible right it's for painting you know to do paintings on glass which was

[01:29:34] hugely important to me um and I have a centaur I have a um you think those are the two ballet

[01:29:42] games I have because it when I worked for ballet you didn't get games necessarily as part of your

[01:29:48] you know you're part of your salary or anything you you had you know we're ranging to buy them

[01:29:53] but with um then I went on later and with a freelancer and I worked with the

[01:29:58] data yeast and then Sega pinball which is basically the same company and I have a Frankenstein I have a

[01:30:04] um what else do I have a Phantom of the Opera I head it back to the future and uh I'm

[01:30:13] missing too I don't forget what else I have but yeah I've um and for me they're more rep

[01:30:19] rep they're fun to play obviously but um they're more um sort of the representations of different

[01:30:26] periods of my career in the pinball business and they it more of an nostalgic meaning for me

[01:30:33] not just to have a um games in my basement but um they represent you know the time in that part of

[01:30:40] my career so you know enjoy them for that reason too but my grandkids love to play them and

[01:30:47] they're still still fun to see still so now we went to centaur and I mean centaur as far as like

[01:30:54] pinball machines go from this era centaur was like go ahead of the curve um as far as like

[01:31:00] game playing and features and the artwork was um really stunning in that you did so much

[01:31:07] with so little color I mean basically it looks like there's just three colors black white and red

[01:31:13] exactly you did your homework um that was that was the intention that was when you're always

[01:31:18] competing you know in the way at the way at least way we um developed our ideas for graphics

[01:31:24] and so and you're always trying to come up with some way to get somebody over there to play a

[01:31:29] game they could stand out from another game and get their first quarter and um that was at least

[01:31:35] that's how we tried to develop the graphics so they had to really grab you and you know if it was

[01:31:39] um four or five games in a bank at an arcade or a location which they were many times you wanted

[01:31:47] to have something that was kind of grab you different you know either current with a licensing

[01:31:52] theme or as I said in pop culture at the time you try to capitalize on something that was

[01:31:57] happening at the time um that would you know would strike a core but somebody that wouldn't just

[01:32:02] be a repetition of the same old theme and I proposed and it was a little hard for them to grasp

[01:32:08] it first I mean they were a little bit unsure I said well let's try one we try something that

[01:32:13] would be the opposite of having all these bright shining you know bright warm hot colors and

[01:32:19] just do a very strong graphic black and white game with a few accents of red um to pop it out

[01:32:27] and then that came up with a theme that was sort of this um mythological but again kind of a

[01:32:32] biomechanical creature that was uh sort of being a horse and a man it was a motorcycle and a man

[01:32:39] kind of combination and and the black leather and all that was to kind of tie in that you know to

[01:32:47] emphasize that black and white theme uh and then the red was of course just for the accent and

[01:32:51] and you know I think it was pretty successful I still like it a lot even today great great game

[01:32:56] I it it sold about 5,000 units which was you know half of what you were selling with you know

[01:33:02] space invaders and xenon but I and that maybe that was an indication of the of the environment

[01:33:07] um you know the marketing environment or not so much the game I think it was more reflection of

[01:33:12] the industry at the time of the industry right you know we're talking before if you follow a curve

[01:33:17] of how the industry was at its peak you know with with the eight ball and playboy and some of those

[01:33:22] early electronic games and then Tim Balls because of the competition from video games

[01:33:28] we're heading the other direction and you know and so it was yeah that was that was considered

[01:33:33] a very successful game I got to give Jim Pat a lot of credit on that because he was a designer

[01:33:37] that game as well and Jim was always known as a designer that designed a game but then went down

[01:33:43] you know to the production line and kind of made sure everything function correctly and everything

[01:33:48] went smoothly on it to get it into production because um he really you know shepherd his games

[01:33:53] through and really had a great deal of um care for his games now was sentar was not for

[01:33:59] for color process right because it was for color process even though there's only three colors

[01:34:04] yeah I mean it was because again it's it's and it's sort of hard to explain a little bit but the

[01:34:09] the ability to paint it was a painting a black and white painting with black and white and then

[01:34:13] all the gray tones that are in there too wasn't just black and white it was you know the subtle

[01:34:18] he's a gray as well and that is only something you can do in four color unless you know there's

[01:34:23] their tricks you can do with a with black where you do little dots or something but um yeah

[01:34:29] actually the four color process is actually um you know there's probably maybe 35 different

[01:34:35] variations of gray in there as well as a black and white so you have all the the blending of the

[01:34:40] tones and so there's the same kind of sophistication you want in a painted piece with all

[01:34:47] called colors um still was able to be done with um the four color process making it gray you know

[01:34:54] the different shades of gray so it's it's more that more the painting technique than it was

[01:34:59] the limitation of the color you know now why the bug like eyes on the on the girl on the playfield

[01:35:06] a little bit of again it's sort of this um you know uh parallel universe or um you know

[01:35:13] other uh you know some other some other place um sometimes you don't define where it is you know

[01:35:18] you just sort of say it's somewhere in time and she had this sort of yeah it's sort of

[01:35:23] either insect lake or you can think of it as um some kind of implant type uh air thing instead of

[01:35:32] for her eyes i'm just just a uh kind of a light sensitive sort of implant you know I guess

[01:35:38] was my thinking at the time i'm trying to remember because i it wasn't you don't sit down and write

[01:35:43] a whole book but you sit down sort of create sort of a back story or a mythology a little bit of

[01:35:50] for the game so you have so when you draw something up in the left hand corner it's not

[01:35:54] something that has to be a piece of clip art or something that comes from nowhere it has a sense

[01:35:59] to that there is sort of a story going on in that um in that game even though it's not a

[01:36:04] you know that's a literal that you have to show you know the all five characters and you have to

[01:36:08] show them doing this in this episode it's not like that but you have a back story that kind of

[01:36:12] creates the elements for the for the game so the whole idea of centaur was and even the name was

[01:36:20] all your brainchild yes i mean again again well we we kicked things around uh sometimes in the

[01:36:26] end of the department itself because we were back at that point we were back at we were over at

[01:36:30] Bentonville which was just for a manufacturing pinball machines we were separate from the

[01:36:36] the main facility over on that which used to be the corporate headquarters in downtown

[01:36:41] Chicago and um so this is the group over there was all we're all pinball illustrators and there's

[01:36:47] so sometimes we just would kick it around as a group among us and say and and for for a couple

[01:36:52] reasons you know there would be several different games that would be being worked on at the time

[01:36:56] that were whitewoods and you wouldn't want you know four guys going off doing a a cowboy theme

[01:37:01] or something at the same time you have to make sure that these things are all kind of um developed

[01:37:06] you know appropriately and separately and uh so we would kick ideas around back there many times

[01:37:13] so i and that when i think pretty much was my idea because i had to come up i had this idea for a

[01:37:17] graphic plan of black and whiteness in a red accent and i had to come up with a a graphic theme that

[01:37:26] actually tied you know tied together with a color so the color idea came before the the concept

[01:37:31] to use that you know um and yeah but i have to say that um and i i won't i won't uh deny that a little

[01:37:38] bit of that biomechanical stuff came out of doing the space invaders thing that the HR giger that

[01:37:44] was that's his what he was most noted for was this um you know biome they call it biomechanical where

[01:37:51] you have this sort of combination of you know elements or animal elements that are tied in with

[01:37:56] mechanical elements in one in one creature or one one body and that was a little bit of that

[01:38:02] influence kind of reemerging again with you as we was later but kind of his few years later but um

[01:38:08] he was kind of a kind of a cool theme we thought at the time so and there were people that um

[01:38:14] you know i remember i remember the the frank brokka who was our um bp in charge of the electronic

[01:38:20] pinballs and and he he could not grasp out anybody in the world would want to walk up and play

[01:38:26] that game because as you know look at this thing it's ugly i wouldn't i wouldn't want to come up

[01:38:31] and play this thing so i just remember you know kind of battling about that and and i will say

[01:38:35] ballet was always very supportive because you know our got instincts at the time and our kind

[01:38:43] of our own sort of our research that we did sort of um you know casually on our own not not some

[01:38:49] major focus group touched up but um you know when artists would come in i had this idea and it's

[01:38:55] you know it's not too far fetched they would be very supportive and listen and and usually trust

[01:38:59] um because we were you know about the age of a pinball player you know at the time or

[01:39:05] i'm with a lot of pinball players so they were pretty trusting and um and it it was kind of

[01:39:10] diversity but it definitely got a lot of play it and as we said that we were at this point we

[01:39:15] were trying to come up with things that almost jarred you know jolted people a little bit because

[01:39:19] we were fighting for pinball money now i mean for a video game money so these you know the you

[01:39:24] know it was a huge change in the industry and it i mean it got a lot worse before it got better

[01:39:29] um you know that was kind of a you know that was a from a lot of us that was the first time we'd

[01:39:35] ever seen that either from the time i went to ballet everything was going up you know when i

[01:39:40] started in 70 right the late 75 really 76 um you know that's when everything started to go up in

[01:39:47] terms of sales and appreciation for pinball and the whole legalization of pinball in Chicago and

[01:39:54] you know the electronic games and all that was a great period and then this all of a sudden now

[01:39:57] we were struggling for sales we used to just be able to make any game we wanted and there was

[01:40:02] even some arguments in those days you know about the license property do we really need these you

[01:40:06] know do we need to license games anymore because we you pay a license and then you know the game

[01:40:11] would have sold that much anyway and that's and that's where Tom Neeman used to say yeah we might

[01:40:14] get 10,000 games without a license but then if you go to 20 it's that phenomenon of it's you know

[01:40:20] you got a pop culture icon type project and it would it would give you that much more money so

[01:40:27] now what some there was another ballet game is called big foot did you have any association with

[01:40:32] that i did do that yeah um that was um i'm not even sure if it ever got manufactured i remember

[01:40:39] we made one game if i'm not mistaken it went to a trade show but it came out of a competition

[01:40:45] with this upstart company Atari had come up and made i think they might have made three different

[01:40:50] pinball if i have three different models and they also had what was it i think it was called

[01:40:55] Hercules or something something major like that and they had this made you know big

[01:41:00] um it was actually way oversized uh yeah yeah Hercules was huge i mean it was like you know

[01:41:05] three pinball machines okay and again this was at a time when when everybody sits down the

[01:41:11] branch storm you know what do you do to take away the same old same old you know pinball no it's

[01:41:17] another pinball game you know because the market was getting pretty i don't want to say flooded

[01:41:21] but it was getting pre-saturated with um as many as as difficult as it was to make new and

[01:41:27] different games they were the perception was there a lot of the same old same old and

[01:41:32] and then all these new video these video games seemed like you know amazing things to

[01:41:37] from i think there was sea wolfs and then there was space invaders and then you know these games that

[01:41:43] suddenly you know making and they were much cheaper to manufacture or at least they were much

[01:41:47] simpler to manufacture i should say all right a pinball so there was a lot of competition you know

[01:41:52] so um try to come up with things that would be you know do you see that big game of ballies booth

[01:41:56] did you see that big game of Atari and um so these were all kind of market driven

[01:42:03] inspirations to try to you know to try to get something new in the marketplace

[01:42:08] because once you get a manufacturing line sent up you know like the automobile industry they don't

[01:42:12] like to change you know in the middle of you know be like a job shop they want to kind of

[01:42:17] manufacture and refine the manufacturing process for each model and then come back with a new

[01:42:22] and every time you add something new and different it creates a you know manufacturing nightmare

[01:42:27] sometimes so um so they were in the one things we're going great they were a little bit reluctant

[01:42:32] to do that but um as a market was starting to change they were trying to come up with some

[01:42:36] new and different things you know um i remember doing when i was doing big foot we had a

[01:42:41] a visit from another from an artist uh i'm going to have Alan Aldrich that came in and worked with

[01:42:46] us for about a week and he was known as um he'd done some uh work with the Beatles when they were

[01:42:53] doing so did some album cover artwork and stuff for for the Beatles he's the Englishman

[01:42:58] and he came over to work on a game that was going to be sold as a home pinball

[01:43:04] and it was um based on uh Elton John it goes in Elton John theme piece because Elton John was

[01:43:09] very big at the time and it was called it was the um uh forgot the name of it now it was a

[01:43:17] the the based on the collaboration of um Elton John and Bernie Topin who were who were writing

[01:43:23] albums together and and there was a potential for a bunch of characters that um

[01:43:29] uh captain fantastic and the brown dirt cowboy was the was the two was a name of the two characters

[01:43:35] and it was going to be kind of an animated uh cartoon type piece or movie and the whole idea

[01:43:41] of putting that that artwork that would look like the movie was was being done by Alan right

[01:43:45] while i was working on bigfoot that's one of the reasons the bigfoot stands out in my my mind

[01:43:49] because we were and actually when we did bigfoot we were still over at um at the uh office in

[01:43:56] downtown or the north north side of Chicago and at ballet headquarters and we Alan kind of took

[01:44:02] another drawing table in the um in the art department and just worked along with us and then

[01:44:08] sent the artwork and i think they did manufacture that came from from Montgomery Awards and sold

[01:44:12] as a home pinball right so that's kind of how well i remember bigfoot because i was working on that

[01:44:17] when this fairly famous guy came into town and was working with uh with us and you know

[01:44:23] i was taking him around Chicago and showing him you know different um different elements of

[01:44:28] the city and he got to meet Dave christian send and because Dave was still working with us and

[01:44:32] it was an interesting time to say the least so now after centaur it looks like you uh it looks

[01:44:37] like you left ballet and went to game plan is that what happened no sure okay um i think um

[01:44:45] what it ended up happening was again the industry went in the thing is about 1980 three three

[01:44:51] yes okay i'm trying to remember the time that's about when i think the pinball business would

[01:44:55] edit was at almost its lowest ab because i mean they started downsizing um a lot of the ballet um

[01:45:02] product um and um and i'm trying to think there was one more game i did after that but i can't

[01:45:08] remember to be out we were doing i mean i was working on some of the video product we were doing

[01:45:13] we we we had moved over to midway facility and combined the art we had gone from benthamville

[01:45:19] um and then moved over to actually midway facility which is in franklin park right nearby but

[01:45:25] so we've moved the whole department over there because it then was sort of in they'd

[01:45:30] combined the executives and they had kind of downsize the company and and um and there was actually

[01:45:36] talk at that point of you know not even doing pinball anymore i mean they were it had reached a

[01:45:40] pre low ed and um and then as i almost everybody had gone from the art department they were going to

[01:45:48] get down to just a skeleton sized um prove actually at our department and um and that's when i

[01:45:55] mean i knew that we could see that the that the the end was coming or that you know there was

[01:46:01] going to be very very tough to keep doing some of the things we had done before so i i built a

[01:46:06] studio in my home and kind of had this plan of whenever you know the bottom falls out of all this

[01:46:11] because again this was my first experience with this with you know that things can go up but they

[01:46:16] also can go down even if you're doing all the right things in the market as is what controls all

[01:46:22] that um so then i then i did leave and i think they kept maybe two people um two or three people

[01:46:29] that just to kind of run a skeleton crew in the art department um and that's the time when

[01:46:35] i think right after that's when uh Williams bought valley um not too long after that but the actual

[01:46:42] pinball i'd emerged at him with the Williams line and Williams actually was um actually kind of

[01:46:49] saved pinball at that point now i may have my chronology of the law here but i'm trying to

[01:46:54] this was all happening about the same time because when i when there was you couldn't even give a pinball

[01:46:58] away for a while um Williams kind of shut their doors on manufacturing went back and we're

[01:47:05] kind of retooled and and came up with uh um think it was space shuttle as they're able to game for

[01:47:11] right and they that was a very successful game again pinball if it almost vanished from if you

[01:47:16] can believe that from from our cades and they were fighting with all these great video games in

[01:47:21] these the Japanese imports that were coming in and and and really kind of overrunning the the

[01:47:27] the arcade business with um with video games and pinball for kind of seen as the old you know old

[01:47:32] school and dinosaurs and um and uh the space shuttle kind of revived pinball um to some degree and

[01:47:41] then there was a resurgence during the um for remember i kind of the later 80s from about i think 86

[01:47:49] but if i have my chronology my chronology is a little messed up because it's all kind of

[01:47:52] harder remember in linear form but um well how did you get to game plan i didn't actually go to

[01:47:58] game plan i was i was um and again you may your list of games may not be act i've seen different

[01:48:04] lists of games that i've done that are not mine i've seen different you know at times but i did

[01:48:09] one game for game plan because i had started my own business as a freelancer it was called

[01:48:15] paragon studios and i did not just pinballs because obviously um they said pinball was not you know

[01:48:22] there weren't a great deal of pinballs but game plan was trying to come out with pinballs at that

[01:48:27] when when valley or when Williams came back into the game with a space shuttle and it was a success

[01:48:32] there was this sort of uh this feeling that the pendulum had swung back in terms of the

[01:48:38] resurgence of pinball and um and that there was you know the people that know how to do this

[01:48:43] if they manufacture there's a market out there again and so game plan had come in with i think they

[01:48:48] did a um a game roger sharp was on um yeah sharp shooter sharp shooter but i didn't do that i

[01:48:53] some places some some people i get credit for that but i didn't do it i might i'm sure who did

[01:48:58] yeah sharp shooter they they uh pinball database credit you was doing sharp shooter 2 in in

[01:49:04] drama dot i did do in drama i did not do sharp shooter um and in drama though it was a game they

[01:49:11] called me in and said they you know had a again in those days it was about you know can you do this

[01:49:17] quickly you know can we get this done and in a short time they they they would bring in some

[01:49:23] experienced people and um and try to get them to you know do it as an outsource they didn't

[01:49:27] have people work for them to do what they were you know you do that like any kind of graphic

[01:49:31] project you do as a freelancer and i did do that actually did it was doing several different things

[01:49:37] at that time you know it just started my own business and um so i was doing some video game stuff

[01:49:42] some advertising brochures which actually were a lot of fun because you could do illustrations

[01:49:47] for the product you know and kind of a simulation of the game but this is before you had

[01:49:53] you know higher resolution digital graphics that they use now for you know characters from the game

[01:49:58] you would as an advertiser i would do an illustration of the characters on the game that would be

[01:50:03] very much like a pinball game so that was kind of fun to do that stuff um and it was very lucrative

[01:50:08] and um you know it was um but uh well so the in drama dot how what was the thinking behind the

[01:50:15] a drama a art work and i mean did you have to did you work with roger sharp or ed kabula or was it

[01:50:21] like because you were um at your own studio you didn't really interface and i and i so i would

[01:50:27] get you know go in we brainstorm but i what the way it worked then is they showed me the game

[01:50:33] i go back work on some concepts and then bring in the the color cat concepts and show them my ideas

[01:50:39] and they they so that's great and again this is sort of again that sci-fi um you know other world type

[01:50:48] um character um again pretty prevalent in the movies at that point pretty well received um

[01:50:54] you know star trek and all that stuff was going on in the movies and of course um all it

[01:50:59] just a great there's quite a few very successful sci-fi movies and that's also an arena that i

[01:51:04] love to work in so um so i presented this idea again it's sort of um woman from another

[01:51:11] another universe and you know she had several eyes but she was still kind of um sensuous and

[01:51:17] actually i'm like although my daughter's not pleased i had to tell people my daughter was a mom

[01:51:22] that was the first time she modeled for me and she was the model for that character obviously

[01:51:26] she doesn't have that many eyes but she doesn't have four eyes but she's she's beautiful and

[01:51:31] i think she's about 17 18 at the time and so she was my um she agreed to my model for me and

[01:51:37] and we did that game so it was kind of a fun you know not not a lot of heavy direction by them

[01:51:42] just they just said okay you know we know you've got experience come up with something that would be

[01:51:46] cool and and we try to so um so that's how that happened and again this was just a

[01:51:53] a company that was trying to you know do different things to get back in a pinball mark and

[01:51:56] edd was a terrific guy i mean i mean he was um he went on to um i worked actually

[01:52:02] work closely with him when he went to date east right and then i did a game which is one of my

[01:52:08] favorites and it was a very cool project to do was now maybe i'm jumping ahead for you but i

[01:52:13] think it was about the next project i did anyway was was uh phantom of the opera well yeah because

[01:52:17] now you kind of had this lag i mean in drama uh well well wait there was one other thing too uh

[01:52:23] in 1986 you did some artwork for Williams on the grand lizard right oh yes uh and that turned

[01:52:30] out to be not a very satisfying project from a finished standpoint but it and again there's all

[01:52:34] i've um i should probably back up a second again they were they had their own a few of their

[01:52:40] own artists that were in house um i think Connie Mitchell was still working there if i'm not mistaken

[01:52:45] and um and they again they had this resurgence in pinball and um Steve Cordek and some of the

[01:52:52] design very obvious or i know it was one of them and they had kind of revised pinball to some degree

[01:52:57] and um so they had a game that had been scheduled for production it's kind of an element

[01:53:03] of things sitting around but they were trying to work it in but they only they realized now

[01:53:07] they only had a month to get the artwork done and get it in production now four weeks for a

[01:53:12] pinball machine is not a lot of time especially when you have to go back and forth and please marketing and

[01:53:17] but i agreed to do it and uh because i just any time there was a chance to do a pinball you know

[01:53:23] first of all the comfort level but it was it was a great package product because you tie everything

[01:53:28] together and you know it paid well but it also was fun to create an entire package that all related

[01:53:34] to the same theme you know that that was you know one of those largest package designs you could ever do

[01:53:39] so i was always excited about doing pinball when i had the opportunity i was actually working very

[01:53:44] hard on other projects not not even in the pinball industry but um yeah you know outside the game

[01:53:49] business as a as a new company and and we were doing i had you know different production artists

[01:53:54] was working for me i finished my studio and have this you know tremendous studio now that um

[01:54:00] from that time so i was um you know enjoying a lot of other work but when a pinball came up i

[01:54:05] would try to give it priority and this was a tough one you know it was a month to do it and um

[01:54:09] so i came in with some sketches to show them i think i showed them three or four different sketches of

[01:54:14] ideas and the idea there was again the sci fi theme with um you know like some uh

[01:54:21] astronaut should have landed on another planet and we come across this race of uh of mandrels or

[01:54:27] kind of baboon type you know baboon human type creatures and you know it was in a uh

[01:54:33] a fight for his life and in on the back glass and then he just kind of tied those themes in

[01:54:39] with um that storyline on the play field um and i did actually did an oil painting of that and

[01:54:46] were very well received by everybody at Williams and um now there's two stories and i know i

[01:54:51] know several people from Williams that have told me one version and i know what i was told

[01:54:56] that i completed the back glass copy of the whole play field and this was um a game that the

[01:55:01] creature of the grand lizard was came from the head of python angelo i don't know if you know

[01:55:06] anything about python or sure he had he was working for Williams as an artist and artist slash

[01:55:12] game designer at the time he wasn't a mechanical guy but he was kind of a concept guy and

[01:55:17] knew you know kind of bright d's on games and he did he did comet and

[01:55:23] there's a couple different roller coaster theme games i know he did and um so

[01:55:27] anyway so this was his his character creation he didn't he wasn't gonna have time to do it

[01:55:33] and then they so he thought well it was good paul faire so you could probably do it in a month and

[01:55:37] that's how i got involved well once i did the glass they were in a process of changing to

[01:55:45] alpha numeric displays right where you know at that time up until that time all you could do

[01:55:50] was numeric but then they were going to go with these alpha numerics that actually could do

[01:55:55] you know messages and information as well as the numbers now that doesn't sound like a big deal

[01:56:00] but again here in a business that's trying to come up with new things that the competition

[01:56:04] doesn't have it was a pretty big a big thing at the time and my what they told me was that

[01:56:11] that they had to redo the glass because they were going to make me they paid me and i got

[01:56:16] you know satisfied with they were satisfied with the whole project they paid me that was great

[01:56:20] but then they came back and and we're going to reconfigure the back glass for these openings

[01:56:26] for the alpha numeric so that i mean i did not have room for in the way i did the artwork

[01:56:31] so that's the story they gave me but then i also heard in it some

[01:56:37] Larry Demar told me this and i'm not sure he was looking for Williams at the time as

[01:56:42] some of their programmers and he said that when everybody there was happy with it

[01:56:49] in in i'd say it's been said when the german distributors came in and at many times the european

[01:56:54] distribution of pinball had a huge impact on what you did i mean we you know at valley we

[01:57:01] had to change the kiss logo to a regular block s instead of an ff style even though that was

[01:57:07] part of kiss's logo but in germany you know that was that taboo so we had to make changes for them

[01:57:12] and and when france in germany would come in as a as distribution their distribution people would

[01:57:17] come in they had some impact on your themes i mean they could actually you know they well we

[01:57:22] can't really can't use that here and then it they would listen to changing it you know

[01:57:26] so when the germans came in and it can a lot maybe half of the half of the sales of pinball were

[01:57:32] being done in europe they apparently one of one of them didn't like the theme of the game and i

[01:57:38] don't know if it was the the group that's kind of a dragon or lizard queen kind of in the

[01:57:45] piece that's and she's she's not in but she's more she's more serpentine and lizard like than she

[01:57:51] is human but she but she doesn't look like she has a lot of clothes on but that way right and

[01:57:55] and i think um you get nobody even steve cortic did not have any trouble with with the theme

[01:58:03] well Williams but supposedly that that german group had some some difficulty with that and that's

[01:58:11] what he said they changed it so are you saying that your artwork never got used on the game

[01:58:17] well it's but this way my art my glass never got used so they think they ran off about 20

[01:58:21] pieces of glass for the and i've um i think i actually have one now that someone got for me

[01:58:26] i just some somebody at the pinball x bow got a glass for me and you know it just as it was very

[01:58:32] nice so it and it came out very happy with the way the glass came out it's actually my son on the

[01:58:36] glass my son was about i think a senior high school at the time and um was a wrestling champion

[01:58:43] and so he's the he's the astronaut in in battle with these um with these uh mandrels and uh

[01:58:50] so i really like the artwork as one of the ones i like whether or not i got made or not but

[01:58:55] but the play field art was used they changed the colors to match with python python redid a back glass

[01:59:02] which was the back glass that was on the final production version and they also modified the cabinet

[01:59:08] that i had on there too i mean to make it more like his glass now i don't again and this was a crazy

[01:59:13] business i was glad i got the project i glad he did it i got paid and you know you move on but

[01:59:19] right so you got the play field python did the back glass and the cabinet was kind of yours

[01:59:26] yes as i remember i i on the what i had on the cabinet was a large version of the again this was his

[01:59:33] he came up with the name and he came up with the idea of grand lizard was python or

[01:59:38] or Williams but i think it was mainly python what what did you think of python

[01:59:42] well python's a character i mean you know he's um you know he's a character uh but he's got some

[01:59:48] talent and again i think at that point he was trying to become more involved less of a pure artist

[01:59:53] and more involved as a designer designer and influencer and stuff but um he had some talent no question

[02:00:01] and and again i don't know if this is a project that he wanted to do and they kind of took away

[02:00:05] because he wouldn't be time because he was very cooperative with me and you know that there can

[02:00:09] be ego clashing going on at that point but he at least in front of me there was none i don't know

[02:00:15] if anything behind the scenes was going on or um because it was a very fast time period i was

[02:00:20] working you know very long hours to create that project in the time frame they had and it was

[02:00:26] you know it's a struggle because i had other other clients i was working with at the time and

[02:00:30] to suddenly commit to one month on a project that normally would take you eight weeks to you know

[02:00:35] uh six to eight weeks to do um was um pretty uh pretty intense time so i was disappointed

[02:00:43] any any time you do i mean i've had some other artwork later on that i did too that i did

[02:00:48] you know through myself and do a hundred percent i got paid but you know the game never

[02:00:52] received the light of day for whatever reason you know right and um it has nothing to do

[02:00:57] necessarily with your artwork but it just means that they for production reasons are marketing time

[02:01:01] or whatever the game never never get to meet so then there was a little break between like 86

[02:01:07] and then you went to dade east in like 1990 well actually i did what i stated the freelancer i

[02:01:13] i never went back and worked for any other company i've always dated a freelancer and actually

[02:01:17] i still freelance now but i do much more selectively and you know only on projects i want to work on

[02:01:23] and i'll go into that later but i um i kind of became a little more selective about things but um

[02:01:29] but at that time um i got a call from joe camman co from dade east who i'd never met i just had heard

[02:01:35] about him and he's if you know bondel of energy and you know very kind of creative uh you know

[02:01:42] a guy that made some some noise in the business with it i think it was called lockness monster

[02:01:47] he did four game plan after i had done uh mandromeda and he had followed the industry his dad was

[02:01:53] involved with the distributor and so he'd known all about the industry really knows about the

[02:01:58] history of the the business and he used to call it uh in the new age of pinball when um when he

[02:02:04] started working at dade east um he saw this as a more resurgence of pinball and he took it very

[02:02:11] seriously was you know a very clever guy sometimes challenging to work with because he was he was

[02:02:16] very um you know very uh uh i don't know say manic but really a lot of energy and very intense and

[02:02:24] but he caught he i didn't know all that about him and i met him when he when we he called me up and

[02:02:29] asked if i want to come in and do a game and ironically it was a um i said anytime i can do a pinball

[02:02:35] i'd love to have a shot you know doing pinballs because i still love the product i was doing a lot of

[02:02:39] work and at that point outside the industry because i wasn't quite sure what's going to happen with

[02:02:45] the industry um so you know trying to diversify as much as possible and this was the phantom of the

[02:02:51] opera he brought you in on right and it went allegedly i mean actually in the beginning it was he

[02:02:55] brought me in they had a pool theme game that they were going to do and i came in to take a look at it

[02:03:00] and um and said yeah i would be interested in doing this and they kind of gave me some of their

[02:03:05] ideas for the treatment of the game and you know again it's another pinball another pool theme which

[02:03:10] you know every seems like every five years and pinball there's a new pool theme because i'm so

[02:03:15] popular it's good so and then i went and i i guess he didn't hear me or somehow misunderstood but

[02:03:21] i went home and then went with on vacation for about ten days um and it told him you know i was

[02:03:27] going to come in take a look at it and then when i got back from vacation now i've given this

[02:03:32] proposal well you know with Joe there's no um and as i said i didn't notice at the time but

[02:03:38] you know ten minutes is a long time to not be contacting him you know so i got home and i

[02:03:45] had all these messages on my phone this was before i had a cell phone or anybody did i think

[02:03:51] and there are many people did and i had all these messages about you know oh where are you

[02:03:56] i got to talk to you and and and then he called me back in and said well we're not going to do

[02:04:01] the pool game now i thought okay and i thought maybe that was the end of the project but he came

[02:04:06] up with this i thought for me it was a brilliant idea and Joe was always trying to come up with

[02:04:12] ways of impacting the market without him to spend a lot of money or this was still in the

[02:04:18] you know dayd use the infancy of pinball and um so he had this idea to do phantom of the opera

[02:04:24] which was eight which was on Broadway at the time and was making noise there at the Broadway play

[02:04:30] but did not want to pay for a license um and and really when he researched the phantom of the

[02:04:36] opera the book is in public domain so you know you have the right to do it you just have to do kind

[02:04:41] of your own version of it you know and so what he did is he sent me home to read the book which i

[02:04:46] did and and then kind of created my own phantom of the opera you know my what what the so my phantom

[02:04:52] doesn't look anything like the one i'm Broadway there's you know it's it's based on the book not

[02:04:56] on the play on the musical or um but i enjoyed really enjoyed doing it and it was an oil painting

[02:05:03] and on that one actually my daughter is the um is the heroine the christine die a character who's

[02:05:10] the love interest of the phantom and and she's on the back glass and um and then my son is actually

[02:05:16] modeled in different poses to become the phantom and so it was a lot of fun to do um and it's one of

[02:05:22] my favorites um and we also did something and they were very willing to try to do things to capture

[02:05:27] attention and i don't know if you've ever seen the game in person or sure but when you walk up to the

[02:05:31] game you see um the phantom as a masked character with a hat on right and then we and that was

[02:05:39] actually a separate piece of glass that had screening on it and then the way we illuminated it was

[02:05:43] when there's certain certain features happened during the game um that were you know the

[02:05:48] the as it builds up to certain accomplishments on the game yeah the mask kind of come what kind

[02:05:53] of melts away right and then you see the horrible face of the phantom so you'll unmask the phantom

[02:05:59] part of the storyline anyway and so i really enjoyed doing it i mean it was tough that was my

[02:06:03] first introduction to joe and so you know joe wants to come over and look at the artwork every

[02:06:07] you know every five minutes basically and i was you know i was into this so i'll drop the project

[02:06:12] you know i went i this is the time i need and um and it once i took it in there was a great

[02:06:18] experience because they were all you know obviously all waiting for this to see you know

[02:06:22] hoping this was going to be good and i remember um when we took when i took the covering off the

[02:06:27] off the painting they all applauded you know so it was kind of a neat neat thing for a guy who's a

[02:06:32] freelancer now and and doesn't have that interaction with um with other you know executives and

[02:06:38] marketing people you're because you're basically working in a studio by yourself and you're in a

[02:06:42] vacuum so um that's one of the things about freelancing that's just wonderful but it's also

[02:06:46] can be tough because you're not you know you're not getting that daily interaction with other artists

[02:06:51] and kind of kibbit thing with other artists so anyway that that was a i enjoyed that project

[02:06:58] i enjoyed the outcome i loved the piece i had one of those on my basement um and uh it was very

[02:07:03] happy with that yeah joe says that phantom of the opera was the game that put d d east on the map

[02:07:08] they sold a lot of units of that and they they got a lot of acclaim for the for the game itself

[02:07:14] especially for the artwork so you know you did really cut on that project well i appreciate

[02:07:19] yeah and again we worked we worked again i make it sound like joe with joe that's just joe's

[02:07:25] personality i'm not knocking joe at all i mean he's he brings the whole energy level to

[02:07:30] you know to to there was just different you know and um and i was very thankful that he

[02:07:35] thought of me for that project because it was a it was a great theme for me to i'm a you know in my

[02:07:41] past i've always enjoyed doing monster and sci-fi and you know that kind of um genre and uh so

[02:07:48] this was perfect i mean and actually have to go back to the original source and then creating my

[02:07:53] own vision of it because i've seen movies and i've seen the play you know and then trying to come

[02:07:57] up with well you know what did what did beston la rue mean when he said it because he only describes

[02:08:02] the phantom he doesn't doesn't give you a lot of description of what you know what that could be you

[02:08:07] know and where the broadway played at a very um very like almost slight the cigarette as all it

[02:08:14] was you know to be more theatrical um i thought you know the face of death in especially in today's

[02:08:22] um sort of worked where everybody is very aware of very horrifying looking things you know

[02:08:27] you'd have to come up with something pretty scary so um that was my version of it so yeah

[02:08:32] tell me um tell me about um total recall okay that was um that's like that's all those games that

[02:08:40] they had this um double pinball it was like a v shape pinball playfield the two two playfields

[02:08:46] feeding into one head one back glass head right right it was yeah exactly i saw it

[02:08:52] expo one year the prototype okay um so they had to come up with a theme and again this was when

[02:08:59] Joe and Gary uh but you know basically Joe was doing the the footwork and and Gary was going along

[02:09:05] with it because it was working they were gonna almost license every game i mean it was one of those

[02:09:09] things that i think Joe enjoyed the process of acquiring the licenses and coming up with one

[02:09:15] and you know who to thought of a Simpson who to thought of you know it's he was pretty diversified

[02:09:20] in what he brought out now you have to say i thought he was showed some genius there when um

[02:09:25] you know with some of the themes he'd come up with some would you say there might be a car theme

[02:09:29] or something so who's gonna be into that well you know you find out that there's a pretty good

[02:09:32] market of you know young males that are out there um that like that stuff and um but with

[02:09:37] total recall it was a property they had it was carolco as a company at the time that was

[02:09:42] doing some of um Schwarzenegger's um films and i think it was after predator if i remember right

[02:09:49] and so this is the second movie they were doing after predator they since have gone

[02:09:53] and bitten the dust but um but they had contact or Joe would contact with them about doing some

[02:09:57] project with them and then uh that with them they'll say well we've got this and it was total recall

[02:10:02] so we did the um did the artwork went out to california to talk to him and and quite honestly

[02:10:07] one of the fun things about this job i went when i talked to students about becoming artists

[02:10:12] and commercial artists that i often say um sometimes your job description doesn't describe exactly

[02:10:19] what you're going to be doing i mean you you you may not think that it has all these other perks

[02:10:23] well in my case a lot of the you know as a movie fan and somebody really loves a movie is all

[02:10:28] my life to suddenly be in that realm of where they're all made and talking to the you know some of

[02:10:34] the actors and um you know movers and shakers in that business um in terms of

[02:10:40] for pimbal art was a was a side benefit that was very enjoyable you know it's one of those things

[02:10:44] that i'll look back on say well that was a lucky time to be in that business you know um so but

[02:10:50] we went out there and talked to Schwarzenegger's we actually didn't meet Arnold there but we

[02:10:54] eventually did meet him at a at a party for back to the future but um the uh so you get to get

[02:11:00] input from them what they wanted you know in a lot of times it's you just find out what

[02:11:05] what visuals they want to see or what they have a theme they want or let me tell you this turn

[02:11:08] over to you you you send it to them and then they'll come back with comments and um sometimes it

[02:11:14] will be comments like unbatman um michael peat keep michael keaton's um people were very concerned

[02:11:22] in that really having a comic book faith you know they knew that when he got the when he got the

[02:11:27] role for the for batman so they had me kind of square up his chin and make his lips a little less

[02:11:32] full and things like that um though but on Arnold's case it was um we just you know do a good

[02:11:39] job and then we sent the artwork in it got approved it did a great job Arnold was happy with it

[02:11:43] and um you know so that was it was very satisfying for that reason um but the game never got made

[02:11:51] never got made right right as i understand yeah i mean i don't think it ever went out even on test

[02:11:56] i mean sometimes they'll make a game go out and put it on test and decide you know what it's

[02:12:00] cost of manufacturing isn't worth the the the gameplay it got when it was out and

[02:12:05] right so sometimes decisions are made like that now what now you did um back to the future next

[02:12:10] tell me about that one and and if you met any of the people in that film um we did um actually

[02:12:17] back to the future was um was a lot of fun to do too that was one of my because then when my early

[02:12:23] projects with data east it was the first license game i had done with data even actually i i

[02:12:28] i remember total recall being after back to the future now i could be wrong no no you you

[02:12:33] could be quite right actually um because i remember that we had already gone through the experience

[02:12:38] of the whole you know taking a trip to Hollywood with Joe and and dealing with the people and

[02:12:42] that we did that on back to the future bob had um i'm just gonna have a joe had um

[02:12:48] made kind of connection with bob gale who was one of the producers for back to the future

[02:12:53] and he and you know give joe credit he just kind of just cold called this guy and said i'm a

[02:12:57] pinball engineer and i'm interested in doing some projects with you i think it might even have

[02:13:02] been the guy from from uh universal he was talking to initially but then they when they hooked

[02:13:07] up with bob gale who had written the script for all the back to the future was his concept

[02:13:12] he you know he was turns out he's a big game player and a big game fan and so he and joe hit it

[02:13:18] off real well and and i think to this day there's still personal friends you know um but um

[02:13:24] we uh decided to take on this project and it was already too back to the future games had been

[02:13:30] or not games the too back to future movies had been done and we were there when they were shooting

[02:13:34] the third and get ready to to release the third movie when we when he got involved in it so you

[02:13:39] were going to do a pinball that captured all three games basically are all three uh movies i

[02:13:46] should more correctly say and um so we you know we did that the only problem with that game that

[02:13:51] turned out when you get down to the end you know as there as you're doing these projects they're

[02:13:55] acquiring some some movie producers have the right to use everybody's image some you know

[02:14:01] contracts for the different uh especially the main actors they have their own agreements that

[02:14:07] you know they won't be used on anything else unless they get a piece of the action and yeah yeah

[02:14:11] you couldn't use michael j fox right exactly we were not allowed to use michael j fox and we um

[02:14:18] we know we just we we ended up using um the dock brown um with the same uh he he was very

[02:14:25] very high up he was very fine with it doing it and then uh michael j fox ended up for the painting

[02:14:29] was my son again i inserted him in the same pose that they used on the poster and uh in again

[02:14:36] because of the lighting and everything else it's not clear that it's not michael j fox unless you look

[02:14:41] carefully you know so that was right and that was kind of a little bit of a bummer because it was

[02:14:44] bob gale was very um upset at the time because you know he wanted to see the whole package

[02:14:49] represented me because he was totally fine with the idea of a pinball machine i think michael j fox

[02:14:54] at that point was trying to branch into uh movies and not be the little kid type character or the um

[02:15:00] i forgot the character's name in the in the um marty mcfly he didn't want to be marty mcfly the

[02:15:05] rest of his life so he was getting encouraged to not and then the other thing that um the other

[02:15:11] thing that came up was that you know they just they just want to get a piece of the action you know

[02:15:14] they want to be cut in for one part of the the payments you know for the for the license agreement

[02:15:20] so we didn't do it um and by the way if i if i go on too long you can jump in anytime because i'm

[02:15:24] trying to give you my recollection of the answer okay you're doing great i know you have a time

[02:15:30] time all of it now what about now the next one you did after that was um the teenage

[02:15:35] mutant ninja turtles right right um what a wacky what a wacky title the two um creators of the game

[02:15:45] out in massachusetts so we went out to meet with them talk to their people about the the concept

[02:15:50] for the game and um pretty simple concept the only thing i remember about that and this was

[02:15:55] it sounds out sound unbelievable but um we there's a there's a character of the girl who is i

[02:16:01] think a reporter in that whole storyline and right we've been in the sketches for her in the

[02:16:06] any artwork and and they wanted because it was pinball they want to her to be more um

[02:16:11] voluptuous you know more um it she sure was in that back last yeah i mean but believe me this

[02:16:17] was not paul ferris this was the encouraging that we i sent in maybe four different different

[02:16:22] sketches almost like with a each one kind of being more pumped up you know um uh and that was

[02:16:29] them i mean that was that now that we were surprised because they usually in pinball you're always

[02:16:33] being can you tone down the you know the uh yeah the female form a little bit you know so this

[02:16:39] was the opposite so and again for a for a scene that i thought of as kind of a kid's theme you know

[02:16:43] um at the time i i know ninja turtles were popular with pretty young young kids but that was their

[02:16:48] request so right that was that was not just me now on checkpoint which was the next one did

[02:16:55] there was no license with that right i mean they didn't like so with porcia or anything right

[02:16:59] right not at all and again this is joe um joe yeah and if you know anything about joe but joe

[02:17:04] yeah um he has you know had a garage in his home here in Illinois where he had actually two

[02:17:10] two layers of um he had like ramps in his garage so he could house some of his cars you know he

[02:17:16] is a kind of a car collector and that was one of his cars the um silver vintage porcia and actually

[02:17:22] i think i actually painted he and i that's another one where i did use myself but um i was one of

[02:17:27] the drivers and he was the driver i believe in the other car and uh that was one of his pet projects

[02:17:33] just uh uh you know again to come up with a theme that has sort of a um yeah a strong tie-in without

[02:17:40] having to pay anybody right right yeah he's he's a genius when it comes to money huh yeah yes

[02:17:47] i mean i i whenever say you know differently than that he's you know he's always on to the next

[02:17:53] thing and he's i'll never um never knock him he's as i said he can be very tough to work with

[02:17:58] because he's you know there's some you know manic genius going on there sometimes and and he's

[02:18:03] got a lot of different irons in the fire in his head you know so um i remember he was very

[02:18:09] impressed with joe silver when we went out to hollywood because joe silver didn't have just one

[02:18:13] secretary had two you know the guy could keep that many people you know jump as he uh yeah yeah

[02:18:20] interesting all right and then it looks like after that you did Batman right and that was fun um

[02:18:26] that was that was a very good project it was went well with daddy's went well with um with

[02:18:33] you know uh that universal remember a Warner Brothers i think of who we dealt with there and we met

[02:18:38] one of the head of licensing for Warner Brothers and a nice real nice assistant that he had a lady

[02:18:42] that was very good and she ended up having a pretty good relationship brother projects with joe

[02:18:47] we actually did a Batman retried at a painting for Batman returns for a second that the one with

[02:18:53] Danny DeVito and and that game never got made but so i have but i have two Batman paintings of my

[02:18:58] possession that were you know full you know full projects for Batman but the one with Michael

[02:19:04] Keaton i mentioned earlier that you know he was they were a little bit tough and it's only on the

[02:19:08] play field the the back best was fine i guess jack Nicholson loved it and we met um

[02:19:14] um i forgot the director's name uh young guy i was tim Burton and uh we got to meet him we went

[02:19:20] out and talk about the game and um as i said from an artist standpoint the only thing that was

[02:19:27] troublesome at all was having to modify Michael's face to look more comic book character like then

[02:19:33] he actually looks um but that's you know those actors goes to the territory you're

[02:19:37] constantly trying to tweak people's images a little bit so they satisfy the the personality involved

[02:19:43] but um tim Burton was actually a very uh use the term sweet man i mean he was he has this

[02:19:49] reputation i have in these sort of dark images and kind of you know kind of weird sensibility visually

[02:19:55] and um in person he's a very quiet not you know not super talkative but very very almost um

[02:20:05] you know almost a youth like you know in his in his personality so he was a very nice guy and kind

[02:20:11] of you know when you hear about these geniuses in Hollywood or these young genius directors and

[02:20:15] stuff you don't know what to expect and you know he didn't come across as any big egoed

[02:20:20] um you know power hungry kind of guy at all is a very gentle guy a very nice guy so that was

[02:20:27] kind of a nice um surprise and when we were working on that game but that came

[02:20:32] did very well i think it um you know you know came it came at a good time and the the Batman

[02:20:37] phenomenon had just happened i think it's going to move you already was already in production when

[02:20:41] we did it i believe but we they brought the bat mobile to the shows and uh right so it was kind

[02:20:47] of a fun time you know and again pinball was was on the rise again too i think if they followed a

[02:20:53] curve i think pinball you know with the emergence of data east and Williams was doing well and so

[02:20:59] pinballs were there back again you know so that was a very you know very fun time to be working on

[02:21:03] that product yeah early 1990s pinball was real strong again and then you did you did hook now i

[02:21:09] can't figure out is you know it was hook the artwork based on the movie or on on or was it a paid

[02:21:15] license or what paid license um and again this is another one where um we got the license for hook

[02:21:21] and this is this is the way these licenses work sometimes i mean you you get the rights to use

[02:21:26] the term hook and they sent us a bunch of their pre-production art of the different characters in

[02:21:30] costume it was not out yet i mean it was we had no uh no pictures of um the actual movie at that

[02:21:37] point we did go out to Hollywood and um and go we went on this on the back lot and saw the sets

[02:21:43] and the sets were spectacular i mean that was amazing but it was a it was a Broadway um set

[02:21:48] designer that had gone to Hollywood to do the sets so it was all done in sound stages and they

[02:21:53] were and they were actually when we're out there they're actually giving you know friends of

[02:21:57] the studio were getting tours of the set because it was so you know so cool with all the pirate

[02:22:01] stuff and the you know the lost world and uh or the whatever it was called i forgot with the

[02:22:07] lost boys in their their area the island on skull island and um so that was a you know it was

[02:22:13] very neat for that reason but the problem was you know you're you have the right to hook and you

[02:22:19] know spew spielberg is on board and all that but you don't have the right to robin Williams or

[02:22:23] um dust and hothman damage or i think we had i can't remember if Julia Roberts um gave us right

[02:22:29] don't think she did either i think it so it was there for some reason and again this was you know

[02:22:33] Kimball's coming back up these people's managers realized this was a good chance for some

[02:22:38] additional revenue on a life system so if you use my image you got a painting and i think that

[02:22:43] was another one of those kind of things that um the license you know for the concept would be

[02:22:48] this much but for all these other actors you pay another you know another bunch of money so i

[02:22:53] think that it was an attempt to capture the theme and uh so i used Gary and uh Gary Stern was

[02:23:00] hooked and uh Joe Cammanco was uh actually Peter Pan because they were both both shots of their

[02:23:06] faces were kind of a that's all that Peter Pan was looking up and you only see underneath his

[02:23:10] chin and he kind of had a robin Williams look when you look at it from that point of view and um

[02:23:16] and then Gary you know with the hook character has a mustache and a long wig and it's so it's

[02:23:20] hard to tell dust and hothman from anybody you know so um hard enough to see it with him so that's

[02:23:25] what we had to do on that one yeah so that was one that was kind of fun to do we've got to go out

[02:23:29] to go to the premiere of the movie and meet a lot of actors and um and and the party afterwards

[02:23:36] was spectacular party in the back lot of Sony I think it was Sony or um universal and

[02:23:42] anyway it turned out to be um you know a fun project in that way but the you know would not be

[02:23:47] able to use their likenesses was always a challenging so um and then and again we had no actually

[02:23:53] no shots from the movie to use right right whatever you're doing it so that's that's somewhat

[02:23:57] ties your hands a little bit and then you realize that there might be a shift in the direction of

[02:24:01] the movie or the costume or something by the time you've done your part and you can't change it you

[02:24:05] know so then you went to this um WWF Royal Rumble thing and the one thing that I noticed now

[02:24:13] in this era of data east machines the back glasses are great but the play field art it just looks

[02:24:21] real blotchy and undefined is there a reason why that was happening about now

[02:24:27] well I'm trying to remember um I'm trying to remember my first of all let me just tell you about the

[02:24:32] um the experience with WWF and then um I'm trying to remember even if it's my artwork or not my

[02:24:38] artwork because I did some of the play field art then we then it got changed because during that

[02:24:43] era and you might appreciate this was going on with Barry Barnes now and some of the um we

[02:24:48] we first of all there was like 24 different guys I painted on the back glass or the original glass

[02:24:53] and then they were going through all these contract disputes with these different wrestlers

[02:24:57] you know one minute Hulk Hogan was going to be in one minute the ultimate warrior was going to go

[02:25:01] to WW whatever the other one was there was another one with Ted Turner there was another wrestling

[02:25:07] W.D.R.A.R.A.C.I forgot what it was now um but it was a another world wrestling type

[02:25:12] competition so these guys were battling back and forth for staying with WWF and so after I had

[02:25:18] done painted 26 different wrestlers they come say well we don't have a contract with him this

[02:25:22] time so we take him out and put this person in and and you know by the time that thing went to

[02:25:27] production I think actually a guy named Marcus um he's used to find his name Marcus and he's kind

[02:25:33] of one that kind of used photographs for a lot of his stuff and airbrush photographs and I think

[02:25:38] that might have been the one that actually got used um because I I was stopped in midstream after all

[02:25:44] these all these different wrestlers had been changed and they made me paint Hulk Hogan

[02:25:50] he was all muscular and ripped and very vascular just like he was looking at that time but they

[02:25:55] made me take that out and smooth him all out because there's a steroid scandal that went out at

[02:26:00] that point where all these wrestlers were promoting their action figures and all that kind of stuff

[02:26:06] for kids and here you know they came out there's a big thing in the paper and that these guys

[02:26:11] are actually using steroids and this was before they admitted that they were just fake and

[02:26:17] you know entertainment as they say now right so um so I can't remember what I mean I still have

[02:26:24] the original painting I still have the the pre-production artwork that was done but I don't even know if

[02:26:30] my glass got on the on the game because of the the contract stuff that was going on because they

[02:26:35] you know I was on to other projects at that point and um so and again the play field stuff I don't

[02:26:40] remember um I know I can just say this and this is going to sound a little bit picky but um Marcus

[02:26:47] was a very good airbrush photographed based artist almost like Photoshop would be today you know

[02:26:54] that that's how a lot of stuff gets done today is on the computer with Photoshop but um

[02:26:59] he was not an ink draw he wasn't he was the opposite of Dave Christianson he wasn't a very

[02:27:03] detailed ink ink artist he didn't draw real well with that medium and that's what the play field was

[02:27:09] right so some of I noticed that some of his play fields were not nearly as sophisticated as

[02:27:13] some of the earlier ones with the ones that Kevin O'Connor did or that I did or people that come

[02:27:18] out from him ball background so that's the only answer I have for play because another artist was

[02:27:23] being introduced at that time too um and because you know again they were they're when you're

[02:27:28] working on one project and another one's coming up to be quickly done you can't you can't

[02:27:33] interrupt and then go jump to another project so that was happening at the time.

[02:27:37] When did four color process come into play field usage?

[02:27:41] Okay I remember pretty distinctly because as I did Frankenstein the Mary Shelley's

[02:27:45] Frankenstein piece I really wanted to use it on that piece because I thought it would you know

[02:27:52] work well with the style of the artwork on the back glass it it wasn't a game it was going to

[02:27:57] require you know huge areas a very brilliant vibrant color it was more of a textural and you know

[02:28:05] visceral type game and so I thought maybe that would be a great time to try to introduce

[02:28:11] this four color process and again it's it's a tricky situation four color process on a play field

[02:28:16] is much tougher to do than it is on a back glass it's because you have all these inserts and

[02:28:21] it's wood it has you know there's sometimes a slight bend to the wood and it makes it tough to

[02:28:27] to print accurately you know because you're only dealing with these little dots and if the

[02:28:31] dots are slightly out of register you have a whole color shift you know and so they were

[02:28:36] they were always nervous about doing it but Joe was again was pushing for it and he had we had

[02:28:41] some film done and then he decided that instead of when we came time to the go ahead on the

[02:28:47] four color or keep it conventional they hadn't done enough of the test to figure that was going to

[02:28:51] work fine so they said let's go ahead and do Frankenstein as a conventional game and then the next

[02:28:59] one I do we could do that as four color and we did and then the next so I did Frankenstein and then

[02:29:04] I did the golden eye game with Pierce Brosman as his first go James Bond movie and we did that as

[02:29:12] a four color play field and to my you know I think it all worked out pretty well there was some tweaking

[02:29:17] in the beginning and some you know a little bit of concern about you know keeping the the continuity

[02:29:24] of the product the same that's the trickiest thing about four color is that making version one look

[02:29:29] like version 260 you know they can be a shift if you're not careful in color so you have something

[02:29:34] that doesn't look like the same product and that was one of the biggest concerns and I and as I

[02:29:39] said before you're printing on a surface that is difficult to print on so that was the first one

[02:29:45] I believe that was the first four color play field was golden eye and did you want did you meet any

[02:29:51] of the golden eye cast members or and that was a lot of fun it was actually during the

[02:29:56] night didn't even know I was getting the project at the time we went out to California

[02:30:01] for the premiere of Frankenstein with Robert Demiro and Kenneth Branagh and what was

[02:30:05] interesting about that was this was a very important film to the English film industry so

[02:30:12] which one which was important to the English film the Frankenstein movie was because there

[02:30:19] wasn't a lot of film product coming in the United States from the English film market and they

[02:30:25] had made some obviously had a history of making very good films as well so when this was a project

[02:30:31] that Kenneth Branagh who was very famous in England is one of their top actors was very involved

[02:30:36] in and I think he directed the movie as well as acted in it so it was more his vision of the

[02:30:42] Frankenstein book and the rather than the old Frankenstein movies and the one that's most accurate

[02:30:48] to the book actually and that's another one that I really enjoyed doing because that's very

[02:30:52] familiar with the book and and it was a you know reinterpretation of the theme that was different

[02:30:57] unfortunately it wasn't real scary I mean they you know it was a very well made movie but it

[02:31:02] wasn't real scary didn't do a real big box a big box office but but at the premiere there was a

[02:31:09] chance to meet a lot of the actors and and we because you go down the red carpet with you know

[02:31:15] before the actors get there you're walking into the theater with a red carpet and the big crowd

[02:31:19] all around and then the actors come in and they have a cocktail or two jack Nicholson was at the

[02:31:23] bar having a cocktail and you know it's good man over boys have a drink you know really very

[02:31:30] very cool guy and there are a lot of celebrities in the audience and Tom Cruise is right he and

[02:31:37] Nicole Kippman were right in front of me when we were walking in and at that time he was there

[02:31:41] because his movie the interview with a vampire was coming out in several weeks from from that

[02:31:47] point so these actors kind of go to these premieres to right to get their face out there and so that

[02:31:51] was fun and then when we were in the theater the the first time that ever happened in my life of

[02:31:56] course is you're in the theater with all the celebrities and everybody's seated and then they ask

[02:32:00] they turn the lights up and they ask everybody to stand up and you say what am I you know what am I

[02:32:03] doing what am I standing up for them in with a movie and as they did they announced the prince Charles

[02:32:09] was there and he was coming into his seat and so everybody in the in the theater stands up

[02:32:15] and here because prince Charles down the aisle with you know I think a couple other people in his

[02:32:18] entourage and finds his seat down you know down toward the front and sits down and lights go down

[02:32:24] they show the movie and you know and then they had a big party across the street at Century City

[02:32:29] and at the party they had a pinball for the Frankenstein pinball out in the foyer where people

[02:32:35] were playing it and just promoting the game for the movie and as I was playing the game

[02:32:40] Pierce Brosnan came up and started talking and he said you know I never thought I'd see Bobby

[02:32:44] DeNero on a pinball machine and and Joe was saying it came up and started in the conversation

[02:32:51] and mentioned that what that they had just gotten the rights to gold and I and they're they're

[02:32:54] I was going to be doing Pierce's you know image on this good class and so we started talking and

[02:33:00] we talked for about half an hour and I get it interesting interesting thing about Pierce Brosnan

[02:33:05] who seemed like a very cool guy by the way is that he used to be a commercial artist before

[02:33:12] he got into acting and he had just gotten the you know the James Bond contract for the next I think

[02:33:17] three movies and I thought I think your gig there is pretty is pretty rewarding so I'd stick

[02:33:22] with that he said it was very tough as a commercial artist so we had a lot of respect for our and we

[02:33:27] said we've kind of just shot the breeze for a while and I mean well his girlfriend at the time

[02:33:31] was playing the game so he was a very cool guy he's a guy that I had impressions of in movies

[02:33:37] as being you know not a real masculine kind of guy more more kind of prissy type guy some of the

[02:33:42] roles he had played but in person he's a real rugged guy a great handshake you know just a he's

[02:33:48] the one that all these other actors with Tom Cruise and everybody else being in there the women

[02:33:52] that were in our our group were much more impressed with Pierce Brosnan in person than almost anybody

[02:33:57] so that was kind of fun now the the next project you did and it looks like it's the last

[02:34:03] project you did for Joe chemical was was Twister tell me about that one okay that was the one with

[02:34:09] the last one I think I did yes and it was just it was pretty much a straightforward you know they're

[02:34:17] making this movie about tornadoes and the actors are you know Bill Paxson hell and hunt I forgot

[02:34:25] there's a couple of I've got some of the other actors are in it but they were we know fairly well

[02:34:30] known but it was Helen Hunt's first her first movie before she won an Academy Award but her first

[02:34:36] leading role I think in a movie and kind of marked the shift in her wanting to become a major

[02:34:41] movie star from just being this character actress and even though she played sort of this

[02:34:46] pombo-aged type characters she wanted to be a little more a little glamorous and so it's from the

[02:34:51] the graphics on our members it being you know fairly straightforward everything was well received

[02:34:56] and except I think it was her managers are and Helen Hunt directly through them did not like the

[02:35:06] way she was depicted with her eyes being very squinty and all the pictures we had to use from

[02:35:12] as references had her looking out in the distance that tornadoes and in in in in reality she actually

[02:35:18] does have pretty squinty eyes I mean that's just her physical you know which she looks and so

[02:35:27] so I mean again we've sent several different variations of her and when you start to open

[02:35:31] somebody's eyes and changing their configuration of their eyes structure it it makes them look

[02:35:36] not as much like themselves and so you're kind of fighting that all at that but that was the only kind

[02:35:40] of hang up on the game that I remember and again these things are not unusual I know I know John

[02:35:45] Yalsey when he was doing Adams family he said he had to do Angelica Houston repeatedly to get

[02:35:54] opposed that she was happy with with her nose and different features that they're kind of sensitive

[02:35:58] about and so we we we're not a and used to doing that you have to make those corrections but it

[02:36:05] was a it was a interesting project it was fun except for that's the one minor thing and I think we

[02:36:12] went to Hollywood for that premiere too if I remember right but but that was yeah that's the last

[02:36:16] one I remember doing and I think then Pinball had started to collier the direction again if I'm

[02:36:21] not right it was on a downturn well now up to this process it sounds like that you haven't used

[02:36:28] the computer at all for any of your pinball artwork I had at that point I mean I used it for

[02:36:34] sketches or you know changing colors on sketches I was just getting probably about the mid 90s I

[02:36:39] was just starting to use the pinball I mean the the computer but but in terms of actually creating

[02:36:45] digital art that was used as a digital form I was I mean it was still it was still pretty new I

[02:36:51] mean there were a lot of people it was changing that was changing rapidly and dramatically and

[02:36:56] and to be honest with you some of the things that you might work 30 years on developing the

[02:37:00] ability to do the computer with some slick young guy coming out of college it's pretty good with

[02:37:05] the computer could could emulate without really understanding perspective or anything because

[02:37:10] the computer could do that so it presented a kind of a new challenge in the illustration world

[02:37:16] you know you had to have that familiarity with the computer and then pretty soon like right now

[02:37:21] most images are either end up as a digital file at some point you know I mean even if you created

[02:37:28] as an original drawing and then scan it and you know tweak it from there so I I use the computer

[02:37:33] much more now obviously than I did then but I you know I always like to see the hand of the

[02:37:39] artist in the work I mean you could see could tell somebody's style I know John Yalsey used

[02:37:43] the computer a lot he and I were both sort of reluctant reluctantly embracing it at the time but

[02:37:49] but you had to you know it's just it's where you know where the future of graphics was going you know

[02:37:55] so are you going to get back into doing pinball artwork again well you know I want to say no to

[02:38:03] it but I what I what I did and I try to make this real quick but I think about about five years ago

[02:38:11] I had an opportunity to make a change in my career that I'd always plan to do as I near the

[02:38:16] retirement I always wanted to go back into teaching and you know kind of my my envision that being

[02:38:21] sort of a you know a slowing down and becoming a little bit more relaxed in life and not having

[02:38:27] deadlines and all that kind of stuff so I have a nephew who was becoming was going into his

[02:38:33] freshman year in high school and I had raised him as almost our son my wife and I had kind of

[02:38:38] taken him in because it was her brother's child and he died the her his father died when my nephew

[02:38:45] was in first grade and we had become very involved in his life and I so much so that I was driving

[02:38:52] an hour every day to go coach him in middle league and wrestling and football and all down in the

[02:38:56] town called playing for Illinois and as he was going into his freshman year in high school I got

[02:39:04] a call from the people down in playing field the high school asking if I ever have any interest

[02:39:08] in being their wrestling coach because I had become a familiar figure down in playing field

[02:39:13] coaching my nephew and I had I think I told you before I'd always like to love education

[02:39:19] and I always plan to go back at some point I said no one was going to be convenient

[02:39:23] and this sort of presented the opportunity so I applied for the job became the head wrestling coach

[02:39:29] and then head to the site how could I run my freelance business as a full-time business

[02:39:34] and also do this coaching which is driving an hour away to do all this so then I'm going to

[02:39:39] re re examine things got my teaching certificate and I've been teaching for five years I was a head

[02:39:44] wrestling coach down there for the last five years got the coach my nephew be graduated and I

[02:39:50] this year was my last year as a head wrestling coach down there at the high school and I've been

[02:39:54] teaching art in high school and still in the summers I do commercial projects but it hasn't been a

[02:39:59] pinball it's been not totally outside like book illustration and package design and those kind of

[02:40:05] things because it really hasn't been that much pinball available plus it's between there's

[02:40:10] one guy left and they're using mostly I think photographic stuff now in pinball and I and to be

[02:40:18] able to say I could you know lay out six to eight weeks on one project would be very tough you

[02:40:25] know it's got to be much more fluid than that and all that shorter bites you know so um

[02:40:30] so that's I would never say I would never do because I don't know what's going to happen with pinball

[02:40:33] it's it's right as it's it struggles right now I think so now is there what was your your favorite

[02:40:40] pinball art you know favorite pinball artwork piece and who was the designer that you'd like

[02:40:46] to work with the most okay well probably my I have kind of four favorites I would say

[02:40:53] they're hanging right up right above me right now in my studio and um one was paragon because of the

[02:40:59] right theme of it and it represented a time you know the four color process you're solving and

[02:41:06] all out of that lost world is the favorite in terms of what it represented from a

[02:41:11] industry industry position but not as so much as my favorite piece of artwork

[02:41:17] I like Phantom of the Opera and then I really like to last well not the last one I did but I

[02:41:21] liked the James Bond piece and I liked Frankenstein I mean in terms of artistically I really in the

[02:41:27] packages I really like those those packages are a great deal I'm felt most most satisfied with

[02:41:33] those pieces and the designer I like to work with I like well I work for the bunch I mean Joe was

[02:41:39] a designer that was a very creative guy and very demanding and but the less of a

[02:41:44] I don't know he you know he always had yet Sabula as his mechanical you know guy that could be

[02:41:49] to make his ideas work out so he was he was fun but also could be very challenging to work with

[02:41:55] because he you know his idea could change overnight and he had a new idea and he was very um

[02:42:01] yeah if you know Joe you know his ideas are very yeah he's really right and he many times he is

[02:42:07] right so I would say he was he was fun and there's a lot of great memories from working with him

[02:42:12] but also very challenging the guy that really was um and I worked a lot of good designers great

[02:42:16] commit was a very good designer Gary Gatins a guy that used to work at Valley he had the

[02:42:22] evil cannibal piece but I would say Jim Patla and I hit it off the best he a lot of respect for what

[02:42:27] I did he did appreciate artwork sometimes in the pinball business the designers really felt they

[02:42:32] were king of the hill and the artists were just somebody to decorate their ideas that that wasn't

[02:42:36] the case at Valley and there was so there was respect for what what we were doing and appreciation for

[02:42:43] it and he was a very thorough designer I just always thought of him as a very professional designer

[02:42:48] that he would really he didn't just design a game he made sure mechanically it all worked and

[02:42:53] sent our was a major example that he um he really tweaked all the mechanisms for that to work with

[02:42:58] a ball delivery device and all right so he's a good one well cool thank you Paul I really really

[02:43:04] do appreciate all the time well I hope I haven't ramble too much but you bring you know we

[02:43:08] trying to remember memories it's uh there's always come out on your form but uh it's great talking to
