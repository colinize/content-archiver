[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinball is a online radio.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:12] Okay, welcome to another edition of Topcast.

[00:26] We have a very special Sunday night show tonight with somebody that's been involved in pinball

[00:32] on just a variety of levels, definitely since the 70s.

[00:38] But I have as my engineer tonight, Mr. Jim Shelberg of the Pin Game Journal, he's helping

[00:45] us out.

[00:46] He's also messing with the webcam which we are going to be using in full force tonight to

[00:53] illustrate some stuff because we have some good pictures to match the interview that

[00:58] we're doing tonight.

[01:01] So without too much ado.

[01:04] I'd like to introduce Roger Sharp.

[01:13] Say hello Roger.

[01:14] Hello Roger.

[01:15] I just want to make sure I can hear you.

[01:18] Hi, Clay.

[01:19] How are you doing?

[01:20] Say hello to Mr. Shelberg.

[01:21] And Jim Greetings as well.

[01:23] Hey Roger.

[01:24] What design Mr. Shelberg?

[01:26] You know.

[01:27] But anyways, so Roger, the thing that I always remember getting the first pinball

[01:34] book I ever bought was that picture of you in a Manhattan, New York courtroom in 1976

[01:43] where pinball was illegal in New York City.

[01:45] And I see this picture of you playing a game that's actually set up in the courtroom

[01:50] with a bunch of people all kind of gathered around.

[01:54] And I've heard it said that like you would like pick out, you were trying to demonstrate

[01:58] that pinball was not a gambling tool at all, that it was an amusement device that required

[02:06] a great amount of skill and that you would like call out shots like you know, be proofed

[02:12] in the World Series.

[02:13] You know, I'm going to make this shot and then you make the shot.

[02:16] I'm going to make that shot and then you make the shot.

[02:18] And I guess they were just totally amazed.

[02:21] But now that's just what I've heard mostly from Mr. Shelberg.

[02:25] You know, he loves to recant that story.

[02:26] I'd like to hear this story from you and how this all happened, how you got there.

[02:33] I mean, you know, of all the people in the world, you know, how did you get into that courtroom

[02:38] and you know, give me the whole thing.

[02:40] Sure.

[02:42] I know you're probably sick of telling this story, aren't you?

[02:45] It's a matter of being in the right place at the right time.

[02:50] I had done or at least had been working on the pinball book up to that point in time.

[02:56] I've gotten somewhat familiar with many of the people in the industry and I've done

[03:03] an article in John M. Scorley where I had been at that time, the associate editor.

[03:12] And it also done a piece in the New York Times and from that the New York State Association

[03:19] reached out and contacted me to see if I would be involved or would want to get involved

[03:23] and help me then legalize pinball and throw out restrictions that have been in place at

[03:33] that point for 35 years.

[03:35] Now, how did, so you were doing, you were basically kind of a pinball author at this time?

[03:42] Well, I was, I guess, with a couple, with a magazine piece and the New York Times piece,

[03:51] yes.

[03:52] But truly, I mean, I, and I've kind of told this story as well.

[03:58] I did not grow up with pinball and I started playing when I went to college.

[04:01] So it wasn't a dip, this was something that I had intimate familiarity with.

[04:06] And based on my college experience, the mall became something that I thoroughly enjoyed.

[04:14] When I moved to New York City after I left school and I went to the University of Wisconsin,

[04:20] New York City did not have pinball machines.

[04:22] And being in the situation that I was at, which on the quarterly, I thought this would

[04:29] be a nice way to try to meet people in the industry and maybe I could buy them a shake.

[04:35] That was really the sole motivation of what got me going on my quest.

[04:42] And I think the part that surprised me was, and going out to do some research initially

[04:49] at the New York Public Library and not finding any pinball books, it was like, oh, okay,

[04:57] now where do I go?

[04:58] How do I start this process?

[04:59] I'm looking at this in 1974.

[05:01] And I remember going back to the other magazine saying that the piece that I wanted to do

[05:09] was going to take a little bit longer and he kind of offhandedly, certainly, said, well,

[05:14] you think so much about the ballwinds right above.

[05:19] And at the end of the journey of going out and being in publishers, getting an attorney,

[05:26] getting an agent, you know, eventually three years later having a pinball book.

[05:32] But, you know, starting totally from scratch, totally not knowing anything about the industry,

[05:38] really nothing about pinball is the fact that I played it in school, liked it, and thought

[05:42] it could be a tab again because there were no games around.

[05:46] So I think that, you know, the level of familiarity that I was garnering with people in the industry

[05:55] through, you know, a couple of trade shows that I had gone to up in that point in time and

[06:00] then the fact that, okay, except for Esquire magazine, which in 1972 had done a feature on

[06:08] pinball, there really hadn't been anything as consumer press and here, you know, here

[06:12] I come literally almost back to back.

[06:15] There's, you know, a nice color feature in John M.S. Cortling.

[06:19] And then in the arts and leisure section of the Summary of New York Times, which is fairly

[06:24] well read, was his other feature on pinball and suddenly I became, I guess, much more

[06:31] real to people that I had encountered, Alvin Goutley being one another's, who had some

[06:37] doubts and apprehensions just to whether or not I could really do a book or get a book

[06:41] off the ground because, you know, there were a bit of number of people that you've been

[06:45] talking about.

[06:46] You know, the late Dick Bouchalle had been working on a variety of different pinball tones for

[06:52] years and years and years and eventually came out before he passed away with a couple

[06:57] of volumes that were truly meticulously done.

[07:01] But I think that having had some credibility, if you will, from being printed in the

[07:09] publication meant, okay, here's somebody that kind of knows the business or at least

[07:15] he's learning that he's had a chance to meet with many of the people here who are Williams,

[07:19] Bill Gourge, Hook, John, Alvin Goutley, Sam Ginsburg, Sam Stern.

[07:25] I mean, what's going to go on in that?

[07:27] Now, as far as like, who was trying to legalize pinball in New York?

[07:32] Who was basically, you know, bringing this to the city council?

[07:36] I think that it was God, you know, I did a talk at Pymboxbone.

[07:41] I forgot names for some reason, somewhere I was able to unlock a couple of doors in my

[07:47] brain and I want to say Irving Holtzman and Ben Shakowski, the two principles of the

[07:55] New York State Association.

[07:57] What was their connection?

[07:59] They were the President and the Vice President, respectively, of this state association

[08:04] representing, you know, the industry, you know, the efforts of the industry at large,

[08:12] at least on a local level.

[08:15] You have a number and you still do, although maybe people are not as familiar with it.

[08:21] You still have a number of very strong state associations.

[08:24] They cannot trade shows.

[08:26] They do whatever lobbying may need to be done for different tax scenarios or if there

[08:33] are court cases where people are saying, you know, we don't want there to be arcades

[08:38] or what have you, you know, in our town.

[08:41] They'll go out and, you know, they'll fight to fight, hopefully.

[08:45] And in 1972, the New York State Association, because this is not something that had just

[08:50] been laying there without anybody ever attempting to change and alter what had happened when

[08:58] Mayor Fielrello LaGuardia was in power in New York City.

[09:03] 1972, I gathered it from what they had told me that they had mounted a campaign.

[09:10] That's Myerson was the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs for New York City and she was a

[09:16] opponent of, you know, opening up the doors and in the restrictions, effectively legalizing

[09:22] the operation of Pimball Machine.

[09:24] So it's amazing that these people really weren't, I mean, they didn't work for Valley,

[09:28] they didn't work for Williams, they didn't work for Gottlieb.

[09:31] So you didn't have any industry people pushing for this?

[09:33] Well, yeah, I know that Rufus King was an attorney who had represented Gottlieb and

[09:40] company back in 1956 before the Keith Offer Commission to, I guess, really put into fundamental

[09:48] ruling the difference between an Abusing Pimball Machine and a Bingo style Pimball Machine.

[09:51] Right, that had to do with Johnson Act, right?

[09:54] I'm sorry.

[09:55] Didn't have somebody do with the Johnson Act back in 1952 that they were arguing that?

[09:59] Possibly, I mean, they got me on for the time being and maybe I'll come back to me.

[10:05] I know that, I guess the best way to describe it is that the industry by and large, New York

[10:11] is a great city, don't get me wrong.

[10:13] But I don't think that it was something where they were going to either live or die,

[10:18] you know, the business back in the mid-70s was going along nicely and didn't really need

[10:23] New York others in the fact that you would like to be there.

[10:27] So I think that it was on everybody's radar of wanting to do it.

[10:31] It wasn't as if the, and I think it was the MAA was the Association in Dengdon-Asc,

[10:37] because I don't know if the letter stands for in the column, it was something different.

[10:40] There was enough to remember Irving Holtzman and Ben Shikowsky's names.

[10:44] Okay.

[10:45] But I think that effectively, they were on this quest to try to open it up for local operators,

[10:54] local distribution, obviously, they would benefit everybody.

[10:57] Now locally, and there would be an incremental benefit to a thing.

[11:01] We're just looking at net sales for a few pinball manufacturers that were there in business.

[11:09] So I think that, well, one of happening in 1972 was things did not happen and they continued.

[11:14] And Eugene Master Peary, who was, I think, a local con conspiment or councilman, made a proposal

[11:22] again.

[11:23] There was, Eleanor Guggenheim was the new commissioner of consumer affairs and she was behind it.

[11:29] But there had to be, you know, the court case to make it official going before the city council.

[11:34] Now what machines were actually in the courtroom for this?

[11:37] There were two.

[11:38] There was an Aldurado and then the bank shot.

[11:41] And who supplied the machines?

[11:43] I want to say that it was either run in or monday.

[11:46] Okay.

[11:47] So one of the distributors in New York was monday for Gottlieb.

[11:50] Right.

[11:51] So who was run-doll and also distributor or valley distributor?

[11:54] Running was a, I guess a distributor a little bit for everybody.

[11:58] Alzheimer was the Williams distributor.

[12:00] Okay.

[12:01] So I, I want to say that it was probably monday that provided the equipment.

[12:06] Did you, I didn't have choice in it.

[12:08] Oh, you didn't.

[12:09] Okay.

[12:10] So like, were you familiar with these games?

[12:11] Yeah.

[12:12] And you did you make every shot you called?

[12:14] Well, I did not call that many per se.

[12:19] Yeah, I don't come out brag a little.

[12:21] Let's hear it.

[12:22] Yeah, I'm making that one.

[12:23] That's Rob target's mind.

[12:25] Well, truthfully, I mean what I tried to do was incredible.

[12:29] And the flip were explained just the overall geometry and what the game rules were.

[12:34] And yes, if I hit this target that's going to spot the two in the 15.

[12:38] Because I'm trying to fill out my rack.

[12:40] If I go up to the top, I can collect a bonus because you have two kick-out holes on either side.

[12:44] And I'm trying to do this off of memory.

[12:47] Obviously, the five lanes up on top.

[12:50] And the key ingredients for them was, I think that I played a couple of balls, gave, I'd like to think a fairly good demonstration as to, you know, what the relative skill elements were.

[13:02] The fact that there was a rhyme and a reason is to why there were certain features on the play field.

[13:07] And then I remembered encountering some pitball machines, actually in Scocchio, I don't know, at a bowling alley.

[13:14] Were they taking the plungers off because that was seen as being something that made it a gambling device.

[13:20] And this is well before the wherever, the auto shooters.

[13:24] Now, what about how were the replays set on this game, or did that just never come up?

[13:29] It never came up because we knew that we were going as an edible.

[13:32] Oh, okay. So the game was set as an...

[13:34] The gameplay was seen as something of value and as such.

[13:37] Being something of value, it could be sold bartered.

[13:41] There could be a gambling element.

[13:43] But New York went in under the same kind of guidance that I had experienced in Wisconsin. Wisconsin was an edible state.

[13:52] Now, because you went to school or you grew up in Wisconsin, right?

[13:56] Well, I grew up in Chicago, but went to school in Madison.

[13:58] Okay.

[13:59] And growing up in Chicago admittedly meant that I had no access to Pemball because Pemball was illegal in Chicago until 76.

[14:07] So they Chicago followed New York when New York changed their policy.

[14:12] Chicago followed, followed, as did.

[14:16] There was another case that I got involved with.

[14:18] I want to say, perfect for junior or some places.

[14:21] Another one in California.

[14:23] And you were involved in all these?

[14:26] Yeah.

[14:27] In some way, shape or form.

[14:29] Well, I testified in Ohio.

[14:31] The others, I think, that it was more just providing some background information and material to develop the chronology and history of the industry and providing, I get some background.

[14:44] Just based on the level of familiarity that I had attained in being able to sit down with everybody.

[14:52] Or mostly everybody who was still alive.

[14:54] Who kind of shaped the industry for day one?

[14:57] Now, how did you get your first job in Pemball?

[15:00] Wait, hold on a second. Is that Marvin?

[15:03] Roger, do you want to talk to Marvin, you go to?

[15:06] Sure.

[15:07] And Marvin, Marvin wants, I don't know when he gets up.

[15:11] Here's the phone number right here at Jim on the bottom of the page, so Marvin.

[15:14] Marvin, when he heard that you were going to be on this, he called me and said, I got to talk to Roger.

[15:22] And I'm like, okay, call me at 815 or something like that.

[15:28] And I'll usually, Marvin is like, he's going to be late to his own funeral.

[15:33] He's one of those guys.

[15:34] Understand.

[15:35] But here it is 815 and he called.

[15:37] I can't believe it.

[15:38] I can't believe it.

[15:39] Well, he's going to call back.

[15:40] But anyways, so when did you land your first job in the industry?

[15:43] Full time or?

[15:45] Yeah, well, whatever.

[15:47] I mean, I've been, obviously, I've been involved in the industry going back to the initial research that I had done.

[15:53] I had worked with some of the companies in the East Coast, helping them with various promotions.

[15:58] And one have you pay site home games being one.

[16:01] So local distributors, I had done some consulting or independent tasks for Bally and for others.

[16:10] But truthfully, the first time that I was gainfully employed was April 18, 1988 was first time I stepped through the door at Williams being the Zurecker of Marketing.

[16:25] Yeah, but what about that?

[16:26] Game design for Game Plan.

[16:28] Right.

[16:29] As an outsider.

[16:30] Still living in New York, still working.

[16:32] I think at that time, still at Jalman's quarterly events managing editor.

[16:37] So I had done a last.

[16:38] I had worked on Barra Coro with Williams.

[16:41] There were a couple of designs that I'd done at Gottlieb didn't ever saw the light of the day.

[16:45] At one time, I came close to working at Atari.

[16:48] Came close to working at Gottlieb.

[16:50] Came close to working at Williams at Valley.

[16:54] So, I mean, there were things that either just because of circumstance or one have you that never really, really did pan out.

[17:03] But at least I had the good fortune of being able to be somewhat involved as a person who was somewhat recognized as being a good player.

[17:12] And I'd come in and I'd give my input and offered suggestions or answer whatever questions that some of the designers had.

[17:21] I know that I worked on behalf of Bally for their super shooter pinball tournament and provided some play by play.

[17:31] I guess he's a local district that people may remember Gary Meyer before he was really starting out at the Playboy Tower in downtown Chicago.

[17:42] So, I mean, again, I had been on a periphery.

[17:45] I was writing as a contributing editor to play meter.

[17:48] I was writing for cash box. I was writing for replay.

[17:51] I was doing some writing for bending times for all the trades.

[17:55] I guess people tend to know me more for the 15 years that I was the contributing editor of the Playmator doing Critics Corner.

[18:04] Now, tell me about the game plan. You did sharpshooter and the cowboy on the sharpshooter glass is you that's without a question.

[18:13] Yes.

[18:14] Okay, now who are the two ladies?

[18:16] Two ladies. The lady on my right leg with her hand higher up my thigh is my wife Alan.

[18:22] Oh, come on. You don't have a better story than that.

[18:25] And the woman on my left leg with her hand a little bit lower down on my thigh.

[18:31] Is her sister?

[18:32] No, it's actually the wife of Lee Goldbots who was the president of the game plan. That was his wife now ex-wife Marilyn.

[18:39] Wow.

[18:40] So Lee is actually in the background. I want to stand there right side holding a shotgun.

[18:47] She's daughter that's in front of him. We'll go blind here girl and they're cat Mike Abrams who was his vice president partner.

[18:54] There's a guy sitting back with his legs up on a stool.

[18:58] And then I know to my very, very dear friend Steve Epstein in the very background is Z's cafe because he was growing up at the nickname of Z.

[19:10] He was now mo for some of his basketball college with a young fellow.

[19:14] All right, here's Marvin. Hold on a second. Hold on.

[19:16] Sure.

[19:17] Marvin?

[19:19] Yeah.

[19:20] You're on the air with Roger.

[19:23] Hello, much to Roger Sharp.

[19:25] Hi, Marvin. How are you?

[19:27] Good. Nice to see you. I mean, nice to talk to you and see all the nice things you're right about you.

[19:32] And you're one of the ICANN's pinball business.

[19:35] Well, thank you, sir.

[19:36] I think it's probably the nicest thing I think is that your son with a commentary column has been in the game.

[19:43] And their commentary column have an interest in what you create all these years.

[19:47] And I know fathers create nice things and then they just go away.

[19:52] But I think with your son's, I mean with their ability and what they do, I'm really happy for you.

[19:58] Well, thank you.

[19:59] I mean, truthfully, I never thought that what I have been able to achieve over the past 30 plus years would have been my,

[20:07] I guess either my destiny or my legacy in life.

[20:10] And I have no second thoughts about the way that it's gone and the fact that both Joshua and Zachary,

[20:18] I guess, have taken out of the mantle.

[20:21] It's really something special.

[20:24] I'm appreciative of the fact that they enjoy the industry and come to it with absolute passion and dedication and earnest belief.

[20:34] And not only would it just today, currently, but what the potentiality is for it to be in the future.

[20:42] And that's something that's great.

[20:45] Well, I'm sorry, but now I have to want to give Kudu to play because he's actually the solid.

[20:53] That was a website with all the information.

[20:55] But he never takes off a lot of the calls.

[20:58] I really get so many accolades, people calling it.

[21:02] Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

[21:05] I think it's time for you to go now.

[21:07] Thanks for calling.

[21:08] You have a good night.

[21:09] Okay, Marvin?

[21:10] What are you uptight about?

[21:12] Marvin.

[21:14] All right.

[21:15] Both of you did a nice job and look for a Roger.

[21:18] I look forward to seeing you at the AMOE committee.

[21:21] You're there, Arthur.

[21:22] Absolutely.

[21:23] I look forward to it as well.

[21:24] You take care of my dear friend.

[21:25] All right.

[21:26] Take care.

[21:27] Bye.

[21:28] Still there, Roger?

[21:30] I still am.

[21:31] Yeah, Marvin, he just had to call.

[21:33] Well, a special guy.

[21:35] Yeah, he sure is.

[21:37] But I think that that's the part that intrigued me always about Timball was absolutely the machines on some levels,

[21:43] what is really getting to know the people and the personalities.

[21:47] And the characters, both, you know, past present, and I think that that's the part that somehow struck a responsive chord to me that went beyond it being just a book project.

[21:59] Let's face it, there have been a number of books that came out around the time of Michael Kalmers and at Fipponsky and Carrie McGowan.

[22:09] But yours is the one that's out of print.

[22:11] Did it really stay?

[22:12] Yours is the one that's out of print.

[22:13] And yours is the one that brings the big box on eBay.

[22:17] Yeah.

[22:18] Why was it never reprinted?

[22:20] It's a good question.

[22:22] I think that EP doesn't as a publisher had a nice run with it.

[22:26] They enjoyed it.

[22:27] But never felt the need to go back in print.

[22:31] I got all of the rights to everything.

[22:35] And, you know, kind of toyed around with it.

[22:37] But it was never the right opportunity to do it.

[22:40] There was a financial consideration just because of the nature of the book, the amount of color, the kind of paper stock, and so on.

[22:47] Yeah, it's all color. It's beautiful book.

[22:49] So I think that there were a couple of factors that came into play as to not doing it.

[22:54] And, truthfully, there was also the necessary passage of time to be able to really update it and do justice to it.

[23:03] I remember Nolan Bushnapp, and all the people, I'm familiar with the name, Nolan really kind of put video games on the map.

[23:12] But seeing Nolan after my book had been out, it's called Straight Shone Chicago.

[23:18] It walked down the aisle and there was no, what are you doing here?

[23:22] Your book is already done.

[23:23] And it was like, well, I'm still around.

[23:25] I'm still like the industry.

[23:28] Coming back to his kind of tipping was, so what are you going to do?

[23:32] A book on the history of video games?

[23:34] And I think, well, when there is a history, because I think it was about five or six years in from when, on, it hit the same level.

[23:40] Yeah, and Nolan was responsible for Pong.

[23:42] He was also responsible for what was its space.

[23:46] Oh, that other game in the Farmingless Cabinet, that's...

[23:49] Well, there was Space War.

[23:51] Yeah.

[23:52] There was obviously Missile Command.

[23:54] I mean, a whole slew of games that came up by...

[23:57] Right, right.

[23:58] They came up by Atari that really kind of gave rise to video games and more importantly, popularized the notion of coin-operated amusement equipment.

[24:07] You know, Pimball Benefit, despite most people.

[24:12] In hindsight, one of things, it wasn't that video was suddenly successful that Pimball fell into the, to the dark of this.

[24:20] If anything, what it provided was the opening of more family entertainment centers, more mall game rooms.

[24:26] Right.

[24:27] Why didn't it appeal to at least, you know, it wrote on maybe the coattails to some degree, but they were writing on each other's coattails.

[24:33] Yeah, absolutely.

[24:34] And there was cross-influencing as to, you know, how both adapted to whatever some of the better things.

[24:40] Now, how did you sell your designs to Game Plan and to Williams?

[24:46] You know, you sold the sharpshooter.

[24:49] And did you actually, I mean, doing that?

[24:52] Was it like, you know, like, you know, like Pat Lawler goes into his garage and he comes out with a white wood that plays and he has it off?

[25:00] Was that how you were doing it, too?

[25:02] No, better not.

[25:03] Okay.

[25:04] I was at a New York State trade show and encountered Ken Anderson with the time was at Game Plan and I've known Ken from his days at Chicago Coin.

[25:21] And he took me over to look at a cocktail table Pimball Machine that this company I'd never heard of was doing.

[25:29] And it was real cigarettes was the brand on it.

[25:34] And asked him what I thought.

[25:37] I mean, it was like, my guy can't do cigarettes.

[25:39] I mean, Pimball things are still somewhat, you know, tenuous in regard to people's acceptance of Pimball machines.

[25:46] There's a lot of stigma attached to it.

[25:49] And, but I like the concept of a cocktail table and I wound up eventually that later that night having dinner with Ken,

[25:58] with legal boss who was the president of Game Plan.

[26:02] And we kind of talked a little bit about what his intention was and he was somebody whose company was AES Technology.

[26:11] And AES Technology was, I guess, a technology company of sorts doing government contract work and Lee and his partner Mike saw an opportunity to come in to the Pimball Business.

[26:26] And what they saw was the opportunity because of all the video games that were coming out in different cabinet configurations and some sit downs for those of the member old Pac-Man games.

[26:37] You know, maybe stuck somewhere in the restaurant that you could get much broader distribution.

[26:42] And the next one that they were doing was going to be black velvet based on the alcohol.

[26:47] And this is great. And those are two things that you can't do.

[26:52] So you straight out?

[26:53] We got a good dinner. I went back to New York. They went back to Chicago Land Area.

[26:59] And I want to say that I probably had a trip because if there's a New York State show, it had to be in the spring.

[27:05] And probably that summer was when I made it back to Chicago for the Consumer Electronics Show and did a side trip out to meet with Lee.

[27:15] Just to talk, see how things are going. They want to meet and come by and show me the new factory and what happy that was in Alcro College.

[27:21] And we got to talking. And during my, I guess, my travails and putting my Pimball Book together and having been around all of the secret back rooms of design and development and having had the opportunity to play every game up to that point for the previous 20 years that it had been manufactured.

[27:43] And having had the chance to play not only throughout the United States but throughout Europe, I had a pretty good sense of the types of games that I enjoyed personally.

[27:53] And some of what those component parts of play field design appeal to me.

[27:58] And Lee and I were talking and his time at Wesley, he wanted to get into conventional full size Pimball Machine.

[28:06] And then he was actually doing it done with these two commercial efforts.

[28:12] And you know that I had any thoughts about it because they really didn't have designers per se when the big atoms was there.

[28:20] It came over from Chicago, became Chicago Coin.

[28:23] But I did not have any hardcore designers as we were taking them.

[28:29] I took out a little piece of paper and I did some circles and I did some squares and I held it up to them and I explained what this was.

[28:39] But my drawing was and I said that it would be too expensive.

[28:44] And he called Winham-A-Makannems and I gave Winham-A-Makannems literally, it had to be almost like an African size.

[28:53] And he said, in some of the numbers, he circles over here, this is like a lame thing over there.

[28:57] Here's this, the target bank, and one happier, and he looked back at Lee and probably would be too expensive.

[29:04] And I remember looking back at Lee and saying, I told you, I mean I know that.

[29:08] And Lee said something to me that nobody else had because truthfully I had talked about doing some designs potentially for any of the other companies.

[29:17] That's a way of just saying thank you for all the help that they provided me and having my book come together.

[29:24] And Lee asked me, dead on, looking straight in the face, would it be successful?

[29:31] And for the quarter of another second that it took me to answer, I said if I knew anything about them, well, yes, it would be. So that came with fear.

[29:40] Really? So now that was that was sharp shooter, right?

[29:44] That was sharp shooter. And sharp shooter effectively was done in a fashion that the main portion of the play field is, and I'm sure most people noticed,

[29:53] got Lee's free-fall slash sky jump to the target bank in the lane configuration.

[29:59] Right. The bottom, and it's a flop, the bottom, said the jet bumpers was from William Seton, down.

[30:07] The giant tank was really utilized the way that it might have been just based on the, the lives based on that particular play field design.

[30:17] But I like the idea of having jet bumpers down on the bottom like that to effectively act as extra flippers.

[30:24] So I took those two brochures, referenced them, made my other changes, which were the spinner lane and loop around the kick out hall.

[30:33] And said, here, this is it. And I want to say that maybe about two weeks later, I want to fly back out and win in.

[30:47] And Joe Joseph is also their very instrumental in making everything happen. I'll explain why in a moment.

[30:55] But they had the white wood up. And the white wood up was great because my top right portion of the play field didn't fit.

[31:03] And the spinner was overlapping the kick out hall, and the lane, and so on. And it was like, okay, well, this doesn't work, guys.

[31:13] So what are we going to do? And Joe, excuse themselves, came back, and basically they altered where I had the spinner originally.

[31:22] And he said, what about this? And I said, well, that's great. I mean, I love it. And Joe and I became very, very close.

[31:31] I mean, he's incredibly talented and gifted person. Very hard working. He's no longer with us. He did some marvelous games at Stern.

[31:38] He did some incredible things at Williams for the end of his career. But his thing was that they didn't know how I would respond to somebody encroaching with my design.

[31:51] And I think it's when they saw how I responded to it. The rest of the day said, say, when I was a lot of funnily.

[32:00] I did nine out of the next ten weekends. I flew back and forth between Chicago and New York, which is where I was living.

[32:10] And I remember coming back, I want to say it was either on Christmas or New Year's, where it stopped watching hand going into the factory to play

[32:20] and time out the game for all time as well as making notes as to the amount of multiplier I was getting and so on.

[32:32] Basically going through everything. Snapper was the guy on the programming portion of it. I drove George Millett crazy for the artwork.

[32:44] Because as I told him, I did not want the Dracula artwork for Harry Williams game. It's done and done.

[32:50] There's a lot of purples and things. I wanted to be as realistic as it possibly could be. In fact, if I had my way, it would have been blank and white because this is my own or homage to high new.

[33:02] And I wanted it to be one piece of artwork. Most people think that I'm the guy also being shot on the play field. I'm not.

[33:11] There's just been the showdown. I've done the shooting. The guy is falling and that's why the plastics on the play field have horses and things reared up all looking back up that way.

[33:21] It was a daunting challenge for George to try to bring the life. But again, having said that, that was the process. The process was literally, as I said, being in the right place at the right time, getting a great opportunity.

[33:34] We unveiled the game at the ATE Show in London. Basically had two or three that we had built up with Wendell praying that the chicken wire and gum would all hold and the sketch tape would hold for the games to really function correctly, which they did.

[33:49] And the rest of the day is history. They want to be in Coney Island that followed, which most people get me credit for designing now. In fact, I totally don't do it. I've given them three other designs.

[34:02] But I want to do this to be flop of sharp shooting. And did a couple more games for them. And in between there, I've gotten very close with Mike Stroll, who was the president at Williams.

[34:14] And we talked about my moving out to Chicago and coming on board there and also doing design work. And you know, Barack Coro was a game that was about three years in the making before came to Martin.

[34:26] Yeah, now let's talk about that particular game. Which one? That one, truthfully, that one was a full size Mylar Steve Kortack put together a care package for me, got me components parts on hand view so that I knew what kind of surface I was dealing with not only on top of the play field, but more importantly, what the assemblies were below so I could leave enough spacing for lights, leave enough spacing.

[34:50] So I didn't run into the same problem that I ran into sharp shooting. So that was actually my first full size Mylar that I'd ever done.

[34:58] So when you say a Mylar, do you mean like you were building this on?

[35:02] It was an actual full scale drawing. It's what the guys now do with AutoCamp. This was a full size drawing with everything in position.

[35:14] Everything correct. So they basically just transfer this to, you know, however they route them, you know, right to turn it into a white one. Gotcha. Gotcha.

[35:23] And you did this again. You were still in New York.

[35:25] I was still in New York. Yep. There was another one of those, you know, traveling back and forth, back and forth.

[35:30] Barry Asher was given a task of working on the buildup. At various points in time, Larry Demar was doing some programming for it before he switched over to work with Eugene on Defender.

[35:43] Got 20 Kramer Paul D'Salt at Sahaki and Mr. Watson was the fellow in charge of doing the artwork. I think it was one of his first projects that he had done for Williams.

[35:56] Now, you know, you so you divide you designed these games for Williams and in and and game plan did you actually make any money doing this?

[36:06] Or was this just fun and games at this?

[36:08] I mean, there was some money involved, but it really wasn't, you know, for the money so much as it was the opportunity to try to bring to life.

[36:18] My approach to game design, you know, it's one thing to be able to have some influence on a great committee or a Jim Catler game or Steve Richie game or a giant for dough game or made off sites that got me, you know, I mean across the board with all these people.

[36:40] It's another thing to be able to, you know, really kind of do it on your own and show that maybe you have an affinity for this.

[36:48] Maybe there's a gift that you have and really much more of a firm. You know, Chuck Schruer was the first game with a million white because as a player, I didn't like making it tilled out again at 998, 980 before you rolled up.

[37:04] And the 800 and some odd sounds and was still flashing as the high score. And there was a reluctance and resistance for people who were first game with seven digits plus the start was hearing Williams a big game.

[37:17] Because we talked about it a lot and was able to affect it.

[37:21] The type of parts that were available, the scoring displays that game plan had access to only allowed me to six digits.

[37:31] So even the million light on time, Darah Korra has a chance to do multi lane change TM so that I could take three lanes and have them function as six.

[37:41] Double lighting up on top and I also gave players the opportunity to play for either a three ball multi ball or they could play for two ball.

[37:52] So I mean, so there were there were little touches again within God's the rudimentary beginnings of where things were with solid state and not having the same type of flexibility and familiarity.

[38:09] It's subsequent programmers had of saying, you know, what are the things that I was like and not just in the overall physics of the game.

[38:17] Not only in looking at sharpshooter specifically and maybe why it had and has been really kind of stood and test the time is that he was a thematic choreography of gunshot sounds for the drop targets galloping hoops,

[38:37] voices, hearts, feet up saying, you know, do that for the spinner, the dynamite explosion for the 50,000 point shot.

[38:44] I wanted something that was, you know, really as true as it could be to the same as opposed to just kind of being slapped on and not having any kind of relationship.

[38:55] And point of truth at least at the core of the original design was not that there was a relight we are underneath the play field in the center in the game.

[39:05] So original theme was Las Vegas.

[39:08] How did that change or why did they get changed? I'm sorry. Why did that get changed?

[39:14] I think that there was prevailing attitude that people didn't like Las Vegas as a theme.

[39:20] They liked the idea of gambling or what have you and I thought that it was someone innocent. My car would come out in 75 from ballet and was good.

[39:29] And the little relight we all think that thought was fun. We could have some fun with it.

[39:34] And the games that got lucky sevens and gambling as elements were fun. I just thought that Las Vegas is a backdrop was much more universal.

[39:43] It seems kind of hypocritical. I mean, you know, back in 70 Williams had gold rush that had like a slot machine.

[39:50] Oh yeah, no, I know. You know, I mean, that seems really odd.

[39:53] And I mean, a lot of it was due to and taking nothing away to do for a Steve Richie coin to turn more of Las Vegas.

[40:01] So we kind of got shunted into the corner.

[40:05] All right, nobody paid a lot of attention to it. It was a totally different experience in game plan.

[40:09] Game plan I was the only game in town for them at Williams. You had a design stamp.

[40:15] I mean, you had Steve Cordack that was still very, very active.

[40:19] You had Steve Richie. You had a number of different people who were pumping out game designs.

[40:28] And Barry Hassel. And you know, this guy on the outside and become somebody stepchild.

[40:35] So I mean, in that context, it wasn't the same experience where I could kind of guide it and know the things you're going my way.

[40:43] Some of the things got out of hand. And you know, Ronald Behold.

[40:47] I mean, I don't know if you're a core, but the integrity of the game design was still there in terms of the overall geometry.

[40:53] And what some of the game rules were that I wanted it to be. I wanted that type of multi-ball opportunity.

[40:58] I wanted to do a multi-lane change. So, you know, from that respect, it did work out.

[41:06] Although, again, when I saw the artwork for the first time walking into the fan tree, Steve Cordack took me down to the middle of the production line.

[41:16] And I was looking at the distance and I was like, oh, and it's just, you know, striking face with like fish coming out of her head.

[41:23] And it's like, what the hell? Do you know how I couldn't even pronounce Barry Barr?

[41:28] Yeah, I know how you feel.

[41:30] What is it? And I work, look, because Steve had his big smile on his face as we kept them walking closer to him.

[41:37] My game, what did you do to it? Oh, my God.

[41:42] But, you know, it worked out. I think that my biggest regret was Mike Strong not listening to me.

[41:48] Steve Richie had been working on Black Knight admittedly. And Pimbo was kind of going through one of his periods.

[41:59] And he adopted every game at the B.A. Double Level Playfield.

[42:05] And who taught that? Mike Strong.

[42:08] Oh, okay.

[42:09] And instead of following up, which is where it was supposed to be, following up Black Knight with Barry Korra, he came back with Junderlord.

[42:17] Great game. Don't get me wrong. I think Barry did a great job with it.

[42:21] But Valley was smart enough to say, okay, we're going to move away from, you know, what we've done with, I think Flash Gordon is like one of their first.

[42:30] And they came out with eight ball for months.

[42:33] And I still to the state believe, and again, maybe some of it is my own vanity.

[42:37] I think I'm balanced. The better playing game is Barry Korra compared to ball to lups.

[42:43] Eight ball to lups was incredibly successful because everybody was doing double level playfield.

[42:48] And your Valley came out with this. Very solid game. Straight forward.

[42:53] And I think that if Barry Korra had been able to go into that spot where it was being held back until 1982 in the summer,

[43:01] that maybe it would have gotten a better reception.

[43:05] Right. Right. It might have been thought out in a little bit better fashion, with more familiarity than kind of like falling into the abyss.

[43:14] So let's move up to 1988. You said you landed the job full time job in the city.

[43:22] Yeah, we're looking at it and we're not getting a call now.

[43:26] I put it on context and perspective. It wasn't as if I had been out of touch with either Williams or the rest of the industry.

[43:32] In fact, I had been talking with Williams the previous year for a couple of different projects.

[43:40] One was I wanted to launch a consumer magazine and do what I had been doing in the video games magazine.

[43:46] I had left GK years before then and potentially wanted to take me over the ownership of the original video games magazine.

[43:55] While starting up a couple of other magazines and doing some of the books, but I wanted to do a consumer kind of like coin up magazine.

[44:05] I said there was a marketplace for it. And with the video game magazine, I had given away conbalm machines taking away video games, arcade games, as part of a way just to kind of get leadership going.

[44:17] We had really good self-sipulation. It's great editorial. God amortizing it.

[44:24] What I wanted for the launch of this new magazine was to reach out to the various manufacturers to see if they would ship the games out with the premiere issue.

[44:35] And I felt that after that premiere issue, when people had a chance to see it, they would then want to subscribe.

[44:42] And I could get everything going. So that was one of the projects. The other projects was a game design idea along the whole.

[44:49] Another design that I was trying out to the third, that I was actually tied into my game design was the opportunity to provide two Williams the license for teenage mutant interterals.

[45:06] So when I wanted to get a phone call in March of 1988, it totally came out of the book. I thought that it was on the free gate.

[45:15] It was for the magazine or potentially it was for the license. And instead it was Marty Glazeman, Ken Fideson calling and asking me if I want to come on board as the director of marketing.

[45:34] Now the teenage ninja thing that didn't go to your company. So I guess I'm confused there. What happened there?

[45:46] Well I had gone to Toy Fair in 1987 and was just looking at seeing what's going to be hot a year from now. Back then Toy Fair were items and toys and merchandise and things that were yet to be released.

[46:03] So I wanted to make it into the marketplace. One property was a hoop frame Roger Rabbit, which I thought was got that inventive and everything that didn't exist.

[46:14] And today would ever go for it. The other was, I think it was a spillbook from Jim. I'm going to need you help on this one because I think it just escaped me.

[46:26] The former was in it and it was like with dragons and things. Oh shoot. It was a fantasy movie. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

[46:39] Mr. Schelber guy has found as a memory like a steel trap. I understand that is mine. Sometimes my trap is shut down. And as if to go in since it is. No, no, no, it's just a silver one word title. And it's on the tip of my tongue but it's not there. Anyway.

[46:54] And I thought that that was going to be a little bit edgy. And then I wanted to encounter a teenage mutant ninja turtles, which I thought this is really delightful. This is really, you know, cookie.

[47:04] Yeah, couple of guys starting with, you know, black and white, little drawings and things and the mounting, you know, a major campaign to see if they can get her off the ground. I met with the company representing the property and said, would you guys be interested if I could get a symbol company to do something like sure.

[47:24] And I said, okay, and I said, you know, I don't think it would be a lot of money. Not knowing anything about licensing at that time. But I saw, all right, we kind of had a connection. I don't think a lot of people were paying too much attention to the back then. And they went.

[47:40] And that's what I went to Williams to say it. And by the way, I have access to I can get you teenage mutant ninja turtles. And of course, it was met with blank stairs because they heard it. Yeah, but this is going to be the next hot big thing.

[47:55] And you know, subsequently, a canami came out the video game.

[47:59] And they were sitting there with, you know, going, oh, this guy maybe he knows his stuff. They would hire him.

[48:12] Well, what's interesting is that I was truthfully hired not for licensing.

[48:17] I mean, I was hired to be marketing. I think that Mark Lasmen with the vice president of marketing and sales understood where his strength was and still is today.

[48:27] He's an incredibly good salesman. But, you know, one of his strong suits wasn't necessarily marketing and all the rest of that.

[48:36] And he really believed that I could come in and between the two of us would make one heck of a team.

[48:42] If you want one heck of a person covering all of the functionality of what could and should be existing in the game company, let alone any company.

[48:55] So, you know, I got the car on a Monday.

[49:00] Kind of said I needed some time, got a call on a Tuesday and talked a little bit more.

[49:07] And when I didn't get the car on Wednesday, that's when it really struck because I was kind of, I won't say ambivalent, but I was hesitant to really make the leap.

[49:17] And not having to call on Wednesday got to realize, you know, what I wanted.

[49:24] And fortunately, I learned my wife was learning to go on, and she knew I always wanted to come back to the Midwest.

[49:31] And Thursday, I wanted to call and say, okay, let's do it. And we kind of negotiated dollars a little bit differently than we had before, which had never been the second point to begin with, but it was fine.

[49:42] And I wound up, as I said, a couple of weeks later.

[49:48] So, what was your first license work with Williams? What was the first thing that you licensed?

[49:55] First thing I went after was bad man in 1988.

[50:00] But you didn't get that? No, I turned it down. Oh, you turned it down? Why?

[50:07] I had deep familiarity with what I'm even, had been able to accomplish a valley back in the mid to late 70s, early 80s, when they really kind of bust out with different license things.

[50:19] My belief was that there's really no budget to exist for the game companies to do outreach and get exposure and visibility and awareness in the consumer marketplace.

[50:29] But if I could get a business alliance with a licensing partner based on a film or got away knows what and ride their co-cails, that would be wonderful.

[50:42] We can really create something that there would be public awareness for.

[50:51] And again, kind of going through things a couple of years before the movie came out and actually before it was even cast, I had caught something somewhere about bad man kind of.

[51:03] And, one of the things that you should actually have already have to minute so that to meet with some company, you only find out that they were only going to be one of the companies producing some type of merchandise.

[51:17] And then we need to talk to Warner Brothers and one of searching things out, contacting Warner Brothers, telling them I had an interest and I also got cast with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.

[51:33] I made a very big issue about I want to be on the cereal boxes. I want to be on the toys. I want to be whatever.

[51:41] I want to be give away pinball machines. You want the pinball machines on the cereal boxes?

[51:46] Yep, yep, absolutely. And they didn't like that?

[51:49] No, they loved it. The problem was that there was a prohibition based on the contract with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson that they were not going to do any kind of licensed merchandise.

[52:01] So if I wanted to feature them on the artwork and not use the cartoon characters or something else, I was fine as long as there wasn't any promotional things involved.

[52:13] So if you go back even to the first generation of toys, they're much more generic Batman and Joker characters than it was, the absolute likeness of these actors.

[52:23] Well, then how did they do that? Because they don't have Keaton on it. They were they've Keaton in fault.

[52:28] They were they were fun because for them, it wasn't mandatory as it was for me, my belief. I don't want to pay money and get nothing in return.

[52:36] Right. So for them, obviously it wasn't a deal breaker not having the opportunity to be involved in any kind of crossover promotions.

[52:45] They just did it the way the industry had done it for years previous.

[52:50] Right. We're going to give you money. You're going to give us some artwork. We're going to produce a good mall machine. Thank you. Take care so long. Have a good life.

[52:57] Right. Right. So the toughest part in going to the process was Neil Nacastro that that time, you know, the president of the company.

[53:08] What do you mean? What he was talking about? Mobile the work saying, yeah, we got it.

[53:12] No, no, no, no. Neil's comment was he did not believe in licenses. He didn't think we should do it. He said because truthfully.

[53:20] And I kind of started on this little quest just as a side thing. You know, look where it got Bally and you know, six months later we had acquired the amusement game division from Bally.

[53:32] We got Bally Midway and his belief was it didn't do them any good. They kind of basically gone belly up and we're taking the scraps.

[53:41] So it became much more arduous cast to say, you know what? I think we can do like a few licenses a year. It doesn't have to be every game.

[53:50] So let's be really selective and my approach again was and we're going to be able to multiply the visibility, the reach and the frequency of what we're doing by being involved in these types of programs.

[54:04] I just don't want to do it the way that Bally had done it before. So the first license that actually came into the marketplace was Elvira in 1989 and the party monsters.

[54:18] You know, all the licenses to get in the world, that wouldn't have been on the top of my list. I wouldn't even have thought of that one.

[54:27] Well, it was interesting. I wanted to get a phone call. I had gone to a licensing show by then and gotten somewhat familiar, at least on the periphery of some of the people that were involved in the business from the studio side and so on.

[54:41] And actually in, I guess it was 88 had begun conversation with Lucas, which eventually resulted in us doing Indiana Jones, but was talking to someone who represented, you know, Cassandra Peterson.

[55:01] Nice people. She's really into pinball. She was doing a lot of things back then. There's a movie coming and they were, you know, she's going to be on the tonight show will publicize and promote the pinball machine. She does not very farm every Halloween and will promote the pinball there.

[55:18] It was like, wow, this is cool. And more importantly, she'll come to the trade show and make a personal appearance. I like that a lot. I can generate some publicity that way.

[55:28] And that was actually the first license and it made perfect sense as a ballet game just based on their history of ample women that were featured in the artwork.

[55:40] Was she an expensive license? No. No, I mean, it's all relative.

[55:45] But I mean, I got to imagine that getting Indiana Jones was to cost a pile of money compared to getting no alvira.

[55:54] Actually not. No, why? I basically set up a policy of parameters for all the licenses that were all within the same relative amount of dollars.

[56:11] Whether it was Indiana Jones or alvira or World Cup soccer or shadow or any of them.

[56:20] There really was not too much of a disparity in the dollar amounts. That was just the way that I wanted to approach things.

[56:28] They wanted to do pinball machines and I could deliver numbers anywhere from 10 to 15 or 20,000 units and get them visibility and coincidentally

[56:39] promote me, meaning the game and the industry and the company so that we were part of the fan club for Terminator 2.

[56:49] We were celebrities being there for the Gala Red Carpet. We were there for the same process for the premiere of the Hollywood premiere with the Cleak Life and the Red Carpet for Adam's family.

[57:04] It was the morning of with Pat Loller and Larry and John and myself all being with Janet Trinvine and the DJ.

[57:17] Anyway, on this radio show and being part of a one-off magazine in the Adams family that was going to be printed to about a quarter of a million people where we gave away a pinball machine.

[57:29] The same thing for T2 when we gave away a pinball machine.

[57:33] The kind of cross-promotions that I was able to do, whether it was being involved in Broadway Cares Equity Fights 8 where we provided pinball machines in New York City for Peter Townsend and others that were doing a benefit in the local rock radio station with celebrities paying the pinball machines and people doing pledges and so on.

[57:58] All of that was always part and parcel. We were on, I think it was 17 million juice boxes for high-sea with arch rivals and I want to say police force.

[58:09] We were involved with promotion and in fact one of the advertising and peeling things with El Viro was that she was a spokesperson that year for Coca-Cola and we were involved in a national promotion with them.

[58:23] So the things that I really believed in I was able to follow up on.

[58:28] And that was the part that was most gratifying because it provided us the impetus and began that process where we garnered a heck of a lot of publicity.

[58:39] We had TV crews in almost weekly doing interviews and footage at the plant talking to the designers and so on.

[58:48] Articles and features running in life magazines and Sony and Scott, you know, the list goes on and on.

[58:56] Newspapers from everywhere. That was one of my quests, one of my areas involved with.

[59:03] And that took a lot of pride in the fact that we kind of put pinball back on the map after it had been drawn up for a long period of time.

[59:12] We're going to take a little break from our interview with Roger Sharp of Williams-Balley Midway Licensing and Marketing Department and we'll be right back after these words.

[59:23] Hey George, I just had to call and tell you about this really great magazine I got.

[59:31] It's called the Ping-Gang Journal and it's the only magazine dedicated to a little pinball. It's got great articles and interviews with designers and everything.

[59:39] No George, I won't lend you my copy. Who knows where you'll take it to.

[59:43] You're going to have to go to Ping-Gang Journal.com and get your own subscription.

[59:47] But George, the guy says that each issue will give mail whenever he feels like it. What's the deal with that?

[59:52] All right George, I got to go. Got to call Elaine and tell her, I can't believe how good this magazine is.

[59:58] Okay, we're back with Roger Sharp of Williams-Balley Midway Licensing and Marketing Department.

[01:00:06] What about your competitor, Dede East? They seem to really dive into the whole licensing thing.

[01:00:14] Everything they did seemed like it was licensing after 90 or 91. Everything was licensing.

[01:00:22] Yeah, that became a prerequisite for them. I think they followed the past of Ballet.

[01:00:27] Everything has to be a license. You need that. Just to get the awareness, if you will, hopefully get the receptivity in the marketplace to get the right license.

[01:00:39] How did you guys feel that you see them doing that? Did that have any influence on you guys?

[01:00:46] By and large, if you take a look at the portfolio, we still did original thing games.

[01:00:51] There were only a couple of occasions where I think that it was like, oh, we have to have a license.

[01:00:56] But that was never the process for us. The process always was meshing together design teams and what it was that they wanted to do is a subject.

[01:01:08] Dennis jumped right in for all of Ira. I know that Greg Ferris and the whole group of other guys just beat me up unmercifully about Billigan's Island.

[01:01:20] They wanted that one really bad? Yeah, they did. Absolutely. It was a game designed by Dan Langway, who's no longer with us.

[01:01:29] It was like a brainiac type of thing, which became the jungle run. If you want this great device.

[01:01:36] And Greg just had this great notion of being able to create a Gilligan's Island type of episode.

[01:01:45] And knew that it was something that kind of hit at part of our target audience.

[01:01:53] We wound up by wound up reaching out to Turner. We had Bob Denver come into Chicago into studio to do the speech for us.

[01:02:01] And it wound up being a very successful game. So I think that when you have that blending in, Mark Richie diving in on Indiana Jones, John Trudeau for Congo, which I really wanted to tap into the A3 for monkeys and things.

[01:02:17] And he has to do that one. And John was great at it. But John Ashley wanted to do Creature for the Black Lagoon.

[01:02:23] So I think that when you can bring all of that together, and it's not just a work for hire, where you walk in on someday, and you're told that,

[01:02:33] oh, your next project is going to be Johnny Nemanik. Well, really? I don't know that. I mean, George wants to do Johnny Nemanik.

[01:02:42] The idea of doing a glove and a mechanical device, but here's a guy who recreated a Corvette engine, if you will, down to the detail with the blessing of Pat Waller and me on the cast over both Corvette fans.

[01:02:55] Well, how hard was it to get the Corvette license? For me, I've never really had too many problems getting any licenses. I will let it.

[01:03:02] Okay, well, here's the big one. Papa, you want it? Papa.

[01:03:07] Oh, that just kind of figures.

[01:03:11] A Python just thought it would be wonderful. It was Popeye's saving the world.

[01:03:15] Yeah, that's where I was going with this. I watched Popeye when I was a kid. Never once did he save the world.

[01:03:21] Popeye was about being a bad guy and getting laid. That's what Popeye was all about. He liked the skinny chicks too.

[01:03:29] I understand.

[01:03:30] But he never once saved the world ever and he didn't give a rat's butt about pollution or, you know, away of any of that stuff.

[01:03:37] A green stance and Barry had some interesting ideas, at least mechanically.

[01:03:43] What's faith in him? Bugs, bunnies, birthday bash wasn't a great success either for us, although I think that John really did somewhat innovative playfield with the two levels.

[01:03:54] But, you know, kind of went over like a led balloon. So I think that you know, I like both times.

[01:03:59] And a lot better than Popeye.

[01:04:01] Well, yeah, I think that most people probably don't have real strong regrets that Popeye is not probably out there in the math quantities that it might have been other ones.

[01:04:14] So I think that, you know, again, it wasn't as if it was when I go back to this.

[01:04:19] That there was something forced it upon anybody. I mean, you know, Steve Richie, originally the conversation was for total recall.

[01:04:26] The timing was wrong. We got it inside track to do T2. The deal with that was flying out to California because they wouldn't release the script.

[01:04:36] And flying out was a jerk feature for the video game. And Steve Richie and myself reading the script because my promise to them was I said, if we like the script, then maybe we'll consider going in.

[01:04:50] And I absolutely love it. It was like, God, there's a game here. There are a game here. And I believe it was. But I mean, it was something that was hard-enched. It was quintessential Steve Richie.

[01:05:03] Yeah, it was great game. I mean, it was a little...

[01:05:06] And roller games? Well, that was my thing because the American Gladiators are roller games. Well, American Gladiators, I don't know. But roller games, God, roller derby, I remember that growing up. That's going to be huge.

[01:05:18] It would be like wrestling. There's girls, there's guys, there's costumes and teams. Let's do it and getting Steve into it. And, you know, unfortunately, it was a good game. But the license did not help us in any way, shape before we started.

[01:05:32] Well, was the TV show like canceled when the machine came out? Yeah, I think it lasted for the one season. However, the 13 or 16 episodes, they took it on the road and went to have you. But it never took hold.

[01:05:43] So, you know, there were those kind of failed things as well because you're going out there and you're taking a risk. There was a lot of licenses. Trust me that we wanted to turn down.

[01:05:53] What was the good one that we turned down? More of them that were, you know, here's going to be this great blockbuster, you know, TV series. And I think, God, you don't do it. Or this movie that, you know, kind of comes and goes.

[01:06:05] Well, what did you turn down that, that you maybe regret it?

[01:06:10] God, what did you turn down that? It was there. You know what? I would probably, given the chance over again, would have done American Gladiators and Matt Roller Games.

[01:06:20] That's first. Although I have a great relationship with the GAL who I worked with on that. And now 20 years later, we're doing some other projects together. So, that's a good thing.

[01:06:31] I probably would have gone after Stargate and not the shadow. It would have meant totally different type of games for Brian to design. But meeting with Ronald Emeric and Dean Devlin and I had had familiarity with Universal Soldier, which I thought was an okay movie and I'm reading the script and hearing what they're going to do is I just didn't believe it.

[01:06:54] It just didn't resonate with me. But the shadow was like God, I knew Walter Gibson. It's done a piece featuring magic and visited with him up in the state of the art critique.

[01:07:07] Incredible individual incomes in that world of magic. What his role was, what he needed. So I basically think, you know, when the shine lights between behind the rims, the scene for the radio serial.

[01:07:22] And here's this movie coming out. The classic. It's going to be huge. Well, the game actually shadows a killer game.

[01:07:31] Oh, I'm saying the game was great. The movie is forgettable with Jonathan Winners as the Captain, right now, at Baldwin.

[01:07:37] I like the movie actually. And you know what the one regret I have in the game is that damn trans like, you know, I mean, come on. You got Kim Basinger in this movie.

[01:07:47] Yeah, Basinger. And you put Alan. What was the charge of that? Was that you?

[01:07:53] Because I'm pissed off. I tell you on that one. I understand, but you have to go to main talent and can Basinger absolutely die.

[01:08:02] I do agree. She is the talent. She was and she probably could have been played up a little bit bigger than she was.

[01:08:09] Yeah. Can you get that one redesigned for me that translates?

[01:08:14] Let's look into it. Yeah, I think we need that one. You know, and with that guy, it just freaks me out when I play that game and I look up and he's watching me.

[01:08:23] No, I don't mind the babes watching me, but the Baldwin guys, I just, you know, I don't want anything to do with them.

[01:08:30] I don't understand, you know, although he isn't the light to me, we were upset. And you know, it all worked out. Of course, you know, and we got to be prominent for standard Bullock for demolition bands.

[01:08:41] For those people who are like standard Bullock, there she is in all of her glory, then, and her breakout role with Snipes and Stallone.

[01:08:50] Yeah, I like her actually. She's not a chemist, and she's a jerk though. I'm sorry.

[01:08:56] She, I like her, but she's no chemist. No, that's for those who are remembering back to that in a half weeks, I would agree.

[01:09:03] Yeah, yeah, there you go. Exactly. You should have done that pinball machine. Yeah, right. Right after Playboy, right?

[01:09:08] It's going to be the next pin 2000. It was going to be the pin 3000 again. Yeah. No, so I guess, you know, to further answer the question, were there any other, you know, licenses that I wanted to do?

[01:09:19] I'm, you know, I'm sure that they probably were at various points in time, but I would say that by and large, you know, the stuff that we wound up pursuing, we wound up getting.

[01:09:31] And, you know, that was gratifying. It was a testament to the quality of work that we had going into our product, the level of design, talent, creativity, our role in the marketplace, having probably at that time about 85, 95 percent of the world marketplace.

[01:09:48] For the ball, moving the market leader being very innovative, getting a heck of a lot of media so that, you know, some of us brought some credibility brought from cloud and to the proceedings and being able to get the types of assets that we needed.

[01:10:05] Well, it's sort of when you can get on towards the order to do speech for you. That's kind of a nice thing when he is, you know, actually there working on the approvals for what you are submitting.

[01:10:20] That kind of nice side of the work schedule and the work day. And again, I mean, for all the projects, you just have to learn about it, support. I think that made it all worthwhile.

[01:10:35] What about, were there any themes that you didn't get that diddyslashsega got that you said, oh man, I can't believe we let that one slip by or that you said, man, I'm glad they got that one and we didn't.

[01:10:51] Well, last action here all comes into lead in month one that I did not want and we got a pitch to a lethal weapon really didn't want to let that one down.

[01:11:00] Why didn't you want lethal? You know, I mean, it was like, okay, I just it wasn't anything out of the ordinary in terms of the films.

[01:11:10] Just they let's do a gun game and forgetting about the fact that it became, you know, lethal weaponator and people affectionately called it just because of the similarity to what's needed done with terminator.

[01:11:21] I think probably, you know, Jurassic Park was something that, you know, no one really wanted internally.

[01:11:31] I used to do some hard selling sometimes and try to justify, you know, why it is I think we should go after this.

[01:11:39] It was kind of a two way street the way it was structured. I would kind of go back and meet with the various designers and creative people.

[01:11:48] What have you put it was pinball and video and say, I think these are things are coming up. What do you guys think?

[01:11:54] And there would be times when they would come back to me saying, I really wanted to do this.

[01:12:00] They'll fit some of the assholes meeting to do one new doctor who John should go ask me positive and be judge dread.

[01:12:08] I think some familiar doctor who, but I wasn't a fan, I did not need to go to one of the conventions. It wasn't experience.

[01:12:20] That's a freaky title doctor who I mean, I'm not I know that there's definitely a large fan base, but I think there's also a hell of a lot of people that didn't even know anything about that show.

[01:12:31] Well, trust me, I mean the same for judge dread. Yes, exactly.

[01:12:34] We came out before the movie. Right. So it wasn't even a question of working with the studio and getting stalone.

[01:12:40] I mean, whether that would have been a positive or a negative anyway. It was, here's this, you know, this culture sensation.

[01:12:45] You know, like, huh? And I know, you know, not bearing it on. I mean, one of the best ones that he had, definitely do pinball was going out with John Newcomer to Denver to highlight their convention because you want to do a short game as a video game.

[01:13:01] And that was kind of bizarre. It's self totally different for you people that you would find it different ball. I could throw that along with a doctor who or a Star Trek convention.

[01:13:11] So I think that, well, speaking of which, I think Star Trek. I'm sorry. I was just going to sidetracked for one second. Hold that thought because I want to try to remember back to all of please say, good day to East licenses and see.

[01:13:25] Was there absolutely anything that we had.

[01:13:29] While 13. I'm sorry. How old 13 did that get offered to you? Yeah, but I would never do a license without getting all the talent.

[01:13:38] And the idea of having Tom hangs behind the mask really didn't resonate with me. You have to have weaknesses. Sorry. And if you look at all of our games, all the key people are there in the end of Jones.

[01:13:51] I mean, it is Harrison Ford. It's Sean Connery. It's Kerenl. It's everybody. And John, you know, right state is coming into studio to do the speech for us.

[01:14:01] I would never ever view those kinds of shortcuts. I would never have done back to the future taking nothing. I think Keren looks great in the back glass.

[01:14:10] But, you know, it would have had to have been Michael J. Fox and Christopher Boyd. What happened?

[01:14:16] Well, what about what about dirty Harry? I mean, you know, I've heard the story where you couldn't get you couldn't get Eastwood to do the voice and you actually had a voice over actor that did an unbelievable job.

[01:14:28] And then you had to scrap that and actually when when Eastwood actually was willing to do the voice and then it didn't turn out like the way you wanted or something. That's the story. I heard.

[01:14:39] You've been working story all I know is that he was doing filming in Iowa for the Bridges of Madison County.

[01:14:46] And I was getting phone calls and an almost weekly basis from the person that Warner wrote was saying, I just tried to clearly want to know about the football machine. How's it coming?

[01:14:56] He's working on a multimillion dollar movie with Meryl Streep. You're telling me that he's calling you from production, filming and going knows what to ask about the Pimol machine.

[01:15:07] Like this is the most important thing in his life. Just curious, just wanting to know. So they're really good liars there are really bad liars there, aren't they?

[01:15:17] No, I mean, he was very much into it. You know, we submitted the artwork. We told him ahead of time that we were going to try to kind of compromise between his younger look as opposed to where he had gotten to.

[01:15:31] And speech that is a new one to me because I know they did go into studio for us back at Tahama and Malposa after they were in post production on Bridges and did all the speech.

[01:15:50] I mean part of the thing that we did or at least that I used to do was you would get a Pimol machine for your efforts, customized one.

[01:16:00] So some of the software speech prompts that people have heard for Arnold's game much of that is his or if you have the special Star Trek software, you get to hear the personalized speech that exists for each of the seven main actors.

[01:16:16] That was the payoff. Please.

[01:16:18] The Flintstones and getting the phone call saying, you know, Roger, I've had second thoughts. We just looked at an apartment and had really don't have room for the Pimol machine.

[01:16:28] And they should be getting you know talking to him and saying, you got to be kidding. You've got to take a Pimol machine. I had a studio apartment. I had five games in my studio apartment. I'm sorry. I'm not taking no for an answer. You're getting a Pimol machine.

[01:16:40] So I mean it was those kinds of things or tragically having to deal with Roger Williams with a because you passed away and say, I'm so sorry.

[01:16:52] And we have a game. We'll wait. You just tell me when. But I think that the something is in a lot of special speech.

[01:17:02] So I mean, so much. Did they ever take delivery? Yeah, they did. So basically you're saying.

[01:17:12] And I've heard this, but I've never been able to actually confirm it that the home roms for all the games were basically if you type in the right flipper codes, the game converts itself to the party that's playing it.

[01:17:28] Yep, it could. Yep, it could. That's not definitive. Yes or no. There are things that truthfully. Even I'm not aware of or I have found out about it well after the thing.

[01:17:46] Okay, because like for example, let's take demo man. Okay, the famous home roms for demo man. You're aware of them. I assume. No, tell me. Please. Okay. Well, there's a set of demo, demo man roms that.

[01:18:00] Um, swears like a sailor. Okay. And what I've heard is in it. And that's swelling from slabs and storm. Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. And kind of back up the way I kind of learned about this stuff is.

[01:18:14] Duncan Brown and Cameron silver were actually at my house one day. And at the time, I didn't really know who they were. And they kind of there were other way to go to marvans.

[01:18:24] And they I knew Duncan lightly and he said, you know, can we stop by? I got a friend camera and you might have to stop by too. And I sure plan over. So they're playing games.

[01:18:34] And I noticed, you know, the point gives my basement and then we go to marvans and this is right when Star Wars episode one had come out. Okay. And I'm standing there with Duncan. Duncan does his flipper coats. You know, he taps it up and she comes up and says, hi, Duncan.

[01:18:48] And then, you know, he plays this game and I'm still kind of watching and Cameron does the same thing. Game says, hi, Cameron. Yeah, you know, I mean it actually comes up on the screen with this like, you know, the game knows who they are. And I'm like, right.

[01:18:59] What's going on here? You know, I'm like, I mean, there was so much hidden stuff that the guys buried and put in. Right. So my understanding is that that the devil man roms actually if you have the right flipper codes and you enter them, that the game will actually assume a whole different personality.

[01:19:18] Yep. Well, I'm got what the game. The evil or attack from Mars, lineman, lament, right. Right. Right. Yeah. And that's a great mode, by the way, because he that's what I'm hoping is willing to share. I'm sorry. That's a code that he's willing to share. Right. You know, I mean, there's obviously there's these other codes that, you know, they're not willing to share that, you know, they're, you know, unbeknownst to us regular humans.

[01:19:45] Well, and I count myself as regular human because there have been times and you know, people's houses or whatever. It's like, what are you kidding me? Right. What did that just say?

[01:19:57] How does that get out? Right. I can pass approval.

[01:20:03] Okay. So in your collection, how many games do you have in your basement?

[01:20:09] Already in total. They don't have to be the basement. It could be in other people's basement.

[01:20:13] Well, it's, it tends to populate the house. I guess I have a couple of dozen. Are they all late? Do you have all your game plan games?

[01:20:20] Yeah, I have a global warfare, uh, sharp shooter, sharp shooter, two cyclops. And I have a barricara from Williams that I did. I had stingray from Chicago coins, turned that I did.

[01:20:35] Um, type of those and I have games that I've worked on in some way, shape, or form.

[01:20:43] So, yeah, I mean, the collection is from 1871 improvements in Bagotel, Monarchy Red Graves game through a couple of other 30s games.

[01:20:52] No official many thanks to Mark Weiner for putting things into a macular shape and condition. He truly is a gifted master doing those kinds of restorations.

[01:21:05] I love one mark. He's the best. He's been one of the nicest guys I ever met. Yeah, but I have the pinbott that Peter Maxx had done the cabinet artwork for that the company had purchased for $13,000 to benefit charity.

[01:21:23] I think it was pop of three key depictions, tournament in New York City, blind auction for, I want to say it was variety clubs international of young children.

[01:21:37] But, um, yeah, I mean, it's kind of like an, uh, an eclectic collection, a fast break, which I absolutely do love.

[01:21:46] Uh, thinking it was, uh, not given it just due, but, you know, not a hinder there.

[01:21:52] Uh, evil, con evil, uh, Buckaroo, fun land, uh, NASCAR, Pirates of the Caribbean Star Trek, Star Wars episode one, Monster Bash, and it's kind of like all over the lot.

[01:22:06] Okay, now here's another one. And then Joshua has, I think, 15 in his place in Zachary now has six.

[01:22:12] And I think he's just buying a seven. I think he's getting a, uh, a cyclops, which is going to be at somebody else's house.

[01:22:19] He's, no, we're all, my wife will deal with.

[01:22:22] Are all your games, the games that you got at the time you designed them or did you have to go back and buy them?

[01:22:29] Um, yes, and yes.

[01:22:31] Okay.

[01:22:33] Global Warfare, I never realized it was, uh, they were ever built. So my many thanks to not only Jim Sheldon, but Gary Flower.

[01:22:40] And letting me know that that game actually existed because I just knew it was a drawing, uh, as a wide body for game plan.

[01:22:48] It was never really finished.

[01:22:51] The game rules are there, but the geometry, my god, I never would have let it go out the door. And that one found out about it.

[01:22:58] And Jim helped me. Who is the fellow in Michigan?

[01:23:03] Oh, uh, Wiley.

[01:23:06] Yeah, it was Wiley, Mike Wiley.

[01:23:10] Okay. Well, my, my, my, my eternal gratitude for number one having and having it in working shape.

[01:23:16] It's kind of amazing, uh, being familiar with the drawing and then actually seeing it in real life.

[01:23:22] So that one I got after the fact.

[01:23:25] The both Sharp shooters were, were new in the box. Cyclops was off of location from the Broadway arcade only because that was the one that functioned the best.

[01:23:36] Star Trek was supposed to be mine, but, uh, about next year or the original.

[01:23:42] No, the Star Trek next gen, but we ran out of games and it went to the ad agency and, uh, when the ad agency person moved,

[01:23:51] on Ford to Las Vegas, he called and we arranged for me to actually buy that from him so I could get the game that was supposed to be mine.

[01:24:00] Star Wars, episode one, I was supposed to get one and never did and they surprised from my sons and my nephew, Darrym, in Ohio.

[01:24:13] And, uh, I got woke up in the middle of the night.

[01:24:16] It was told to come downstairs and want to hold the living room there was, uh, Star Wars, the birthday present.

[01:24:22] So that was kind of nice.

[01:24:24] And, you know, when the, when the whole pinball 2000 thing kind of came around, I mean, were you in, you know, during the, you know, were you there when, when, when patent George, you know, walked in with this model and.

[01:24:39] Yeah, I was in fact the first person they showed it to.

[01:24:41] And what was your reaction?

[01:24:43] Um, I thought it was great. I got it immediately.

[01:24:47] The hollow pin worked. It was like, well, okay, I can see it.

[01:24:51] Who didn't get it immediately?

[01:24:54] Um, I think you're right, got it. I think there were a couple of camps.

[01:24:59] And, you know, whether or not this has been made public or not, I know that, you know, John Poppazine's had some very definitive ideas as to the direction he wanted to take.

[01:25:08] Uh, you know, the color monitor and so on.

[01:25:11] And I think that, uh, you know, we were beyond that point.

[01:25:14] We needed something that was going to be much more interactive.

[01:25:17] He was more of the baby pack type thing.

[01:25:20] Yeah, kind of. I mean, I, I don't believe that it ever got to the point of really being fleshed out as to what it, you know, it might have been just as a platform.

[01:25:29] Right.

[01:25:30] Um, I know that you know, it's a cost would have been, you know, some significant.

[01:25:34] Although probably the same because you're still dealing with a monitor and, you know, in about 2000.

[01:25:40] But having said that, I think that, uh, there was enough put into the platform for it to be something everybody understood.

[01:25:52] Yeah, this can work. It's still going to be a mechanical pimpom machine.

[01:25:56] Uh, you know, my, my regrets to some people who headed to label it as being, you know, video pinball really wasn't video pinball.

[01:26:08] You were still hitting solid objects that just happened to correlate to particular video imagery, but, you know, if I'm blasting away a martian by hitting a left ring,

[01:26:19] I still have to make the left. Right. Right.

[01:26:22] So I think that, uh, you know, it was, it was a great start for something that probably had much more viability and legitimacy than maybe people getting credit for.

[01:26:36] Oh, I think it was an incredible platform. Um, I'm sorry. I think it was an incredible platform. Yeah, but most people condemned it before they even saw it.

[01:26:44] Yeah, you know, the problem is just like, you know, you made two, two machines that would be like measuring WPC based on, you know, fun house and bride a pinbite.

[01:26:57] You know, I mean, if, if you wanted to look at the WPC platform and all you got to see was fun house and bride pinbite, and you didn't get to see anything after that and make a decision on whether that platform should progress.

[01:27:09] That was kind of like what, to me, what they did to pinball 2000, ain't something like saying personal computers can't survive the PC junior or the Lisa. Right. Something like that.

[01:27:19] You know, I mean, it's just, I don't know. I just saw it as something that could have been really, really incredible.

[01:27:27] Well, and, you know, give Pat and his team all the credit in the world for what was your blocks was and might have been, if it had ever been made in a real world, Pat really took a different approach.

[01:27:40] And the notion of needing to have a center area for the screen, you know, have brought it in as much more of a visual compliment and, you know, giving peak.

[01:27:52] A lot of credit for Trotsky for what he and time were working on on Playboy.

[01:27:58] Yeah, I mean, there was a definite, a sure of the technology. I think that if we had been able to continue moving forward that we probably would have seen something that people would have absolutely said, okay, this is kind of neat and fun.

[01:28:18] There would have been the ability to get which was one of the major selling points for the pinball 2000 platform anyway.

[01:28:27] So at the time, you know, pinball was, you know, in the early 90s to the, you know, the mid to late 90s pinball was basically financing the slot machine division at Williams.

[01:28:38] And then all kind of, I mean, to understand we weren't in the business.

[01:28:43] Right, but well, you were trying to get in the business and I GT was trying to make your life as difficult as possible.

[01:28:50] Yeah, and thankfully they did so because it allowed Williams or WMS now to be much more successful than the company ever would have been by putting in the screws on the Thomas patent.

[01:29:02] The plan was to do conventional slot machines and the background was to do video slots, which should have been successful in Australia and never come really here in any, you know, measure of success or penetration in the marketplace.

[01:29:17] And when the company wasn't allowed to move forward with conventional slots, all the effort, all the manpower when it was developing video slots on the hand games like real men and jackpot party.

[01:29:30] They came out and suddenly standard and immediately gave WMS a 30% market share.

[01:29:37] So in attempting to cripple the company, what I GT said was what they did was effectively give life and sustenance to the company.

[01:29:48] Yeah, they made you, they made you get up to the mills. They made it to success.

[01:29:52] What's fun to thank God for doing what they did otherwise with the company you've ever gotten around to it.

[01:29:59] Yeah, somewhere down the road, would it have had the kind of impact initially? Probably not.

[01:30:05] But the problem is that at least five to seven years behind where we are today is a significant factor in the marketplace.

[01:30:13] So I've seen Neil subsequent to it and I think if you asked him today, one of the things that he would say to you is that he probably made a mistake in pulling the plug when he did.

[01:30:23] Really?

[01:30:24] Yeah. I mean Neil really has his heart and coin up. I mean that's what he grew up around.

[01:30:30] I think the issue became one of you have a publicly traded stock that is a leisure time entertainment industry.

[01:30:38] And you have ups and downs and ups and downs. Absolutely radically, also stock price and expectation.

[01:30:45] The same way that time Warner has gotten hammered because of AOL, Viacom has gotten hit.

[01:30:51] I mean, looking at major corporations is combining a universal and NBC.

[01:30:57] It becomes a situation that is nightmarish and when you have seasonality for some product,

[01:31:07] it makes that much more difficult. And when you have uncertainty for some product and you're not bringing in measurable profits to the bottom line and you have expensive operating expenses because the manufacturing pinball is not inexpensive.

[01:31:24] The AOLI went through it. Most definitely.

[01:31:28] As a public AOL company, with Gottlieb, they went through with Columbia Pictures and then Coca-Cola.

[01:31:37] And finally they abandoned them and think back when that was in the beginning of the 80s.

[01:31:42] Didn't even give it a chance to live or thrive or survive.

[01:31:46] Well, so you're saying that that Nicasso, you know, he didn't have any, he wasn't trying to push pinball out the door.

[01:31:54] No, he was trying to push everybody to a solution.

[01:31:57] Give me something where we can show some dramatic improvement and growth.

[01:32:01] Give me something where we can change things over.

[01:32:04] Look, take a look at Twilight Zone and what Pat Lawler tried to do.

[01:32:07] You know, the replacement marketplace is a great way to go into business.

[01:32:11] You have conventional football machines and through cycles, through technology changes.

[01:32:17] Well, I had a lecture mechanical but now everything is out from the New York style of state.

[01:32:22] I have to get rid of these old games.

[01:32:24] Oh, I have Alphanumerics now.matrix display.

[01:32:28] Oh, I guess I have to get rid of these.

[01:32:30] Pat's intention with Twilight Zone was I'm going to give them a new shape.

[01:32:34] A different thing to do that's going to become part and parcel and maybe they have to weed out their older kids.

[01:32:40] I mean, you have to try to recycle.

[01:32:42] You know, Jim and I were talking earlier today and I think that one of the issues and one of the problems and it's a daunting task for Gary Stern to for anybody.

[01:32:50] And for any of us back then was how does the player I'm sophisticated out in the real world differentiate between medieval madness and family guy?

[01:33:03] You don't.

[01:33:05] A lot of what you are seeing as features and functionality on the games are somewhat similar to the uneducated eye.

[01:33:12] So those of us who are close enough to the hobby or those of us who are art and players and kind of follow things we kind of know.

[01:33:20] But you know, by and large it becomes much more seamless now if you take a drum scoring unit and a game from the 1960s and putting up against anything new.

[01:33:30] All right, there's a change. There's a difference.

[01:33:33] If you show them a pinball 2000 that's a difference.

[01:33:36] You could take out a pinball 2000 put in location today and I guarantee you that for the average person it'd be like wow that's new.

[01:33:43] Well, no, it's not. It's eight years old. That's new.

[01:33:47] So I think that it's a question of really kind of putting things into the proper context and the problem that you have with pinball was that all the games were kind of like the same.

[01:33:58] So we're going to go to the color got matrix.

[01:34:00] Okay, what do you do? Is that really changed things?

[01:34:04] Well, it's a problem that you know arcade video games and everybody's kind of doing the same stuff the technology was changing the graphic imagery was changing.

[01:34:13] There's much more life like much more realistic.

[01:34:16] But by and large it was still a video game still just only a pinball machine.

[01:34:21] Yeah, then I think it stands revolution, right?

[01:34:23] I'm sorry?

[01:34:24] Then came dance dance revolution.

[01:34:26] Yeah, really.

[01:34:27] And if you think back to what by undy had done with the original Nintendo system with the exercise man.

[01:34:33] That's not anything that's new either.

[01:34:36] And even cast Wilfinstein which led rise to doom and halo and all the others is first person shooters.

[01:34:43] That's all old stuff.

[01:34:45] But you know, you bring it out as a new coat of paint.

[01:34:48] People gravitate to it and they think that it's something that's original and new and people like me who unfortunately are incredibly old

[01:34:55] and sometimes have memory cells that still work.

[01:34:58] I look at stuff and I just see it as being a derivative from something of you know 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago or more.

[01:35:06] Now, now, are you doing any work with Stern in their licensing arms?

[01:35:11] Sure.

[01:35:12] I tend to lead two careers.

[01:35:17] I am licensing brain manager for WMS gaming.

[01:35:23] So my new game in town is slot machines.

[01:35:26] And I do licensing for our slot products.

[01:35:31] And I also have my own company where I do consulting.

[01:35:36] And that consulting is whether it's licensing related or product design and development or advertising and marketing and promotions.

[01:35:45] It's all the things that I have an expertise in and I have you know, stepped in one asked.

[01:35:52] I've had a long, you know, long friendship and relationship with Gary and previously with his dad.

[01:36:00] I've helped a little bit on Terminator 3, NASCAR, Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:36:06] So, yeah.

[01:36:08] I'm there when possible.

[01:36:11] But I've also worked with Eugene Jarvis and his crew at Roth Roles for Fast and Afurious.

[01:36:17] Or for Bay Tech most recently for a novelty redemption game based on American Idol or ICE for their MBA pop-of-shop basketball game.

[01:36:28] So you're still having fun with this?

[01:36:31] I love it.

[01:36:32] You do.

[01:36:33] Okay.

[01:36:34] Yeah, I mean, I think that, look, I still believe in the business, meaning the coin out business.

[01:36:38] I think there's a marketplace for it.

[01:36:40] I think that a lot of people, known as business people, but also the players have abandoned those venues.

[01:36:48] And as a result of falling in this repair, it's a shame.

[01:36:53] I think that if people really had the desire of the belief of wanting to support something that they really enjoy,

[01:36:59] whether it's convolved to do or anything, then you make it your own personal mission.

[01:37:06] And people just don't have the appetite and just desire to do that.

[01:37:10] So having said that, if there's some ways that I can do things that can bring some attention to the marketplace on either a product-like product basis or something of technology driven,

[01:37:21] then that's something I want to do.

[01:37:24] It's a good industry.

[01:37:26] And unfortunately for a variety of different factors, it has an achieved a stature, the sustainability, or the level of success.

[01:37:34] And they probably really does deserve, and most people tend to overlook it.

[01:37:38] You think-

[01:37:39] Much easier to look at Xbox Live and PSP, and the Wii and all the rest of it and say, God, that's the hot stuff.

[01:37:48] You do think pinwall ever has a chance of resurfacing at Williams?

[01:37:54] No.

[01:37:55] Never, huh?

[01:37:56] No.

[01:37:57] You don't have the labor involved that can work on something as meticulously as a pinball machine needs.

[01:38:08] And you're taking this away from a slot machine, but a lot of it is just the electronics and so on.

[01:38:12] But the pinball you're really looking at a variety of boards and different component parts, I mean as Gary has often said,

[01:38:18] it's over 3,000 parts and it takes longer to build a pinball machine than it does the Taurus.

[01:38:25] And I think that you need number one to be a probably health company.

[01:38:32] He can't be public because you're going to have your down quarters and that's what Gary is doing to absolutely survive.

[01:38:39] If you ever took the company public, you'd be screwed.

[01:38:43] It would be over the matter of I would give it two to three years max before the shareholders would say, hey, time out.

[01:38:50] Sorry.

[01:38:53] Because that can make sure the beast.

[01:38:56] So I think that for private people, whether the wing dealers of the world or Gene Cunningham's or John Ross and his guys up in Minnesota

[01:39:07] that are doing customized pinball machines, if any of them ever get the desire to want to really start doing stuff.

[01:39:14] Is there room in the marketplace for pinball machines?

[01:39:17] Yes. Is there room to absorb more than what is being produced currently?

[01:39:21] I believe so.

[01:39:23] Is ultra pin from global VR going to provide some kind of a niche into that?

[01:39:28] Who knows?

[01:39:29] It's an interesting platform. It's pinball, but it's pinball with a difference.

[01:39:34] I'm sure that a lot of people have already made their opinions felt whether they've played it or not, just based on what they've seen, heard, read or got only notes what.

[01:39:46] Sometimes those initial speculations are not always positive to the benefit of anything, whether it's a new movie that opened.

[01:39:57] People said, oh my god, what a piece of trash.

[01:40:00] Oh, did you see it? No, but I heard about it from somebody or I saw something in the news somewhere or read something in the newspaper and that's supposed to be just terrible.

[01:40:08] Oh, okay. Or conversely, just being incredible. It's the greatest, wonderful, you go to the movie and it's like, what was he talking about?

[01:40:16] So I think everybody has to judge on their own.

[01:40:19] I know that that kind of got off the track from, is there a room in the world for Williams to ever consider doing pinball?

[01:40:25] But hopefully in trying to frame it in such a way that I don't see that being a possibility, but I would like to see, you know, they're being a healthy and vital marketplace for new pinball.

[01:40:39] What about you started Papa?

[01:40:43] Yep.

[01:40:44] What year was that?

[01:40:49] Papa had to be when it really did first start, was probably around 76, 77.

[01:40:56] What maybe you should explain exactly what it is and what you're, you know, it was you and your best friend that started it.

[01:41:03] And why don't you give us a little history on the whole thing?

[01:41:06] Well, the Professional and Amateur Pinball Association. The outgrowth, so it had to be, it had to be 77.

[01:41:15] The outgrowth was my experience being involved in super-shooter and helping oversee and structure that final tournament that drew in a million players.

[01:41:30] Top 32 players coming in the Chicago for a God-winter event, I don't know if a footage should exist anymore.

[01:41:38] But that was on live news. I mean, at ABC, at CBS, NBC, he had all the major networks there covering this pinball spectacle.

[01:41:49] It was, it was astounding.

[01:41:51] You had players, I think, that it is a top 20. For some reason, it's a 32. I think it was like a top 20.

[01:41:59] Players who had competed in Laptop castles everywhere and it made it through the regional qualifying or local qualifying, the mega-tune, the national event.

[01:42:10] And the age range was from 11 year old to a 32, and one woman. That's right, it was 20 because there's 19 guys in this one, one gal.

[01:42:22] It wasn't Brooke Shields right after that movie, she did, was it? No, just check it.

[01:42:27] I had a comment.

[01:42:28] See that movie Mr. Robert?

[01:42:29] It was a tilt, yeah.

[01:42:30] See, was that pop one year?

[01:42:32] Yes, she was.

[01:42:33] As a matter of fact, the same year that we had the cast at Tommy here.

[01:42:37] So, the fact that we were one of the people that was happening was it takes nothing away from Ken Lundsford who was the champion.

[01:42:46] But there was a better player over the course of that weekend.

[01:42:49] And the structure of how Bailey had done, the finals was, I think, it was two out of three games.

[01:42:56] Last game was on April, and it was total points rather than number of wins.

[01:43:04] And I think that it's Gorilla, the guy named it, if you're gonna, rushing his Joe Gorilla.

[01:43:11] And he won two of the three games, but Ken Lundsford had an amazing ball on the last game, and he was total points he won the game in the championship.

[01:43:18] And it was done, that was a bumblebee.

[01:43:20] And it went back, and there had always been a debate as to who was the better player, Steve Gump, Steve Ernitzoff.

[01:43:25] And I used to say, Steve gets more of a high, but on a more consistent basis, I am the better, more consistent player.

[01:43:33] Well, were you guys who weren't competing in that shootout, were you?

[01:43:37] No, no, no, I never believed personally for me, and this is probably a much more esoteric, philosophical basis.

[01:43:46] I never believed in competing under a ball, which is why I never competed in any tournament.

[01:43:52] He made him always much more special than that, they didn't want to bring it down to that level, or bring it over to that level.

[01:43:59] It just had a special place in my heart, and I thought that some of them would kind of cheapen my relationship to the games, if I may be cheapen as not the right word, but for some words, and I probably not able to pull out of the year.

[01:44:13] So, there was an advance of the tournament that fell by him, Joe Schick was doing a feature for Games Magazine.

[01:44:25] And the feature was going to be that he was beating the best player in the world, which a lot of people talked about, was.

[01:44:33] And we set up a meeting in New York with the Broadway arcade, Sunday morning to play football, with Guy coming in with his entourage, and he'd be besting it there.

[01:44:44] Another very dear friend of ours, who was actually instrumental in getting pop off the ground, was a fellow band-in, Lionel Martinez, who was a filmmaker.

[01:44:53] I mean, there was a very diverse group of people who used to frequent the Broadway arcade.

[01:44:58] Our one kind of bond was the Lumberton Ball.

[01:45:02] So anyway, Joe Schick comes in, it is entourage.

[01:45:05] The way I had done it was, you know, they wanted because this, and I think Steve might have had 70 or 80 machines by that time,

[01:45:13] and was the corner store 50 seconds in Broadway.

[01:45:19] I said, alright, this is how we'll do it.

[01:45:22] We'll put the names in a hat of all the manufacturers represented.

[01:45:27] Valley, Plagnatic, Williams, all of them, and we'll just pick the name out of the hat, and then we can pick any game from that manufacturer, and we'll play, you know, a 3 out of 5 series, I think it was, on each of those manufacturers games.

[01:45:44] So, I don't know what you're going to pick, you know, it's like all of these games.

[01:45:49] You know, my proficient on all of these games, my god, how could that possibly be?

[01:45:55] And we started in the first game, I mean, yes, this rooting section or whatever else, and you just destroyed me.

[01:46:04] And I remember Steve and Lionel taking me outside, it's like, what the heck is going on? I mean, that was just terrible.

[01:46:11] I don't like this. It's terrible. Just go in and just beat us ass.

[01:46:17] You're so much better than that. And I went in and I think it took about 5 or 6 hours for us to finally finish, and I absolutely destroyed it.

[01:46:27] And he was crestfallen. It was like, I don't know what I'm going to do now with the story.

[01:46:31] We became, it's still our incredible friends.

[01:46:35] What I call him, I said, if you just wanted to write the story, I would have let you write the story.

[01:46:40] You could tell if everybody didn't just trash me, and it really doesn't matter to me.

[01:46:44] But when you come in and you make it this thing, I mean, this competition, I said, that was the most grueling, unsatisfying, you know,

[01:46:53] gay that I've ever spent playing Pymball, because I was out to destroy Pymball.

[01:47:00] You know, it's that question of winning or losing. It's just doing better than I can do.

[01:47:05] Meach and every time. That's what I try to achieve, and to try to make some good funky shots that don't exist, because the angles are wrong, but somehow I can pull it out my butt, and I can do,

[01:47:16] and I have to say, and go off of a reverse to make a shot, somehow geometrically shouldn't be made.

[01:47:21] I mean, that's the kind of stuff that I enjoyed doing, Max and Joe Warner, was his piece.

[01:47:27] But again, the outgrowth after the tournament was going back to New York, and I used to hang out a lot of the arcade and play with Steve, and it used to be more or less a pissing contest as to who was better.

[01:47:39] And, you know, we never kind of took it overly seriously. And it was like, you know what?

[01:47:45] It would be great to come up with some kind of a story, scoring a system like a handicap, like a bowling or something.

[01:47:52] Instead of dealing in raw points, because each game is different, you get 10 points for first, five points for second, zero points for third, front man.

[01:48:02] Steve and I started talking a real lot about, you know, one to be great to do leagues, and we kind of coined together the pop of thing.

[01:48:11] We need an acronym. We need something.

[01:48:13] It has to be pinball. It has to be perfect. We want this to become professional, like bowling.

[01:48:19] This is going to be on Saturday afternoons, and without Chris Shinkle, doing the play by play, it's going to be somebody else, and we are going to have this happen.

[01:48:28] This is going to work. We are going to have this infallible scoring system, this ERA, this handicap, whatever you want to call it, that people will be able to transpose and equalize out different people, different skill levels.

[01:48:42] Steve started the first leagues in New York. I want to say probably around 79, 1980, 80, 80, 81, with the first leagues in those groups.

[01:48:57] We wound up going off-site to Pennsylvania of Ron Kaluchi in Pinebrook, New Jersey, Ghana, and the Oregon, this stuff, this is great.

[01:49:07] We said not totally mind, boggle, at this stage of my life, hold these things out. Maybe if we could disinterview next week, I probably would have lost it all in.

[01:49:17] We need to have some type of special medication. Anyway, we wound up going out to Ron Kaluchi's place, and a great arcade in Pinebrook, New Jersey to see you.

[01:49:27] We know that we have New York people, because the Broadway arcade was something of a famous place, and we were pulling from the three-state area, if you will, with people coming in as regular.

[01:49:39] So doing the leagues a couple of nights a week, Steve had done it in such a way where he had women's leagues, he had men's leagues, or it's mixed leagues, it was awesome.

[01:49:50] So we wound up going to Ron Kee's to see, could we do it people that are just kind of like somewhat regular players, will they make the commitment?

[01:49:57] More importantly, they make the commitment for 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we actually stayed to the leagues there, they understood the scoring, they were able to do it themselves, and that gave him to us to the first pop of tournament.

[01:50:11] It could never get the type of traction that it deserved, and Steve poured his heart and soul into it, and did I.

[01:50:20] The Las Vegas event where we're outside of New York really didn't pan out the way that we wanted it to.

[01:50:28] And it kind of went through them for a while until Kevin Martin started pin-bird, and then pin-bird suddenly became papa, when Steve said, here I'm not doing anything with it anymore.

[01:50:42] But we're all pinball player rankings, and the wopper points is people affectionately now call it, whether you're competing in tournaments to gain wopper points, or that you can raise yourself on the chart of best players in the world, it's kind of like the NASCAR ratings or the golf ratings.

[01:51:02] And the plan now is that we're not only endorsing various events, we're providing assistance and time or other ones, because there is an area of expertise that none of the Joshua has, but most definitely Steve and myself do.

[01:51:19] Roger, we're coming up on two hours, I think we better let you go.

[01:51:25] I really, really appreciate the time he spent with us. You had some great stories. I mean all of it was really, really good.

[01:51:37] I really appreciate you coming on.

[01:51:40] Well thanks to Ashley, just on a picture of Steve and myself, so maybe there's a good ending in the two of us smiling.

[01:51:46] Okay, well again, we're speaking with Roger Sharp, who worked all the way from game plan to Williams, to licensing to God, everything to Papa.

[01:51:58] Man, you've pretty much done it all.

[01:52:02] And one of the best pinball players in the world too.

[01:52:05] No, at one time, yeah.

[01:52:07] Now, now it's kind of like Arnold Palmer, Willie, who wants to do the ceremony, he'll key off for the Masters.

[01:52:14] Right, I kind of know my place in the world, just the most farthest home Joyce playing.

[01:52:19] All right, well thank you again, Roger, you take care.

[01:52:21] Thank you guys.

[01:52:22] All right, take care.

[01:52:23] Bye-bye.

[01:52:25] That's all for tonight on Topcast.
