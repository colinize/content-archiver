[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.Marvin3M.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:18] Tonight on Topcast we've got a William Soundman.

[00:21] Somebody that did the sound on many of William's games from 1986 up to about 1995.

[00:28] Then he moved over to Capcom and was head of the Sound Department at Capcom Pinball.

[00:33] Then he went to incredible technologies, worked there, and finally ended up working at Stern Pinball,

[00:38] doing a lot of their machines including Simpsons, Pinball Party, Terminator 3, Lord of the Rings,

[00:44] and many of their other pinball games.

[00:53] Alright, I'd like to welcome Chris Granger to Topcast tonight.

[00:57] Again, Chris worked at Williams from 1986 up to about 1995.

[01:01] He did a lot of their popular games including Pinball, F14 Tomcat, Fire, Cyclone, Taxi, Urshaker,

[01:09] Elvira and the Party Monsters, Fun House, Terminator 2, The Adams Family, Fish Tales,

[01:15] Whitewater, Twilight Zone, Indiana Jones, Red and Ted Roadshow.

[01:19] You can see he just keeps going on and on, the number of incredible Williams pinball games

[01:24] that he did the sound on.

[01:26] So we're going to give Chris a call right now and see how he developed the sound on these incredible

[01:29] pinball games.

[01:41] Hi, Clay, how are you?

[01:43] Hey, Chris, do you got a sec?

[01:45] Yep.

[01:46] So what is your first relationship with pinball?

[01:48] I mean, were you a pinball player or anything or were you a musician and then you became a

[01:53] pinball player?

[01:55] I played pinball in late in high school and then extensively early in college.

[02:02] I went away to college in 1976 at the University of Illinois in Urbana and just living in the

[02:08] dorm that I lived in.

[02:09] I played a ton of pinball the first couple of years that I was in college.

[02:13] I played a lot of pinball and they were games where the games from Gottlieb in the early

[02:22] mid-70s like Abercadabra and surf champ.

[02:25] Those were my two favorites.

[02:29] That was my first real kind of an intimate experience with pinball and Captain Stamphastic

[02:35] was from that time frame.

[02:37] I think BDO was from that time frame.

[02:40] The game was in the game room with my dorm and that's where I mostly played.

[02:46] This was really the four video games all together.

[02:48] It was 1976, 1977, 1978.

[02:52] I played a lot then in 1979.

[02:54] I really got serious about space invaders.

[02:56] I dropped 500 dollars on a space invaders game and just at the point where I was routinely

[03:03] bumping up my own high score on that particular machine,

[03:07] asteroids came out and I just sort of like detected a pattern and I stopped playing games.

[03:11] I just said, you know what I'm not doing this.

[03:13] I'm not blowing all this money.

[03:16] So at that point, that was 1979.

[03:18] I basically stopped playing games all together.

[03:20] And then in the meantime, I was studying music and studying composition at the university.

[03:26] And the University of Illinois is a big computer music and electronic music

[03:31] about kind of a place.

[03:33] And so I was working in that community and doing that kind of work.

[03:38] And really not by any kind of design at all, I wasn't thinking this way in any way.

[03:45] But it turns out that the kind of really very open-ended and kind of a on-guard composition

[03:52] that was being taught and promoted in Urbana at that time was just the kind of work that was

[03:59] just perfect for electronic types bleep.

[04:05] Taking bleeps and bloops to the next level.

[04:09] So that's essentially what I was doing.

[04:11] And I actually had a demo reel that I had from,

[04:17] that was sort of a kooky little kind of a throwaway composition that I had written.

[04:24] That when I reestablished contact with the games community in 84,

[04:30] thinking of moving to Chicago and looking for a gig and hooking up with the Northwestern

[04:35] Computer Music People, I ended up applying actually at Myelstar, which was what Gottlieb had become.

[04:44] That Dave Zabriski, who was working there at the time, and applied for a job there.

[04:50] And that little goofy composition was my demo reel.

[04:53] And they freaked and they just went, oh my god, this is perfect.

[04:55] This is exactly what we want.

[04:57] When can you start?

[04:58] So I had a job offer from them.

[05:00] And before I was able to actually execute that job offer, Myelstar put on a hiring freeze,

[05:07] and they had to withdraw the offer.

[05:09] So I was working as a programmer at that time in Champaign, Urbana, and that was working out okay.

[05:16] But I, you know, there was a pretty strong personal reasons that we had to want to move back to Chicago anyway,

[05:22] by family at that time.

[05:23] So we were looking and we were looking up here and why I was in the midst of looking for a new job up here.

[05:30] Myelstar listed their freeze and said, you know, we had, basically we had somebody,

[05:35] we lost a person under the terms of the freeze, we can replace that person.

[05:39] So if you'd like your job, the job that we offered you, it's still available to you.

[05:43] And I decided not to take it at the time, which turned out to be a 342 at this move,

[05:48] because six months later they shut that factory down.

[05:52] So that was probably a pretty smart move.

[05:54] And I worked as a computer consultant up here from 84 to 86 before I had the opportunity

[05:59] to come along at Williams.

[06:01] And so it was in mid-86, March, April of 86, that I actually moved over to Williams

[06:07] and started working with the original, you know, the first game that went out of the Williams shop

[06:14] with Yamaha, synthesizer hardware was my first game, it was Road King.

[06:19] So that was where that started.

[06:21] And I was working with another guy there by the name of Bill Parade,

[06:26] who is still a, you know, a neighbor and acquaintance in Evanston.

[06:31] And there's a fabulous programmer and a very interesting guy with regard to sound.

[06:37] He wrote most of the software and I ended up writing most of the music.

[06:42] And both of us designed a lot of sounds and kind of worked on putting the packages together

[06:47] ourselves, you know, collaboratively for the first few games.

[06:52] He ended up leaving about a year and a half after that.

[06:55] And at that point, you know, the system software was pretty much written in place.

[07:00] And we just kind of did maintenance work on that software really until,

[07:07] well, I'm going to say, 91, 92 before the original DCS ideas started to really emerge.

[07:16] So when you were doing the sound, you mentioned the Yamaha sound chip.

[07:20] I mean, how did they choose this chip and how do you write for a particular chip?

[07:25] Well, to be honest, I didn't choose it.

[07:27] It was hardware that was chosen really at that time.

[07:32] It was a chip that produced a certain number of synthetic tones all at the same time

[07:39] and could be treated as a synthesizer that was sufficiently programmable

[07:44] so that you could say, I want one, you know, I could make eight noises at a time,

[07:49] basically, with the hardware that chip had that capabilities.

[07:55] So one of those voices or instruments turned out to be a phase and one turned out to be

[08:00] a kind of a guitar sound and I'd use a couple to do a piano sound.

[08:04] And basically, we build a small little rock band or something like that out of what this chip

[08:10] was capable of doing, right? And a bill for odd with my help developed a,

[08:18] a music writing operating system that allowed us to write music scripts

[08:26] and sound effects scripts in a sort of a macro assembly language.

[08:34] And that's essentially what we did.

[08:35] It wasn't a MIDI system or anything like that.

[08:37] It was basically writing a macro assembler,

[08:42] directives to play a note and then to stop playing and to play another one

[08:46] and to play a different pitch for a different duration and having to coordinate

[08:52] eight of those things running at the same time and if they got out of sync,

[08:54] you'd hear it right away and you'd have to go and fix your scripts.

[08:57] That was that kind of thing.

[08:58] We were basically writing writing music in a text editor in a sample language,

[09:02] is essentially what we were doing.

[09:03] So there was no keyboard hooked up to any hardware whatsoever.

[09:07] Everything was just...

[09:08] Not really. I mean, I had a keyboard in my office that I could use to demo stuff,

[09:12] but it would be noodling around.

[09:14] I actually wrote on manuscript paper and frankly, to this day,

[09:18] I continued to write on manuscript paper.

[09:22] It's the traditional way to do it and oftentimes it's the easiest and the most effective way

[09:29] to get your idea down so that you remember what it is.

[09:33] You'd write the music on manuscript paper,

[09:36] but then essentially what you do is then have to transform this

[09:40] from the notes on the manuscript paper to actually writing it in a program.

[09:46] That's right. I have to type it in, note by note. That's exactly right.

[09:50] And like a particular...

[09:52] What determined a note in this macro assembler? How did you do that?

[09:56] There was a syntax of the language that we would use,

[10:01] the syntax of the macro language would be, you'd say,

[10:05] notes, and then you'd say a pitch, an indicator pitch in some way,

[10:09] C4 or something like that.

[10:11] And then you'd comma, and then you'd say a duration.

[10:13] And that would be a note.

[10:17] The next line would be the next note,

[10:20] or would be a rest, or would be some other kind of directive,

[10:23] like a slur or a volume change,

[10:28] or a voice or patch change.

[10:30] All those things had their own syntax.

[10:34] Similar, in concept to MIDI,

[10:37] because there's a note directive in MIDI just like we were using.

[10:42] The syntax we were using was proprietary.

[10:49] We made a home-brew version of that process.

[10:57] That's pretty much how we did it.

[10:59] I got pretty good at basically touch-composing,

[11:04] how you touch type, if you're looking at something and you're typing it in.

[11:08] I'd be looking at the manuscript page and typing those directives.

[11:13] I got pretty fast to typing them out.

[11:17] It's a text editing stuff.

[11:18] You're cutting in paste and then using whatever tricks you can to do it as quickly as possible.

[11:23] Basically, you're sitting there typing notes in.

[11:26] We're control structures that allow us to do loops.

[11:29] We had variables that we could change.

[11:31] We could do some basic sort of simple programming tricks

[11:35] to cause different things to happen programmatically.

[11:38] Those things ended up being the main tool in our sound effects toolbox.

[11:46] We would do these elaborate things where we'd have just dozens and hundreds of notes

[11:53] that would fire off in the space of a second or two in a very complicated pattern

[11:58] that would kind of evolve.

[12:00] We got pretty good at shaping those things to produce those very graceful sound effects that we made

[12:08] through the games from 86 to 93.

[12:12] Was the duration of that system.

[12:17] We got quite a bit of mileage as you may remember.

[12:20] Got quite a bit of mileage out of that Yamaha chip.

[12:24] That Yamaha chip existed from 1986 with the road kings.

[12:27] You're saying all the way up to like Twilight Zone.

[12:30] Twilight Zone was the last one that I did.

[12:32] You're right.

[12:32] Yeah, why water was the year before I paused?

[12:35] Yeah, because Indiana Jones was the first game to use the DCS sound system.

[12:42] And then you're saying everything changed with that?

[12:44] Well, yeah, that was a completely new hardware base and the method of making sound

[12:49] and making music really evolved into the way that sound and music is made today.

[12:58] Instead of having eight synthetic voices that you had to combine into a piece of music

[13:03] and transcribe having the synthesizer actually perform the music.

[13:09] With DCS, you can take music or sounds from any source at all, whether it's a licensed

[13:14] arosmeth tune or something that I composed in my own studio and recorded and then take that

[13:22] recording and place it on one of however many available tracks there are within the system.

[13:28] And the DCS system would play that system back like a multi-channel tape deck.

[13:33] Basically, a multi-channel interactive playback device.

[13:39] So this Yamaha chip basically lasted like seven or eight years.

[13:42] Isn't that like a long time for a sound platform to be used in like this environment?

[13:48] That's certainly what we thought. Yes, we thought we should have upgraded much sooner than

[13:53] in fact, but it was what it was. It was a system that they had sunk.

[13:59] One of the things about Pinball that doesn't have very many parallels in the computer game world is

[14:06] that it does have a kind of an odd parallel.

[14:10] But the statement is simply that hardware costs a lot of money to develop.

[14:17] Hardware manufacturers, especially ones that were manufacturing essentially an item by hand.

[14:24] Okay? Pinball is largely assembled by hand and that's still true today.

[14:29] People who have that kind of mentality about hardware, their big expense is design costs.

[14:38] And so designing a new circuit board, that's an expensive proposition.

[14:44] And they basically want to use a piece of hardware for as long as they can to get the mileage out of it.

[14:48] So that was, there were various iterative upgrades and versions and things like that.

[14:53] But the basic design really just underwent very minor modifications from 86 to 93.

[15:01] Well, let's take two extremes. Let's take Pinbot, for example, in Adams family.

[15:06] So you got Pinbot came out in 86 and you got Adams family that came out in 92.

[15:10] And they both use the same Yamaha synthesizer chip.

[15:15] But they sound dramatically different. I mean, when people will say,

[15:20] I'm not a big fan of system 11 games and people will say why?

[15:23] And I'm like, man, because it sounds like a system 11 game.

[15:26] But when WPC came around, it's like the sound seemed so much more involved,

[15:31] but you're saying that it really wasn't.

[15:34] The WPC really wasn't incremental change.

[15:36] The biggest change that happened with WPC is that the amount of RAM,

[15:42] okay? They're not a memory that we had on board,

[15:45] increased by a pretty significant way.

[15:48] And that allowed us to start bringing more elements of live sound and recorded sound

[15:55] into the soundtracks.

[15:58] So technologically, the capability was there back in Rook King's days or Pinbot days.

[16:03] But what was actually delivered was, I think we had one 256K RAM chip available on the Pinbot

[16:14] Rook King system. And I guess there were two.

[16:21] Not bloody much memory for compressed speech or actual recorded sound effects.

[16:32] So all of the sound effects for those games were synthesized.

[16:37] System 11 sounds, those algorithmic sounds, the gyros and all those fabulous

[16:45] cutlaric and a whole bunch of guys back in the late 70s and early 80s had developed all these

[16:51] algorithms for the system 11 system. For a guy like me, an avant-garde composer,

[16:56] I just thought those things were awesome and totally cool.

[16:59] And still to this day, those algorithms are wild and willy.

[17:03] They produce very kind of the expressive ranges is still pretty limited.

[17:09] And that's what you were just expressing there.

[17:15] So you're saying, largely, it was a difference in how much RAM you had to work with.

[17:19] That's really what an amount of two. By the time we got to WPC, the System 11 system,

[17:25] and a lot of those really graceful and elegant, but very limited,

[17:29] tall electronic sounds, those things went away.

[17:32] I thought, when you said Pinbot, I kind of had to smile a little bit because I think the

[17:36] Pinbot represented the absolute pinnacle of the marriage between the Yamaha system

[17:44] and the System 11 system. The System 11 system, remember that, that goes back to what space

[17:50] shuttle or something like that. I can't remember.

[17:53] High speed, actually, high speed was the game before road kings. High speed was the first system 11.

[18:00] They already added. High speed was the first game that attached a separate piece of hardware

[18:07] to the System 11 sound system. The System 11 pinball system was a 6800, a motorway of 6800,

[18:14] CPU, and another 6800, making sound. The 1,600 ran all the game logic and then the second one

[18:23] ran the sound system. It could only make one sound at a time. When you go back and listen to

[18:28] a space shuttle or a sorcerer of those games from like 82, 83, those games, both of those things

[18:37] had a kind of a space shuttle. I'll see if I can imitate space shuttle for you.

[18:43] I can only do this with my right hand, but this is what space shuttle sounded like all the time

[18:47] in the background. It would go, and it was just a loop like that. It just ran the whole time.

[18:56] And then whenever you would hit a target, there would be a target sound.

[19:00] Whenever you, you know, one of the 15 speed calls or whatever, that would go out.

[19:06] That would stop it. Or when one of those other goofy sort of algorithm, if you hit a ramp,

[19:10] it would go up a ramp and go, you know, or some kind of goofy thing like that. Whatever kind of

[19:15] thing it did, all those things were happening what we call monophonically, you know, one sound at

[19:20] a time and that background, you know, drone would get supplanted, right? And then when the four

[19:27] rounds sound was done, that that background would be restored and would keep running. So it was

[19:31] always sound being made, but just one sound at a time, okay? So high-speed innovation was

[19:37] introducing a second piece of hardware that played music. And, you know, during single ball

[19:45] play and high speed, you have this drum track that was playing. And that would be all that would

[19:49] be going on. And then when you hit multiple, you got the big, you know, you got the big

[19:53] door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, you know, that wonderful rock and

[19:57] thing. And that was a single guitar track and a single drum, like a one-handed drummer and

[20:03] a single guitar note at a time. And that was what that whole, you know, that was high speed.

[20:09] That was the music for high speed. That was the first music in Pongongan. That was the first

[20:13] actual music. The Yamaha board that I described, the thing that they put into road kings,

[20:20] that was the first game after high speed to have that second board. And it was the first game,

[20:28] you know, basically the Yamaha system replaced that, you know, that outboard little guitar and

[20:33] drum synthesizer or playback unit that they, it was basically like a two-voice sample. Once one

[20:38] voice was used for drums and one was used for a guitar sample. And they, you know, it was,

[20:44] in fact, it was Bill Parade who, it was Steve Richie, the designer who wrote the song and wrote

[20:48] it on a guitar. But it was Bill Parade who, you know, who programmed that system and executed the,

[20:54] you know, executed the script that played those notes. And like I said, they only used it for

[21:01] that one game. That was the only game that ever used that board. The Yamaha board came along and

[21:06] supplied it with road kings and, you know, kind of went from there. Now, how hard was it to,

[21:12] I'm sorry, how hard was it to implement speech? It was speech like overlaid on top of the music

[21:19] because it was a separate, you know, you have the separate soundboard, but you had it on the system

[21:23] 11. You also had sound right on the CPU board too or speech, I should say, right on the CPU board.

[21:30] Exactly, exactly correct. The system 11 system implemented a very ancient, it was like literally

[21:35] 1948 compression technology made by a company called Harris. The algorithm, it was like an old,

[21:42] you know, military codec that they used. And that Harris hardware was the ancillary process on

[21:57] the, on the system 11 board. So it was still the case that you had to feed that hardware bit by bit.

[22:04] And, you know, the little 6800 that was designed, you know, that was tasked to play sound,

[22:10] was unable to do that and do any other sound at the same time. So that 6800 was out there feeding

[22:15] this little Harris chip making the speech, you know, digging stuff off a ramp and feeding it

[22:23] to the Harris for decoding and how it would come from the speaker. But that was part of the

[22:27] monophonic system 11 sound system. So when both with high speed and with road kings pinbot era,

[22:36] stuff, the system 11 board was responsible both for the system 11 sounds and then also the

[22:44] speech was coming from that board too. The big innovation with WPC, I mean, you know, it's not

[22:49] really much of an innovation, but they just combined the sound functions all onto one piece of hardware.

[22:55] Okay, so the, you know, and all they did was they took the, you know, that Harris

[23:00] circuitry from the system 11 board and plopped it down onto the Yamaha sound board and and and

[23:09] tasked the the 1609 chip that was used on the Yamaha board with, you know, with driving that CVSD

[23:17] part as well, that Harris part, you know, that was WPC's big, you know, sort of, if you want to call

[23:22] innovation, that was where that came along. There were a couple of sort of interim steps towards

[23:27] that process in the games, which were the ones that were the Joker's era and the,

[23:37] right, Joker's had a stereo game, the first stereo game by Williams.

[23:42] Well, I, it wasn't really stereo. They were, you know, they were separate, you know, it wasn't

[23:47] stereo at all. It was true channel mono is what it was. You know, they, you know, joke Dylan called

[23:52] it stereo. They got a little extra marketing push out of it, but it wasn't stereo at all.

[23:58] But, you know, so those games were sort of the, those are the kind of interim games.

[24:04] It was Fun House actually that was the first game that used the, you know, to use the real WPC

[24:11] hardware that was, you know, the big step up and ram and that was really, you know, at that

[24:17] point, you know, when you're talking Fun House Terminator 2,

[24:22] Adams, they'll certainly Adams, but I was going to, you know, include, you know, the other games

[24:26] that were made then. Yeah, Fish Tales. Bright of, Bright of Pindot was, you know, was a fabulous

[24:32] example. And, you know, there's a couple of other, there was a mouse mouse and a round,

[24:38] there was another one. All those games, including, of course, you know, you know, from, from

[24:42] my book, you know, Adams and then Fish Tales. That's my, that's, that's, you know,

[24:47] been my favorite for a long time. And, and then Whitewater. You know, those were the games that,

[24:52] that, you know, that really made WPC shine. I don't, you notice that I don't include Twilight

[24:57] in that list. Not the Twilight wasn't a very cool, sound-a-game, but you got to understand

[25:02] that Twilight was intended to be the first DCF game. And we have developed, you know, like 98%

[25:08] of the entire package for the DCF system. So all of that music that you heard had been composed

[25:14] for a much higher fidelity synthesizer system. Basically, I wrote all that stuff in my studio

[25:19] with real guitars and real synthesizers and, you know, with a real recording technology. And,

[25:24] and, you know, digitized all of it and it was being played back in a much, much, you know, I mean,

[25:28] DCF is a big step forward, right? In terms of, of, of sound fidelity. And, and, you know, that whole

[25:35] soundtrack exists in a, you know, in a, in a completely other form, right? But then it turns out

[25:40] that the hardware wasn't ready. The DCF's hardware wasn't ready. And they had to totally pull back

[25:44] and they said, you know, what we need you to go back and re-engineer this system. You know, re-engineer

[25:49] this soundtrack for the WPC system. So then you had to go back and, and, and, and, we spent about

[25:56] three weeks of, you know, just doing nothing but recoding all that music and all those sound effects

[26:02] for, or the WPC system. They, the one concession that we had was that we, um, was that they dramatically

[26:10] increased the amount of RAM on the, on the soundboard for, for, for Twilight Zone. And they allowed

[26:16] us to digitize, you know, a lot of the sound effects that we were intending to use. We were able to,

[26:21] to, to just drop in as samples and, and, you know, pretty much playing back as they were. But the music

[26:26] was all, you know, was a, the music was just, you know, I, I will never be able to listen to Twilight

[26:32] Zone and, and, and not remember what those two were supposed to sound like and really what

[26:36] it amounts to. So that's, that's just a, you know, I've had people tell me that, that, that's, that's,

[26:42] that's, you know, their favorite of my work is that, is that game. And, and, you know, I mean,

[26:46] it's good music and stuff. Uh, but I just will never be able to, you know, that's, that's my own,

[26:51] you know, sort of, you know, personal history that I'm baggots that I'm carrying around, you know,

[26:55] what I'm saying. Did you save the DCS version of Twilight Zone and ever like after the fact,

[27:01] plug it into an Indiana Jones or later DCS sound card and, and plug it into Twilight Zone,

[27:06] just to see how it all worked out, implemented into the game. There, there really was no way to do

[27:11] that. I mean, you know, there were, there were, yeah, I guess there were prototypes, you know,

[27:15] that the original whiteboard cabinet or something that Larry DeMar, that lived in Larry DeMar's office,

[27:20] you know, you might have been able to do that with, with, with that cabinet. But, um, you know,

[27:24] by and large, there was no, there was no real way to do that. Um, so, uh, so, so you didn't save the

[27:30] code. You know, it's just that, you know, I mean, that stuff's on tape, you know, I've got that

[27:34] stuff on tape somewhere, you know, it's all, it's all around, uh, you know, some buried in

[27:39] buried in some, you know, box of data, so whatever. But, um, uh, yeah, so that, that was, that was

[27:45] Twilight Zone. But so I don't, I don't necessarily include that in that, in that list, but, you know,

[27:49] rightfully, I guess it would be there. And, and, uh, you know, all those, all those games, you know,

[27:54] um, you know, uh, for me, I guess that period of time was certainly my most

[28:00] productive and, and, you know, the place where I probably did the best work that I, you know,

[28:05] that I did in the industry, I would say it's safe to say that, you know, um, the curve was,

[28:09] was just at the right place and, um, you know, everything was really, you know, it was really

[28:14] right to, to do really good work in that, in that regard, it was, you know, um, you, you,

[28:19] you probably remember that, that right about the time that, that DCS came out and, you know,

[28:23] we had a couple, a couple of games in the DCS world that still, you know, that still sold really

[28:28] well, but that was the beginning of the end of the, of the, of the pinball peak, you know, and,

[28:34] uh, uh, you know, Adam Stanley was a 22,000, you know, game run and, uh, fish tail sold something

[28:42] like 14.5 and Terminator sold 16.5 and, and how, uh, um, you know, Twilight Zone was at 16,

[28:49] you know, and a half or something like that. Um, but the, the, uh, you know, after that,

[28:55] the curb dropped off, you know, I get away, fell off the pace a little bit and, uh,

[28:59] start right next generation and started to fall off the pace and after that, you know, we just

[29:02] never, you know, those, those huge numbers of manufactured games just started to drop and, um,

[29:09] uh, you know, things started to really tighten up in the development, uh, department, the engineering

[29:13] department really started to, to, to struggle then and, um, uh, and, and, and, you know, frankly,

[29:20] that was, that was kind of the beginning of the end for me, you know, back in like 94, you know,

[29:25] end of, end of, you know, mid, early mid 94 and in the 95 and I ended up leaving, leaving

[29:30] Williams, you know, as part of the kind of, you know, feeling like a kind of a,

[29:33] gets you to almost call it like a crisis of faith or something like that in, in terms of,

[29:38] of, you know, what we were doing artistically and, uh, um, you know, and frankly, economically as

[29:43] well, you know, we had, had this great run and, you know, we'd all made a lot of money and, uh,

[29:48] all of a sudden we weren't making money like that anymore and, and a lot of the, the,

[29:51] the ways that thing were going, um, you know, weren't being supported by the economics anymore and,

[29:56] and, you know, started to be a real struggle. Um, and my, I ultimately kind of, you know, I,

[30:02] I thought, well, gee, I need to do something transformative here and have the opportunity

[30:06] with Capcom and, and decided to, to make a jump, you know, to be honest, they were, they offered me a

[30:10] lot of money to go and, and I took the money. Um, you know, I, I, I, I can't say it was a mistake to

[30:15] do that, uh, because the people that I met at Capcom, you know, continue, you know, they're,

[30:21] they're people that I met there that continue to be some of my best friends and colleagues and,

[30:25] and, uh, you know, I'm, I'm not at all sorry exactly that I, that I did that. Although, you know,

[30:29] there were a lot of problems over there, but, um, you know, that was the decision that I made at the

[30:33] time and, you know, I, I, I can't, you know, I have, I had pretty good reasons for doing it at the

[30:37] time I, I, I can't say I wouldn't make the same decision, you know, decision again.

[30:41] Did you have a hand in all the machines or just, all the Capcom machines are just pinball magic?

[30:46] Well, I was running the, I, I ran the Sound Department there. So I was, you know, I, I had management

[30:51] duties as well as, as, as, you know, sound creation duties. Um, the games that I kind of, you

[30:57] know, more single hand, you know, I, pinball magic was, was, was mostly done when I got there. Um, I,

[31:03] the kinds of things that I did that had to do with choreography and adding a few, you know, big

[31:08] sound effects and things like that for the sound system. But really that was, you know, that was,

[31:12] that was 90 percent Jeff, 90, maybe 95 percent Jeff Powell's work on the pinball magic. And, um,

[31:19] you know, we, we added the speech stuff I had a fair amount to do with that. And, uh, like I say,

[31:23] a number of sound effects that I added, but, um, you know, Jeff, that, that, that really was, was Jeff's,

[31:29] Jeff's package as much as anybody. Um, and, and how was Capcom's hardware compared to Williams,

[31:36] W's, you know, uh, digitally compressed sound system? Oh, that, uh, that, um, Capcom's,

[31:45] Capcom, the, the basic, the Capcom sound hardware was a two-voice, uh, uh, recording and playback

[31:52] device, right? So I had a fair amount of RAM, um, you know, maybe a comparable amount of RAM

[31:57] to DCS at that time. DCS at that point had become a four or five channel system. So we were able

[32:03] to just make more sounds at once. Uh, the fact that in Capcom land, we went down to two,

[32:08] you know, dramatically changed the, the, the, the density of the sound that came out of the game.

[32:14] But at the same time, it also made the whole thing kind of work in a more consistent and, uh,

[32:19] um, you know, there was a kind of a clarity about those, about those games that, um, you know,

[32:24] there's a certain that, you know, that, that was pretty attractive. Also, the, uh, the actual, um, um,

[32:29] uh, uh, encoding and decoding of sound, the compression itself was a much less, um, you know,

[32:36] what they call lossy compression system. It was, it was basically, it was, it was an impact, uh,

[32:41] system was, uh, uh, it was the original impact, uh, audio, codec. And, um, I forgot,

[32:48] I think it was a Toshiba part that we used to implement it. It was pretty expensive. It was $10

[32:53] at Chip and each chip would only make sound one, you know, like I say, one, one sound at a time.

[32:58] But it was, it was reasonably, you know, reasonably intelligible and reasonably queer, much more so,

[33:04] in my opinion, than the DCS system, the early DCS stuff, we really pushed the envelope on how,

[33:09] you know, I'm just on, um, uh, you know, we allowed ourselves to get very lossy with the sound.

[33:16] And those first few games, you know, have a kind of a brittle quality to it. And if you listen

[33:20] carefully, you know, you can really hear at the ends of sounds, you know, you can hear the little

[33:24] wobbly and then the workly things that go on that, you know, that indicate that it's being compressed

[33:29] or, you know, um, re, you know, decoded. Are you saying that, that the DCS stuff was largely

[33:36] over compressed? Is that what you mean? Yeah, because we're trying to get as much, we're trying

[33:40] to get as many, you know, we basically work with them. And this is always true, you know, or

[33:45] that have been true for many years. You know, you're, you're, you're trading off sound quality

[33:50] for sound quantity. And, you know, when the designer says, oh, we need a sound there, you know,

[33:54] what do you say? Well, I guess, you know, we'll try and find something to go in there. And,

[33:58] and with DCS, it started to be, well, you know, we've got, we've got this much memory and, and,

[34:03] you know, our aggregate, uh, you know, uh, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, you know, a number of

[34:07] bytes per sound that we, that we have or the number of bytes per second of material is this. So,

[34:13] you know, what do you want me to take out here? And they said, well, I don't want you to take anything

[34:16] out. Just, just get more, you know, more seconds per, per byte or whatever, right? And, and that,

[34:22] that's, that's the quality knob. And, and so we ended up in many cases, we ended up turning that

[34:26] knob down pretty far just to get something in every slot, you know. And, you know, it was really at

[34:32] that point that we started to say, wow, we, you know, uh, this is, this is how we trade, and this is

[34:37] how we do these trade offs. And, um, you know, eventually, you know, when RAM got cheap and we were

[34:42] able to put more RAM into the games, uh, you know, that started to become less of an issue, but,

[34:47] you know, I mean, that continues to be a problem for, you know, for play stations and, and Xboxes

[34:52] and everything else that, that, that, that, you know, dedicated piece of hardware like that.

[34:55] Feudersystems and pulling stuff off of hard drives and stuff like that, that, that stops being

[34:59] so much from a problem. And, and most of your games, you know, your Xbox three games, your,

[35:03] your Xbox 360 games and your PS3 games, those, those things are, are cramming massive quantities of,

[35:09] of sound in the games and the, you know, the, the, the sizes of projects are, have just, you know,

[35:15] exploded, not just obviously for, you know, for, for programmers and artists as well, but, you know,

[35:20] get, every bit as much for sound too, you know, um, but that kind of day, you know, when we were first

[35:25] getting that stuff going at 93, 94, 95, you know, there just wasn't a lot of RAM around, you know, so, uh, we,

[35:31] yeah, we, we cranked a bit right down pretty far and, and I think you can really hear that.

[35:35] The Capcom system didn't have that knob, frankly, it was a little bit rate, single compression

[35:40] solution that, you know, it was just what it was, it wasn't great, but it was, you know, on average,

[35:45] it was pretty good. It was, you know, Jeff Powell used to say that it was about the quality of AM

[35:49] radio in terms of bandwidth and stuff like that. So, you know, and, you know, one of the things that

[35:55] I really want to stress Clay in, in, in, in all of this is that the fidelity of any given system

[36:02] to my mind is, is less important to the quality of the soundtrack, of the overall soundtrack,

[36:09] than the gracefulness of the choreography and the, and the attention to detail that you're able to

[36:15] bring. And, you know, it's my opinion that, that, you know, if you listen to a game for about a minute,

[36:22] you have, have, you know, you've been, you're, your brain has properly been invited into the sound

[36:28] world that that game presents to you. And, if it presents a consistent, you know, face and, and, and,

[36:35] you know, all of those old games do, that turns out to be an adequate, you know, level of information

[36:42] to pass from the game to the, to the listener and to the, to the player. And, and it's a, it's a,

[36:48] it's a compelling experience. It always was a compelling experience. You know, when you, when you,

[36:52] like pull out one of those old, um, name games or something like that and you, you play like, you know,

[36:57] joust or something like that on name, um, you know, you listen to those sounds and you just go,

[37:01] oh my god, this is a disaster. God, listen to that. Oh, it's horrible. It's horrible. The 30 seconds

[37:06] later, you're, you're remembering the game. You're flapping your, you know, your bouncing around.

[37:10] Here comes the tarot act of, you know, those things are, they, and, and, and, and, and, and, and you

[37:15] respond to those things the way that you did when you played that game in 1982. And, and, and you just do,

[37:21] your brain makes those adjustments even today where, you know, we've got five dot once, you know,

[37:25] five dot once surround games going on and fabulous fidelity and incredible attention to detail,

[37:30] you know, as much attention to detail as, as any movie soundtrack gets, you know, are going into

[37:36] games these days. It's, it's, it's phenomenal. It's great. But it doesn't diminish the, the work that

[37:42] was done on those old games, you know, and when you go and play those old games, you know, you're

[37:47] able to, you're, you're just as able today as to have a compelling experience as you were when those

[37:52] games came out. That's, that's, you know, that's, that's my opinion. So now when you say, you're, you're

[37:58] talking about RAM all the time, what you really mean is E-Prom space, the ROM space that, that you

[38:03] can store these sounds in. RAM it is, it was E-Prom, you're absolutely correct. Okay. I, I just want to

[38:08] make that clear that, that, you know, from System 11, you, you had a limited number of E-Proms,

[38:13] and then when you went to WPC, those jumped up, you know, you had larger E-Proms and more of them,

[38:18] and then when you went to DCS digitally, compressed sound, that then the E-Proms got even larger,

[38:23] and there was even more of them. That's exactly correct. That's, that's, you're, you're, you're absolutely

[38:28] right. I just wanted to make it clear for when people, I knew what you were talking about, but I

[38:31] just wanted, because ultimately what's in the E-Proms ends up in RAM. So it's just, you know, I just

[38:36] got to make it clear so people understand. Yeah, the, the people who are going to be concerned on that

[38:41] level, yeah, specifically the hardware, we're, we're, we're E-Proms that we were using, you're

[38:44] absolutely correct. Now how was it working with, you know, at, at Capcom working with, you know,

[38:50] with Python and Mark Richie and, and the designers? Well, you know, all those guys, I, you know,

[38:56] I'd really worked with all those guys before, and, and so I, you know, I knew how they worked, and I

[39:00] knew, I knew kind of what they were, what they were after a little bit. You know, to be honest, the,

[39:07] the, the, the failure at Capcom, you know, was certainly related to the fact that the industry itself

[39:14] was in, was in a decline at that point in their timing was just spectacularly bad. But even, you

[39:18] know, even, even, I, you know, I think that they probably could have survived had they not spent

[39:25] so much money early on in such an elaborate way. And they really did, you know, the way that I've

[39:33] always described is that they threw the party before they built the product. There will never again

[39:38] be a facility as elegant and well equipped to manufacture pinball games as that facility.

[39:45] You know, it was just, it was, it was unbelievably up to date, you know, built by, with Japanese money,

[39:52] by, by people who understood manufacturing in a very, very clear way, you know, all of that stuff

[39:57] was just, you know, absolutely top shelf. But, you know, given the legal problems that they have,

[40:02] they, they, they struggled to, you know, Williams's, you know, lawsuit against them and, and preventing,

[40:09] you know, essentially preventing a lot of the work that, you know, that the, the ex-Williams

[40:14] designers had, had done there early on kind of forced them onto these, onto these tracks that,

[40:20] you know, essentially required them to hold their breath for a couple of years. So all that

[40:24] stuff was going on and that was certainly a legitimate problem. But, you know, by the time you got to,

[40:29] what do you mean by the law? So what law suits was Williams bringing against Capcom?

[40:33] Well, Williams, Williams sued Capcom details of which I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to

[40:41] reconstruct exactly, but Williams sued Capcom for patent infringement on, on a number of different

[40:49] different patents. I'm afraid you're going to have to check in with, with, with Python,

[40:54] or Bill puts them in a, or Mark Richie to, to get those details, but there were, there was

[40:58] extensive litigation that was going on as early as 1993 and extending all the way into 19, you know,

[41:05] the end of 1996. And by the time that had happened, by the time, by the time actually, frankly,

[41:10] by the time I got there in 1995, you know, uh, uh, uh, Tujimoto and the, and the Capcom, uh, you know,

[41:17] corporate people had sunk, you know, tens of millions of dollars into this, into this operation,

[41:22] and they still didn't have a game to show. Now, you know, they were, they weren't, they weren't

[41:26] really practicing any kind of like, you know, they were really in startup mode at that point, and,

[41:31] and they, and, and money, they had plenty of money, Capcom had a lot of money at that point, and,

[41:37] and, um, you know, they paid their bills on time, and they had tremendous relationships with their

[41:42] suppliers. You know, they had, they had, um, you know, parts suppliers in the shop helping the

[41:48] engineers design, design the games and design the components, because, you know, they knew they were

[41:54] going to get paid right on the spot, and that was really happening, you know, I mean, they would

[41:57] pay, they would, they were paying cash. They were paying, you know, they were paying, you know,

[42:00] they were paying right away, they were paying on receipt of it, of invoices. And then all of a

[42:04] sudden, in June or July of 1995, that stopped being the case, when they started to pull back and say,

[42:10] you know, what this is costing us way too much, we've got to reign this spending in, and,

[42:15] uh, one of the ways they did it was to implement a much less lenient policy towards the suppliers,

[42:21] and that support dried up, and suppliers turned from, you know, from collaborators to adversaries,

[42:29] and, um, you know, and, and a lot of bad feelings erupted as a result of, of a very,

[42:34] kind of a parsimonious, in my opinion, parsimonious, uh, cash management strategy. Now,

[42:40] you know, that was, that was the view from the sound department, right? And the details to support

[42:44] that are, are, are all anecdotal, and, um, you know, I, I go way out on a limb, and, you know,

[42:50] somebody from the, from the accounting department of that, of that time would probably be able to come

[42:54] back with, with chapter and verse on how that wasn't true, maybe, but that, that was, that was very

[42:59] much the perception in the shop that, that, you know, all of a sudden our suppliers just were saying,

[43:03] you know, to the engineers, guys, you know, you're not paying our bills, we can't, you know,

[43:07] we can't support you in a way that we can support it. So, that was a big loss, but the, you know,

[43:12] the fact of the matter was that, um, you know, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a,

[43:17] it was a pretty good party that was going on in a capcom, and they were spending a lot of money,

[43:21] and, um, uh, you know, and, and it took them, you know, every bit of three, three, you know,

[43:27] basically three full years to, uh, get the first product, you know, the first pinball product out

[43:33] there, and, you know, they did a lot of, of, of tremendous innovation. There was a, just, you

[43:37] know, there was, there was, you know, pinball magic was a, you know, that was a very strong piece,

[43:42] and, um, uh, unfortunately, it got released really at, uh, you know, at a time where the market

[43:50] had significantly declined, you know, and, and, uh, you know, I, I, you know, did they sell

[43:54] three thousand of those things that they sell, you know, maybe, maybe thirty three hundred three.

[43:58] According to the internet pinball database, they only sold twelve hundred.

[44:03] Okay, I'll, you know, I'll buy that, um, and they probably lost money on every game,

[44:08] because of what they, you know, of how much the, uh, you know, the actual bill of materials ended

[44:13] up in, um, so, you know, it was a, uh, uh, you know, it was a, it was a dicey situation,

[44:19] they had put a lot of money into this very slick hardware, you know, the Soundboard was a great

[44:22] example. They, they, you know, that Soundboard cost them something like a hundred and twenty

[44:26] dollars in parts, and, you know, that's about thirty dollars more expensive than the DCS board was

[44:30] at the time. Um, so, you know, I, I, I, I, make those kinds of decisions, you know, really using

[44:36] Cadillac components and, um, you know, buying solutions that were embedded in Silicon, rather than,

[44:43] you know, finding, finding some cheap ways around those problems, or, or just, you know,

[44:47] having a more modest goal in mind, um, you know, set them back in terms of bill, bill materials,

[44:53] you know, like I said, they were, they, you know, the, the games were too expensive to manufacture,

[44:58] too expensive to buy the parts for, and even with the most, you know, the most sophisticated and

[45:02] modern, you know, manufacturing techniques that were available at the time, uh, they were still,

[45:08] um, you know, they were, they were losing money on those games. So, um, so, you know, it really

[45:13] was a kind of a doomed effort in that regard, and, and, and, and that, um, that realization,

[45:19] you know, really permeated everything that was happening at Capcom, um, had already been

[45:24] permeating it for, you know, for a, for a while when I got there, um, you know, the big push to

[45:29] get that first game out, um, you know, we, we had a lot of euphoria over that game, and we still

[45:34] enjoy that game a lot, um, uh, but, uh, you know, the economic something that were just never really

[45:41] there, and, uh, and eventually, you know, I mean, when the money dries up, then, you know, then

[45:45] you're kind of done, and it took, you know, took another year for us to, to, to realize that it

[45:51] was done, but, you know, we were, it was, it was, it was not a, um, it was not a pretty picture,

[45:56] really, you know, from the beginning, and, and by, you know, mid 1996, everybody was just kind of

[46:01] sitting around going, okay, do we look for another job? Do we wait for a severance package? What do we

[46:05] do here, you know, at, um, you know, you ask me what games I specifically, I, my, my, uh, um,

[46:13] the two things that were completely on my, on my plate to do were airborne, and then, uh, the game that,

[46:20] that, you know, that only, that only the prototypes were ever made, which was Kingpin, those were,

[46:25] those are the two games that I, you know, that I was responsible for the soundtrack for.

[46:29] Did you have anything to do with the Ziggy Bingney project?

[46:32] No, no, no, not at all.

[46:34] No, did you see it?

[46:36] Um, yeah, I saw it, why would, I, I saw some of the drawings and stuff like that, um,

[46:42] there was a, um, you know, there's a pretty strong sense, uh, you know, that was, that was,

[46:49] that was, you know, obviously, it was a pretty controversial project, um, and, uh, and I guess that,

[46:54] uh, you know, that the, the, the, the, the faction, uh, Capcom, who thought that it was, you

[47:00] know, completely inappropriate thing to put out there as a pinlock game, uh, you know, I suppose

[47:04] you could call it, you could call that faction the Poods, you know, because it's a Pood's

[47:08] position to take, but, um, you know, I guess I have to count myself amongst those, those

[47:13] people I just thought, you know, you know, what, who's gonna buy this game, you know, and, you know,

[47:18] these days we're in a completely different place, right? You know, we're in a place where games

[47:22] don't have to be out in the, uh, you know, don't have to be out on location to make money. They

[47:27] can go into people's basements, you know, and, uh, people, you know, there are, there are collectors

[47:31] and, and, and, you know, there's sufficient interest in the game, you know, in and of its own

[47:36] self that, you know, that you could maybe get away with a game like that at this, in this time,

[47:40] but, you know, what's, uh, you know, the economics of it in 1996, you know, seems, you know,

[47:46] we were just kind of scratching our heads. And, you know, I mean, people scratched our heads,

[47:49] you know, people scratched their heads about Rudy, right? And that was, that was a huge hit, you know,

[47:55] and people scratched their heads about pinball 2000, and that ended up, you know, being the last gas,

[47:59] right? So, you know, you never know about an innovation, you never know about, you know,

[48:03] something that's different from the way that we've always done, and Zingy Bing, he certainly

[48:07] was different from the way that we always done. You know, so, um, you know, there was, you know,

[48:11] Python was not a shy guy, you know, and he, he, he had a, uh, you know, an artistic temperament that,

[48:17] you know, that, that produced some fabulous innovations in pitball, you know, I mean, you know,

[48:22] pinballed to this day is still, you know, one of my, you know, I, I think, you know, for the time,

[48:27] you know, looked at for what it was when it was, you know, still has to be listed right up there

[48:33] with, you know, with, with some of the most innovative thinking in pitball. Um, and, uh, I'm talking

[48:39] about, you know, in terms of conceptually, and, and, you know, what is the, you know, what is the,

[48:44] sort of the message and the artistic message that's, that's being put out here, what kind of an

[48:48] experience are we trying to give people? And, um, you know, pinball was pretty, pretty awesome.

[48:53] Well, before we start talking about Stern and how you got there, what, what, what was your,

[48:59] like your favorite system 11 game that you worked on or your favorite experience? I know you had a,

[49:04] you, you probably worked directly with El Vira and, and maybe some of the people from Adams family,

[49:09] right? Taxi. Taxi. Taxi. Taxi was your favorite? Taxi is absolutely my favorite game.

[49:17] Why? Um, why? That's another Python influence. It is, it is another Python game. I, you know,

[49:25] I, I, I guess taxi is, you know, the, the, my, my, um, my love of taxi. And by the way,

[49:33] I gotta tell you that, that, you know, I, I still own several pinball games, but they're all kind of

[49:37] on loan except my taxi. My taxi is still in the basement. And I, and I do, and I do have a Maryland

[49:43] taxi prototype. Um, but, uh, uh, taxi is, uh, taxi was a game that started life as, um, as a,

[49:53] as a game that was going to be about Grand Prix racing, which I thought was a pretty cool idea.

[49:58] And it was really Python's ideas that, to scrap the whole racecar thing and, and go with a,

[50:04] you know, and go with this, with this kind of goofy, you know, off beat theme, right? And, um,

[50:12] uh, there was something about it when, when, when they first presented, you know,

[50:16] when Mark and Python sat me down and said, okay, it's not going to be super Grand Prix anymore.

[50:20] It's going to be taxi and, and I just want to block. And they explained the whole thing to me

[50:25] about the passengers and picking up passengers and earning toward a jackpot. And, you know, and,

[50:30] and I just, you know, I looked at this, you know, that the whitewood was done. You know, the

[50:34] figure eight ramps were already there. And so you would, you would look at it, what sure looked

[50:38] like a racetrack to me, you know, but, um, and I just sat there and looked at it and, and they had

[50:43] pictures of the characters on the walls and I just, you know, and I just started laughing. And I

[50:47] just said, you know, this is, this is crazy. But it might just be, you know, crazy enough to work.

[50:53] And I did, you know, we just had so much fun making that game. It was, you know, doing those

[51:00] characters and doing the voices and some of the characters that didn't make the cut, um,

[51:04] uh, uh, we, you know, we just had a blast. The main theme, um, I don't know what you remember it,

[51:11] but it's the best thing I ever wrote. It is the best thing I ever wrote. Huh. Now,

[51:17] what characters didn't make the taxi theme? Um, the only one that I did that, that, that, um,

[51:25] that comes to mind was a character. There was a, um, actually there were two. One of them was,

[51:33] was one that we never really came up with a satisfactory name for and that's kind of,

[51:37] that's partly why. But that game came out in mid 1988 and the movie of the year,

[51:41] but the previous year was Tootsie. And so one of the characters was going to be something,

[51:46] you know, was, was basically a takeoff on, on Tootsie and we were, and we were doing a thing

[51:50] where basically we're, I'm going to step away from my, from my phone just a little bit to do this

[51:54] for you, but it basically was sort of like a, you know, taxi taxi taxi. You know, and it was that kind

[52:00] of, that, that kind of thing that, that, that we were trying to get across. And we thought it

[52:04] was hilarious and it was, it worked pretty well for a while, but you know, there weren't enough

[52:08] slots in the game for it and, you know, it just, it just didn't make the cut. Um, that was one and

[52:12] then there was a, you know, I, I, we haven't talked about this, but I, I spent, when I was a kid,

[52:18] I lived in India for six years and, and, and one of the things that you, you know, you'll see through

[52:23] many, many of my games all through the years is, uh, this fellow who does it actually very nice,

[52:27] you need an accent. And that is something that we all just tried to, you know, get into the games and,

[52:33] and one of the characters, we, you know, sort of spoke with an Indian accent. So, uh, again,

[52:37] it was, wasn't something that, you know, just, just didn't rise to the level of, of necessity,

[52:41] I guess you could call it and, and probably just as well, you know, these days, you think,

[52:46] twice about stuff like that. But, um, so, uh, those, those are the two that I can think of that didn't,

[52:51] that didn't make the cut, but, uh, you know, Gorbi was just great, you know, Steve Richie did that

[52:56] voice and, you know, Pindot was an obvious one and the whole Maryland thing was, you know,

[53:00] it was what it was or Maryland or Lola or whatever you want to call it, you know, by the time we got it done.

[53:04] And, um, uh, Santa Claus was a, was a fun one and, and, uh, um, yeah, it was just, uh, yeah, it was, uh,

[53:12] you know, all those characters, you know, we had a lot of fun with the characters and, we had a lot of

[53:16] fun with the, with the rules and, um, uh, uh, uh, and, and again, like I say, that the, the music,

[53:23] you know, basically, you know, at the time, my favorite artist was Little Feet and, uh, and Mark basically

[53:28] said, go, go write me a Little Feet too. And so that was really where I was at, um, you know,

[53:33] musically and, and, uh, and it's just a, it's a, it's, you know, the factory when, when, when,

[53:39] when that game was on the line and, you know, we would go home at, you know, seven o'clock eight o'clock at

[53:43] night or whatever, um, and, and listening to 50 taxis being burned in and that factory all playing that song.

[53:51] I mean, you just can't even believe how awesome and how wonderful the factory sounded.

[53:55] While that game was being manufactured, this factory sounded, that was as good as the factory ever

[53:59] sounded, was, was one that came with being manufactured. So, you know, it's a sentimental thing with me

[54:04] because I like that kind of music, um, the most, uh, but, uh, you know, that's, that's really the,

[54:09] you know, that's the one at the short of it. That was my favorite, you know, I mean, it's a,

[54:12] it's a nice playfield, a cool playfield, but, um, uh, you know, the rules are what they are and

[54:17] and stuff, you know, they're, it's a, it's a much simpler game than, you know, than some of the later ones,

[54:21] but, um, still have a, just a real soft spot in my heart.

[54:24] Okay, we're going to take a break talking with Chris Granger, the soundman at Williams Capcom

[54:29] and Stern Pinball and we'll be right back after this message.

[54:33] Deep in the forest of eastern Canada, you will find something, well,

[54:38] ground breaking and something that's very, very pinball, but something that's really, really small.

[54:46] Oh,

[54:48] presenting classic playfield reproductions.

[54:51] Oh, two guys in their basement.

[54:54] We've got the passion, we've got the gear and we've got the quality, doing our very best to

[54:59] remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts.

[55:04] Classic playfield reproductions.

[55:09] Playfields, back glasses, plastic sets.

[55:17] On the web at classicplayfields.com.

[55:20] All right, we're back with Chris Granger, the soundman for Williams Capcom and Stern Pinball.

[55:26] Did you get to work with any of the, you know, the license theme personalities, you know,

[55:31] like Elvira or Arnold Schwarzenegger for Terminator 2 or any of the Adams family cast?

[55:37] We did. We, um, I met her name is Cassandra Peterson, is who Elvira actually is and I went to LA.

[55:44] Had a couple of great sessions with her and she was really easy and fun to work with. I really enjoyed it.

[55:52] I declined to actually meet with us. It's a pretty funny story and not sure what the, you know,

[55:59] what the rating on this interview is, but we had to, we had to go some to get him to even get

[56:06] in front of any kind of a microphone at all and he didn't agree ever to record for us with us.

[56:14] But basically the soundtrack for the original Terminator 2 game was made in his trailer

[56:22] while he was on the set of Terminator 2. And Lee Orwa, the, the sound recordist for the movie,

[56:29] actually conducted the session. You know, he worked from our script and, you know, he was

[56:32] Terminator. So it wasn't like we had to worry too much about it, especially or anything like that.

[56:36] But, you know, he went through and read all of our stuff and we got everything there and,

[56:39] and, you know, and they did a great job. They caught a bunch of, you know, they caught a truck

[56:43] driving by and made him report a couple of lines of stuff and, you know, they, they were very

[56:47] careful and professional about it. We got a great, great, you know, recording out of it.

[56:51] But at the end of the session, you know, Lee Orwa goes to him anything else and he could hear

[56:56] Arnold kind of change character and he goes, yeah, fuck you asshole. And of course, that was so

[57:02] first, you know, he didn't even say it in character, you know, he, he just said it, you know,

[57:06] and it was pretty clear that he'd never wanted to do this project and,

[57:10] um, uh, and was, you know, it was kind of pissed off about this. And, you know, I basically just felt

[57:16] personally addressed by that line. And we just, I mean, we just all went, yes, yes.

[57:23] You know, it was one of the great moments in the involved development history for Hit the

[57:28] World to throw that in. Of course, it was the first thing that went into, you know, that went

[57:31] into the game, you know, and there's a, you know, of course, there are a powerful roms out there

[57:35] that have, you know, that have that phrase in it that you can get, you know, for the, uh,

[57:39] the possible responses random feature, you know, if you get nothing, that's what it says, you know.

[57:43] So, so why didn't that actually end up in the actual final roms, you know?

[57:49] Well, like I said, Pinball was all, you know, Pinball always had a bad, uh, you know, had a bad

[57:56] reputation in the community, right? Even in Chicago where, you know, where it's manufactured,

[58:01] and a lot of people were employed by that business, you know, the feeling was that it was, you

[58:05] know, there was somehow immoral or, or, you know, like it was, it was kind of equated with gambling

[58:09] devices. And of course, there, you know, they're then gambling, you know, on games and stuff like

[58:13] that. So, so that had a bad reputation and had to live that reputation down every day. So,

[58:19] the idea that we would put a, you know, cursing into a game like that, that was just, you know,

[58:23] I was completely, you know, there was no way, there was just, you know, no way at all.

[58:28] Um, you know, for our basements, absolutely, you know, my games, no question about it. But,

[58:35] you know, not for, not for public release. No, you know, there's, you know, there's no such thing,

[58:39] you know, the sopranos, I guess, was the first game that actually had a kind of an R, you know,

[58:43] had a setting that was R, right? So, um, so we did, you know, come to that thinking later on, and,

[58:49] you know, and, you know, give Python some credit for, for, you know, pushing that envelope with

[58:53] Ebingy, you know, 10 years before. So, um, but yeah, yeah, 1991, no way. You know, that was not

[58:58] going to happen. We were writing a, a crest of success at that point, you know, we sold, you know,

[59:02] we sold 16,700, you know, uh, terminator twos. And, uh, you know, I, you know, who knows what the

[59:08] movie, we, you know, I mean, it's a, it's, you know, it's the signature line, right? But, um,

[59:13] you know, the movie people probably wouldn't have cared much, but, you know, the pinball,

[59:16] convocacy, never would have bought it. Red and Ted Roach show. There was, um, you know, the,

[59:21] the, the country star, the singer for that. How hard was it to implement her songs into that

[59:28] theme, into that pinball system, into the DCS system? Well, she only had the one, um, she only

[59:35] had the one, uh, uh, song that was, you know, that every little thing song that was, uh, that was

[59:41] actually in the game. Uh, the rest of it was just, you know, it was just speech kind of like any other

[59:45] project. She was, she was great curling Carter's, right? And, uh, you know, she did a great job,

[59:49] but, uh, really only had the one song. Um, and, uh, you know, uh, that dropped in, um,

[59:57] uh, you know, if that, that pretty much dropped in as a, as like an extended, um,

[01:00:03] piece of, of speech. And, uh, that was, that was pretty much how it worked.

[01:00:07] And was it harder to do a license theme during this, during the pre-DCS time where you were

[01:00:12] using the, the Yamaha, you know, YM2151 synthesizer or was that, you know, easy to do?

[01:00:19] That was a lot, that was actually a lot. It was a lot harder to do the license stuff because

[01:00:23] there'd be so, so much material. But, um, you know, ultimately, I think that doing the, uh,

[01:00:27] the original titles was, was quite a bit more rewarding. Now, how, how did you make the transition

[01:00:32] to over-dustern? How did that all come about? Well, like I said, I was working with, uh,

[01:00:36] incredible technologies and, um, uh, running their sound department. And, uh, while I was doing that,

[01:00:43] a several of my old colleagues at, at Williams Valley Midway, um, you know, had also left, um,

[01:00:49] you know, left that, that shop and started their own shops. And I started doing work on the side

[01:00:54] for them. And I was pretty, you know, pretty up-spunk with incredible technologies about the fact

[01:00:59] that I was doing that. And I worked out okay because they frankly didn't have, you know, the golf,

[01:01:04] you know, needs for a, for soundtrack in terms of golf work, uh, we're, you know, we're pretty limited.

[01:01:08] And, uh, um, you know, I just frankly wasn't that busy. But, um, so I had, you know, I had,

[01:01:13] I had the brain cells in the bandwidth to do it. And I was doing side work. And eventually,

[01:01:17] I got so much side work that, um, you know, it was pretty clear that I should just, you know,

[01:01:22] go back out on my own and do all that other work. And I actually did some work for incredible,

[01:01:26] you know, for, for years to after that, anyway. Um, but, uh, uh, the, the stern piece of that was,

[01:01:34] um, uh, was, was a pat waller, um, you know, call that I got while I was working at kind of credible

[01:01:41] kind of in this mode. And he basically said, we'd like it to, we'd like to bring you on. It's a very

[01:01:45] rush project, you know, can we basically borrow you from incredible for, you know, for, for three months?

[01:01:51] And, uh, I took that to Elaine Hodson, the, uh, the CEO of, of incredible technologies. And, you know,

[01:01:58] they're, um, they're old friends with, with Gary Stern. Um, basically we worked out, uh, you know,

[01:02:03] we worked, we worked it out. You know, there was a way for us to, to, you know, they, they were able

[01:02:06] to spare me for that amount of time. And, and soon after, you know, that, basically about the time

[01:02:11] that that project finished, it was the time that my relationship as an employee of incredible was,

[01:02:16] was coming to an end. Um, so, um, uh, uh, you know, I, I then left. And, uh, it was the, uh, Simpson's

[01:02:26] project that Dan Fordon found himself kind of overbooked, uh, during. And I, uh, basically picked

[01:02:32] up a slack from him and kind of finished that project for him. And, uh, at that point, I was in a

[01:02:37] position to do it. And, uh, and I just started doing, you know, I started doing all the, all their,

[01:02:41] all their work at that point. They, uh, they kept coming back to me. Now, how was the hardware

[01:02:46] system? Like, you know, you were using the, the Yamaha YM2151, then you were using, uh,

[01:02:52] digitally compressed sound. And then you were using the Capcom system. Now you're using the

[01:02:56] Stern hardware system. Was that a step forward or a step backwards? Well, it, you know, it's,

[01:03:01] it's, it's like, you know, like I said, you know, fidelity is a, is a kind of in the eyes of the

[01:03:05] beholder. Um, but, uh, in many ways, the BSMT hardware system was, uh, um, with a step back,

[01:03:12] it was a, uh, was a sampler-based system, uh, uh, you know, 12, 12, uh, uh, you know,

[01:03:19] modified sampling voices, uh, that we would have to create the samples for and play back. Um,

[01:03:25] it was not unsophisticated for a sampler, but it was just a sampler. So, um, that was, that was

[01:03:30] essentially, you know, what, you know, that was, that was what we had to work with. Um,

[01:03:36] and, uh, you know, that said, the, uh, the, the, um, the, the amplifier and the speakers were,

[01:03:43] as, you know, we're, we're, as, as, as good or, you know, they can put as much money, you know,

[01:03:48] into those as the, uh, as Williams or, or, or Capcom ever had. And, um, so, you know, it's, uh,

[01:03:55] you know, the sound of the, of the games themselves and the sounds of the samples were, you know,

[01:03:59] we're okay. You know, they were pretty good samples. And, um, you know, it's time went on, we made

[01:04:03] a couple of incremental improvements to that system. And, uh, of course, you know, they're with, uh,

[01:04:09] uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we'll poke her tour. You know, we made a pretty giant leap forward

[01:04:14] at that point. But, um, you know, I would say that the, uh, the Stern system wasn't nearly as good

[01:04:18] as, as the Williams DCS, you know, in. There's no question that, that, that DCS was vastly superior

[01:04:26] to the BSMT system, uh, at that point. But, you know, you got to remember BSMT was technology, uh,

[01:04:31] that was developed in, you know, something like 1991 and 1992. Um, and again, you know,

[01:04:37] the very conservative nature of, of, of pinball hardware development, uh, you know,

[01:04:42] it dictates that you just get as much mileage out of that, um, out of that hardware as you can.

[01:04:46] And frankly, the, uh, the impetus to change was, uh, the fact that they were going to stop

[01:04:52] manufacturing the parts. They were going to stop man, you know, first TI was going to stop

[01:04:56] manufacturing the BSMT and then Motorola stopped manufacturing the 68.09. So, you know, I mean, we

[01:05:01] were done, you know, they, they, they had to do something else. And, and that was how the,

[01:05:06] the WP, the WPT system, you know, came to be. And the WPT system, you're saying that's what they

[01:05:11] started using with World Poker Tour. Exactly. Yeah, I just, I call it WPT system. I can't

[01:05:16] remember what we actually called it, um, the, you know, that, that, that next generation,

[01:05:20] uh, pinball hardware system, the, you know, the system built on the App Now technology.

[01:05:24] But now you're saying that the, the, the, the older version, the BM, the BMST was not like how you

[01:05:31] programmed the Yamaha synthesizer. It was more like you, you know, designed the sounds on

[01:05:36] standard instruments and standard record them and then sampled them into the, into the, into a,

[01:05:40] recording device. No, if that's how you understood it, I misspoke. It was in fact almost identical

[01:05:46] to the way that the Yamaha system worked. Um, in fact, the, the, the syntax of programming, um,

[01:05:52] uh, programming music and programming sound was, was still close to identical that the differences

[01:05:59] don't really matter. Huh. So the Yamaha chip and the BMST were essentially the same thing.

[01:06:05] Like I said, the user interface between those two systems were almost identical. Yeah.

[01:06:11] So now that's unlike the digitally compressed sound at Williams, where basically you'd write

[01:06:17] everything on an amp, or, you know, one, whatever instrument you want it and then just basically

[01:06:21] recorded it and then it got transported and compressed into the mpag format. Exactly, exactly correct.

[01:06:26] So now when you were working on, like say you were working on, you worked on all license

[01:06:33] theme. Again, you're working on Terminator 3 with Stern. So, you know, you got Arnold again and

[01:06:38] you, of course, you're working with Simpsons. How, you know, how were the personalities? Because

[01:06:42] you, you had to record with these people, I assume, right? Um, again, the, uh, the opportunity to work

[01:06:49] with the Simpsons people, uh, we, we were not into the studio to, uh, to work with the

[01:06:55] Simpsons people, unfortunately, um, nor were we invited again to, uh, to, you know, to the Terminator 3 set.

[01:07:02] However, I, both, both of those, uh, both of those projects were very well supported by the

[01:07:09] studios and, um, surprisingly, Arnold was, uh, was very excited to read our script. It was a much

[01:07:16] more lengthy script, um, and, you know, much more expensive than, you know, he did a great job. He

[01:07:21] was, uh, you know, he, it was as though, you know, it was, it was as though the previous, uh, you

[01:07:26] know, issues that we had had really hadn't happened at all. So, um, that was kind of, kind of amusing. But,

[01:07:32] with regard to the sopranos, we had a, you know, had a, had a wonderful, um, you know, two-day event

[01:07:38] in, in New York City to record that material. And, you know, that was a, that was a tremendous project for,

[01:07:44] uh, uh, not for the sound, sound equipment, for, for me, for the sound guy.

[01:07:50] How, how about how was, like, say, Elvis in Lord of the Rings?

[01:07:54] Well, uh, Lord of the Rings was all of the, all of the Lord of the Rings stuff that we had.

[01:07:58] I guess we did, you know, I guess, um, I'm glad you mentioned Lord of the Rings because it,

[01:08:02] it allows me to mention John Wright's Davies, who was, um, you know, as Salah was the, uh,

[01:08:09] you know, was, was, was, was one of the, one of the great voices from Indiana Jones. And,

[01:08:14] was the one guy that we actually got in for Indiana Jones to, to do sound. And, um, that was another

[01:08:19] project that I, you know, I had a lot of, a lot of affection for. So, John Wright's Davies was one

[01:08:24] of the fellows that read for us as was the guy who played photo. You know, both of those two characters

[01:08:29] read for us for, uh, you know, for Lord of the Rings. And that turned out to be a great project,

[01:08:33] rest of the sound from Lord of the Rings or the rest of the speech work, you know, came from,

[01:08:38] you know, from excerpts from the movie. Elijah Wood, thank God. Okay. Boy, I'm so happy that I

[01:08:43] didn't completely lose that. Um, so those are, those are pretty cool. Uh, that was, you know,

[01:08:48] Lord of the Rings is a pretty, pretty great project all the way around. They were the movie

[01:08:52] studio again. It was very supportive. Now, on Simpsons, on Simpsons, it seemed like there was a

[01:08:57] couple characters voices that were missing. Was there a reason for that? Well, they only gave us

[01:09:04] access to, basically, we were only able to work with three actors. And so we, we basically,

[01:09:10] you know, we missed March, right? Because, uh, because the person who does march is a, um, you know,

[01:09:17] somebody who only did seven or eight voices. And so we ended up picking, picking Nancy Cartwright,

[01:09:22] who does bark, um, and Dan Castellaneda, who did, you know, who did Homer. And, um, and the guy,

[01:09:28] the guy who did the comic book guy and the, uh, the deeper tone guy, the, um, also does, um,

[01:09:36] uh, the, the Indian boys. Uh, so we picked those three because they, they ended up giving us,

[01:09:41] you know, something like 65 different characters or something like that. So that, you know, that turned

[01:09:45] out to be, you know, really what we want. Um, that was, that was probably the finest bit of speech,

[01:09:51] integrating, you know, a licensed speech theme with a, with a pinball theme that there ever was.

[01:09:57] And, and, and credit for that work solely and, and fully and happily from my perspective,

[01:10:03] goes to Keith Johnson because it was his script from top to bottom, you know, he had a very

[01:10:07] elaborate set of rules for that game and, uh, was an absolute Simpson, you know,

[01:10:14] Nanak, Simpson's fan and nut and, um, did great, great research and, uh, the, the, uh, you know,

[01:10:22] the links between the Simpson's television episodes and the rules of the game and the way that the

[01:10:27] speech supported those links, you really have to have, you know, to my mind has no equal in pinball

[01:10:33] history. It was just that it was a masterpiece of script writing. Now how about Elvis? How was Elvis?

[01:10:40] Elvis was a, Elvis was a great project. Um, we, we recruited a, um, we recruited, uh, from

[01:10:47] Graceland, uh, on their recommendation, their favorite Elvis performer. His name is Jamie

[01:10:53] Aaron Kelly and he lives in the middle of, of nowhere Iowa, but he is, he's got a touring Elvis show.

[01:11:00] And he, he was amazing because he came in and said, so you want Elvis, which Elvis do you want?

[01:11:04] You know, do you want the Lame jacket Elvis or do you want the black leather jacket Elvis or do you

[01:11:08] want the pant, the, you know, the, the sequined, uh, pants suit Hawaii Elvis and he was able to do

[01:11:14] quite distinct versions of each one of those things for us. And, um, you know, it was awesome,

[01:11:20] but, um, you know, the speech, the speech work itself was not the main push there and, uh, you know,

[01:11:28] he did some nice singing for us as well. It just wasn't it, it was, it was a fun project that

[01:11:32] need to do and stuff. Um, but in terms of, of, of, of, you know, interactive with Elvis himself,

[01:11:38] it wasn't quite as, as detailed as, as, uh, you know, as, as a lot of projects might be because

[01:11:43] of some of the licensing concerns that we had, we were, we were very, very limited in terms of

[01:11:47] what Graceland was able to, to let us use. So, um, you know, we were kind of limited to taking clips

[01:11:53] out of, out of some TV specials that they, that they solely owned the rights to, um, and that was

[01:11:58] the only way that we could avoid paying royalties to, to the record companies to RCA. So that was kind

[01:12:04] of the situation that we were in. Now, when you went to World Booker Tour in the new sound system,

[01:12:10] how much different was it, uh, you know, doing sound for that compared to the BMST system?

[01:12:16] Well, that was really coming back into a, um, you know, back into a more of a DCS kind of

[01:12:21] environment and that was an environment that we designed, um, specifically, you know, to, to

[01:12:27] look like DCS because that interface made a lot of sense to me and, and to all of us. And, um,

[01:12:33] so, you know, it was, it was once again looking at, at, you know, compressed sound and, uh,

[01:12:38] you know, multiple streams of sound. I think we had five or six tracks available at one time and,

[01:12:43] um, and it was, you know, certainly the highest fidelity stuff that I had ever had a chance to work

[01:12:48] with in a pinball context. And, uh, you know, I think, I, you know, that, I thought that game just

[01:12:52] sounded spectacular. It was a wonderful sound again. Do you think that system is better than the

[01:12:57] Williams DCS? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I would say so. I, you know, I mean, in terms of just, just, you know,

[01:13:02] looking at nothing but sound production, that was definitely a superior, you know, I, I may,

[01:13:07] I'm not enough. I've never had been enough of an expert on, on, you know, pinball,

[01:13:12] on pinball technology to know about, um, you know, drivers or, or, which, you know, detection and

[01:13:18] stuff like that. Um, so, uh, you know, not really able to answer that in a comprehensive way,

[01:13:23] but certainly with regard to sound, it's that it was, it was, um, you know, the most advanced

[01:13:27] sound system really ever. Now, when you were doing sound on the BMS T system, you know,

[01:13:34] our, or not sound, but what digital voices did, and that was probably similar to what you were

[01:13:40] doing in, in system 11. What, I mean, did you have just a limited amount of space for actual

[01:13:46] digitized sound voices compared to like what you have in world, world, world, world, world,

[01:13:54] literature we had, we actually moved to, to flash parts at that point. And we had a pretty,

[01:13:59] you know, really quite a bit of memory. And we had something like 32 megs of, of, storage

[01:14:03] capacity there. Um, and that was just a giant step forward plus the algorithms that we were

[01:14:08] able to use to get into kind of a, you know, an MP3 era, you know, level of, of encoding meant that,

[01:14:15] you know, the fidelity was just vastly, vastly improved. Um, and so we had a, you know,

[01:14:20] a pretty looked at rate and quite a bit of memory to store stuff in and the capability

[01:14:25] of playing back all those channels at once. So the WPT system really just in so many

[01:14:33] different ways in terms of algorithmic sophistication as well as just capacity was a giant, giant step

[01:14:42] forward the amount of RAM on the BSMT system was considerably more limited. So yeah, I mean

[01:14:51] we were talking about four 8 megabit parts. So a total of form megabytes of RAM or memory,

[01:14:59] you know, of e-commerce in the BSMT land versus 32 megs in the WPT system. So really,

[01:15:06] memory and computational capability really drove all that stuff. Talked about the music end of it

[01:15:14] and how you created the music. But we really didn't talk much about working with the people to get

[01:15:21] the vocals. Like on the games that were non-licensed, you know, like how you know, where do all the

[01:15:29] voices come from? Or, you know, like let's just take pin-bot for example, where are the voices for

[01:15:34] pin-bot come from? The voice for pin-bot was essentially achieved through a very long

[01:15:45] standing and traditional electronic manipulation technique called vocoding. And, you know, which is why you get that kind

[01:15:52] of machine-like sound. You hear it in bad pop music a lot. And, you know, the kind of robotic voices

[01:16:01] that you've heard over the years, it's a real, you know, I mean, really, it's just, it's basically a cliche.

[01:16:06] And there's a box that you can use to basically make anybody's voice sound like that. And,

[01:16:13] it just coincidentally, it was very out of the voice who we used through that process. And he was

[01:16:20] the voice of pin-bot. So, and I might add that he was also then, you know, two years later or a year

[01:16:27] and a half or so later, he was also the voice of pin-bot when we, when he reprised that voice in taxi. So,

[01:16:34] so yeah, that's how that worked out. Okay, let's take another one like, say, Earthshaker. Who are the voices in that?

[01:16:42] Well, let's see if I can recall correctly the main voice in Earthshaker. I guess there was,

[01:16:51] you know, there was sort of a DJ voice. It's Sonny Drive Time. That guy, that was Mark Richey.

[01:16:57] And then the girl, the, you know, the California Valley girl, whatever, you know, that's kind of how we

[01:17:01] we thought of her. Yeah. That voice was a character. And I think she made a couple of other

[01:17:06] appearances in a couple of other games. I don't remember offhand which ones they were, but she was,

[01:17:12] she was a lady who worked for Williams for a fairly short amount of time. But she was

[01:17:20] just one of our favorite people and she's, she's her main one of my close friends. She is,

[01:17:26] she's an Indian lady and her name is Somia Netrobile. She is a really neat person. She was an artist,

[01:17:32] a fabulous painter and a, she was working at Williams as a technical writer back in, in 1988,

[01:17:40] 89 and she was available and had just the right sort of attitude to pull that, to pull that character

[01:17:47] off. So she was great. And Mark, you know, Mark's done voices. You know, the, the, the general answer

[01:17:54] to your question is that is that people around the shop, you know, basically did the voices for

[01:17:58] the non-licensed games with, with almost no exceptions. As I'm, as I'm sort of scanning down the

[01:18:05] list here, you know, you would ask about, about Earthshaker. That was, that was, that was that way.

[01:18:10] World Wind Funhouse, Fish Tales, all of those games were done with in-house voices.

[01:18:17] World Wind, the, the voice for, you know, the, the announcer, that went around going to

[01:18:23] Stolmer's coming, return to the homes. Yeah. That's Ed Boone. And, and Funhouse, that was,

[01:18:31] you know, I'm not sure whether this is a big secret. I, I sort of thought this was common knowledge,

[01:18:35] but Ed Boone is the voice of Rudy. And I might add that there was a, a very lengthy process

[01:18:44] that we went through in, in attempting to, to, to get Ed to deliver that voice in just exactly

[01:18:52] the right way. He had said the phrase that we, that we struck in our first recording session with

[01:18:59] that game. And, and I think that there were about eight or ten of them, you know, before we were all

[01:19:04] said, done, before we really, you know, felt like we had gotten it right. The first phrase that he

[01:19:09] said that we, that we all said, yeah, we wanted all to sound like this was the phrase, quick

[01:19:13] climb with the clock. And, for whatever reason, you know, many, many of the other phrases that we,

[01:19:20] that we started with, you know, in sort of version one in that game, just didn't have that same

[01:19:24] quality to it. It was had a kind of a frenetic, sort of a near hysteria or a panic, you know,

[01:19:31] his voice kind of cracked a little bit. And, and it just, you know, it really took us a long,

[01:19:35] long time, and took Ed a long, long time, who was, you know, Ed's got a fabulous ear and he's a,

[01:19:41] he's an amazing mimic. He's, he's got a number of really, very, very strong impressions. If you ever

[01:19:45] get a chance to talk to him, he'll, I'll do a few of them for you. But he is, you know, he's a funny guy.

[01:19:51] He's got a great sense of timing, like I say, a great ear, but, but we were really after a very,

[01:19:55] very specific sound and, and Pat Lawler and Larry DeMar, you know, we're really the, you know,

[01:20:01] the masterminds behind that game, you know, and, and I and Ed, you know, just really spent a lot of

[01:20:06] time in the studio trying to get that voice right. So, so that was, that was Ed and, I guess,

[01:20:14] uh, uh, uh, fish tails was the other one. There were a number of, there were a number of voices in,

[01:20:22] in fish tails because, you know, of course, we had the, the multiple, you know, that the random

[01:20:26] feature about how big your fish was and lying about the fish. Um, the, uh, the guy who says,

[01:20:33] biggest fish I ever saw. That was George Petro, who was, you know, as a, a big game programmer and,

[01:20:39] you know, uh, the designer behind terminator, terminator two. What, what do you just pull these guys

[01:20:45] out of the hallway when they're walking by or something, you just yank them out of the, hey, say

[01:20:49] this for me or something, how do you get these guys? We certainly started that way and, and, uh, you

[01:20:54] know, once it became known that, that we were doing that, uh, you know, once it became known that

[01:20:59] people, that, you know, we were just using people, you know, who worked at the factory or whatever

[01:21:02] worked and worked, worked in the, in the building to do the voices, you know, we got people to come

[01:21:07] and volunteer for us and, and, um, you know, we, we used a few, we used Ken Fedeson Secretary on a

[01:21:12] couple of voices. She was the, uh, the voice of the, of the cutie and, in, in taxi. She was,

[01:21:17] when I said, you know, who the factory, you know, that was, uh, um, you know, Ken Secretary, Kathy Klein.

[01:21:23] And, um, uh, you like I say, George Petro was a, you know, he did, he did that particular kind of

[01:21:28] Indiana Southern, uh, draw voice. Um, uh, the guy who went, um, it was this big man. I'm not

[01:21:36] kidding. That was Steve Richie. Um, the, uh, the voice that goes, you're not believing,

[01:21:42] guys, this is what I'm doing. You know, as you can, might, might, might detect that was me.

[01:21:47] And, uh, um, and there were, uh, let's see, you know, then Mark was the, was the guy who says,

[01:21:52] you know, gone fishing, leave a message and then he was the guy who would say, you know, welcome

[01:21:56] to the fishing tournament. He was the main voice of that game. Um, I would say, uh, the other one

[01:22:01] that you didn't mention that, that was a, that, you know, that, where, where, where vocals played a very

[01:22:05] big part was, uh, was cyclone. Um, and, uh, we really had a lot of fun with that. You know, we got

[01:22:11] into the whole, um, um, you know, sort of carnival barker thing. And again, that was Mark Richie,

[01:22:15] who did that voice. Um, Mark was somebody that we really, really used a lot. Um, he had a, you

[01:22:20] know, he had a very clear, very strong voice. He had a, again, again, he had a pre-girdier and,

[01:22:26] and was able to, uh, you know, to achieve that, that, that, you know, really that, that, that,

[01:22:30] very high energy, uh, up energy kind of, uh, kind of, you know, uh, just attitude that, that,

[01:22:37] that just seemed to really work very well for, for pinball, for, you know, for, for having a voice,

[01:22:42] but cheerlead the player, you know, through the game and, and, uh, it'll provide a little bit

[01:22:47] of instruction, but mostly cheerlead. That was the thing that, that, that, that, that that voice

[01:22:51] did particularly well. Um, so, uh, I think those are the main, um, you know, non-licensed titles that

[01:22:57] you, you, you, you had mentioned that. Now, when you went to licensed titles and you had to actually

[01:23:03] work with this people, you know, you talked about, uh, how, you know, T on T2, how you guys didn't

[01:23:08] actually record Arnold that it was done on the set of T2 by the, the sound engineer there.

[01:23:13] Was that commoner, did these people come into the studio often?

[01:23:17] Well, yeah, you know, whenever we could get an, an individual session with a, you know, with,

[01:23:22] with talent from, you know, from a licensed, uh, you know, that was always our preference, obviously.

[01:23:26] Um, you know, just wasn't always possible. The, uh, you know, the Indiana Jones thing was, uh,

[01:23:31] you know, was a particularly nice one. You know, John Rice Davies actually came to our factory and, uh,

[01:23:37] and gave us the, the benefit of about an hour worth of work for, um, you know, the voices for, um,

[01:23:43] uh, for Indiana Jones. And so, uh, all those goofy, uh, you know, goofy awards and things like that.

[01:23:49] He was, he was the call for that, for that game. And, uh, of course, he's just got, you know, he is a

[01:23:54] wonderful, Shakespearean actor, you know, and, uh, you know, fabulous project. And, uh, just wonderfully

[01:24:00] coachable and, um, was just a great guy to work with. We, we, we really, really enjoyed work at the

[01:24:05] end of great deal. Um, uh, with Adams family, we got a chance, of course, to work with Raul Julia.

[01:24:11] And that was another, just, you know, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. Um, it was, um,

[01:24:16] you know, it was not long before he died, that he, um, you know, that he, that he produced that,

[01:24:21] that, that shot. And, and I don't really know, um, you know, I don't know too much of the details

[01:24:26] about his, his passing. So I don't really know what his state of mind was at the point where we,

[01:24:30] you know, he did that movie or, um, you know, how, how things were going for him. But this was in,

[01:24:36] I guess this was, you know, late 1991 or something like that that, that, that we did that, uh,

[01:24:41] did that project. And I, I did fly to New York and, and, and had a had a recording session with him.

[01:24:47] And it was a very interesting session because, uh, um, you know, there's a, there's a,

[01:24:51] there's a particular sort of an attitude that, that, that's kind of standard in all pinball games

[01:24:56] that, that we need for vocal talent to, the sort of, uh, latch onto and, and, and project this

[01:25:01] attitude. And it's a, it's, it's like I said, it's the attitude of a cheerleader and a, and a,

[01:25:05] and a very up energy kind of, uh, kind of a character. And, um, and certainly, you know, that,

[01:25:11] the, the role of going as Adams was, you know, fit right in with that. And then it worked out as,

[01:25:15] you know, as you, as you know, it worked out fabulously well. Um, but I, I kind of had to get,

[01:25:20] give him fairly specific instruction with each line. Well, I felt like I did anyway because

[01:25:26] his personal affect in the studio was so low and so kind of absent that I really didn't know

[01:25:31] whether he understood what it was that I wanted him to do. Because I would explain how a line was,

[01:25:36] was, was to be said, or I would do it for him. I would, I would perform it kind of roughly the

[01:25:40] way that I would have done it or the way that I did it on, on, on a number of occasions, you know,

[01:25:44] when, but I would say, get the extra ball or shh, not butter or any of those kind of goofy things

[01:25:49] that, that, that, you know, that we would do. Um, and I, you know, so I would, I would, I would model

[01:25:53] the behavior or I would describe the, the gesture I would describe something about it to kind of

[01:25:57] coach him. And then he would sit in the studio from the microphone, this blank look on his face.

[01:26:03] Huh. For about three seconds.

[01:26:08] And finally, he would do exactly what I wanted him to and absolutely nailed it. But without that

[01:26:16] coaching, he didn't seem to, to, to, to be able to put himself in that place because he,

[01:26:22] you know, he, he took no initiative in, in ad living lines or, or going any further than what I,

[01:26:27] what I, you know, what I delivered. And I felt like he was just, you know, he was, he was sort of

[01:26:32] performing like a, like a circus bear or a circus, you know, or a, or a train field would,

[01:26:36] would kind of perform. So it was a little odd and, and, and not altogether comfortable. But,

[01:26:42] you know, obviously the result was just stunningly, unbelievably awesome, you know. I mean, it was,

[01:26:47] it was a great session and, uh, the, you know, the, the custom speech for that game was, was, was

[01:26:52] absolutely top notch. I should add that he, um, that I had a, a girlfriend at that time who, uh,

[01:27:00] who was from New York and knew, uh, and, and, and kind of idolized Raoul, um, from his Shakespeare

[01:27:06] in the Park Days and had asked me to get some kind of an autograph form or something like that.

[01:27:11] And actually what I got him to do was to read a little thing for me that said, hello, this is Raoul

[01:27:16] Jane can't take your call just now, but if you leave a message, you'll call you back and it was a

[01:27:22] tremendous hit. And, uh, well, leave us to say I got a big hug and kiss for them. Yeah. Um,

[01:27:27] I would say. And, like, that was a, a, a pretty memorable session. It was, it was a little odd, but,

[01:27:33] but, you know, ultimately very successful. Um, you, you would also ask about, uh, uh,

[01:27:37] the sopranos. That was a wonderful, um, that was a wonderful session. Yeah. Now, now, who did you work

[01:27:42] on that with? That was a two day session. It was actually just one day, um, in New York. And we

[01:27:47] got to work with four of the actors. We got to work with Donek, Cheon A. Z. The guy who plays,

[01:27:51] uh, Uncle Junior. Uh, we got to work with Edie Falco, who was just stunning. Uh, we got

[01:27:57] Lorraine Braco. And then we got little Stevie Van Zant, um, who plays Silvio. Um, and they were all

[01:28:03] in the studio that day and came in, you know, we spent about an hour and a half or, or maybe a

[01:28:07] little more with each of them. And, uh, you know, and, and all of them just, you know, they,

[01:28:13] they each kind of, you know, as, as, uh, as Lyman and, and Dwight. And I had, had, uh, kind of

[01:28:18] spec'd out, uh, um, in, in, in, you know, fairly lengthy and, and, uh, you know, extensive, uh,

[01:28:25] script preparation conversations for that game. They each kind of had a, a role to play. And then

[01:28:30] we all had them kind of do the generic, um, you know, get the extra ball type, you know,

[01:28:34] the standard pinball stuff. And, uh, you know, they all, they all kind of kind of smiled and,

[01:28:39] and we're kind of kind of, you know, thinking, God, this is pretty silly, but all right, here we go.

[01:28:43] You know, um, uh, with, with all of it, but they all, you know, of course, they're all, you know,

[01:28:48] consummate professional actors and, and, and they just did fabulous, who well. And, uh, so, yeah,

[01:28:52] that was another very, very, uh, um, you know, that was a pretty memorable session I have to say.

[01:28:57] Then, um, well, what do you do about the actors that you couldn't get for the sopranos like, you know,

[01:29:02] all those, all the other roles, um, the other guy that we got was Big Pussy. The guy who played

[01:29:06] Big Pussy, you know, he's been in a million things. Um, we got him, uh, actually on a remote session,

[01:29:12] you know, that we, he was in New York and we, and we recorded him from Chicago. Um, you know,

[01:29:17] we actually got him twice. Uh, we had to, we had to do a makeup session with him and, and,

[01:29:21] and wait, wait, wait, when, when you say remote, what do you mean you can do this over the telephone

[01:29:27] or something? Well, there's a, there's technology that, that, you know, that major commercial

[01:29:32] studios have that, uh, that actually allow for, uh, you know, for, for a, an actor in one studio's

[01:29:39] audio to be transmitted through, uh, the, it's actually not the phone system itself. It's, but it's

[01:29:44] the ISDM system and, uh, those, those lines, um, you know, those are basically dedicated lines that,

[01:29:51] you know, that, that, that operating out of the, out of the old telephone system's trunk system,

[01:29:55] it's a digital connection and it's a very high quality, uh, dedicated, you know, connection and, uh,

[01:30:02] so, you know, our guy is, is in us, in a New York studio in front of, you know, a $5,000

[01:30:06] microphone in that New York studio playing through a, a Pro Tools rig that's wired into the ISDM

[01:30:11] system, sending that audio to a studio in Chicago that's recording it also in Pro Tools,

[01:30:16] and we end up walking out of the studio in Chicago with the, with a, you know, with a CD of the session,

[01:30:21] and then two days later we get overnighted or, you know, we get delivered to a CD from the New York

[01:30:26] session as well, and frankly, unless you're, you know, unless you're in, you know, a super high

[01:30:30] fidelity situation, you can't tell the difference between those two, those two pieces of audio. So, um,

[01:30:37] you know, we've, we've, we've been fortunate to, to, you know, to, it's an expensive thing to do,

[01:30:43] uh, obviously, but, uh, something we've done on a number of occasions and it, you know, it get,

[01:30:47] you know, when you, when you don't have to spend the night in the hotel and, and when you've got,

[01:30:51] uh, you know, actors coming in that are, that are, you know, costing a lot of money, uh, it's a,

[01:30:56] it's a, it's a way to save some, you know, save some dough that way as well. So, um, you know, we've

[01:31:00] taken advantage of that for a couple of games. Now, who did Wad Sterling's voice?

[01:31:05] That actually is the name of a local Chicago actor. His name is Tim Kitzaro, um, and, uh, you,

[01:31:11] if you know anything about Midway video games, he was also the, uh, he was the voice of a number of,

[01:31:17] of Midway sports titles. Um, so, uh, he's, he's, he's not a ton of work for us, uh, you know, over the,

[01:31:23] over the years and various guys as he did some stuff for us over at, uh, incredible technologies

[01:31:28] back in the day and, and, um, you know, got to, uh, I'm trying to remember, he did, it seems like he did

[01:31:34] something for us in, um, you know, uh, in a, in a Stern-Kin, uh, oh, he was the voice of NASCAR.

[01:31:43] So, um, you know, he was, he was on an ounce. He was the, uh, he, he, he did a couple of,

[01:31:47] up different announcers for, uh, for NASCAR. So, um, you know, we were able to use him again,

[01:31:52] but that was Wad Sterling. Uh, again, that was something that we had to work on quite a bit to,

[01:31:56] to really kind of get the sound right. But, uh, you know, feel like we, we did a pretty good job,

[01:32:00] you know, I mean, of course, you know, in retrospect, it doesn't sound exactly like raw, but, uh, you know,

[01:32:05] we got the, we got the basic inflections in the attitude. I think we got pretty well right.

[01:32:08] Now, how often did you have to come up with custom sounds, you know, like the sounds of a

[01:32:12] motorboat or the sounds of a car or stuff like that, and where you actually had to go outside the

[01:32:17] studio and hook a mic up to the tailpipe of a car. Did you ever have to do something like that?

[01:32:22] You know, I, I, I think we did, uh, um, you know, we did that whenever we could, really, because,

[01:32:27] you know, uh, live recorded sound, custom sound for any given situation. If you can, if, you know,

[01:32:33] the situation is right and the recording environment is right, you know, you're always better off with

[01:32:37] a custom piece of sound than you are with, with something canned off of the sound effects record.

[01:32:43] You know, the, the needs were, were sufficiently, uh, you know, the list of sounds to make were

[01:32:47] sufficiently long that, you know, wasn't really practical to do that with like, with every sound,

[01:32:51] with every digitized sound we'd need, but, um, you know, whatever it was, something that, that,

[01:32:55] you know, where either people were going to like recognize the canned sound, you know, there's a

[01:32:59] couple of, of bird calls, you know, you still hear all over the, you know, all over television shows

[01:33:04] and stuff like that. And I know exactly what cut from what sound effects test can they come from,

[01:33:09] you know, because we've been through that stuff so often, but, uh, you know, a certain barn owl

[01:33:13] sounds, you know, it's just, you know, it's such a recognizable sound. But, uh, you know, we, uh,

[01:33:19] we would do that whenever we could, um, and like I say, whenever it was practical. So, um,

[01:33:24] you know, the NASCAR stuff, we actually have some pretty good material from a couple of different,

[01:33:29] um, you know, NASCAR related sources. So, uh, most of our stuff there was, was, you know, I,

[01:33:35] I didn't need to record it myself and it's a good thing too because I, I, I never did make it to

[01:33:39] a NASCAR track. But, um, you know, like I say, any, you know, anytime we could, uh, you know, we could,

[01:33:44] we could, uh, could record something custom. We, we did a lot of that and, uh, you know, there were a

[01:33:50] number of recordings that we made over the years that, that yielded some very interesting results. I

[01:33:54] did a, uh, a session once that featured, um, a flock of about 50 pigeons, uh, that, that we knew

[01:34:02] hung out outside the recording studio, uh, that was owned by our friend of mine and, uh, we went out

[01:34:07] with a couple of his microphones and, uh, a bag of, a bird seed and we basically got these,

[01:34:13] these incredibly, you know, I'm, I suppose they're smart as they are, you know, but we got these birds

[01:34:18] to, to come down and sit on the sidewalk, you know, within a few feet of our microphone and I was

[01:34:23] able to just make a single gesture that was, that was completely silent just kind of wave my arms

[01:34:27] and raise my arms up and they would all fly away, you know, and it was just an incredible film.

[01:34:32] And, um, and, you know, I've used that sound in a number of, in a number of contexts, it's a,

[01:34:37] a real classic kind of an iconic sound of a, of a whole flock of birds flying away.

[01:34:44] You know, it was a very effective session and, uh, frankly, I haven't, you know, I was never

[01:34:48] able to, to find that very sound anywhere on a disc, so I, I went out and made my own and, and

[01:34:53] got a really good one. So, um, you know, there've been a number, you know, I've got a number of,

[01:34:57] of recordings of debris over the years. I've got a number of recordings of, of El Track,

[01:35:02] you know, uh, travel here in Chicago. We got the elevated trains and, uh, um, got a couple of

[01:35:06] nice, nice clips of that and, um, you know, there are things that are, you know, like I say,

[01:35:10] that are iconic or that you, you know, that if you've got the time to do it, it's just nice to,

[01:35:15] to do a custom, custom take. What about, uh, World Polkertour? Was there custom speech for that

[01:35:20] from the actors? There was, uh, all of the characters on the, um, you know, that make an appearance

[01:35:26] on the show, uh, spoke for us. Um, uh, the session was in Vegas. I went down. We did it all in one

[01:35:32] day. Um, you know, each of the three of them, uh, you know, came by the studio and, and, and did a

[01:35:36] set of, a set of set of lines. Um, uh, the, uh, the main, um, uh, play by play guys was the guy who

[01:35:43] did all of the, um, you know, all of the shoots and all of the, uh, uh, you know, the rankings of the

[01:35:48] cards and stuff like that. And, uh, we had to have to do it in very specific ways in order for us to,

[01:35:53] then have the game, um, you know, electro, uh, you know, electronically or, or, or, you know,

[01:35:59] algorithmically combine those phrases together to call out hands. And, uh, uh, that was, uh, that was,

[01:36:04] that was a fairly non-trip. You'll script to write. And then it was pretty, pretty tough session to

[01:36:09] actually deliver. But, uh, but the guy did a really nice job. And, uh, you know, like, I think that

[01:36:13] speech came off pretty well. Um, Keith Johnson had to do quite a bit of massaging, uh, to the,

[01:36:18] to the, to the playback program to get it to really come off in the game. But, uh, you know,

[01:36:22] we had good material to work with. And, and I think it worked out pretty well. Now, what about the

[01:36:26] siren in fire? Uh, that was, um, uh, that was not, uh, that was synthesized. That was, you know,

[01:36:34] that was back in the yaw day. And, and, and, uh, that was one that we just, uh, you know, basically

[01:36:38] fired up the synthesizer and got something that sounded big with siren and like. And, uh, and that

[01:36:43] was just, you know, that was as good as it got, basically. I did want to want to say one other thing.

[01:36:48] I, I, we, uh, we started, sort of started to get into this a little bit yesterday. I just

[01:36:53] like to add this one thing. If it's a useful thing to you. And I just wanted to say that,

[01:36:56] that the music experience, you know, we, we talked about, you know, going from the Yamaha land of,

[01:37:01] of making, you know, synthesized noises and, and, and, you know, writing music in a similar

[01:37:05] language to, to writing music in our studios and working, you know, working with, with, uh, you

[01:37:11] know, with, with just any recording, you know, apparatus or, or, or sound making devices that you

[01:37:17] could, that you could find and, and, and getting that stuff into the end of the game.

[01:37:20] The first game, of course, that, that, that we used, actually used DCS-4 was, was Indiana Jones.

[01:37:26] Right. And, of course, we had, um, you know, and, and this never happened again. This was the

[01:37:31] best treatment that I've ever had from a licensed vendor. Although we've had very good treatment

[01:37:36] from, from many, um, this was just an unbelievable thing, music-wise. I received a box, you know,

[01:37:42] a big giant bankers file box that was full with about a foot's worth of legal sized,

[01:37:48] single-sided music score that was the original conductor's score from all three Indiana Jones

[01:37:56] movies. I mean, the score that the conductor used to conduct the orchestra for the movie,

[01:38:03] that actually was, you know, that, that actually was in, that was, was, you know, was released in

[01:38:08] the theaters and was on the video tapes that we have. Was there, man? Why? I can't even, I can't even

[01:38:13] begin to describe how unbelievably enlightening and educational that was as, as, as an experience for me,

[01:38:21] sit there and watch the movie and read the score as the movie was going by and, and just going,

[01:38:27] well, wait a minute, I gotta, I gotta hear that again and, and, and rewinding the tape and,

[01:38:30] and watching these scenes over and over and over again to just understand how he would orchestrate

[01:38:35] these musical effects. And I mean, I, I learned more about orchestration, you know, orchestral orchestration

[01:38:42] and instrumentation and how you got effects out of an orchestra and out of those instruments.

[01:38:47] I learned more in that, in that two-month period of doing that game than I ever did in school

[01:38:53] and that, or that I have since. I was, it was far and away the most, it was just this, this giant,

[01:38:58] giant leap forward for me and it was such an incredible experience. And I, you know, I, it would be,

[01:39:04] you know, my, a recap of my career and that this would be incomplete without that story, it was,

[01:39:09] it was just unbelievably cool thing to be able to do. And I'm so grateful for the people at Lucas

[01:39:15] Arts who sent us that music and, and then, you know, for, for everybody, just for the opportunity

[01:39:20] to be in that place and to be able to, you know, to go through there and, and, and, you know,

[01:39:24] take this snippet and that snippet from the movie score and, and, and turn it into, you know,

[01:39:29] pinball style loops and, and, and get it all to, to, you know, come out of it and, well, speaker

[01:39:33] in an interactive way, that was, it was, it was an honor and a privilege to work with that material,

[01:39:38] to work with John Williams' music and Herb Spencer's orchestration. It was just, it was an unbelievably

[01:39:43] enriching experience. So, you know, just wanted to kind of get that in a few, a few months.

[01:39:47] Very cool. Very cool. Did a lot of games get home-rom treatment from the sound perspective?

[01:39:53] Oh, well, you know, not really as much as you'd think, you know, there, you know, a couple of things

[01:39:57] like the fuck you asshole thing. That was kind of an obvious one, you know, but, um, you know, we,

[01:40:02] really, we really got as much into those runs as we possibly could and, and, you know, doing a

[01:40:06] home-rom was, uh, you know, with something where you just go, well, okay, I can put something

[01:40:10] different in, but what am I going to take out, you know, so, um, that was always a kind of,

[01:40:15] kind of a nifty thing. I said, I suppose there was a, you know, there were a few, but, um, you

[01:40:18] know, to be honest, I, I, um, you know, the only one that I can really reconstruct for sure was the,

[01:40:23] you know, was, was the one of the Terminator 2 pinball. Now, why did you end up leaving start?

[01:40:29] Well, I left, I ended up leaving the industries for, you know, for reasons that I think are, are

[01:40:33] pretty complicated. And, you know, there's certainly, there was a, um, you know, there was an

[01:40:36] economic reason involved, there was a, uh, kind of a personal, um, you know, I guess you could maybe

[01:40:42] call it a spiritual focus that was kind of coming around for me to, and something that had been

[01:40:47] developing for a long time. There was a, uh, kind of an artistic focus, um, issue as well.

[01:40:53] But really, I think the biggest reason and the way that I can say this in the most clear,

[01:40:57] clearly is that I needed to make a big change in my life. I just needed to do something

[01:41:03] transformational. And, um, I had this opportunity to work for this particular firm, uh, because of

[01:41:09] some family connections. And, um, because that opportunity was there for me, I just decided to take it.

[01:41:14] So now you're like a financial advisor or something? That's right. Yeah. And how is that working out for you?

[01:41:19] One, and, and small business and family, uh, you know, financial advice and, uh, you know, financial

[01:41:24] planning and, and, uh, retirement planning and state planning and things like that. Is that

[01:41:28] working out okay for you? Working out great. Yeah. I'm very happy guy. Do you miss the sound thing?

[01:41:34] Excuse me? Do you miss, you know, the sound, the pinball sound, you know, the, the, you know,

[01:41:39] working for pinball sound. Sometimes I do, there are certain characters. I, you know, I, um, you know,

[01:41:44] uh, you know, there are certain people, you know, Lonnie Rocket pinball. He was, he was a great guy

[01:41:48] to work with. Uh, Dwight Sullivan, another guy that I, that I, you know, really enjoyed having,

[01:41:53] you know, very, uh, detailed and, and, and elaborate conversations with Keith Johnson, of course,

[01:41:58] just a tremendous, uh, talent. All the guys at Stern really, you know, Steve Richie's been,

[01:42:03] you know, was a, was a great designer and, um, you know, Dennis Norman was just arriving there when I

[01:42:07] was leaving. I was, I was disappointed not to get a chance to really work very closely with Dennis.

[01:42:12] But, uh, you know, those guys are, are, you know, um, I, I certainly remember them very finally and,

[01:42:17] uh, um, you know, and I certainly miss those guys. I, I honestly don't, don't miss doing it for,

[01:42:22] for a living anymore. I, I, I have a, um, you know, I have a trio that I play with that way,

[01:42:27] that I really do enjoy a lot. And I have a, um, uh, uh, you know, various opportunities to play

[01:42:33] music at church and things like that these days that I, um, that I enjoy very much. And so I've got

[01:42:37] a couple of personal contexts where I do still, you know, I still have a musical opportunities. And, uh,

[01:42:42] and that's more than enough for me. I'm much happier as a, as a professional financial guy and

[01:42:46] an amateur musician than I was the other way around. So, um, yeah, it's worked out really well.

[01:42:51] I hate to say this, but I've come to an event where I, I need to, I, I need to tear myself away

[01:42:56] here. Um, it's been a real pleasure talking to you though. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry for holding you up,

[01:43:00] Chris. I really, really appreciate the call and the time. Like you've got a great sight there.

[01:43:04] And, uh, you know, good work with it. Have a great day. All right, take care.

[01:43:08] Bye-bye. I like to thank Chris Granger for joining us tonight on Topcast. Really do appreciate

[01:43:14] his time. It was great hearing from him and how Chris developed the sound for these, these

[01:43:19] incredible pinball games on on these different sound platforms. Really good hearing from him.

[01:43:24] And I hope you all come back and hear us again on Topcast.
