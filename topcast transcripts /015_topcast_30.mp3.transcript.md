[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:21] Today on Topcast we have a really, really special guest.

[00:26] This is a gentleman that worked for Gottlieb since before World War II until 1980.

[00:34] And he designed some of the most famous Gottlieb pinball machines of all time.

[00:41] From approximately 1949 up to 1965 he designed basically all their games.

[00:49] Been working in pinball since the 1930s and I'm really, really proud to have them on the show.

[00:56] Special guest.

[01:01] I'd like to welcome Wayne Nions of Gottlieb.

[01:05] He started out in the late 1930s with Western and then went to Gottlieb.

[01:11] He designed nearly 200 games for Gottlieb and let's talk to Wayne Nions right now, the game designer for Gottlieb.

[01:26] You're right on time.

[01:34] Hard to believe.

[01:36] Hard to believe.

[01:37] Tell me about when you started getting involved with pinball in your life.

[01:41] Started in the business in 1936.

[01:45] At Gottlieb?

[01:46] I don't know.

[01:47] I had a company called Western Equipment and Supply Company.

[01:50] Okay.

[01:51] Oh yeah, yeah.

[01:52] I heard Western they made some great baseballs.

[01:55] Yeah, we made a great baseball game.

[01:58] In fact, that's the only thing that kept you and Johnson going, you know, as that baseball game.

[02:05] And we had actually two baseball games.

[02:08] The first one didn't work too well and it almost put them out of business.

[02:13] It bankrupted them and then three of us fell as there.

[02:18] There was Don Anderson and myself and follow my name

[02:23] of the Emil Goodman.

[02:27] And Emil Goodman was an electrical man and Don, he was just all around guy and of course me,

[02:34] I was just an all around guy too.

[02:37] You know, this, but you go back a little further than that in 1936 when I started there,

[02:43] I started on February 11th, 1936.

[02:45] And I didn't know a pinball machine from anything, you know.

[02:49] I'd never even seen one.

[02:51] Well, how did you get in the Jimmy needed a, a, a, a draftsman and he,

[02:59] he said, he called up Crane Technical High School where I happen to be going to high school.

[03:05] And this, now this in 1936, this is in the middle of the depression.

[03:09] I mean, things were tough.

[03:10] Jobs were hard to get.

[03:12] And, you know, and they sent us notice around the high schools and for a draftsman.

[03:18] I was pretty good at drafting, so I went and I answered the, the ad and got hired.

[03:25] And I got hired on February 11th, 1936.

[03:29] Were they teaching drafts that drafting in your high school at that time?

[03:34] Or you knew?

[03:35] Oh, yes.

[03:35] So, teaching, I was at, I went to Crane Technical High School in Chicago, which is a very,

[03:43] very good technical school.

[03:45] It was a long way from my home.

[03:47] I had to take the street car there.

[03:48] It's about 10 miles from my home, but I go every day.

[03:54] And I was very good at drafting.

[03:57] My best subject, really.

[04:00] And they taught us electrical work, forage, radio,

[04:06] a little, a little of everything along with other subjects.

[04:09] And, anyway, that's how I happened to get to Western.

[04:16] And, of course, very fortunate.

[04:19] And then, my first job was to draw a payout unit.

[04:26] And they had the unit there, and I had to just put it on paper.

[04:30] And my boss, at the time, was Lynn Durant.

[04:34] You heard of Lynn Durant, I'm sure.

[04:36] Of course, you started United.

[04:37] Sure.

[04:38] Lynn Durant worked the engineer on his own work.

[04:41] That we were working on.

[04:42] And he was my boss.

[04:44] And he was just a young man, of course, at that time.

[04:47] He was probably, I don't know how old he was, but he seemed like an old man,

[04:52] but he's probably 25 years old, because I was 17.

[04:56] And so he gave me the job to do.

[05:00] And I did the job for him.

[05:02] Got to know him very well.

[05:04] And I'll tell you, if Lynn Durant had started United, you know, when I left Western,

[05:14] I would have went with him, because we were friends, you know.

[05:20] But he was, at that time, designing, I think, with Harry Williams over at Exhibit.

[05:27] And so he was over there, and, of course, I needed a job.

[05:34] I was working in Western.

[05:35] I'll give you a little story.

[05:36] I want a little story on it.

[05:37] Yeah, I definitely want a little story.

[05:39] Well, Jimmy went bankrupt twice.

[05:43] And both times he kept me on.

[05:46] Well, first of all, I was going back a little further.

[05:49] When I was drafting, that was fine after school.

[05:53] I worked about three or four hours a night and Saturday.

[05:56] But then when I graduated from high school, and I wanted a full-time job,

[06:01] Jimmy Johnson told me, we can't keep you on full-time.

[06:04] We don't have that much drafting to do.

[06:06] But you can work part-time drafting.

[06:08] I said, oh, no, that won't do.

[06:10] I won't have that.

[06:11] And I said, can't you give me a job in the shop?

[06:14] Can I work down in the shop?

[06:16] Which is the best thing that ever happened.

[06:18] Because they gave me a job in the shop.

[06:20] And I filled in all over.

[06:22] I ran cables.

[06:24] I soldered.

[06:24] I ran a punch press.

[06:26] I did everything.

[06:28] And by doing that, I learned the whole trade.

[06:32] And then at that time, games were just changing over to PowerPacks.

[06:38] Before that, they were all battery-operated games.

[06:44] So they'd send these games in.

[06:47] These operators are bringing the games in.

[06:49] And I would work on them and take PowerPacks out.

[06:53] Or take the batteries out and put PowerPacks on them.

[06:57] And those kind of things.

[06:58] So I learned the pinball business pretty thoroughly.

[07:01] So a PowerPack was essentially a transformer.

[07:05] But a transformer with a rectifier.

[07:07] Oh, because it was running on DC.

[07:09] Running on DC, yeah.

[07:10] Okay.

[07:11] And of course, you know, the operators were scared to death

[07:13] at games at that time because they weren't used to

[07:16] plugging it into the wall.

[07:17] Guys, that was the dangerous thing.

[07:19] But when he went bankrupt,

[07:21] and he kept me on and Don Anderson and Emil Goodman,

[07:26] and we built the, we built the baseball game.

[07:29] And that was his successful game.

[07:32] And he got really going on that and we did real well.

[07:34] And then I got put on the,

[07:39] ended up doing final inspection work.

[07:42] And I was a final inspector.

[07:44] And I was in charge of the whole line.

[07:45] I was only 18 years old.

[07:47] Now, on the baseball, you mean Western's Deluxe Baseball.

[07:51] Kind of was a squareish cabinet.

[07:53] Yeah, it was a square cabinet.

[07:55] Right, right.

[07:56] Kind of almost had a jukeboxish type look to it more kind of.

[08:00] Yeah, I did.

[08:01] And you know,

[08:05] see, somebody had a show here not too long ago.

[08:09] I think,

[08:11] Rob had one, I think it was.

[08:14] Yeah, and the front drawer in it,

[08:16] it had like a drawer that you pulled out.

[08:18] Yeah, you pulled the drawer out.

[08:19] That's right.

[08:20] Like a filing cabinet drawer.

[08:21] Yeah.

[08:22] And that's where all the lecture mechanical stuff was.

[08:25] That's where it was.

[08:26] Yeah, that's, that was really unique.

[08:27] I, I never seen a game that did that.

[08:29] The relay bank was on the right hand side.

[08:32] You know, I can remember that as if it was yesterday.

[08:35] A lot of things I can't remember,

[08:36] but some things that happened in Western,

[08:38] I can remember very clearly.

[08:40] I'll tell you a little interesting thing to happen at Western.

[08:44] You know, at that time, there were no free play,

[08:47] free play was not known.

[08:49] And Jimmy bought the patent

[08:53] to the free game, the push shoot.

[08:56] That, you know, you can push it in,

[08:59] you put a nickel and you push it in,

[09:00] or you can push a, hold a lever on the bottom of it and push it in.

[09:04] That was a free play coin shoot.

[09:06] And he bought the, the, the rights to that coin shoot.

[09:10] And he didn't know what to do with it.

[09:11] Nobody knew what a free play was,

[09:13] or how to use it, how to make a novelty game.

[09:16] And Harry matches there at the time.

[09:18] And he was trying, you know, and so on.

[09:21] But they didn't have a free play unit.

[09:24] They didn't know what a free play unit was.

[09:27] So I made one for them, you know, just as a kid, you know,

[09:30] I made it up.

[09:31] And I took it up and showed it to Jimmy and Jimmy,

[09:33] who wowed, is it work and I sure it'll work.

[09:36] And we'll put it in the game.

[09:37] So I did.

[09:39] And it worked fine.

[09:40] And so he called up,

[09:43] see who that was at the time.

[09:46] A, B, T or something.

[09:47] A, M, laboratory.

[09:48] Okay.

[09:49] And GM laboratory came over and they bought the rights to the

[09:53] my free play unit.

[09:54] They gave me a check for $50.

[09:57] With that was a lot of money back then.

[09:59] I assume it was a lot of money.

[10:01] That was a lot of money.

[10:02] That was on October the 5th,

[10:04] 1937.

[10:06] And what did Jimmy say?

[10:08] He was a thrilled, you know.

[10:11] Did he get a piece of that?

[10:12] Did he get a piece of that?

[10:13] Did he have the, now he knew how to, how to make a game,

[10:16] how to make a,

[10:18] a free play game of an amusement device.

[10:21] Well, did he get a piece of that,

[10:22] that licensing as it was?

[10:24] No, I didn't get nothing, but the $50.

[10:28] You know, if I had a piece of it, I'd be a rich man today.

[10:33] That's pretty good.

[10:34] All right, so how long were you at Western for?

[10:36] I stayed there until 39.

[10:39] Okay.

[10:39] In 1939, I was a final inspector in the line.

[10:44] And I was making a nickel in our less

[10:48] than the man working next to me.

[10:51] And that man's name was Tony Birdall.

[10:54] I'll never forget him.

[10:55] And he used to rip the delivered daylights out of me

[10:57] because he was making more than I made.

[11:00] And so I told Jimmy, I said,

[11:02] I want to talk to you about money.

[11:04] And he said, okay, come up the office.

[11:05] So I went up.

[11:07] And then he said, now we talk.

[11:08] And he said, okay, I'll give you,

[11:10] I'll give you two and a half cents.

[11:11] And now we're more.

[11:15] I said, okay, Jimmy, that's great.

[11:17] So I went down to my working spot at the end of the line.

[11:20] I picked up my tools, my toolbox, and I walked out the door.

[11:23] I was two, one o'clock in the afternoon.

[11:26] I worked here.

[11:28] On the street car.

[11:29] You agreed to or raised, but then you left?

[11:32] I left.

[11:32] Two and a half cents he gave me.

[11:34] So you that was an insult?

[11:36] That was an insult.

[11:37] That was an insult.

[11:38] Because now I'm still making a lesson.

[11:40] The guy's working under me.

[11:42] Oh, under me.

[11:43] So I get on the street car and I'm going home.

[11:45] And I go past Jen Cole.

[11:48] I knew guys that work at Jen Cole.

[11:51] And we were kids, you know, we used to play baseball.

[11:54] We had a baseball league.

[11:55] So I got to know a lot of the kids.

[11:56] And anyway, I go over, I'm going past Jen Cole.

[11:59] And I get off the street car and at the mercy.

[12:02] And Gottlieb is two blocks west.

[12:04] And Jake goes two blocks back.

[12:06] So I, well, with the heck, I go over to Gottlieb.

[12:09] Within a half hour, I was testing play boards

[12:11] in the Gottlieb play board line.

[12:12] And did you get the pay increase that you wanted to?

[12:15] I got ten cents an hour more than I was making it Gottlieb.

[12:18] Are you mean a western?

[12:20] That western, yeah.

[12:22] Sent an hour more.

[12:23] So now when you left western, did you say maps?

[12:27] Where was maps at?

[12:28] At maps that go on to Gottlieb.

[12:30] So he was already there.

[12:31] He was already at Gottlieb.

[12:32] And that's the reason why when I stood in the corner

[12:34] debating which way to go, I knew Harry.

[12:37] And see Harry had a son,

[12:39] by name of Bud, Budmaps.

[12:42] And Budmaps and I were of the same age.

[12:45] And Budmaps worked at Western along with me.

[12:49] And him and I used to horse around a lot.

[12:51] And we go out dating at night, you know.

[12:54] And him and I and Harry liked me to go along with Bud

[12:57] because Bud was a little bit of a wild character.

[13:01] And I was a little, I was a good influence on him.

[13:05] And so Harry always liked me to go out with Bud.

[13:09] And so Harry and I became friends too, you know.

[13:13] And so when Harry was at Gottlieb, I said,

[13:15] well, I'll go over there.

[13:16] So I did and I got a job and I'm testing play boards.

[13:21] And then of course I could do anything in the shop.

[13:23] I knew everything about the game.

[13:26] And now did you even talk to the people at Gento at all?

[13:29] Or did you do it?

[13:30] I never went in the building.

[13:32] Now see if I had gone in a jenkel, that's a quartet.

[13:36] Quartet, yeah.

[13:37] I would have been with Quartet him and the other guys, you know.

[13:41] But I didn't know Quartet at the time.

[13:44] But I knew other kids because we had this baseball league of the manufacturers.

[13:50] There were a lot of manufacturers at that time.

[13:52] And I used to play baseball and I played on the Western team.

[13:56] So I got to know these guys and you know everybody kind of knew everybody.

[14:00] So you didn't know Steve Cordack and you didn't know Harvey Heist at the time?

[14:05] I didn't know them.

[14:06] You didn't know them.

[14:07] So I was the easy way to go over to Gottlieb because you knew somebody over there.

[14:11] That's right.

[14:12] Okay, very cool.

[14:13] So now what year was this that you started at Gottlieb?

[14:17] 39.

[14:18] 39.

[14:19] So I start there on, well, I see it was in August, I think, 39.

[14:27] I see if I got it down recently.

[14:30] Yeah, I started at Gottlieb on September 1st, 1939.

[14:39] Now you were doing, you were testing the boards.

[14:42] I testing play boards, yeah.

[14:43] Right.

[14:44] Now how long was it before you started taking on more responsibility?

[14:48] Well, I did that for about a month, maybe more or less, not more, maybe about a month.

[14:56] And we had a problem with one of the games, I know which

[15:03] that game was building at the time.

[15:04] And we shipped out the message games to New York and they had an error and they needed

[15:10] a circuit change.

[15:13] They had no one to extend.

[15:15] So they picked me, which is very nice.

[15:18] Of course Dave and I got to know Dave very well in that month.

[15:23] And anyway, he sent me to New York.

[15:26] So I got rid of my job into play board line and lost my job in a play board line, I might say.

[15:33] And I went to New York and I worked there for about two, three weeks.

[15:38] And then I came back and of course they had a fine job for me now, you know,

[15:42] somebody else was doing the play boards.

[15:44] And so I got put in the engineering room and I started working in there and

[15:49] and one thing led to another, you know.

[15:52] Now was that where Harry was working to Harry Mab's?

[15:54] Well, he was in the design room at which it was adjacent to the engineering room.

[15:59] So was was Harry designing games at that time?

[16:01] Oh yes, yeah.

[16:02] He was the only game designer they had at that time.

[16:05] So he kind of got into that position rather quickly then?

[16:08] Well, he was doing design over at Western too.

[16:11] Oh, okay.

[16:13] That's what he was primarily a designer and then of course he,

[16:17] that was a crazy place at Western.

[16:20] It was constantly in a state of flux that just, I don't really,

[16:27] they kept changing positions all the time.

[16:29] Harry was a designer supposedly, but then he became the factory foreman and he ran the factory

[16:36] for a while. And of course, but not our work in under him and we out of ball him and I,

[16:43] but he did all kinds of things over there and then when they went bankrupt,

[16:48] why he laid everybody off and then Harry went and he got tired of that being laid off and

[16:54] and he went over to Gottlieb and then got a job as a designer and did very well over there.

[16:59] And he was well liked.

[17:00] The Harry was a very likable person and he did very well over there and of course him and I,

[17:10] I did a lot of work for Harry at that time.

[17:12] He was a great idea man.

[17:14] He had ideas coming out as mind all the time and he didn't like to turn the crank,

[17:23] he didn't like to draw the circuit up and he didn't like to wire the game up and those

[17:29] kind of things were below him.

[17:31] You know, he had another idea that he wanted to work on and that's what made him so good.

[17:38] He was so many ideas going all the time that he was a great, great designer.

[17:44] Now, when World War II broke out, how did everything change?

[17:49] Well, everything stopped in the industry of course.

[17:53] And a lot of some people like Durant and Williams got together, I guess you know of that story.

[18:01] Well, I like you.

[18:03] A little company that rebuilt games.

[18:07] They bought old games and they stripped them down, take the wires and stretch them out and

[18:12] bundle them up into colors and so forth and they realized they'd take apart and clean them and

[18:16] so it had built new games from that.

[18:20] That's what they did during the war.

[18:22] But God leave itself, they went into war work.

[18:26] They did a lot of tool and die making.

[18:29] They operated, they did a lot of punch press work.

[18:33] You know that machine shop type of thing.

[18:37] Right.

[18:38] Right.

[18:38] Now, I heard a story and I don't know if it's true, but a story that Durant and Williams,

[18:46] you know, they were in business together during the war and then after the war,

[18:51] they had some sort of, you know, they split off.

[18:54] Of course Durant went to United, became United Manufacturing and Harry Williams became,

[18:59] of course, Williams.

[19:00] Yeah.

[19:01] I heard that what caused them to really split up was that they were fighting over a woman.

[19:11] Well, I mean, is there any truth to that story?

[19:14] I never heard that, but it could be.

[19:19] That's what someone told me.

[19:20] It's only that they flipped a coin to see who got the gal.

[19:27] And the guy that got the gal had to leave the company.

[19:33] Well, you know, that sounds like Durant.

[19:36] I don't sound like Williams, but it sounds like Durant.

[19:39] So it could be or could not be.

[19:41] So I tell you, see Durant was married when I knew him.

[19:45] And his wife was very sick and she eventually died.

[19:51] And he was really taken, took it hard.

[19:55] He really loved that woman.

[19:58] And when she died, all the time she was sick,

[20:04] she was lingered for months and months and months and all that time I knew him.

[20:09] And he was excited himself with this terrible thing going on.

[20:15] So, but of course later on he became quite a man about town.

[20:22] I can't believe the story, but I can't verify it.

[20:24] Okay, I just care.

[20:25] Yeah, and I heard that Harry won.

[20:28] Harry Williams won.

[20:29] And he had to leave United.

[20:31] And of course, that's what started Williams.

[20:34] Well, it could be, but I wouldn't.

[20:37] I might just be Fishhockey, who knows.

[20:39] Yeah, it could be anything, you know.

[20:42] So now, after the war,

[20:45] well, just to kind of back up a little bit, how big was Gottlie compared to like Western?

[20:50] Was it a bigger company?

[20:51] Yeah, so it was bigger than Western.

[20:52] Yeah, Western was a very small company.

[20:57] We had, oh, I'd say, we went all the way from three people working in the factory to,

[21:06] I would say 200 maybe at Mac.

[21:12] That's maybe not that.

[21:13] Maybe 100 be Mac.

[21:15] Because it wasn't that big a factory.

[21:17] Now, what about Gottlie?

[21:19] Well, Gottlie was a little larger, I'd say twice as large as Western.

[21:25] Now, after the war, how long was it before you guys were making, you know,

[21:30] pin games again?

[21:31] We were making pin games right away, right away.

[21:35] After the war, I was in the war.

[21:37] I went, I was in the Air Force and stationed out in Maine, as a matter of fact, most of the time.

[21:49] After the war, the war ended in Japan.

[21:55] I got to leave.

[21:56] I came home.

[21:57] And of course, you know, you always go back to factory and see who's around, who's there.

[22:02] I went back and our superintendent, the name was Tony Gerard at the time,

[22:08] brought me in the office and all, and Dave came in and everybody in there,

[22:13] they're talking as well.

[22:14] When you're going to get out, when you're coming back, you know, and all that,

[22:17] how do I know it?

[22:18] You know, they're slow and getting out.

[22:22] It'll be a while, I'm afraid, but Tony says, well, we'll see what we can do for you.

[22:27] And I'll take care of it, you know.

[22:30] I could outtake care of this.

[22:32] And within two weeks, I was out.

[22:35] Got out of service.

[22:36] And they were happy to have you back.

[22:37] Oh, yeah. And I went back and I said, well, you know, I got to have, I'm coming to work

[22:43] right away now, but I got to have two weeks off in the summer time because I'm going to get married.

[22:50] And I need a couple of weeks off.

[22:52] It's like, okay, take any two weeks you want.

[22:55] I said, okay, you got to deal.

[22:58] And I went back to work.

[22:59] And of course, and gradually, all the guys came back.

[23:02] Most of them, we lost a few people in the war.

[23:06] But most of them came back and we started up again.

[23:08] And I think the first game was kind of a carry-over stage-door canteen was the first game after the war.

[23:16] And I think we had the game left over from before.

[23:20] Harry, Harry Mabbs, he went down to Texas during the war.

[23:24] And he ran a route of the fitting game route.

[23:32] And I guess that did fairly well at it.

[23:34] But of course, he wanted to get back into the factory and the designing and the guys.

[23:40] So he came back and start designing again.

[23:43] And we took off and we had quite a run for men on.

[23:48] Now, Harry was pretty much the primary game designer at the time, right, Harry Mabbs.

[23:54] He was the designer, yes.

[23:56] So, and then in late 47, of course, his invention, the flipper,

[24:04] as seen on Humpty Dumpty, came out.

[24:06] Yes.

[24:07] I mean, was that like a giant kick of the pants for Galleib?

[24:11] Oh, yes.

[24:13] It sure was.

[24:16] It enabled the game, the thin game, to become an amusement device.

[24:22] Before that, no one knew how to really make an amusement device.

[24:27] Wasn't any fun to play.

[24:28] You go, you shot a ball and oh, yeah, there was a little fun to it.

[24:32] But the flipper, that made the game.

[24:38] The industry changed overnight.

[24:40] And to lend a rant at that time is a little interesting story.

[24:44] He said he would never put a flipper on a pinball machine.

[24:48] He obviously changed his mind with that.

[24:50] He changed his mind within a couple of months because he couldn't sell anything.

[24:53] Right.

[24:54] Right.

[24:54] Right. Now, so the flipper came out.

[24:57] Now, why didn't Galleib patten that?

[25:00] Well, I'll tell you why.

[25:03] Dave Gottlieb said that what's good for the industry is good for Galleib.

[25:09] And he believed in that.

[25:12] And he didn't patten, he pattened very little.

[25:14] In fact, there's only one thing that I know for sure that he pattened.

[25:18] And that was something that was my bumper switch.

[25:21] You know that the silver point that operates the bumper circuit?

[25:26] You talking about like on a pop-up or there's any angle kickers.

[25:31] On all the bumpers.

[25:32] No.

[25:32] Oh, okay.

[25:33] It used to be a carbon ring with a peg in it.

[25:37] Right.

[25:37] I hate those things.

[25:38] Yeah, they were a disaster.

[25:40] And can you imagine that on a pop-up?

[25:42] Yeah, it was awful because Williams used that carbon ring well into the 50s.

[25:48] And whenever I work on those games, I hate them.

[25:50] I always convert them over to Galleib.

[25:52] The spoons.

[25:52] Yeah.

[25:53] Well, I designed the, and I have the patent on that switch.

[25:57] The spoons switch?

[25:58] And on that switch, under the bumper, I have a patent on that switch.

[26:02] Now, eventually though, Williams went to that.

[26:06] Everybody went to it.

[26:07] Yeah.

[26:08] So what happened to the patent expired or something?

[26:10] Oh, no, no.

[26:10] We just didn't care.

[26:12] We told him, Galleib used to tell him,

[26:15] what's good for the industry is good for me and what you do is good for us will get long.

[26:20] And he was that way.

[26:21] He didn't care.

[26:22] Huh.

[26:23] He didn't care, you know?

[26:24] Right.

[26:24] Well, that's pretty friendly business practice.

[26:27] Yes, he was.

[26:27] Dave was a gentleman.

[26:29] I'll tell you that.

[26:32] I knew Dave very, very, very well.

[26:35] Now, on the internet pinball database,

[26:40] the first game in 1949 that's credited for you as the designer is college days.

[26:46] Yeah, that's right.

[26:47] Now, how did you step up to be in a game designer?

[26:51] Well, I tell you, at that time, I was building test fixtures for the factory.

[26:58] Every time a game came out, my job was to build three test fixtures for the bottom line and

[27:04] three for the playboard line and three for the light box line.

[27:08] That was my job.

[27:10] So I would hustle along and get that job done in a hurry.

[27:14] I get, if we ran, say we ran a month, I could build test fixtures for the next game and maybe

[27:21] two weeks.

[27:22] You know, and I had two weeks, I had nothing to do.

[27:25] So I'd go out and shoot trouble in the shop, but that was all.

[27:29] But then I, what I did, I got a cabinet and a playboard and I started to make my own game,

[27:35] just to keep myself busy.

[27:37] And I made college days and I'd say it took maybe a year, you know,

[27:44] which I only worked on it when I had time.

[27:46] Which is a long time, a year's a long time at that.

[27:48] I mean, you know, it was like a three or four-week game development period.

[27:54] Yeah, so I only worked maybe an hour here and an hour there, two, three hours, wherever,

[27:58] wherever I could fill it in.

[27:59] I would design the game.

[28:01] So when you showed it to, I assume you showed it to David and Harry,

[28:06] what was, what was their reaction?

[28:08] Well, they liked it, you know.

[28:10] In fact, the college days did very well.

[28:13] That was a very good game.

[28:14] Yeah, you sold 2230 of them, which is...

[28:19] That was a good run.

[28:20] Yeah, that was a really good run.

[28:22] I mean, compared to the production of games after that, you know,

[28:26] everything's like a thousand or less.

[28:29] And here, you more than double that.

[28:31] That was a pretty good game.

[28:32] And, you know, that started me and then I built another game.

[28:36] I think it was Basketball.

[28:37] Yeah, Basketball was your next one.

[28:39] And then Casey Jones.

[28:40] Yep.

[28:42] Those were just, you know, just my film work.

[28:47] And of course, Dave loved it, you know, and Harry loved it too.

[28:52] He liked me and he encouraged me too.

[28:58] So we were friends.

[29:00] We visit back, in fact, he lived not too far from me.

[29:02] And we visit back and forth in our pre-time, Sunday's batteries.

[29:09] But, um...

[29:11] But, I started, and then of course, Harry left,

[29:14] went back over to Williams.

[29:16] And Dave came to me and he said,

[29:18] Wayne, you have full time designer go over in that room and get busy.

[29:23] And I did.

[29:24] Okay, now, in 19, around 1949, also the pop bumper was invented too.

[29:32] What's that?

[29:32] The pop bumper, you know, the...

[29:34] The pop bumper, yeah.

[29:35] Yeah, now, who invented that?

[29:38] That was designed by Charlie Castaker.

[29:43] Okay.

[29:44] You ever hear the name?

[29:45] No, never.

[29:46] Well, Charlie Castaker was the supplier for plastics for the whole industry.

[29:54] His company was American molded products, I believe it was.

[30:00] American molded products.

[30:02] And he made two kinds of pop bumpers.

[30:07] One, as you know it today.

[30:11] And one was a little different.

[30:12] It was a...

[30:17] A wire wound spring.

[30:19] That was about...

[30:20] Oh, I would guess half-inch in diameter, maybe...

[30:27] maybe five-h in diameter.

[30:29] And it circled the bumper as a color.

[30:33] And then there was a...

[30:35] Inside of that was a...

[30:39] lever, I guess you'd call it, which pulled down against that spring and pushed outwards.

[30:44] The spring would expand and hit the bumper, hit the ball and go outwards.

[30:49] And he had the two versions.

[30:51] And he gave us each one.

[30:54] He gave all the companies both versions.

[30:58] And we put it on playboards, we fooled around with it.

[31:02] And I think we all

[31:05] agreed that the one we came out with, that we finally used was the right one.

[31:10] And so he was the designer of it.

[31:14] And who did he work for?

[31:15] He worked for the plastic company?

[31:17] He owned the plastic company.

[31:18] Oh, he owned it.

[31:19] Now he owned it.

[31:20] That was Charlie Castaker.

[31:21] And he basically marketed this to all the companies.

[31:25] He marketed to all the companies, right?

[31:27] It's pretty smart on his point.

[31:28] In fact, he started out.

[31:29] Charlie was a salesman for a spring company.

[31:36] Now we're talking back in 1936-37.

[31:39] He was a salesman.

[31:41] And he found out about plastic.

[31:44] Now plastics were just coming out in 1936.

[31:48] There was no plastic before that.

[31:50] So he made a little molding machine.

[31:53] And he made a post.

[31:56] And he brought it around.

[31:57] I remember him bringing it to Western.

[31:59] And he wanted to sell it.

[32:01] And so that's the first time we put it on the game was back in about 37.

[32:05] I guess you start putting it on the game.

[32:06] 37.38.

[32:08] It was a plastic then.

[32:09] We're not like they are today.

[32:11] They were poor plastics.

[32:13] They were shrink.

[32:15] You put a screw into the board to screw that post down.

[32:18] And a month later it would be loose because the plastic

[32:23] would shrink.

[32:26] It would try to go back to its original shape.

[32:28] I guess it's a glob.

[32:30] So he came along ways in the business.

[32:34] And this was the first company that supplied the plastic parts.

[32:40] For a lot of people.

[32:41] And he was doing like the injection molded style plastics.

[32:44] Right?

[32:45] Pardon?

[32:45] He was doing like that.

[32:46] You're talking about injection molded style.

[32:48] That's injection molding.

[32:50] Right.

[32:50] Right.

[32:50] Okay.

[32:51] Gotcha.

[32:52] Gotcha.

[32:52] Okay.

[32:52] So now in mid 51, Harry left Gottlieb and went to Williams.

[32:59] Harry Bans.

[33:01] Now why did he do that?

[33:03] Why would he leave Gottlieb?

[33:05] Well, that's a good question.

[33:09] And I really don't know the real answer.

[33:13] But I've heard a lot of rumors.

[33:16] One of them was that he went to Dave and wanted money.

[33:20] And see, this was shortly after the flipper.

[33:23] And Harry thought he should have had a big bonus.

[33:28] A lot of money.

[33:29] And Dave was not that kind of a guy.

[33:32] He never gave you money like that.

[33:35] He took care of you at the end of the year.

[33:36] He always got a bonus.

[33:38] Not for any particular thing we did.

[33:41] On a daily basis.

[33:42] If you did something on a daily basis, that's part of your job.

[33:46] And I think I was there.

[33:51] I was designing.

[33:52] He knew I could design.

[33:54] And I was a kid.

[33:55] Well, I was more than a kid.

[33:56] I was in 41.

[34:02] 48, 49, I guess.

[34:04] I got up to 49.

[34:06] So I was 30 years old.

[34:12] But anyway, I was there.

[34:15] And Harry was getting pressure on him for money, I guess.

[34:18] And that's what I think.

[34:19] I'm not sure.

[34:21] But that's part of it.

[34:22] And I was there.

[34:23] And he had a nation of whole.

[34:25] I was the Asian whole.

[34:26] And of course, even though Harry left,

[34:30] and we were a little bit of a cloud,

[34:32] by Harry and I were still friends.

[34:34] And we still visited a little bit,

[34:36] not as much as we used to, because we were competitors.

[34:41] But we were still friends.

[34:45] That's how I could be a game of full-time designer.

[34:47] But he left.

[34:48] And I feel kind of responsible for it.

[34:51] If I wasn't there, they probably would have paid him.

[34:54] I don't know.

[34:57] Now, you did some really great games in this era too.

[35:02] And just before Harry maps left, and even just after he left,

[35:06] all in there, you had a run of some amazing games.

[35:09] Like, a couple that I really like are like Spot Bowler.

[35:14] That's one that I really enjoy.

[35:17] I think it's a great game.

[35:20] Happy Goal Lucky.

[35:20] That's another one.

[35:22] The big one that you did, that's like the all-time got-lead collectible.

[35:28] Probably not.

[35:28] It's certainly number one is Mermaid.

[35:31] Mermaid.

[35:32] Mermaid.

[35:33] Tell me about mermaid.

[35:35] Why did I do it go to Slate?

[35:36] Slick Chick.

[35:37] No, mermaid.

[35:39] Mermaid's where it's at.

[35:40] They know everybody has their favorite.

[35:42] Well, during the 50s, I think you could easily be said

[35:48] that mermaid is the most collectible got-lead single-player wood rail

[35:54] in that era, by far.

[35:56] And they're really hard to find because you didn't really make a lot of them.

[36:00] Oh, let's see.

[36:02] About 600 of them are self.

[36:04] 600, yeah.

[36:05] Yeah, and they had a course of mechanical animation in the back box.

[36:10] Where the fisherman's line pulls up.

[36:13] And that old fish.

[36:14] Yeah, the fish in the shoe.

[36:16] Yeah.

[36:17] Yeah, yeah.

[36:18] I know I still got that fish.

[36:22] I think I still have it.

[36:23] I mean, I give it as somebody I don't know, but I've had it in my toolbox for years and years.

[36:29] I may have given it to somebody now I'm thinking about it, but I've had it here for so long.

[36:34] Well, I've made a little fish, you know, and colored them and hung them in there.

[36:38] Yeah.

[36:39] Well, now tell me about mermaid.

[36:40] How did you come up with that design?

[36:43] I have no idea.

[36:45] No idea.

[36:46] That is very amazing.

[36:48] I don't think anyone ever said mermaid was so popular, right?

[36:53] Oh, yeah, it's big-time collectible.

[36:57] Everybody talks about slick chick.

[37:00] I mean, I own a slick chick and I own a mermaid.

[37:04] And I know which one I'd pick.

[37:06] And it is a slick chick.

[37:10] Yeah, no, I mean personal favorite.

[37:14] Queen of hearts.

[37:15] Oh, yeah, I was going to kind of come up to that one too.

[37:18] I was going to go kind of go through this chronologically and see if you had any stories

[37:25] about some of these games.

[37:26] Like, for instance, Rose Bowl.

[37:29] That was another one of your games.

[37:30] It's a fairly early game, you know.

[37:32] Yeah, 1951.

[37:34] Rose Bowl.

[37:36] Another good one from that era in 1951 again is Niagara.

[37:40] Oh, Niagara?

[37:41] I can tell you a story in Niagara.

[37:43] Yeah, tell me about Niagara.

[37:44] Great game.

[37:45] That was one of my favorite games.

[37:48] And so I took one home and had it in my basement for the kids to play with, you know.

[37:54] And what I do, what I used to do was not take a game off production line or nothing like that,

[38:00] but I would take the sample game and I'd take a new playboard and get a cabinet.

[38:08] I take a home and I transfer everything onto the new playboard and build it up.

[38:13] So I'd have a game.

[38:15] Yeah, because you're saying the engineering samples were basically...

[38:18] Yeah, I kind of engineering samples.

[38:20] Yeah, whitewoods with no graphics on them, right?

[38:22] Yeah, but I got the board from our cabinet company.

[38:26] You know, they sent me one over and I just have a screen and then I'd go and build it up.

[38:32] But my kids love that game.

[38:34] They played it constantly and the neighbor kids would come over and play it constantly.

[38:39] So I had a friend down the street who sold Encyclopedias.

[38:45] He was president of the San Pia,

[38:51] and he was a procanica.

[38:53] And he liked that game too.

[38:56] I tell you what I'll do when he said,

[38:58] I'll trade you a set of Encyclopedias for that game.

[39:01] So I sold the game to him and got the set of Encyclopedias.

[39:05] My kids wouldn't speak to me for about a month.

[39:07] They're mad at me, you know.

[39:09] They didn't like the Encyclopedias.

[39:11] They wanted that game back again.

[39:14] You still there?

[39:14] Yeah, I've listened to that.

[39:15] I think that's a great story.

[39:17] No, anyway, I got rid of that game.

[39:20] I had to get him a new one.

[39:21] So I got a different game for him.

[39:23] Now, Niagara was unique in that it was the first game to use trap holes.

[39:29] Yeah.

[39:29] Okay.

[39:30] Now, what was the thinking behind trap holes?

[39:33] Well, you know, tried to come up with something different.

[39:35] It was all.

[39:36] It wasn't the plan thing.

[39:40] And I wanted to, you know, it was a constant fight to make a game that played the right length of time.

[39:47] And if you wanted to close up the bottom to give a little better action,

[39:53] the game played too long.

[39:54] So you had to come up with something.

[39:56] And so I came up with those trap holes.

[39:59] And they were a lot of fun after a while.

[40:02] You got to your like them.

[40:04] And then, you know, to stay with the same subject,

[40:10] Queen of Hearts was a game that was the first game where the balls fell through it.

[40:17] You shot for the out-hole.

[40:19] Right.

[40:19] It was the first game with what we call gobble holes.

[40:22] Yeah, first gobble holes.

[40:23] Right.

[40:23] The trap hole and gobble holes.

[40:27] My thinking at that time was, could I possibly make a game where a player would take and shoot

[40:36] for the out-hole?

[40:38] You know, is that possible?

[40:40] And I made it and not believing it.

[40:43] I didn't believe it, you know, that you do it.

[40:45] I got it together and I played it and you know, it was still binding.

[40:51] I loved that game.

[40:52] And when I got through with it and it was okay for production and so forth and I had to go on

[40:58] to make another game, I couldn't do it.

[41:00] I said, I can't make another game.

[41:02] That game is the end of all games.

[41:05] It took me, I know, months to get over that game.

[41:08] I loved it.

[41:09] I loved to play it.

[41:11] And to this day, I still like that game.

[41:14] Oh, yeah.

[41:15] I have a Queen of Hearts and it's an amazing game.

[41:18] It's a great playing game and it has, yes, a lot of people complain about gobble holes.

[41:24] But the simple fact of gobble holes is that they reward you for a good shot

[41:31] and they take away for a bad shot.

[41:35] And it makes you a better player.

[41:38] You know, it just makes you a better player.

[41:40] You know, when it game, playing a game with gobble holes.

[41:44] Yeah, but the gobble hole has to mean something.

[41:47] It's got to mean, have a big meaning to it and that to me is the whole thing.

[41:55] And I love that game and I still do.

[41:57] A lot of people say, you know, the slick chick is a better game,

[42:00] but I'll tell you that Queen of Hearts is again, it's hard to beat.

[42:06] Now, when in like Queen of Hearts, when you put it

[42:10] a ball in each one of the holes, it represents part of the hand,

[42:16] the part of the card hand.

[42:17] Yeah.

[42:18] And if you get a ball in each one of the holes, you can win a lot of replace in that game.

[42:22] That's right.

[42:23] And you and Gottlieb had a replay unit that went up to 26 units.

[42:28] It had a maximum of 26 credits that you could have on the credit wheel.

[42:32] Now, did Dave Gottlieb or did anybody ever come up to you and say,

[42:38] you know, look, this is the maximum number of credits we want,

[42:42] any particular game to win or not win or whatever.

[42:45] How did you come up with that whole concept?

[42:48] Because you could win, you know, in one shot, you know,

[42:51] you could win a whole boatload of replays and just, you know, in one shot.

[42:56] Yeah, but that didn't happen very often.

[43:00] No, no, it didn't happen very often.

[43:02] But, you know, I mean, there was some, some games that it really was huge on,

[43:09] one I could think of is Sweet Adilite, where if you get all the rollovers

[43:15] and you're at zero credits and you hit every rollover,

[43:19] you win 26, that replay unit just keeps knocking off the knackered knocks

[43:25] and the replay unit kicks off a replay for all the way until that credits max switch is opened up,

[43:32] which is at 26 credits.

[43:34] Yeah.

[43:35] You know, that to me, that's pretty amazing that you could win 26 credits in one game.

[43:41] I'll tell you something about that Sweet Adilite.

[43:44] That game was taken from a bingled card.

[43:50] And you know, bingles was a dirty word at that time.

[43:53] Can you picture Sweet Adilite?

[43:55] Yeah, you're right.

[43:57] In the back glass, it's got a girl with an adding machine.

[44:01] And it's got like, yeah, it's got a bunch of numbers in it like off a tape coming out of

[44:07] an old-style adding machine.

[44:09] Well, you know, that's what it looks like, you see.

[44:12] But that was originally taken from a bingo card.

[44:16] Those numbers are all numbers from a bingo card.

[44:20] And if I had told Dave Gottlieb that that game was made from a bingo card, he would have thrown

[44:25] me out. He didn't like bingles.

[44:29] Yeah, because that was sweet Adilite.

[44:31] You pulled him, you know?

[44:32] Sweet Adilite was 1955.

[44:34] Happy days, which was 1952, the one with the school teacher and the kids on the back glass.

[44:42] That was the one of Parker's best pictures, best designs, wouldn't it?

[44:48] Yes.

[44:49] He outdid himself on that one.

[44:52] Oh yeah, yeah.

[44:52] I mean, the artwork on Happy Days is among the best of that of that era.

[44:57] That's for sure.

[44:58] Yeah, it's got kind of like a tic-tac-toe thing going on.

[45:01] I don't know, line was the biggest one was taken from a bingo card.

[45:04] Happy days, I don't recall that.

[45:07] I don't think I had anything to do with a bingo card.

[45:10] Okay.

[45:10] Now, tell me about the double award system and how that came up.

[45:19] Boy, oh boy.

[45:21] The double award.

[45:22] Yeah, well, you know, that was just a gimmick thrown in and I thought it was a pretty good idea.

[45:27] And we ran it for quite a while.

[45:30] And I don't know whether it made any money or not, but it was a gimmick, you know?

[45:34] That's all it was, it was a gimmick.

[45:36] And we had it for a while.

[45:39] I don't know if anyone ever used it.

[45:41] Yeah, just to explain, you put a single nickel in to play the game,

[45:45] but if you put two nickels in.

[45:47] If you put two nickels, you get twice the free plays.

[45:50] Right.

[45:50] Yeah, for that, that was just a gimmick and it lasted for a few games and that was all.

[45:56] I don't think anyone ever played it that way.

[45:58] It was, you know, a novelty game.

[46:00] Why would you put two nickels in?

[46:02] I don't know why I don't even know why I did it, you know, but it's just playing around, I guess.

[46:08] So that was your idea?

[46:09] Yeah, I have to lay claim to that.

[46:14] I'll tell you one thing that I don't think you've ever heard.

[46:17] Maybe you have four player games.

[46:20] Do we came out with a four player game?

[46:22] Right.

[46:23] In 1954 was the first four player.

[46:25] What was it?

[46:26] Super jumbo.

[46:27] Super jumbo, right.

[46:28] Well, I made super jumbo, of course, and we had a big show showing in our factory and we had

[46:37] all our distributors come in and look at it and of course they all cried, you know,

[46:40] so much money and all that.

[46:42] And anyway, we sold a few and then they kept crying about the money and so we went to two players.

[46:50] So we all alternated four players, four players, two players, and usually the weaker of the

[46:57] games that we thought was the weaker of the games, which meant nothing.

[47:00] You know, our opinion really just mean anything.

[47:03] We would make a two player.

[47:05] If we thought the game was really good, we'd make it a four player.

[47:08] And that's how it went.

[47:11] But after we were into it for maybe three or four or five years, I don't know how many years it was.

[47:18] I wanted to find out.

[47:20] My thought wasn't, I made the first four player was that if you could get four guys playing the game,

[47:27] one of them would win a free play.

[47:29] And if one of them won a free play, the other three couldn't walk away and leave them with that one

[47:33] free game. And they wouldn't walk away and leave it on the game on the machine. So they would

[47:38] stay up but some more nickels in. But I thought I wanted to find out just exactly what percentage

[47:47] of people played these games. How many were times there were four and how many times were three.

[47:52] So I sent out a game on location with meters. And I metered the play on that game for a long

[47:59] period of time, months. And I found out that the majority of the time, one player played.

[48:07] And a amount of times that four players were actually playing was very, very small

[48:12] percentage of the time. I don't have the figures anymore in my head, but I remember I was shocked

[48:19] that still had been a four player game generally one player played. And two was

[48:29] better than of course, three four players in a very seldom play. But still they

[48:34] ate one of four players in some location. So they got them.

[48:39] That doesn't surprise me at all actually. I mean, the two in the four player games,

[48:46] how often do you play four players? It just doesn't happen that often.

[48:51] No, it don't happen. But I tell you another thing, we built a six player game. And we called it

[48:58] high-boy. And it went as far as getting screened and actually built one game. And it was a tremendous

[49:07] light box. It was a bug. And what a circuit that was. That was something else. But that as far as

[49:14] it went, one game was built. It's called high-boy. And I always wondered, what happened to that game?

[49:19] Where's that game at today? What year do you think that was?

[49:24] Oh gosh, I don't know. Let's see. I'd say 1960 about.

[49:33] Now some of these other games were real, real popular. Like here's another one, Arabian Nights.

[49:40] Arabian Nights had a selector knob on the front of it where you could determine

[49:47] like how many of the gobble holes would light up. How many holes you had to hit to win?

[49:54] What was the thinking on that game? I have no idea. I can't remember the details on any game.

[50:02] Why I did a certain thing on a certain game? I can't remember that.

[50:05] Was there any other like, you know, some other ones just I wonder if it hit any memories,

[50:14] you know, like green pastures or mystic marble or Hawaiian beauty or Daisy May or Dragonat?

[50:22] Anything any any good memories? Do you ever see flying circus?

[50:29] I've never played that one. No. Do you ever see it? I don't think so. No.

[50:36] Well that game always intrigued. Are you familiar with all of it?

[50:42] Well, you're in it. The five balls trapped in a you shaped area right in the middle of the

[50:50] board and you had to get all five balls on one side to get a free play.

[50:56] Oh, oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yes. Yes.

[50:59] That game always intrigued me. And I tell you another game that I liked that it that was

[51:06] that could have been a better game than it was and that was lightning ball. There were three

[51:11] rubbers I think they were and if you hit them they would light up

[51:16] because the the area would light up under the plastic and you get all three of them lit then you

[51:21] got it it gave you an advance and work and the way it worked off the flipper you take the the

[51:27] right flipper and slip to the left side and with the crane off of the left bumper left rubber

[51:34] onto the center to the right side and then back onto the left flipper and then the left flipper

[51:40] would reverse it to go from the right right rubber to the center to the left to the back onto the

[51:47] the right flipper and I had it by original game was made with that line marking the

[51:56] path of that ball was a red line about a half inch into the am or a half inch wide

[52:03] maybe three eighths of an inch wide but quite a wide red line going from the right flipper to the left

[52:09] rubber to the center to the right rubber to the left flipper and then it was so pronounced that line

[52:18] that you could you could get good at that thing and you could hit that ball back and forth

[52:23] constantly well from I don't know I'd identify oh maybe ten twelve times without missing and I

[52:32] know the players could have done that and got a kick out of it got a real thrill out of it but

[52:37] in the artwork the the the the artist put in a parker put in a lightning strike in that path

[52:46] lightning strike and it was all all colors yellow red and blue and all kinds of colors and you know

[52:53] it lost it lost something I told them at the time I said you know that you've got to put a

[52:57] solid line in there and oh no no no we're not going to do that we're going to this is the way

[53:02] it's going to be in soy and I was okay but you're missing you're missing the point of the game

[53:07] and uh that that game could have been better game than it was but I still like lightning ball

[53:13] so as a as a game yeah it is a very good game it came out in 1959 uh it is you know it's a single

[53:20] player great great game it really is and I know the shot that you speak of too what do you

[53:25] remember about guys and dolls well you know it has that funky flipper post arrangement yeah yeah

[53:37] well I know we're trying to just trying to do something a little different you know I

[53:41] fool around one day came up for that idea and and uh unfortunately uh uh the uh we had a lot

[53:49] of trouble with those posts breaking off and uh and we found out that the plastic company used

[53:55] the wrong material on us when we when we were at the 80 order and so we we had quite a bit

[54:00] quite a few problems with that game so that was did you never try it again because of the plastic

[54:06] issue well we we didn't realize it first what happened you know and uh and then we found out that

[54:12] uh that uh they used the wrong material on us and uh when we got into production which was

[54:20] disaster you know so we never went back to it again and that you know I just had a bad bad

[54:25] feeling that's all when you made that game and it was brand new could you push get the ball to go

[54:30] from the you know from the bottom of the play field all the way to the top kind of like it had

[54:34] flippers or something no no you never question okay I was just kind of curious because that and when

[54:40] I played it it would seem that way too oh no you couldn't do that okay just to pop it around a little bit

[54:47] just you know we we tried so many things and some work some didn't work some more mediocre try

[54:55] something and you have no idea what's going to happen to it the one thing that always kind of

[54:59] confused me on like the 50s machines was the the it almost seems that there was two methods of

[55:06] scoring you had like that the 10,000s and the 100,000 points but then you had these single point

[55:12] values you know the one through 60 points what was the purpose of doing this like in in replays

[55:18] were were awarded based on both point systems what was the purpose of having like these two parallel

[55:23] point systems well just to give me uh ever just another way of uh of putting a feature in the game

[55:29] you know like uh it was a double bill was it was it was too high scores oh right right yes

[55:35] yes it's right it's like um like the two different colors at two different scores

[55:39] the red score and yellow score and you know like that game I uh I was uh thinking of uh

[55:48] making it a four ball game at the time and uh of course you know you had your five ball and your

[55:55] three ball that I was going to make a four ball game and have like a two player game you uh two

[56:00] guys two could play and you you could uh you say you were the red player you you tried to not hit

[56:06] the yellow and you know it's to give the yellow score and you're to hit your try to hit your score

[56:12] but uh you know a lot of things don't work out but that was the option to do that game now in 1963

[56:18] with sweethearts that was the last game to use gobble holes why did you abandon gobble holes at that

[56:24] at that point of time because you they've been around like got at least eight years or something

[56:29] you know you had to keep changing you had you know you couldn't do the same thing all the time so

[56:33] you had to you had to try something different uh you know it wasn't a plan nothing was ever planned

[56:40] you you just did it because uh you had to do something and uh you had to do something different and uh

[56:45] you tried to uh make a game that looked different played different to uh you know bring a little

[56:52] life back into the game but um did players uh complain about the the gobble holes at all

[57:00] well yeah i think they did it first but you know uh was uh was uh queen of hearts uh that that

[57:07] game was such that nobody ever complained about the gobble holes there and some games they did if

[57:14] there wasn't enough meaning to them and and i think uh i think that had as as a big uh

[57:19] uh that really determined it would serve um i mean this transition from when you had the trap holes

[57:27] to the gobble holes was this just two separate ideas that had nothing to do with each other or was

[57:32] there nothing to do with each other nothing at all okay i was just wondering because you know

[57:37] they're kind of a similar idea where the ball gets you know trapped or whatever but you know

[57:42] you know if there was some sort of transitionary idea we have the other one you uh

[57:47] what fell through i don't know just just trying different things right so all you're doing just

[57:53] trying to make something different now tell me about this thing where you know like in 1954 you

[58:00] do dragonat and then you know five months later you do four bells and they're essentially

[58:07] the exact same game but with different artwork what was the thinking behind and you did that

[58:13] a couple different times you know i guess if maybe if a game was popular or something what was

[58:18] the thinking there well you know sometimes we uh we needed a game in a hurry if if for some reason

[58:26] we needed one we sometimes we we copied a lot of things you know as we went along and a lot of

[58:35] features on boards and things were were copied and changed the rod just a little bit maybe you

[58:41] didn't recognize them all the time but but you know you had to take shortcuts to uh to be able to

[58:46] design so many games of my year that i had a design uh you know i was making some some years maybe

[58:56] 14 15 games in a year and you know that uh you had to take shortcuts and in particular making

[59:04] four player games i always cobbled things up pretty much so i take a uh back of a back

[59:11] insert from one game and i'll put it in the in the cabinet and then i'd plug into it and

[59:18] solder into it and the wires running all around you know to to make it work and uh

[59:24] sometimes i start from scratch and make to the whole thing circuit and everything you know

[59:29] sometimes i have the cobble every everything you played it by your as it was called for at the moment

[59:37] business was slow and and you know there for a while uh back uh well i'd say before i was designing

[59:46] and heritage then we we kept uh we we pulled a game and then we set the fact shut the factory down

[59:52] they'd be down for two or three days or a week and sometimes we went on a three-day week because uh

[59:59] you know there was no business so uh what we tried to do was to keep the factory going keeping

[01:00:05] everybody employed and uh that uh sometimes you had to take some shortcuts you know and that's

[01:00:12] what we did right because like on like flipper fair and cross-town for example it seemed like

[01:00:19] very close you know there the years apart couple three years apart but they you know they're

[01:00:23] basically the same play field layout yeah that's that's true no there's only so many things you can do

[01:00:28] with a play board and buffers and flipper and a couple of holes you know it uh there's only so

[01:00:34] many things you can do and uh sometimes it looks alike you know now i used to keep a little sketchbook

[01:00:42] because i uh i didn't want to make it too similar and i go back sometimes look at it because i

[01:00:47] make the same play board and not even recognize it uh and uh three or four years later

[01:00:54] come up with a board that's too similar and i have to shuffle around and do something different

[01:00:59] now in um 1963 bali came out with a game called moon shot which was basically a copy of your

[01:01:06] 1962 traffic aisle game you were i mean when something like that happened did that i mean

[01:01:12] did that make you mad or you just didn't care made it made it proud

[01:01:17] we liked it you know uh copy copying is uh means you're doing all right no we didn't we never

[01:01:24] cared fact god leave you to say a lot of copy uh you know we don't care we didn't

[01:01:32] never thought about it really when you design the game did you also design the whole electronic

[01:01:38] circuit too oh yeah yeah sure you should have seen the circuit i made on the uh and uh

[01:01:46] his first four player game uh you know you know all the you're familiar with the circuits of

[01:01:52] the four player games i'm sure you're you know the player unit and the player relays

[01:01:57] yeah but that that game didn't have a player unit it had like a set of relays that would

[01:02:01] energize for each one of the four players and that would direct the power to that set of score reels

[01:02:09] well the first one first one i made is all done on one disc on the 86 point unit

[01:02:15] i divided it up 80 points i divided up four sections that be 20 20 steps which is four which is

[01:02:27] five five balls four players four times five is 20 so i had i had that disc divided up so i could use

[01:02:35] all those circuits around that disc and and there were no players no uh no relays in there

[01:02:42] that was a circuit man i was something i'd love that i love that circuit but uh our chief engineer at the

[01:02:49] time uh bob Smith he uh he thought uh we overworked the unit and that we'd have to make a different unit

[01:02:55] entirely to handle that load and uh and you know we don't know how many of these games are going to make

[01:03:01] it may be only the only game we're going to make is this one so what's the point in building new

[01:03:06] steps which to handle such as circuit and uh and so we we didn't know whether we built another game

[01:03:12] after uh after the first one you know jumbo was unknown and uh as a result we we had no idea

[01:03:22] whether we'd ever sell any of them and so in order to get the game built by uh that that made the

[01:03:28] most sense to me too you know i say i up by that because uh although i i love my circuit that i drew

[01:03:34] i drew at least two circuits i don't know maybe i do more than that but i i thought i drew three

[01:03:40] but i've only been able to find two so i maybe that's all i did

[01:03:44] did now you had a guy that that's all he did was draw circuits draw yeah we had uh uh uh

[01:03:50] address well actually we had two drafts and then one of them kind of went into uh doing other things

[01:03:57] mainly mainly handling the parts uh of a parts list and that sort of thing but he did

[01:04:04] drawing too but we had uh i'd say one and a half draftsman going full time and when we went into

[01:04:10] super jumbo of course uh that was such a big change over that our engineering room was over text

[01:04:17] and uh and i got the job of uh of uh during that circuit i'm super jumbo so i i always like to draw

[01:04:26] and i i have fun drawing and i didn't mind drawing so they give it to me once a while

[01:04:31] on a lot of the coils the coil numbers um we're like an a series or a d a d series

[01:04:38] seem to think that that a meant alvin and the d meant david but i i didn't know no no we have nothing

[01:04:44] to do with that so we we kept personal things out of our circuits and out of our games and

[01:04:51] we we never put any personal things in any of them anyway you know any i was i take that back

[01:04:57] the ag relay was named after elvin gotley that that's the only thing i can remember ever

[01:05:05] bringing somebody else into it now why on that one i don't know just uh a guardbar a dot

[01:05:12] a guardbar key made the relay and uh i don't know we're just uh sitting around we had to give it a name

[01:05:18] you know we've got to name that thing and and i don't know how it's come up uh and name it after

[01:05:24] elvin you know and uh that's what we did that's the only i can remember all pan you know maybe

[01:05:29] there are other things i i don't think of all pan now when you when you needed a new step

[01:05:36] for you to do something was that stuff all made there at the gotley factory or was it outsourced

[01:05:41] we made it all yeah so did you have to do the drawings for uh you know a new step per unit as

[01:05:48] it was required yeah uh we had a mechanical draftman roman garbark he was our our chief

[01:05:56] mechanical engineer and he would make all those things he was he was good

[01:06:03] yep and our tool room would make the die when you were designing games did you have a preference

[01:06:09] whether you like to design single players or multiplayer's better well i'd say i like to add a ball

[01:06:16] festival why i don't know just fun to play it and speaking to anabals why would they design like an

[01:06:25] anabal for the states and then a separate one like for italy or something like that well the

[01:06:31] the laws were very in italy particularly you couldn't uh indicate uh that they were going to win

[01:06:39] anything there was you couldn't indicate anything that's why they were put into symbols or uh

[01:06:47] uh always various things that disguised the fact that you had extra balls let's take break from

[01:06:54] talking with Wayne nions and we'll be right back after this word hey George i just had to call

[01:07:03] and tell you about this really great magazine i got it's called the ping-gang journal and it's the

[01:07:08] only magazine dedicated totally to pinball it's got great articles and interviews with designers and

[01:07:13] everything no George i won't lend you my copy who knows what you'll take it to you're gonna have

[01:07:19] to go to ping-gang journal.com and get your own subscription but George the guy says that each issue

[01:07:24] will get mailed whenever he feels like what's the deal with that all right George i gotta go

[01:07:29] got a quality lane and tell her i can't believe how good this magazine is all right we're back with

[01:07:34] Wayne nions Wayne again was a primary game designer at got leave from 1951 to 1965 now tell me

[01:07:42] about Roy Parker did you know him very well oh sure i knew Roy very well look i got his house a

[01:07:48] couple of times uh yeah Roy was a great guy you know he was not uh not like our other artists uh

[01:07:58] he he was he was good he he was a uh you know he he used to draw such comical pictures so many

[01:08:08] embers so clever like barnacle bill you know beautiful beautiful humor but he had no humor and he

[01:08:18] never played pinball he'd come to the showroom and he would do his thing seriously and if we didn't

[01:08:28] like what he did why he would go home and correct it and be back in the morning with with a correction

[01:08:32] but uh he never stopped and played the game never so so he had like a like a real dry dull sense of

[01:08:41] humor but his artwork was like unbelievably comical very very much so that's right you were doing a

[01:08:48] game you know you designed the game and then it went over to um uh you know over to Roy Parker for

[01:08:54] for the artwork did you give him the theme or did he come up with the theme uh both uh normally we

[01:09:02] have the theme once in a while be just a game you know with no theme detected with it and uh we

[01:09:08] don't wait what here's the here's a layout uh uh Parker and uh you uh she would she come up with

[01:09:15] and he'd come up with something but but i'd say nine out of ten times we gave him the theme

[01:09:20] okay now out of the playboy we gave him a drawing uh jack out was and then he would go from there

[01:09:28] very much now did he work for godly brood he worked for ad poster or how was he contracted or

[01:09:36] originally originally worked for a company called reproduction and they burned down

[01:09:44] edifier and then we went to uh ad posters and he worked over there uh at uh they were

[01:09:55] kind enough to let him work there and do his thing there and they did our artwork our our

[01:09:59] screening force at that time then when when they got back uh uh when reproduction got back in

[01:10:06] in business again Parker went back over there and worked and did our work force but then they

[01:10:12] burned down a second time and this time they never rebuilt so we stayed with the ad posters and

[01:10:19] and so uh then uh Parker worked over there and they paid Parker we didn't pay him they paid him

[01:10:27] and uh but he worked strictly for us now a lot of people say that he did other people's work

[01:10:33] but uh maybe he did but Parker said he never did and uh and it Parker says he didn't do it

[01:10:40] that's good enough for me because he was a uh he was a gentleman uh he was he was something else

[01:10:48] now was was he like Dave Gottlieb's favorite or just everybody's favorite

[01:10:52] he's everybody's favorite you know the next one after when he when he died you know when we got

[01:10:58] our uh Gordon's stand on and Gordon did uh oh I don't know a few games then then we got Gordon

[01:11:07] Morrison and and Gordon with just the opposite he was the opposite of Parker you know he was a

[01:11:14] I thought he was a kid you know and here he died not too many years ago and uh I didn't realize

[01:11:21] he was old as he was uh he was uh he was a he was a character and and he would uh he uh he ran

[01:11:27] around a lot with the women you know and and uh he uh he used to try to sneak the girls names

[01:11:33] in on the pictures you know and uh he draw them in the in and so on and uh I'd catch him every once

[01:11:40] in a while and he would try to uh fuck me you know and so I wouldn't see anything he hid him in

[01:11:45] their hides and girls names thinking he's getting away with something but uh Parker would never do

[01:11:51] a thing like that and I know a lot of people say that so some glasses uh or uh that's Dave's in

[01:11:58] their that's Dave's picture and that's his family's picture and all that but uh Parker didn't do

[01:12:03] that and he said he never did and and I take a move where does he can do it so yeah like for example

[01:12:09] the rumor is on Chris Cross which was a 1958 game uh single player that there's a skier on there with

[01:12:17] a couple like snow bunnies and the a lot of people said that the skier who's kind of crashed he's

[01:12:23] got a skis cross that that was David Gottlieb that was a big rumor but you're saying that's

[01:12:29] you don't believe that to be the case. He never did and uh uh and you know if you knew Parker you

[01:12:35] know he would not do that he uh he was too sedate he was um he was a gentleman he was a real gentleman

[01:12:44] and uh uh you know not out going he didn't uh he wasn't you know artists are sometimes temperamental

[01:12:53] they they they didn't take criticism well but uh when Parker come over with something uh if we

[01:13:02] didn't like it we say look uh Parker uh um that girl is too uh scanty can't really dressed or

[01:13:10] whatever you know and and he's oh okay so he take his pen or pencil and he just make a couple

[01:13:17] of little marks and and uh you know I fix it up and never never was hurt by our criticism and uh

[01:13:26] if we if we uh we didn't like something uh like his drawing at all why uh he would go home he had a

[01:13:32] studio at home and he would go home at night and uh he'd leave our place usually come over around

[01:13:37] three o'clock three or four in the afternoon and then uh he'd go home and uh and he'd work at night

[01:13:44] at his home and and he'd be there in the morning with a change you know and uh uh he was he was

[01:13:50] great guy we we loved him and he liked us too we we got along well together well for for being

[01:13:57] out excuse me a real conservative guy he did draw some pretty sexy women on some of those

[01:14:03] back glasses how how was you I mean was your reaction David Gottlieb's and your reaction was

[01:14:09] that generally okay or I mean how often do you tell him to them down quite a bit we we did uh

[01:14:17] we we told him down quite a bit so some of them are a little risque but not uh

[01:14:24] considering the time I guess they were you know but we were we were aiming for that age group of

[01:14:30] young men you know 16 to 24 or five six uh we were aiming for that group and you see most of the

[01:14:37] glasses are sorry oriented in that direction and I think the games were two uh uh

[01:14:47] I I I built things that I liked you know and I I thought I was I was young for my age I think and

[01:14:53] probably still am but uh I I I could see the games as a as a young player and I enjoy playing

[01:15:03] them as a young player now after a period in like 1955 and 1956 the number replays that you could win

[01:15:13] unlike a gobble hole or or a special or whatever seemed to go down was there any reasoning for that

[01:15:20] you know like the the the sweet add-on line where you could win 26 credits and yeah yeah

[01:15:25] and some of the other games it seemed like with world champ in 1957 it was the end of that era where

[01:15:32] you dump a ball in the gobble hole and you win on just a whole pile of of uh replays it seemed

[01:15:38] like that was the last game to really do that is what was the reasoning for toning down the number

[01:15:44] of replays to be won in any particular game well animal we had a real reason or not

[01:15:53] I don't think we really had a reason for just how the games happen to come out you know

[01:15:58] everything isn't planned you know it it's it's designing is not a planned off thing you

[01:16:05] you just do things and uh and you do something you like it and show yeah this is good you know

[01:16:11] this one point two the minstrel man was was the first game with drop targets in 1951 then

[01:16:16] wild west it was an indian when you hit the target a solenoid would pull in that would suck the

[01:16:21] Indian down underneath the play field and hold them down for maybe a second and then he would

[01:16:26] spring back up right around 1970 with crescendo um there's start to be a lot of drop targets in

[01:16:33] the games all of a sudden what what was uh I mean what was that you know the change to start

[01:16:38] doing that was it's just something you were trying see that was crinsky designing at that time and he

[01:16:43] like drop targets used them a lot you have to be so careful when you design things of course

[01:16:48] the timing of the game and the percentage of the game uh these are all important things now did

[01:16:54] you have separate game testers the guys that actually came in and would play a hundred or

[01:16:58] 200 games on a game to actually test it out for you oh yeah when uh two percent we had to do that

[01:17:05] to percentage it fact uh I wonder I'm in in the North Lake uh we had a real good engineering room

[01:17:13] that we we made it special in I in fact I designed that room and in a series of rooms and one

[01:17:20] one of the smaller rooms was our playing room and we had games and we did nothing but play in that

[01:17:26] room and uh we had uh well everyone saw we we designed uh somebody you know to play a game and uh

[01:17:35] and we percentage if we kept track of uh how long it took to play a game uh number of free

[01:17:41] plays one and that type of thing you know so uh you had you know uh timing was very important how

[01:17:50] long a game played uh how many free plays of what you know if those are the things that enter into

[01:17:56] she whether she made money or not you got a you had a game that played uh 15 or 20 minutes on every

[01:18:02] nickel uh she couldn't make money money and uh if they won uh say 80 percent uh free plays

[01:18:12] it wouldn't make any money so we had to have a percentage to say uh 45 50 percent free plays

[01:18:18] and no more than 2.5 minutes to play a game and it's a shot for those things and long and uh if

[01:18:26] the guys uh play the game and played too long by time was too long we had to do something

[01:18:33] to speed it up a little bit it was a little bit uh you know whatever

[01:18:39] so you would shoot for a replay value of 40 or 50 percent yeah the cost of about 40 percent

[01:18:46] was that during the just during during all eras during the 50 60s and 70s yeah well I think

[01:18:52] I don't make the change I think wow because like today the free play percentage is usually you know

[01:18:59] maybe seven or eight percent well today they don't know how to make games today they're not going

[01:19:06] for the customers the amount of equipment that I was limited to all the time was very little

[01:19:12] no there's so much fixed cost in the game you got your your cabinet your glass your your

[01:19:18] playboards your screens your your transformers coin mechanisms uh

[01:19:25] legs cabinets the whole thing you know it's so much fixed cost so what have you got to work with

[01:19:30] when you come down with you got to score units or fix um so you only have a few dollars to work with

[01:19:37] so you're you're always limited to what you can put in the game and uh and they would

[01:19:43] the old Tony Gerard to come in and look at my games when I get to them and he's like hey I count those

[01:19:49] relays there's so many relays there's 18 relays in there you can only have 16 you know that type of

[01:19:55] thing and I say but Tony I just took one out y'all well and okay you know but that was the thinking

[01:20:03] you know they they counted every little thing you put in the game how many steps which is can you add

[01:20:08] to a game how can you add to this to it and uh animation is an example with money uh when you put

[01:20:15] animation in a game you had to take off something else uh it was always a fight for cost and uh

[01:20:22] and uh and maybe uh at that particular time uh uh

[01:20:28] the thinking was that uh you know I had to tone down the number of free places were going to win

[01:20:34] the features that contributed to that in the 70s like when you would have you know all these

[01:20:40] multiplayer and you'd have single players did you guys actually sit down and say okay we're going to do

[01:20:45] you know not eight multiplayer games this year and four single players no no so one thing was

[01:20:54] you know you think everything was planned out but nothing was planned out we were going by the

[01:21:00] seat of our pants at all times you know whatever we thought the market would bear but you know when

[01:21:05] we were building uh uh single player uh four player two player and add a ball all at the same time

[01:21:14] we had various territories it would only take uh like a four player as an example and like uh

[01:21:21] like uh like uh France and Germany but uh if we ran uh single player too long they were

[01:21:28] squawking the distributors hey come on we need a we need a four player we need a four player come on

[01:21:32] let's get us a four player then uh who and that would determine which team next you know

[01:21:39] that it's all on the market demand at certain times now did the market demand certain themes like

[01:21:45] you know the godly like did like to use card themes and western themes never never had any input

[01:21:53] whatever doubted you guys like particular themes i like particular themes i like sports themes mainly

[01:22:00] i i did a lot of sport games i like sports and uh and uh current events you know you see a lot of

[01:22:08] current events like you know well it's bird of 76 that have been the most off-sounding one but

[01:22:14] coronation i was at the time of uh coronating the queen of England um i don't say history had

[01:22:23] something to do with it and songs a lot of popular songs at that time would be uh what uh

[01:22:29] bring up a song and i know i like the railroading that so i had several several railroad themes and

[01:22:39] who was the card somebody obviously had to be a card player there no but i tell you why we made a

[01:22:47] lot of card games it's a very popular uh all people can understand cards uh most people can

[01:22:54] understand cards so cards is a very popular theme same thing with bowling another popular

[01:22:59] well understood theme you know things that most people understand uh you wouldn't uh you wouldn't

[01:23:07] have a chess game as an example because it's a great game but it's not that many people play it

[01:23:15] so you wouldn't you wouldn't even think of it but even just say you have a pinball machine

[01:23:20] now who came up with the rototarget in 1957 whose idea was that

[01:23:26] boy i don't know

[01:23:30] that that seemed like one expensive playfield toy it was it was and uh i i think it was

[01:23:36] well you know it was it was a combination of things it's it came from a step switch we had

[01:23:42] step switches and we were going to just step it around you know step the target around that's

[01:23:46] what i was going to do and then i don't know somebody suggested spinning it you know well gee that

[01:23:50] that makes sense so then what to that and uh so i got that unit made up and then i put it in the game

[01:23:56] but you know it's kind of things grow they uh they start out with one thing and it grows to

[01:24:01] something else and that's how that spinner really came in but it was a great neighborhood

[01:24:06] target we use that in awful lot of games right it seemed to be pretty popular very popular very

[01:24:12] popular now the transition from like uh you know wood legs the metal legs and wooden coin door

[01:24:21] to metal coin door was that dictated by you guys or was that dictated by the cabinet company

[01:24:27] oh no that was dictated by us you saved money do you know those steel legs cost about half the

[01:24:33] price of a wooden leg you know and it's amazing and same with that uh with the uh with the uh with the

[01:24:40] molding um that molding that went on with cabinets is very expensive and we can make it out of

[01:24:47] stainless steel punch it on our flex presses for a lot less money in fact we say i don't know how many

[01:24:55] dollars per game on legs alone by going to the metal legs and it was the same thing with the

[01:25:02] ball arch like the lower and upper ball arches went from absolutely same thing same thing

[01:25:08] okay and you know and it looked better when you got to it looks better right now are you saying

[01:25:13] that in 1960 when you went from the the wooden side rails to the metal rails that that was a big

[01:25:21] cost savings that's a saving yes definitely okay now why did Roy Parker not do cabinet artwork I

[01:25:31] mean the car the artwork on the side of Gatley games was very you know what um you know

[01:25:36] dimensional geographic dimensions and that but it didn't it wasn't it never had artwork that

[01:25:42] reflected the theme of the game why was that well that that was done by the cabinet company

[01:25:48] they they did all that fact work they they had to make stencils you know and that uh to do that

[01:25:54] and and they uh they did the artwork on this on the side so that had nothing to do with you guys

[01:26:00] at all then well we had to pick out the design yeah they've got leave had a had a uh a piece of plastic

[01:26:09] with a shape of a pinball machine cut out in it and anybody come along and come in to visit with

[01:26:16] a fancy tie he'd take their tie and he'd hold it up under that piece of plastic and look at it

[01:26:21] what it would look like on a pinball cabinet you know and sometimes he takes the design from the tie

[01:26:27] but so a lot a lot of times you know you a lot of times for a long period of time we had red white

[01:26:33] and blue cabinets so we ever had and that was because it's a you like red white and blue

[01:26:39] now when you went to using score reels you know on the single players i'm basically everything in

[01:26:45] 1960 everything got score reels there was no longer the light box style scoring was that a savings

[01:26:52] of money or did that cost you more or was that just something you had to do well that that cost

[01:26:57] more money that cost more money that was a that was going to have a tricky space but it was better

[01:27:04] it was better so they had no problems on implementing that design then no i i think i think uh

[01:27:13] uh we weren't the first one to come out with real scoring i think Williams came out with it first

[01:27:19] didn't he? yes that's correct they came out with it for in 1954 for a short period and then they

[01:27:25] stopped using it and then everybody started going to multi-players like you guys did and then of

[01:27:32] course you had to use it in multi-players because there wasn't enough room on the back glass to

[01:27:36] score with light box scoring on a multiplayer that's right now it during the 60s you know the

[01:27:46] cabinet changed to the to the famous wedgehead design was that something that you guys designed

[01:27:52] an implementer or was that again the cabinet company? now we did that we wanted something to look

[01:27:57] a little different data data game and you know so we did that now in the 60s what what were some of

[01:28:06] your favorite games that you designed that you really liked? in the 60s well let's see yeah

[01:28:15] i don't know i like a lot of games of course but i tell you i like all the edible games

[01:28:23] that to me was the ultimate game adabone i'll tell you in in our showroom we had

[01:28:31] we always had the games lined up all the the games that were in production the ones that were

[01:28:37] coming up and so forth we had maybe four four showroom and we always had the adabone or and

[01:28:46] about four o'clock four thirty-five we'd all kind of gravitate into the showroom we talked and

[01:28:52] and and play games and and kind of give it a little bit and first one in the showroom always went

[01:29:01] to the adabone game we like to play adabones now in in the showroom did you have those games set for

[01:29:09] replay or i mean for free player with a money free play oh you did you had them set for

[01:29:15] you're fired in so you're playing for nothing sure now who came up with the adabone game idea i

[01:29:21] did actually actually what happened was elvin elvin got living you know who he is he's the son

[01:29:30] Dave son he he went down to Texas Texas was dying now they couldn't run free play

[01:29:35] and he was down there of one of our distributors down there and they were begging him to

[01:29:42] help him out to get make free plays legal in the state you know maybe they want money i don't know

[01:29:48] what it was but anyway they they were begging him to do something and so he well i'll see what i

[01:29:54] can do so he came back and he came in to see me and and he says you know we got to do something

[01:29:59] to help out Texas we got to make a game that has no free place because they can't have free plays

[01:30:06] and so i well okay i'll see what i can do you know and so i got thinking about it and i

[01:30:12] i i got the idea and and i built the game and and i call it flipper and uh in the reason why i

[01:30:21] call it flipper was that that's a game that harry put on the first flipper game which ended up

[01:30:30] as humpy dumpy see that that game a humpy dumpy uh being the first flipper game was called flipper

[01:30:40] and it was a lot it was it didn't warn such a wonderful invention it was a simple game and uh

[01:30:49] and and the glass was made all the artwork is done the game finished ready to go into production

[01:30:55] and Dave came in one morning and he said no so we're going to jazz that game up a little bit

[01:31:00] we're going to call it humpy dumpy we're going to make a nursery rhyme out of it and he called

[01:31:05] parker in and told him what he wanted and parker did a fabulous job on that game i think it one

[01:31:11] of the prettiest classes and and we changed the the playboard not not the actual working on the

[01:31:18] playboard but we changed the bumpers around there were there on humpy dumpy there were four bumpers

[01:31:24] two in the top and two in the bottom and they were just score bumpers and so we put a little

[01:31:30] four number sequence in there and i think we call i don't want to call it a b c d or one two three four

[01:31:35] whatever it was but we add us that to the game and we did several things to the scoring and we

[01:31:41] came out with humpy dumpy and so i was always disappointed that we didn't use the word flipper i

[01:31:46] thought that was a great name and so when we made the add-up all the first add-up all i threw up the

[01:31:52] the glass that i wanted and i called slipper big red letters across the top of that sucker and

[01:31:59] and when david came in he played it and enjoyed it and and i said you know david we got the call

[01:32:05] this game flipper that's the game and you said you're right that's what it's going to be and that's

[01:32:10] the way to end it up slipper now in the 60s you started to use more back box animation which you

[01:32:18] said was fairly expensive how did you get away with that like on flipper cowboy and in buckaroo

[01:32:25] and cow poke and flipper parade and flipper clown and cross town with the elevators in um skyline

[01:32:33] with the elevators how did you know it seemed like those were expensive animation units well

[01:32:38] they were but they were part of the game you know they really well i don't know but maybe maybe

[01:32:44] the game would have been just as good without but it it was part of the game um like i don't know

[01:32:52] we we had other other animations that were too expensive we couldn't do it but we we got those

[01:32:57] in you know what ones did you were you unable to do that were too expensive oh i'm trying to

[01:33:04] think of one that uh um over the toy soldiers anyway uh it was uh all of the expensive thing and

[01:33:12] that's right when we ended it right there we said that's the end of that but uh money was always

[01:33:19] a problem for us uh what was what was the name of one that had the dancing doll yeah dancing lady

[01:33:28] 1966 right that was the one is that that's the one that had the girl on the string right we had a

[01:33:35] fish line on there a nylon line that held the girl and we had a mortar that revolved and

[01:33:41] met it and uh we didn't know how to tie that fish line so one of our one of our engineers was

[01:33:50] a fisherman he says i'll teach you guys how to tie a fish line so he taught us all how to tie

[01:33:55] a nylon line so we could make the doll run and then you go off the shop and teach the guys on

[01:34:00] the shop on to do it yeah how do interesting things happen now the uh towards the mid 1960s

[01:34:10] uh you know around Buccaru and Calpoke you seem to just stop doing a lot of game designing why was

[01:34:16] that well i did it all until until um see what did i one night stop for about uh well about mid 1965

[01:34:27] yeah it seemed like you you slowed down and calpoke was like your last one and and uh

[01:34:33] June of 65 and then you went to that view didn't design a game until 68 with like Paul bunion and

[01:34:39] yeah Paul bunion we needed a game you know and when i design that game like i've got through i

[01:34:44] says you know i'll never design another game anyone could design a game like that don't deserve

[01:34:50] design design game it's not certainly wasn't my favorite game although i've had some people tell me

[01:34:55] they like the game but uh but you know at that i bought that time i quit designing uh ed krensky came

[01:35:02] in we hired ed krensky as a designer and uh our our superintendent of uh of the factory uh was

[01:35:13] became ill and uh had to leave the leave and go on leave and uh he never came back of course and

[01:35:22] and Bob Smith moved up into the uh uh into the uh superintendent's job but we needed a chief

[01:35:29] engineer so uh they called me in the office and uh that says wait me this is uh well would

[01:35:36] you like to have the job you know yeah i wouldn't like to have the job see we got ed krensky here now

[01:35:42] what you don't need me to design game we got ed you know and i can help him out and uh do the job

[01:35:48] and so i got the job as chief engineer and that's how uh i that's how we kind of we we kind of

[01:35:57] meld it together i moved in the engineering room and he moved in the design room and then we worked

[01:36:02] back and forth and and then i didn't do any designing he did all the designing except uh we got

[01:36:08] through uh Paul Bunyan and we were we needed a game and uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[01:36:14] krensky was running a little a little short and um like whoa i in my spare time i'll make

[01:36:20] a i'll make up a game and all of them so i made Paul Bunyan and after we got through and

[01:36:26] in production i think i played the game i said you know this this is not my my standard i tell you

[01:36:31] that i i can do better than this but if i'm running if i i'm so busy running everything else

[01:36:37] in the shop i i can't uh i can't design i can't i can't think like that anymore i don't

[01:36:45] ever ask me to design another game so i've never did never did well one that you did design after

[01:36:51] that was in the 1971 head-to-head game challenger right oh i didn't i i don't claim that you know

[01:37:00] that was that was designed by a committee there i was involved there was uh bob Smith was uh

[01:37:08] involved at uh at krensky was involved elvin was involved and we we all had our two cents words you

[01:37:16] know and we always kidded about it and we that was designed by a committee and it looks like a camel

[01:37:22] that uh it it didn't have the coherence that you wanted one you can't have more than one guy

[01:37:30] designing something you you can't have two guys or three or four five all putting their two cents

[01:37:35] in it just don't work like that you can't do it it's one person has to do it and uh so we

[01:37:42] we made the game and uh and i'll tell you that that's the story there i could tell you two if

[01:37:48] you're interested in it yeah yeah definitely uh we uh we made oh i don't maybe three four hundred

[01:37:55] up something like that and uh put them out and then none of them made any money they were they were

[01:38:05] they were just they just didn't make money nobody planned so uh we we only made that many and so

[01:38:11] three or four or five months went by and the guy comes in one day from Canada western Canada

[01:38:18] one of the providence over there and uh he tells he's talking to Dave see and Dave calls us all in

[01:38:26] the office we're all sitting there talking with this guy he wanted to buy two hundred challenges

[01:38:33] and Dave says you know that game will not make you any money you'll lose money on this and

[01:38:37] yeah don't don't do it you can't listen he's trying to talk them out of it and guys I know my

[01:38:43] territory and I know it'll do make me money and I'll do this and that and the other Dave's I'll tell

[01:38:48] you what I don't say I didn't warn you now that you're you're going to lose your shirt on this

[01:38:53] but if you pay me a head up ahead I'll build the two hundred games for you and a guy says okay and

[01:39:01] he writes them out a check for the two hundred games and we build them and we ship them up there and

[01:39:06] the guy went bankrupt you lost the shirt that's a pretty good story actually Dave Dave told him and

[01:39:14] I was standing right there listening in I couldn't believe it you know Dave you're going to lose

[01:39:19] your shirt on it don't buy them but if you want them don't say I didn't warn you and that's what happened

[01:39:27] no no no one of the last things you did was the spirit of 76 in pioneer in in 1976

[01:39:37] tell me about that that game sold like gangbusters sure did and did you ever hear the story about

[01:39:43] how I got a game I heard that you made some sort of a bet well I tell you what we were sitting

[01:39:50] around the dining room table at one one day if we were about ready to go into production we had

[01:39:56] you know it was about three or four months out from production day and we were talking about the

[01:40:00] game and all the top extra numbers there and Judd Judd was in charge of the company at that time

[01:40:10] Judd Weinberg and he says we got to pick out a number so we can start ordering parts for

[01:40:16] challenger for spirit of 76 and he says how many games do you think we're going to build follows

[01:40:26] and so one guy would say three thousand another one would say 2800 another one 3500 4000

[01:40:34] four around the table I didn't say anything so we go all around the table and Judd's

[01:40:40] Wayne what about you you didn't say nothing you know you always got your two cents in here

[01:40:45] I said Judd if I tell you what I I think way you'd laugh you know everybody laughed and he's

[01:40:51] oh come on now you know come on come on I said well okay I say 10,000 well everybody laughed

[01:40:57] it was unheard of so Judd I tell you what I'll do Wayne if she's the 10th out if we build 10,000

[01:41:05] games that 10,000 game is yours I'll bring it over to your house set it up for you actually you've

[01:41:11] got a deal well we made 10,000 games and the 10,000 game is still sitting in my garage out here

[01:41:18] I still have it and I still play it almost every day now why did you get a crowd back into

[01:41:24] designing I mean you hadn't designed a game since 1971 the challenger you know in by committee

[01:41:30] with that one and really before that with Paul Bunyan and then all of a sudden you know you you

[01:41:36] do one in and late 75 and it in the thing sells like gangbusters well no that see that that

[01:41:43] is a little misconception I didn't design that game I did and I didn't the crinsky actually

[01:41:51] designed the game but it was the rules of the game was was different and and he could and everybody

[01:42:00] was trying to tell him what to do with it you know because I wanted to build and for two years

[01:42:06] before two years before 76 I would be 74 I started thinking of this game because you know the

[01:42:13] the bicentennial was coming up and I wanted a game made specifically for that era and I knew

[01:42:21] what I wanted red, white and blue and a flashy name and a great game and so I went to crinsky about

[01:42:29] the several months maybe a year before the games to be built and I told him what I wanted you know

[01:42:39] I wanted the best game you ever made it got to be this one you know and we're gonna we're gonna

[01:42:44] really hit hard with a red, white and blue and and so he made the game made the playboard the game

[01:42:52] rules I'm more less made up so I I don't really claim the design I don't claim that at all but I

[01:42:59] had a part of it I had a part of it but you know the thing was that that nobody nobody realized at that

[01:43:08] time that the bicentennial was so going to be so big everybody wanted this game I knew this when I

[01:43:17] when I started two years before that I knew that if I could make a game that was a good game and come

[01:43:23] out in that year with red, white and blue with American flag flying all over the place every

[01:43:30] location would have to have one they have to have it so when I said 10,000 games I wasn't fooling

[01:43:38] I thought I thought that sure 3,53500 would probably be a good number but but double-ass

[01:43:47] triplet because every location will want one it's a big thing and and that time it's it's

[01:43:55] tremendous people everyone with red, white and blue and so I knew we're gonna make a lot of games

[01:44:02] and so when I said that I I wasn't kidding I really felt it and so we made I think oh I don't

[01:44:10] have 1,000, 1,000 something like that and then we went and made pioneer which you sold I don't

[01:44:16] two, three thousand something like I forgot the numbers but something like that we made about

[01:44:21] 13,000 all together that that layout you know and that was a great game and I still like my game

[01:44:29] and you know there's a feature on there are you familiar with the game?

[01:44:33] yeah yeah I am familiar with the game yes that center hole has when you're not

[01:44:42] called a target sound you get double bonus and if it's on the last ball you get double-double

[01:44:49] and so you can get a tremendous score on that last ball and you know as many times I played

[01:44:55] that game in mind I've never never gotten double-double and I played it and played it and played it

[01:45:01] and I've never done it and I like that game all the time I should state that you're you're actually

[01:45:08] known as a very very good in ball player too well I used to play pretty good but I don't play

[01:45:15] great very good anymore I get too old I can't I can't react fast enough you know but I still play

[01:45:22] a pretty good game but I I've lost a little bit unfortunately now what did you think when Dave

[01:45:30] got lead sold the company to Columbia Pictures what was your thinking when that happened?

[01:45:36] well I was disappointed you know I always worked for a a the owner of the company when I worked

[01:45:48] at Western I worked for Jimmy John who I knew personally then I went with Dave and I knew him

[01:45:55] personally and in fact I was a sort of a member of the family you know and then when we went to

[01:46:02] Columbia Pictures things changed immediately I couldn't buy things before that I could buy anything

[01:46:11] if I wanted the computer I go on to buy it you know I didn't have to go to anybody I can go to

[01:46:17] the office write me out a check for this write me out a check for that I can't I didn't have to

[01:46:22] once Columbia took over I had a right to New York and get permission to do anything you know

[01:46:29] and I I didn't like that so I only worked a few years and I left I left in 1980 but if

[01:46:37] if it has been remained with Judd and charge that company I'd probably still be there you know

[01:46:44] it's it was a different world now how did you feel when they went to the solid state you know they

[01:46:53] they didn't do the electro mechanical anymore and they went to the solid state you know computer

[01:46:58] scoring and that how did you feel about that? I didn't like it at all of course that's not my

[01:47:04] cup of tea I was born and raised on relays you know and and I and timing and motors and steps

[01:47:14] which is those things I understand computers I can't understand I still can't understand but I

[01:47:21] had to learn in a hurry and I did enough to keep up with our electronic engineers I could I could

[01:47:29] converse with it fairly intelligently but but I I didn't like it I I don't think the games are

[01:47:35] ever the same you know you miss that that the field couldn't give have a feel and you feel the

[01:47:47] units stepping and you hear the relays clicking and the and the in the chimes they're different you

[01:47:53] know it's it's we we lost something in the pinball industry at that time I I'm sure of it

[01:48:04] now the old mechanical games were by far the fun games were played well the one thing about your

[01:48:13] games that was always stuck out to me is that the the goal of the game you know to win the replay

[01:48:21] your games will get you within an inch of that goal but most often you didn't get it so you always

[01:48:29] wanted to play again because you felt like you know I got so close on the last game that I could

[01:48:35] do it on this game that's right exactly right and I tried to build that into all games but you know

[01:48:42] sometimes I succeeded sometimes they didn't you know there were a lot of dog I made a lot of dogs too

[01:48:48] uh I know some of them were pretty good I like I still like to play some of them when I go to

[01:48:53] when I go up the x-ball I uh there's some games I play and I just have a ball you know thinking back

[01:48:59] on when I first made the first one and what we what they now call the whiteboard how did you feel

[01:49:06] about the slick chick for example I like slick chick but I didn't think of my best game you know

[01:49:12] I've got the name I guess you heard the story about that now why don't you tell me um well I know

[01:49:18] I think I called it um that would be party girls the name is a little bit too risky and and they

[01:49:25] do want to use it and I go over to a friend's house and Sunday night it's a cold winter night

[01:49:31] I remember and we were going over there for supper and as I turned down this corner at his house

[01:49:37] there was a new restaurant it just opened up and and uh there the name was uh yeah unbelievable

[01:49:45] uh I there's the name of the game right there uh slick chick uh what a name you know and that's

[01:49:54] so I went to work the next day and put it in the game slick chick uh and that's how the name how

[01:49:59] it got the name yes I like that game very much uh but uh there's a lot of games I like but I

[01:50:06] like uh uh sweet adalina I like uh lightning ball that was one of my favorite games right

[01:50:14] because I I could play it I can handle that game so well um but let's see if one I don't care

[01:50:21] for here dancing lady I that's that's my name I didn't care that's the one they had the dancing girl

[01:50:27] on there um I never cared much for that game when got lead went to the solid state thing you

[01:50:33] guys hired rockwell to kind of handle that whole solid state our board system why didn't you guys

[01:50:41] design that in house like say Williams and and Valley did well we didn't have time see you know

[01:50:46] it's it's hard to understand why we were going so gangbusters you know we were going wide open

[01:50:53] we were building probably four five hundred games a day and uh we we were moving you know and uh

[01:51:00] we thought it would last forever uh solid state hardly entered our mind we knew it was there

[01:51:06] and we knew it was coming but we were so busy and uh I had hired a I had hired a uh

[01:51:13] electrical engineer a solid state engineer and uh he he worked for a uh he had been working

[01:51:23] for some kind of an organ company I think it was and uh they laid him off and uh so he came

[01:51:30] asking for a job and I said you know we're looking for someone to build a solid state game for it

[01:51:35] and um how would you like to do that oh I like to do that oh well I'll do that so that's one

[01:51:42] now one thing I want to make sure that if I hire you you're going to stay here and not leave as

[01:51:48] soon as you get another job in the music industry he's oh no I'm going to do it I'm going to stay

[01:51:54] I'll stay forever I'll I'll this I'll build your game and he worked about six months he's got started

[01:52:00] on it and then uh walked out of one point went back got another job in an organ company so you know

[01:52:07] we we got off the bad start and I was so busy building the mechanical games uh we finally had to

[01:52:14] had to do something uh we the fastest thing to do was hire somebody a company and we hired rock

[01:52:21] wall to do it and uh I think it ended up they didn't do too good a job but uh but uh they got us

[01:52:27] into it in a hurry and you know we we it was really I think probably a good part of it was my fault

[01:52:36] that we didn't get into it sooner but uh but I was busy building mechanical games and uh I don't

[01:52:44] know it was just out of my out of my league I guess you know and and did you I mean looking back on

[01:52:53] it how long did that rock wall thing take for them to to design that that board system for you

[01:52:59] and deliver it well it didn't take them too long I guess six months something like that I don't

[01:53:06] remember all of Hannah oh six months something like that and when you guys wanted to like change

[01:53:14] the rules on a particular game could you do that in house or did rock well have to do all that

[01:53:19] stuff for you so I we did that in house we we had hired two pretty good men uh and they they

[01:53:29] uh came in of course they couldn't hire couldn't build the whole system for us and that length

[01:53:33] short length of time but they uh they worked with rock well and and they were competent to men and

[01:53:41] they worked out real well for us okay Wayne is there anything I have left out that you would like

[01:53:49] to add I just ran been along here with you play I don't know uh I hope they helped you out with

[01:53:56] something I don't know oh you did great I mean this is awesome I you know this is I mean you're

[01:54:04] you know you got to understand all the games all the got leave games I collect you know

[01:54:09] aside from knockout you every game that leave game I have you designed knockout Harry Mabry's

[01:54:15] right that's the only one I have that wasn't made by you is that right well there's a lot of

[01:54:23] them out there right there I don't know how many there are but I was well 125 130 I guess

[01:54:29] games uh all and all and some of them were we threw out you know a lot a lot of good games I threw out

[01:54:37] they they didn't want to build it I thought they were good but so godly didn't think they were good so

[01:54:42] but uh so I made a lot of games my last time and I tell you it was a lot of fun I often tell people

[01:54:50] you know not not many uh man can say they they want to work every morning uh upbeat I always

[01:54:59] happy to go to work always could I enjoy my work and and I think it's uh uh

[01:55:06] tinball industry itself was a was a happy business and the people in it were happy people

[01:55:13] we were we were a good good crew and a lot of nice people working for us and

[01:55:21] I met a lot of great people in the industry you know I knew a lot of them of course there's not

[01:55:25] many alive anymore I would one of the reasons you were happy is because of the the the godly

[01:55:32] lunch lady the lady that made lunches oh yeah yeah we had a couple of them the boy they could cook

[01:55:37] I'll tell you we we used to eat lunch like crazy you know and I come home and I tell my wife and

[01:55:43] she said what do we what am I making lunch what am I making dinner for you for you have that big

[01:55:47] lunch I'm still hungry I can still eat I could I never put on any weight but I enjoy I enjoy

[01:55:54] the deep deep they actually hired they actually had basically a cook for you guys there at godly

[01:56:01] bright yeah she's just cooked for us for the not for the whole plant just for the uh a pressure

[01:56:05] hunt you know the engineers and the front office and that was all now how long did they keep doing

[01:56:12] that till we did that well from I'm almost from the time I started work there right up to the end

[01:56:25] we always had a cook in fact you see the other companies like Williams Portek and those kind of

[01:56:31] guys they go out to dinner and they would meet the other companies you know they they'd all talk

[01:56:39] and they go bowling together and they play golf together and they did all kinds of things we never

[01:56:44] did we never I never fraternized with any of them once once I started designing I had nothing to do

[01:56:51] with any of them before that when I was at Western I used to play baseball with with the guys but

[01:56:57] so I got to know quite a few people in the industry but then then they all got older and went off

[01:57:04] and other directions but we always had dinner together we always had a table together and our

[01:57:10] suppliers would come in and sometimes eat with us like Charlie Castaker you know the plastic

[01:57:16] man you've come over and he's a great storyteller and we tell stories and we all laugh we sit

[01:57:22] together and laugh and tell jokes and and we talk business some days we we talking business you know

[01:57:31] when we both we both the first slipper game Humpty Dumpty we were we hadn't sent out the samples yet

[01:57:41] and and ballet had sent out a game that that I don't know how we heard we heard about it from

[01:57:51] a location that it it's the night of the ball it hits the ball you can hit the ball you know and

[01:57:58] and we're sitting around a kid the table having lunch and it's like how how could this be

[01:58:03] and one of our suppliers told us this you know and how could this possibly be that somebody

[01:58:10] or let the cat out of the bag and they got the flipper ahead of us and we were worried you know we're

[01:58:14] all looking at each other wondering who who told who you know and so they sent Elvin out to

[01:58:21] someplace in West Coast or they had this game out on test and he called us up one day

[01:58:29] just a day or two later and told us what it was a Nudgey remember a game called Nudgey yeah I do

[01:58:36] remember that and it was Nudgey it came out in the in 47 and and we thought it was a copy of

[01:58:43] the flipper of course it was Nudgey and of course as soon as we came out with a flipper that Nudgey

[01:58:48] was gone but we we were pretty concerned and uh but uh yeah and then we went sold out to

[01:59:01] Columbia Pictures that was the end of Galley that was the shame it put the lunch lady stayed at when

[01:59:09] you were even when it was Columbia Pictures right well yeah she was still there well at least you

[01:59:13] got some good food out of it oh yeah we got good food it was a good we had a good time I don't

[01:59:19] so sorry but then you know I I left in 1980 and and I was 62 years old and and so I wouldn't

[01:59:32] collect so security until I was 65 so I got made a deal with with them to be a consultant for

[01:59:40] three years so I hold my pay and I could retire down I can sell and get paid for it so which

[01:59:47] was pretty good and so I thought there was serious you know and so I I come back up there you

[01:59:54] know when I had a convention or a party or something and I walk around to shop and say hello to

[02:00:00] all my friends and and engineers and all that and and and one time I tried to tell them something

[02:00:07] like gee I don't know I don't like this guy you know well why don't you do this uh well I got put

[02:00:14] out in the hurry I say look they told me they look you're only a consultant you're that's only name

[02:00:19] only you know don't come in here trying to tell us what to do and I go oh wait a minute no

[02:00:25] says that the way it is and they said that's the way it is that's okay I'll never say another word

[02:00:30] so I just sat back quietly and collected my papers for years and uh let it go but you know if you

[02:00:36] don't want to listen to one of this but you know they only they just went down hill from then on

[02:00:42] they from that moment they went down hill 1980 yeah that was about that was about the end you're

[02:00:48] right yeah it was the games didn't have the same flavor anymore they didn't have the uh they

[02:00:55] didn't have the feel you know they lost it immediately and I I felt kind of bad about that but

[02:01:01] uh where it goes you know yeah to go back a little bit you know on Humpty Dumpty where you had

[02:01:11] the six flippers what what made you decide to go to just the you know the two flippers at the

[02:01:17] bottom of the play field what was that well how did that decision come about well we we had the

[02:01:23] six flippers and and I think with Jenckel wasn't the Jenckel they put on they they build a game

[02:01:28] and only two flippers on it and uh I think uh Cordic did that I recall right I don't remember now

[02:01:38] but I think Cordic did and you know we looked at all the games that other companies made it and uh

[02:01:44] and we thought well maybe we ought to go down to four flippers you know we kind of go in half cut it

[02:01:48] in half and I think the Harry's designed a game for flippers on it and uh I don't I don't remember

[02:01:58] first game I guess it's six flippers I don't remember them can't remember what uh so were you

[02:02:07] following Genn Kose's design of of the two flippers or when I was design I never I never looked at

[02:02:13] their games you know I tell you a little story about that uh god leave and I I'm sure the other

[02:02:20] companies did too they we get in one of every game of all the companies that made they made and uh

[02:02:28] and then they bring them in the in the engineering room or wherever and uh it happened to be that

[02:02:34] they always bring the games into my design room when I was a designer because I had the most room I

[02:02:39] had a lot I had a actually two rooms one room I used for designing the other one was just sort of

[02:02:44] a storage room and then they bring a game in there and they'd always tell me wait now you take a

[02:02:48] look at this game and see if there's anything you can use and I said oh okay I'll do that I'll do

[02:02:54] that but I never would I never look at the game I refused to look at them because I didn't want to

[02:03:00] I didn't want to think like they thought I wanted to think the way I thought and I didn't want to

[02:03:04] even look at what they did and I I wouldn't even look at them and I say they didn't know that they

[02:03:09] just but the only thing I ever looked at really really was Bingo game it's get a bingo game in from

[02:03:15] from ballet you know and I love Bingo games I thought they were they weren't tricky you know I

[02:03:22] just love that reflex unit to sit in there and the things like that I would

[02:03:28] fall over the circuit and study the circuit on it on the games and and uh can I learned a lot by

[02:03:33] doing that learn little tricks and so forth I could use on a circuit on some other game but I

[02:03:39] never look at it like a Williams game I bring it in they set it there but I never look at it

[02:03:45] I wouldn't play it I wouldn't have nothing to do with it so when they brought a game and you mean

[02:03:50] they would buy a competitor's games and bring them into you to look at what happened to all those

[02:03:55] they basically were supporting the other company by buying these games well yeah but they bought

[02:04:00] ours and we bought theirs you know actually we didn't buy them we the distributor would send

[02:04:05] to send the game in we supposedly look at it you know and play it and and the other

[02:04:11] the guys did the Dave did and the judge of and the horse played the other thing but we don't

[02:04:17] want to keep it for a week and then we send it back and I suppose they did the same with ours

[02:04:23] we did keep it you know well I had no idea that you guys would follow the competition that

[02:04:30] yeah because it would seem like one feature would come out with one company and then you know

[02:04:34] somebody else would have it you know in a month or something like that yeah well let's see they

[02:04:39] they look at the games and you know the Williams used to copy us all the time they always copy us

[02:04:46] and you know Quartic never admitted this but the other day I heard someone say or someone told

[02:04:53] me that he at the at the at the convention last year got up and actually actually made the statement

[02:05:00] that they copied got me and I was boy I like to bend there and hurt that because he never admitted

[02:05:06] it before but they did copy us all the time Williams Williams always copied of course Quartic was

[02:05:12] that Williams at this time right but but you never copied them never I never did never did

[02:05:22] do you feel like any of your co-workers might have no I don't think so I don't think we

[02:05:27] ever copied anything I don't think we did anything that they ever did I can't think of anything

[02:05:34] we ever took from them certainly not features not no parts no maybe the scoring units maybe only

[02:05:45] what maybe what the wheels after they did I don't I don't recall but maybe we did

[02:05:51] but we sure came out with the metal legs first the metal's cash store the side rails those are all

[02:06:00] things we did now your cabinets were made by a separate cabinet company right yeah yeah

[02:06:07] why why didn't you guys make the cabinets too why didn't we make the cabinets right that's a dirty

[02:06:13] business you know that's just that's really a special business because you got all that saw it

[02:06:18] us near it's it's a it's a it's a difficult business it really is I tell you a little a little bit

[02:06:26] about the company was August Johnson cabinet company and during the war they made caskets for the

[02:06:33] United States Army they were turned into you know they you talk about what we did during the war

[02:06:40] there was one of our suppliers that in the war effort built cabinets caskets

[02:06:46] which I thought was very interesting and yeah that that's almost a little weird

[02:06:54] well you know didn't bought cabinets not too far from the casket yeah well right you are

[02:07:00] all right way was there anything else that you'd like to add no I don't know I got so many stories

[02:07:08] you know and I just can't think of them until they ask questions then I can oh yeah that brings

[02:07:13] up out but okay well I really want to thank you I really appreciate you spending the time with me

[02:07:20] especially Burke that was that was pushing me to call you said you got a call Wayne you got a call

[02:07:25] he's amazing guy you got a call well it's quite a guy to it who would have thought 20 years ago

[02:07:35] that there would be such a thing going on as an expo you know and now all these other

[02:07:41] guys around the country and around the world having these expoes is wonderful to keep the name

[02:07:49] the game pinball alive you know back when I was in the business early years pinball was a dirty word

[02:07:59] at at Western you know it was against a lot of making he pay off tables we're making pay off tables

[02:08:06] that was against the law and and the only way you could stay in business was to pay off the cops

[02:08:12] and and Jimmy we had a PA system at Western and every once in a while Jimmy go on a PA system

[02:08:21] to turn out all the lights and everybody be quiet no noise down there now keep absolutely quiet

[02:08:27] and and we know it's going to be a raid you know the cops are going to come and so we all be real quiet

[02:08:33] and not do anything and we sit there about an hour and then he come on and say okay let's go go

[02:08:39] to work down there lights on let's go and you know he paid off somebody it was it was a dirty word

[02:08:46] the pinball was dirty so did the cops ever did the cops ever come in oh I'd never seen a cop come

[02:08:52] but the threat was always there you know but I went to a I looked at a party one time I was

[02:09:03] I was married at the time so I was I don't think I was I guess I was designing I don't know but

[02:09:11] anyway I went to this party and the guys were all sitting on the back porch and and the women

[02:09:17] all in the front room talking and all the men are out talking and and we you know I talked with men

[02:09:22] talking we talk about our business what we do and so this guy is a doctor and this one's a lawyer

[02:09:27] and this one's this one is a that you know and everybody's bragging about all the money they make

[02:09:33] and and I'm sitting there I don't see nothing you know so funny if somebody says to me uh

[02:09:39] I think it was a lawyer's wing what do you do on it I say I make pinball machines

[02:09:45] wow he does me you go you're part of the mafia you're one of those guys the quicks you carry a gun

[02:09:51] you know and that's why you have any one is a cook around here it's you lawyers are the biggest

[02:09:56] crooks and so we almost ended up in a fight you know and it's over all over a lot of

[02:10:01] the pinball machine but they they at that time they they were looked down on you know I went to a

[02:10:08] I went to a dinner with my aunt's house one time thanks giving day dinner and I was uh
