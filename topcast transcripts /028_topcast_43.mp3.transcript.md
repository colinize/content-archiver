[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:20] Tonight on Topcast we've got a special guest that worked at Capcom as their

[00:24] sound engineer and sound man. He worked on such games as Pinwall Magic,

[00:29] Breakshot, Big Bang Bar, Airborne Invenders, Flipper Football, and then after Capcom Pinball

[00:36] he worked on Vacation America and also with incredible technologies and Mark Richey on the Orange

[00:42] County Chopper Video Pinball Project.

[00:52] So I'd like to welcome Jeff Powell to Topcast tonight to talk about his experiences working

[00:57] at Capcom as the sound engineer there and working on such games as Big Bang Bar.

[01:02] He's got some good stories to tell and we're going to give him a ring right now.

[01:15] Hello.

[01:16] Jeff?

[01:17] Yes.

[01:18] It's Clay. How you doing?

[01:20] So how long have you been doing this, Clay?

[01:22] Wait, who's interviewing you here?

[01:27] I was watching Larry King last night so I'm kind of in that mode.

[01:31] Remember I did 20 years of radio.

[01:34] Let's start at the beginning. I guess sound probably came before Pinball or did Pinball become

[01:39] before sound?

[01:40] Well, sound came in my childhood actually when I built my first little radio transmitter in

[01:48] sixth grade. I thought that same time was lost out to another guy in my class who got the lead

[01:54] role in Ikebod Crane's Legend of Sleepy Hollow which we did for the local or our sixth grade

[01:59] class did for the local radio station and I was relegated to the duties of croaking frogs

[02:06] and clinking glasses.

[02:09] So you were the rudimentary background rhythm sound guy?

[02:12] Yeah, that was, you know, when I look back I guess that was the ultimate start of my sound

[02:17] career. Obviously that was not a professional gig by any stretch.

[02:22] But I got into radio in college and got hooked and left electrical engineering for

[02:29] the radio and television program at the University of Illinois when they still had such a program

[02:34] in the college of communications and graduated out of there in 74.

[02:39] And by that time I had several years of on-air experience at WPGU and one of the other

[02:43] local stations down there in Champaign and basically stayed in radio for 20 years.

[02:48] I ultimately ended up at a number of Chicago stations. Radio was a very important part of my

[02:54] background and basically where I have learned to do a lot of stuff like music and sound effects.

[03:01] I had always wanted to mix music with media and at the time that I had landed in the Chicago

[03:09] market first at WDCB out of college and page I was starting to write tunes and pitching songs to

[03:17] publishers in Nashville. No major recordings but I certainly learned a lot by pounding the

[03:22] pavement on music row and learning how to write better song lyrics and write better commercial

[03:29] melodies, although it's pretty good writing melodies. WDCB then I finally got my first commercial

[03:34] radio gig in the city in Chicago and stayed there for another 10 years making rounds such stations

[03:41] as the old FM100, WOLAK ended up afternoons there for a while and a format change got shown

[03:53] the door and wound up at WOLS during the summer of 1989 while they were starting to get ready to

[04:01] change a format. I think in 1989 it went through three radio stations in four formats. It was quite

[04:08] a year for a people in terms of format changes in Chicago. Did you have a format that you liked?

[04:16] Yeah but I didn't get to do that format until the tail end of my radio career and that was at

[04:22] the Blaze where we were playing ACDC and Metallica and stuff like that. At FM100 I spent five years

[04:31] with elevator music even though we were the number three station in Chicago and I was doing

[04:36] morning drive for a couple years but I didn't get to play personality. It was quarter hour breaks

[04:41] and read the liner notes and do weather and news and pretty much just be a voice that was just

[04:47] incidental to the music and I hated the music. I can hold Montevani strings and 101 strings and

[04:55] Jack Jones occasionally when they finally started adding some vocals in and you know it was a good

[05:04] gig as far as longevity at any one place. Radio is such a trenchant industry as many people who

[05:13] know and so the fact that I stayed there five years was pretty remarkable. Now is the voice you're

[05:21] talking to us as is it your radio voice as it may be? No no well sort of I guess I

[05:31] know if I'm talking like this. It depended on the station or is that if it was FM100 the next time

[05:39] you feel like dialing a friend dial FM100 and I always wanted to change this liner card you hear

[05:45] it in Chicago lands finest restaurants and I wanted to go you hear it in Chicago lands finest

[05:50] restrooms. I never had the guts to do it and then I finally ended up at the Blaze where it was

[05:58] Jeff with a chance 103 five to Blaze. So um but obviously I'm not going to talk to you like that

[06:04] because I'd lose my voice by the end of uh 10 minutes. Why do radio shifts are they generally

[06:10] four hours maybe six at the most? Let me tell you at a place like a top 40 station like WLS

[06:16] and when I was there they were in the midst of changing from music to all talk so it's kind of

[06:25] in that in-between mode and and um I was there strictly as a pinch hitter I had one weekend

[06:32] air shift in the rest of the time that I was there for the six months that I was there was to

[06:37] fill in for other guys who either out job hunting or for the end when they ended up loading people

[06:44] like John Landecker finally go and I also filled in two days when they finally let Fred Winston out

[06:50] of his contract um and I was just there to fill in place of music and read the commercials and

[06:58] do some light talk but nothing heavy duty which was just fine with me because I wasn't really cut

[07:03] out for talk radio I was more of a music jock uh at that time. Why does it take a certain personality

[07:09] for the talk? Even even a music jock when you're in the hot seat for five hours and you only have

[07:16] enough time during a three minute record to run down the hall and down the hall maybe way down

[07:22] the hall and and there are a lot of stories from the old days of people getting locked out of

[07:27] studios infected happened to an old friend of mine they forgot to tell him one night that they

[07:32] had changed the door code and they had dead air for quite a while when he couldn't get back into

[07:37] the studio but when you're in the hot seat it's you know and you're having to come up with stuff to

[07:44] talk about and be bright and cheery and you're like god I'd rather be home sleeping you know

[07:52] it's a it's a bit of work and it takes a lot out of you after five hours so it's it's uh

[07:57] gets to be rather physical at times because you're really having to work your brain plus you're

[08:02] working the phones and sometimes you know in a format where if you've got to record listeners and

[08:07] win contests and stuff and you're constantly going back and forth trying to find commercials out

[08:12] of the rack behind you first morning I filled in for Fred Winston and I looked at the log and

[08:17] it and I'd been on radio 15 years well we've almost 16 years by that point and I'd never seen

[08:24] a commercial log so black so so filled with commercials I as I did that morning and I was so glad

[08:33] that we had floods going on so there are news guys had more to talk about and this and that

[08:38] because the phone lines were lit with people wondering what the hell happened to Fred Winston

[08:42] and I'm just doing all I can to just keep up finding the damn commercials in the rack to play

[08:47] them in time and you know as ones running out and just finding the next one and slamming it in the

[08:51] machine fall of 1991 was last time I was ever on the air live uh in Chicago uh in the rest of the

[08:59] time I've uh since then I've been doing uh jingles for a short time and then a friend of a friend

[09:05] passed along a blind ad uh for a company looking for a music composer and sound engineer

[09:13] and I think I still have that ad tucked away in a file somewhere and no indication of who the

[09:20] who this company was but two weeks later I'm walking in the door a capcom interviewing for a job

[09:26] and walked away with the job the job was uh yeah it was in Arlington Heights okay oddly enough

[09:32] in the building where I now work for incredible technologies so it was kind of a weird homecoming

[09:37] of sorts there but we'll get into that later so tell me about the capcom experience the capcom

[09:44] experience um I assume you never did any work for ballet or Williams or Gottlieb or any of the

[09:50] other pinball people no um I mean I was aware of machines but I really wasn't uh wasn't a

[09:57] fanatic pinball player through much of the 80s all of that passed me by because I was in radio

[10:02] I was where my I was in radio and I was trying to pitch tunes to publishers and artists and that's

[10:08] where my head was at the time and uh in the early 90s trying to expand my voiceover work until I

[10:15] had uh major jaw surgery and ended up spending most of a year doing speech rehab and uh that's

[10:24] that's tough but um once I got past that and uh was taking a look at where I stood as far as

[10:33] jingle production I was partnering with a guy Steve Weebie when I went through my speech rehab in

[10:39] 92 uh and early 93 I was really um having a lot of second thoughts about the jingle market because

[10:48] it was so fiercely competitive in Chicago and I was so underfunded in terms of my own

[10:57] keyboard equipment and software which really was terribly expensive at the time you know to buy

[11:04] a uh a one gig hard drive set you back about 1500 bucks at the time and uh we had no such things

[11:11] as DVD burners and things yet and so uh I you know and I was almost flat broke and so

[11:20] when this ad came through for a music composer I had done just enough industrial music and stuff

[11:25] and it put together a couple of music demos and I had learned how to do demos from all the voiceover

[11:30] stuff I had done in the past and and uh learning from uh some of the big name talent in Chicago and

[11:35] the way they had done their voiceover tapes and stuff so I learned to put together these three to

[11:40] five minute presentations that there were like non-stop music with you know short clips of all

[11:44] the stuff I had done and apparently that's what uh got me past the piles and piles of tapes that

[11:52] had come into the guys at Capcom and I and I really knew that you know I knew that they were probably

[11:57] gonna have all these piles because I had seen similar piles of tapes come into the publishers

[12:02] down in Nashville some of the guys showed me all these tapes that would come in from people you know

[12:06] all the wannabes and and I was very fortunate I'd been able to get in the door at a lot of places

[12:11] because I had you know enough stuff that was fairly credible um but it it's fairly competitive

[12:19] everywhere make this decision as to which way do I go send out this tape to this blind ad thought

[12:25] nothing of it it's like well it's gonna be another tape I won't hear from them and two weeks later

[12:30] I got a letterback saying well we'd like to interview you so I called him up and walked in and um

[12:36] interviewed with people like Python Angelo Mark Richie ultimately I ended up interviewing

[12:43] at length with Mark Richie and he offered me the job and it's like great so because I couldn't

[12:52] use the job at that point I was almost flat broke and it offered me an abrupt left turn

[12:59] out of this uh midlife crisis I guess and I never looked back on on radio other than I've kept

[13:06] some of the voiceover clients that I've had the I still do Andreanifers radio TV commercials and

[13:13] like I said if I am I've done some car commercials from time to time and I have do some other voice

[13:20] stuff for non-commercial stuff telephone information providers whatnot uh

[13:26] on hold advertising uh the lady uh out of Indiana that I still do work for so uh you'll hear

[13:33] me on a lot of veterinarian you know background music uh messages and uh doctor's offices and

[13:39] stuff like that around the country but um um those are things I still do on the side uh because

[13:45] it you know keeps my hand in a variety of things and kind of keeps me fresh and it brings in fun

[13:49] money for all the expensive uh gear that I like to have in my studio but Capcom was a wonderful

[13:57] learning lab because suddenly I was thrown into something I had never experienced before and that

[14:03] was a manufacturing environment I had never produced audio for a manufacturing environment before

[14:10] so I had to learn all about how to create little short files here I'm used to doing radio commercials

[14:16] and lengthy tracks for slight tape presentations that was you know before video was big and uh

[14:23] you know full length tune demos you know fully produced uh 24 track tune demos for pitching

[14:29] to publishers and stuff and suddenly I had to create these little short audio files with everything

[14:36] trimmed off because we had to fit everything into teeny tiny spaces on the prompt chefs I'd never

[14:40] worked with that before wow what an experience I even had to learn how to burn the damn things

[14:46] right burn the the prompt chefs I'd never done that before and um and learning you know just

[14:53] about the whole process of building a a game a mechanical device that uh ultimately used audio

[15:01] within it and uh audio that had to be synchronized to uh dot ma- dot matrix screen and uh audio that

[15:09] responded to uh mechanical switches and things this is this is this is like wow this is great this

[15:15] is cool you know when they finally slapped on the art and stuff however it was a very scary experience

[15:19] also because might they threw me into the fire on pinball magic yeah that was their first game and

[15:26] they basically said do it right yeah it was my very first coin up game ever now I've

[15:35] encountering by the end of the summer I'll probably have completed a hundred such projects

[15:39] over the course of my sound design career but that was game number one

[15:44] manny de la Taranty who uh had done goofy hoops and had started out with their sound designer

[15:49] and later went on into programming um got me started and taught me a lot of things about how to

[15:56] do short files and and uh we were also a capcom was trying to decide whether they were going to go

[16:05] with a sound card that had one channel of audio and one channel of midi sounds and um

[16:12] so I was trying to learn how to develop sounds for the midi chip uh and at the same time start

[16:19] getting some play field sound effects into the uh in ball magic game and I got a couple of uh

[16:24] tunes going uh that first summer uh I was hired there on July 11th of 1994 and that summer I got one

[16:33] or two tunes uh uh developed before I traced off to the Philippines to get married in uh

[16:39] September of that year but uh so they they do that was on the right track with the music and stuff

[16:46] uh you know I kind of got off to a good start there but well just to slow you down a little

[16:50] what is the actual progression like say like for pinball magic I mean did you write the theme music

[16:56] did you uh do any of the voices or did you have to hire talent to do you know obviously you

[17:01] are hired some talent to do some of the voices did you record them all what was the whole assembly

[17:06] process to make the whole thing happen well pinball magic um I try to remember all the voices I know

[17:12] that we used mark richie's life truity as the central magician and I forget what her name was now

[17:17] and I don't remember how many other voices I I think I did a few things in their

[17:21] christ grantor christ grantor came on board a little later on and added some things and I'll talk

[17:27] about that experience a little later on here but man he had taught me to you know write a piece of

[17:33] theme music first uh a general piece of music out of which would come the the main mode music and

[17:40] stuff like that uh and then the other themes would come later he had written one uh theme for one

[17:46] of the magicians which uh we ended up oh yeah actually I think wrote two pieces one didn't get into

[17:53] the other piece I had to rewrite because we discovered it was a way too close to the Batman theme

[18:00] oh we ended up rewriting that uh piece but I learned later that skipped the process of writing a

[18:08] main theme or full length main theme anyway I have a main theme sure but um you know a game like

[18:14] Big Bang Bar had so many different modes uh that um one theme just wasn't gonna do it for that kind

[18:21] of game so what do you do just write write maybe a couple hooks and then move everything around the

[18:26] hooks um and I think every project is a little different uh but a project and I'm thinking even

[18:34] more recently the orange county chopper's video pinball at credible technologies um you know I

[18:41] just kind of launched in with the first theme knowing that this game's gonna spread out and go

[18:45] variety of places and with its modes and depths and and in a game like that we had three virtual play

[18:51] fields so each play field had to have a whole different theme so I just didn't even worry about

[18:56] one main theme I just launched in the first theme that I think this is gonna be the opening theme

[19:00] ultimately uh uh that was the case but I tried out to spin my wheels too much I don't want to spend

[19:06] a whole lot of time developing one piece of music that the leader won't end up as a final in the game I

[19:13] you know it gets my ideas going and then I want to move on from there I want to you know produce a

[19:18] piece that I know is gonna go in the game and then move on to the next piece is gonna go in the game

[19:23] rather than uh develop something that ultimately will end up just as a demo piece well how do you write

[19:29] this I mean are you writing this on uh on a keyboard on a guitar are you doing this on a midi system

[19:35] how does this ultimately start out well the capcom days I was working on a Mac quadro six

[19:42] fifty I had studio vision as a midi and audio program at the time now I had that was another thing

[19:49] I had to learn to work with the Mac because I was a PC person up to that point and I had worked

[19:53] primarily with cakewalk and a couple of other programs but I had a rack with a number of rack modules

[20:01] and a keyboard I'm a keyboard person I wish I knew how to play guitar but I don't have the time

[20:06] or the patience to go back and learn it now I think I sometimes will start with a rhythm oftentimes

[20:12] with the melody first and work down from there and then fill in the arrangement because of the

[20:17] the various magicians I came up with the themes for all the different magicians and half of them

[20:22] never made it into the game because we didn't have enough room on the e-prom chips to fit all the stuff

[20:27] so only a few of the themes ultimately ended up in the game so it was sound digitizer is

[20:33] a midi eyes well starts a midi or a lot of my stuff does in midi in fact I 90% of the work I do

[20:44] is midi based to start but midi is merely you know midi is musical instrument digital interface

[20:53] and it is like the old player piano the midi data is like the holes on a player piano roll

[21:04] where the notes are stored which notes are played and as that roll plays it plays the piano

[21:10] right and a midi keyboard is like the piano the midi data is like the player piano roll

[21:15] and the computer that stores that data is like part of the player piano roll so that's kind of

[21:23] the analogy that I draw is midi is like a player piano of sorts yeah and depending on the computer

[21:29] that interprets the midi midi data it'll sound different based on different midi computers

[21:35] well depends on the instrument that you know is playing back that data if you're playing off a

[21:40] sound blaster sound card that's got a you know set of a midi instruments on it as opposed to say an

[21:47] older Roland card or Yamaha card yeah they've they're instruments they're they all

[21:56] stick pretty much the old Roland standard Roland was one of the early players in midi and set

[22:01] up the standard that everybody the general midi standard that everybody still holds to today

[22:07] to some degree but yeah the instruments do sound a little different but then you've got all of

[22:12] these rack modules over the years I've got a bunch of them here at home that probably should go

[22:17] on e-bay because they sit dark now but you know like the Alisa's D4 and the all kinds of old

[22:23] Roland boxes the U220 and the the JV 1080 and and the 5050 an older percussion which I probably won't

[22:31] sell from emu and I'm on the wave station and I've I've got an old D50 and a core gamma one and

[22:40] all these old keyboards and rack modules that I used to use in orchestral boxes that I had you know

[22:46] the emu virtual so I did and there was I have a lot of things here that I did not have when I

[22:52] started a capcom I had a JD 990 that was a Roland box and a wave station rack unit and a Kurt

[23:00] Swale 2000 K 2000 rack mount unit and then I had a midi keyboard controller made by Fitar and I

[23:08] think that was about it from my initial lineup and then oh and then I had a sample cell card

[23:13] from digit design and sample cell was the first sampler I ever used and so I was able to play

[23:22] all of that stuff out of studio vision and then we record back the finals into sound designer 2

[23:32] which was the 4Runner 2 the current Pro Tools software and this is all done on the Mac

[23:39] yeah yeah that was all done on the Mac on the PC side it was starting to learn how to use

[23:44] sound forge which I still use today although I have to say in a sidebar the Sony has a little

[23:49] work to do on cleaning up the erratic behavior of sound forge 9 but I'll stop there they've added

[23:57] some wonderful things to that program but they've also tweaked and mucked and I've got a lot of

[24:02] people upset including myself right now some things aren't working quite the way they were in that

[24:05] program but it remains my my mains with Army knife as far as soundfile editing and manipulating

[24:13] effects and stuff like that you know midi starts with the midi data and it plays midi instruments

[24:18] and the audio output of those various rack mounts keyboards and nowadays virtual software synthesizers

[24:28] all of that gets recorded into an audio recording program somewhere and so audio is audio and midi

[24:34] is midi and they're they're two separate things and in fact if you look in my studio or any audio

[24:40] studio you'll have three sets of cabling one for power one for midi and another set of cables

[24:45] for audio and I have miles and miles and miles of cable I exaggerate a little bit but probably a

[24:51] mile of cable in my little studio at home and for audio power and midi. So on the cap counter

[25:05] comes soundboard then there's a midi channel and then there's a digitized audio channel then

[25:10] the digitized audio is for voice right well yeah I did have a I did have a little mixboard come

[25:16] to think of it I had a Mackie mixer 1604 was the original 1604 line they've now gone through

[25:25] a couple of major reincarnations of that board and the version three is a wonderful little field

[25:32] mixer I have one of those but what but the advantage to the midi is that the sound files are

[25:39] very very small compared to like digitized sound data right problem with the midi and this

[25:45] is going back to the decision that Capcom was trying to make between using a a sound card that had

[25:49] one audio channel that we would have used for speech and certain sound effects and a midi channel

[25:55] that would have been used for just music the problem with that is that when they decided to go with

[26:00] two audio channels only I went yay now we can make this sound like AM radio and somebody looked

[26:07] at me and said well I am radio isn't that great a quality I said wait a minute if I can do

[26:12] everything in audio that means I can process all of this audio and punch it up and make it sound

[26:19] much bigger and fuller and livelier than I could ever do with a midi instrument in other words

[26:25] one of the things I really learned how to use was a compressor and that's what makes everything

[26:30] bigger and it takes me back to radio because if you stop and think if if if you've known somebody

[26:35] you've talked to in person and that person you hear them on the radio they sound different

[26:41] and it's because radio compresses the hell out of everything everything is loud as the engineers

[26:46] can make it because you want to be the loudest thing in the dial and so everything's run through

[26:51] limiters and compressed and that's what fattens up a lot of the sound yeah when I when I was a kid

[26:57] that and playing playing guitar my one of my main tools was an MXR DynaComp which was a compressor

[27:04] I always thought it made a lot more intense and a lot more bold oh yeah and so it is a must

[27:13] in a sound engineers toolkit as far as the mastering process goes and I hadn't really learned to

[27:22] use that too much in my jingle days I was working with other engineers and they would end up doing

[27:29] that in the studio but and and as far as radio stuff we never used it on on the commercial stuff

[27:35] because the stuff that went out on the air got compressed in the final stage so we never had to do

[27:40] it there but now suddenly I'm thrust into a the arena where I had to master everything I did

[27:47] and when they made the decision to go audio only eat all they had was only two channels

[27:54] and in the case of the break shot game we only had a single channel to work with and we'll get to

[27:58] those challenges in a moment also I keep putting all these things up for a moment hopefully we can

[28:02] remember to tie these threads up but two channels two channels of audio allowed me to do much punchy

[28:09] or things and then a single channel of audio and MIDI and I ended up working with such a system

[28:14] later after the Capcom experience when I went to work on slot machines at anchor they had they had

[28:19] such a beast yeah and it was like oh gosh so Capcom did did use the two audio channels and

[28:28] and didn't do any MIDI channel pinball magic went out with two audio channels and break shot which

[28:36] was the game one of the games right behind that they they did airborne Chris Granar had come on

[28:39] board to help me finish up the choreography and add a few sounds on pinball magic when when

[28:48] we first got an introduce and after you listen to what I had done in the game he said well you know

[28:52] you've done 90 percent of the game already I was still kind of looking over my shoulder because

[28:57] I was still kind of shaky on choreography pinball is not an easy platform and to this day

[29:04] I still think pinball is the most difficult platform bar none to to produce interactive audio

[29:13] interactive meaning things that have to change on the fly even more so than console games much

[29:20] as I would love to do console games and write great thematic orchestral scores and stuff and I

[29:25] haven't been able to break over into that yet but I and yes the the sheer number of files that go

[29:32] into a console game and you know the amount of music it's much larger but I think in terms of

[29:38] designing for interactivity because pinball is so fast and so random and you have points where in

[29:46] some games the storyline can go one of seven different directions sometimes and you have to make

[29:55] this thing happen all with a seamless wall of sound kind of I kind of take the full specter

[30:01] approach and all the old wall of sound idea from the 60s and my other matras everything is loud as

[30:10] possible so I you know I was kind of looking over my shoulder thinking am I making the grade here

[30:18] and I don't know if I'm quite getting this choreography right on pinball magic and Chris came

[30:24] along and helped me shore up some of the final details on it and once we got through that project

[30:29] they let me fly solo on break shot which was a single channel game so that meant everything

[30:36] that played interrupted everything else so there could be no overlap no there there no and

[30:43] anything that played cut off whatever was playing before that's a trip so I had to learn how to

[30:50] I had to learn how to tighten up speeches squeaky tight as I could make it shave off the ends

[30:56] you know the tails of speech files and then do a slight time compression on every speech file

[31:04] 20 to seven to get to ring out an extra 20 to 70 milliseconds of time out of each speech file

[31:12] because when we got done with that game and I ended up the time I believe it was two minutes and 56

[31:18] seconds of total audio in the break shot game and that was it so they did it was that like a

[31:24] cost cutting thing they used a different soundboard to save some money I think it was the same

[31:30] soundboard they were just cutting costs everywhere else in the game somebody told me later that the

[31:34] out we the game was capable of playing two channels gosh that's a 20 to fail question I think it

[31:40] had to do with the the chip and the way we loaded stuff and we're only they were only allowing us

[31:45] to play one one channel out of that so that was it and and then and I started work on big bang bar

[31:55] right after that big bang bar was the third game I worked on well now before we get the big bang bar

[32:00] on break shot there was some pretty sexy speech going on in break shot right yeah yeah um

[32:09] a list of a straw I I'd listen to her in the office and I felt she was an natural for that

[32:15] and then Chris Granger did the male voice in that game and I I played the part of the

[32:23] moose bulldoom rubber the old the rocking bullwinkle stick how do you find voice talent for

[32:31] for these games I mean yeah you know how do you get these people well we could have hired them

[32:36] through agencies and pinball magic we didn't hire anyone from the outside from the outside world

[32:42] I generally I like to try and use people from the office but a lot of times that fails miserably

[32:51] in games that you've you've heard countless games where you can't understand the speech or

[32:55] somebody's you know really stiff or whatever in some games companies will pay an exorbitant

[33:01] amount of higher and outside talent through an agency to you know do sound alike you know

[33:06] characters stuff like that Fred young I used to know Fred downtown he's he's done a lot of

[33:11] pinball games for people where he's done the Star Wars Star Trek characters and stuff like that

[33:16] we were not doing licensed themes and so I felt well here's a chance to get some people in the office

[33:24] actually in the game although it's a lot more work and I really have to direct them kind of

[33:30] Suzuki method where I'll read the line it's like here here's how I'm gonna read the line repeat

[33:35] after me and do it this way and some people are more tone tone deaf than others and they can't

[33:40] quite get the pitch right and I'll have to do it like 40 takes until I get them to say the line

[33:44] just right and sometimes even then I'll maybe take a piece of a phrase from this take and a

[33:50] piece of a phrase from that take and put those pieces together to get what I want but I am the

[33:57] editing king so I'll modest the aside so it's a little more work but that way I get the people I

[34:06] work with involved in the game more and that's kind of fun but you know if we if we if time was

[34:13] a consideration which it didn't seem to be so much in my world in Capcom till till crunch time

[34:20] at the end and then yeah I was always praying for slippage and some of the other departments but

[34:24] I didn't have to worry so much about time and getting the speech together early on in the games

[34:32] and I didn't have to worry about sounding like some character in a movie or something like that so

[34:37] I could rely more on the the office talent and direct them and and in the case of flipper football

[34:47] we actually got about 150 of the people from the office in the warehouse and the manufacturing area

[34:52] out onto the back loading dock for a two hour shouting match where I had them shouting and singing

[34:58] various chants and we ended up mixing that into soccer crowd sound effects to get the the game so

[35:07] I had about 150 people from the office come out and help me on that game which was a lot of fun

[35:13] now one thing that people constantly ask is like I you know they want to change the sounds and

[35:19] their pinball machine and their basement is that possible at all or is that just like unbelievable

[35:24] amount of work and time and energy you mean actually sticking their own music and stuff yeah

[35:29] or their own voice that would take probably reprogramming I think that's a Tony to fail question I

[35:36] think or Bill foot's and writer you know foot's you know when everything's burned into an e-prom chip

[35:44] it's it's pretty much cast and stone whereas the newer console games you know software today

[35:53] allows and Microsoft of course encourages it which is why they don't want to pay bands anything

[35:58] for royalties to be in their games which I think is not good for musicians but nonetheless

[36:09] you know when you got console games with software designed to allow you to stick in your own

[36:12] music that's one thing but electro mechanical games with e-proms you know things were programmed in

[36:22] you'd have to be a programmer I think to be able to make your own changes so you wouldn't even be

[36:27] able to do that no I I'm not a programmer so I would I wouldn't and besides which I've got

[36:34] better things to do you did it once you don't need to do it twice no I mean I you know I I

[36:41] designed a game how I I think it should be or where wherever the inspiration of the day took me

[36:47] or where the game designer wanted it to go ask for something specific or however the

[36:55] talent I was working with the speech talent did something you know there's a lot of experimentation

[37:02] as far as doing the music and sound effects and stuff and we stick things in and try and see if

[37:06] it works and a lot of days it's magical and some days something's just like God that really sucks

[37:11] we got it you know take that out but you know it's much like building a whitewood you know you can

[37:19] draw it and think you've got all the mechanical stuff happening on on your drawing and then when

[37:26] you go to stick those things in gosh you know you end up putting up a lot of screw holes because

[37:32] things just didn't work so trial and error and when when a game finally goes out the door and

[37:41] everything's pretty cohesive it's in my mind it's the best I felt I could do at the time now

[37:48] big bang bar came around again would I do it the same way probably not but it's like a lot of

[37:54] artists who come back it's like Leila you know it's it didn't get re-recorded the same way the

[38:00] second time around so whatever it was at that time it was the best we felt we could do and

[38:09] if you know everybody liked it that way and great but you know if somebody wants to change something

[38:14] well I think in a pinball game you'd have to be a programmer to change the chip or add some

[38:21] component that would allow you to you know when something fired off something allow you to play

[38:27] it off in an additional audio component that you stick in the game or something but well tell me

[38:32] about big bang bar okay well let's start with the sound how did you write the you know the bass

[38:39] music for it and the whole progression through the you know the soundtrack and everything you had

[38:44] to go through and and of course all this the sexy girl talk who are they and where they come from

[38:51] yeah yeah everybody wants to know about the tube dancer um all right backing up I know when

[38:57] Rob Morrison started working on that game and he was a big fan of filter and so he had me pull out

[39:03] a filter to and I can't remember the name of it but I can certainly remember how the two you know

[39:06] Lee were yelling screaming on the on the record on this tune and so we stuck that in just as a

[39:11] placeholder for oh it was in there for several weeks and I remember that Stan Foucault

[39:19] the artist the main artist on the project went through quite a number of different drawings and

[39:24] and it started as a very serious tone and ultimately became very whimsical on him and and it was

[39:31] really fun to watch Stan's drawing Stan's a great artist I really enjoyed working with him and

[39:36] I would love to work with him again someday I ran into him a couple years ago at pinball x-bone and

[39:43] was kind of a pretty neat reunion of sorts but when it started to take on the whimsical tone

[39:52] it's like yes this this is great I started to think back to and I'm gonna start showing my age

[39:58] here but I was I was a child of the 60s you know grew up in the late 50s and 60s and I started

[40:06] thinking back to old tv shows like lost in space and twilight zone and men into space and my

[40:12] favorite martian and stuff like that and all the in the jetsons and I started thinking spoofs on

[40:19] old 60s sci fi that's that's where the music should go and so that's exactly what I did and I had

[40:27] all these wonderful samples and things and instruments that would produce some of these wonderful

[40:32] things that the Kurzweil k 2000 was kind of a you know it's a synthesizer and sampler and I was

[40:41] able to get some unique effects out of that the JD 990 I was also working with the Yamaha TG 500

[40:47] which had just come out a couple years before that the synthesizer you know rack module and they

[40:55] had some interesting effects on there I started writing tunes that were more kind of spoofs on

[41:03] 1960s science fiction and and so you know when you first fire up the game the shooter grew in the

[41:10] main play tune that's that was that's kind of the where you know once I did those tunes that was

[41:17] the direction now you said that today you might change some things what did what did you mean by that

[41:24] well I you know I have a whole different set of tools software synthesizers are different there's

[41:30] there's a much much greater palette of special sound effects and things that I and synthesizers that

[41:39] that do all kinds of unique and weird and fun things that it would probably take on a very

[41:44] different sound now because of the technology you know where technology is gone but I would probably

[41:51] still do a very spoofy very campy theme if if the art stayed the same but you know we all we

[42:00] draw from personal experiences and this was 11 years ago looking at my speech list which was

[42:09] the last thing I did July 9th of 1996 of the date on this list well tell me more about the women

[42:17] big bang bar the women well let's see we had for the longest time I kept remembering eight characters

[42:26] in this game actually there is a ninth which I had forgotten about when I interviewed with Michael

[42:33] Shalube when he was writing his book there is a ninth character who has one line and that is Denise

[42:40] Walner who was our dot matrix she was in charge of the dot matrix art staff and I had her come in

[42:47] and scream at the top of her lungs the looped in space line in the game guys who must have done that

[42:53] maybe 20 times and finally got to take that I liked there are eight main characters in the game

[42:58] there's Ray the bartender the doorman the waitress the two aliens the female patron the DJ and of

[43:06] course the tube dancer which I had forgotten till I pulled out this list today out of my box my

[43:12] old box of calf com files and stuff we had named her moaning Lisa that's what I have on my sound

[43:20] sheet moaning Lisa Mary Kinnahenn with her name she had originally worked from Mark Richie as his

[43:27] assistant and we pulled her in or I pulled her into the studio or Astrid to come in I like run

[43:34] on the hologram her say Mary I asked her if she would be interested in doing this and mentioned

[43:40] who are there there may be some slightly suggestive lines which she which she have any problems doing

[43:44] that because we all knew that she was she seemed to be a rather conservative person but you know

[43:51] she had she had this voice that I kept thinking you know I got to use her somewhere in this game

[43:56] even though again she's not a trained voice talent by any way we did hire one person from the

[44:01] outside her name was Anita and she did the she did the waitress the the Jewish sounding you know

[44:10] gum chewing waitress who goes you at the end when the alien does his gack splat at the end right

[44:19] the splat on the on the match yeah on the match I was looking at the sound list I think I called

[44:26] that file gack splat so she did all those lines Anita did all the waitress lines but Mary did the

[44:36] tube dancer and I told the guys on the design staff particularly Mark Richie I said this

[44:46] has got to be a closed door session it's just going to be Mary and me in the studio I don't want

[44:51] any interruption on this one I don't want people hanging around because I wanted her to get into

[44:58] the character without being distracted or guys you know making snide remarks and then I would never

[45:04] get anything out of her and it took a lot of coaxing to kind of get her into it and I don't know

[45:10] how many takes we did I don't have the original audio traction that all those things ended up on

[45:15] M.O. discs that probably got tossed out somewhere a capcom what why didn't you just go to the local

[45:21] strip club and get a dancer I I don't know Mary was definitely not that kind of person but I was

[45:29] able to but she had the type of voice where I was able to coax her into it and the other thing

[45:37] that was kind of fun with that is that the ooze and the Oz and the music came off of a track off

[45:46] of one of the Hollywood edge sound libraries there was a track on there with a female having an

[45:51] orgasm and I was able to pull the ooze and you know the mones off of that and put them into the

[45:57] rhythm of the music and after EQing and doing some processing to Mary's voice as they want to make

[46:04] the two sound very much alike so a lot of people have gone that's all the same person right I said

[46:11] no I don't know who the person is who did the the ooze and the Oz and the that I used in the tune

[46:16] that was on that was stock library stuff that I had manipulated a little bit cut up and edited

[46:22] and processed a little and I was able to EQ and and and get them to sound very much alike so

[46:31] um Mary heard herself like a week or two later in the game she walked into an office where we

[46:37] were playing in the game somebody got into the mode and she just turned bright red it was like

[46:42] it was like oh hi and but um to this day she remains one of the most popular characters in that

[46:50] game so whether she knows it or not huh I don't I don't know if she knows it or not but um you

[46:56] know people ask me about the tube dancer all the time um we did have one other female in the game

[47:02] and her name was Grace and I can never remember her last name I know that Steve Sabota I think

[47:08] had it on his website when he was running that contest uh your so-go and about naming the

[47:13] characters in the game and um it was it was some long Polish name and she had an Eastern European

[47:21] accent it was just I always was attracted to her accent and I thought and I got to use her in a

[47:28] game and she had a nice sounding voice but again she was not a trained voice actor and I really had

[47:33] to work the Suzuki method on her and but um well what's the Suzuki method? Suzuki method in uh it's

[47:43] often used with violin students where the teacher will uh play something and then uh the student is

[47:49] supposed to imitate the the teacher and that's the Suzuki method it's like do what I do or you know

[47:56] play it like I play it and so I'll read a line you know and uh you get a little gravel in the

[48:00] voice that we call it vocal fry you know that's sultry oh you know I I like to fly big rockets

[48:06] was one of the lines that I had Grace do and uh it took her a long time to get get the right

[48:13] sultry sound I was looking for but she finally nailed one and uh I think that's uh I think I did hear

[48:18] that in the game recently when I got the play on one of the reproductions uh down on playfield

[48:23] recently that uh Gene Cunningham and uh built okay we're going to take a little break from talking

[48:28] with Jeff Powell and we backed after this message the pin game journal is a proud sponsor of

[48:33] Topcast it covers pinball like no other publication can the pin game journal is America's only pinball

[48:39] publication whether you're looking for new games or the classics reports on industry shows or

[48:44] collector expos insights on a game you want or features to help you fix the game you've got

[48:49] pin game journals for you their website is at pingamejournal.com all right we're back with Jeff

[48:56] Powell from Capcom pinball it was some more of his stories okay there's more stories from Big Bang Bar

[49:03] one of the other you know the rate of our tender was certainly a central uh character in the game

[49:08] and four weeks guys have been saying you know we we got to put Davy Jones Davy Jones was the

[49:14] head of our security at Capcom he was he was the he was kind of a a portly uh gentleman who um

[49:23] lived in the back office by the uh the entrance to the plant where we all walked in and uh

[49:30] when when you talk to him he sounded a bit like Ray Charles and he had this infectious laughter

[49:37] he was just a funny guy really enjoyed talking with him uh and that's why everybody wanted to

[49:42] have Davy in one of our games and when when we finally got to the whimsical

[49:48] turn in the art that Stan was developing for the game when we knew it was going to take on a more

[49:53] comical aspect uh that's when I started thinking all right Davy Jones should be the uh Ray the

[50:02] bartender and uh I this must have been a weekend I did this with him I I guess because I recall

[50:10] nobody being around in the building and it had it have been on like kind of Saturday we put him

[50:15] in uh what's called a whisper room and that was our our sound booth that we used for recording

[50:20] voice stuff and uh uh again the Suzuki method I talked about earlier I'd be kind of like throwing

[50:29] my arms in the air you know to uh show more uh animation to his delivery and uh by the time we

[50:39] got to lines like shake it baby shake it baby I had him jumping up and down on the chair and it

[50:43] was so funny I wish I had a videotape of it it was just like it just had this memory of going

[50:48] uh just let it fly baby and and gosh what were some of the other lines lines like if you're willing

[50:53] to pay I'm willing to pour and uh gosh what are some of the other lines uh come on drink up let's go

[51:00] baby let's go uh that was in the um that was like hurry up modes and gosh what were some of the other

[51:08] lines I was I played two characters in that game I did the door man um what are you waiting for

[51:15] and and uh you know Ray wants to see you at the bar and I actually then pitched me down just a little bit

[51:21] um you know player one is that your beater getting towed and other stuff like that and then uh

[51:30] I also played alien two I kept thinking it was alien one but when I pull out the script today and I

[51:34] realized which lines were which it's like oh yeah okay I did things like let's scan for babes and um

[51:42] looks like an asteroid to me she's got more likes in a lunar lander and uh oh yeah one of my

[51:48] favorites look at the planets on that load of boomba stuff like that and then I would you know I

[51:56] I would pitch I I recorded it in a higher voice and then ran it through a ring modulator to get

[52:01] the effect on me and then Frank panthic did alien one all the way at the DJ um Darryl Williams

[52:08] uh came from the video site street fighter alpha it's like come on Jeff

[52:12] name here so Darryl was working with that stuff and he did our uh DJ with the on the in the

[52:20] dot matrix screen uh we did a tilt upward on the DJ and and he's got an afro from here to way

[52:27] out of space you know right it's kind of funny to look at it's pretty good and then what was

[52:33] the other that was pretty much it eight characters it was Ray the door man the waitress the aliens one

[52:39] and two the female patron the DJ the tube dancer and then that one line from Denise Walner the

[52:46] looped in space which uh that was an aim I came up with um they were trying to figure out what the

[52:51] name this one mode um it was like a random mode and I forgot what the skill shot I I believe it

[53:00] involved loop shots and uh nobody was coming up with a name and you know in my usual sick radio

[53:06] joke style I just said oh a looped in space you know and Ray kind of looked at me like yeah well

[53:13] they thought about it a while I think Rob Morrison was like kind of so so on it nobody could come

[53:19] up with another name for it so it finally stuck he'll looped in space so that was my one contribution

[53:26] to naming modes in the game well it sounds like it was a good product that's all you had a lot of

[53:32] fun with Big Bang Bar yeah a lot of I had a ball with that game joyed working with the whole team

[53:37] on it and then and uh Paul Mazer and the rest of the art guys did such a great job on the art it

[53:45] was such a departure from the usual heavy reds and blacks you know with with the blues and greens

[53:51] of you know a little more pastel and just the the fun nature of the game um I just wish it could

[53:58] have gone to manufacturing when it was supposed to have but uh I'm happy to see reproductions out

[54:04] there and and you know more people being able to enjoy that game and and it certainly came to a

[54:10] surprise to me when Steve's boat of called me up last year you're in a half ago and and said

[54:19] do you know you have a fan club out there that's like what?

[54:25] like cheese such a surprise I had no idea that a game that never got manufactured initially would

[54:33] generate the buzz that it has and again I think partly because it didn't get manufactured

[54:39] right yeah what led to the hype and the buzz and the interest in the game no it's a good it's

[54:45] a really good game I mean I mean it's still there's only 180 you know less than 185 of them out

[54:52] there so there's still or believe me there's still a good buzz yeah I was getting one of the guys

[54:59] talk I guess the other guy at cutting hands places and saying you know the cutting any of those

[55:03] left he said now somebody just bought the last one for 12 grand I was like oh a little too rich for my

[55:10] blood you know some guys buy games and I put all my money into musical instruments and audio

[55:19] gear and I've got thousands and thousands and thousands of stock library sound effects that I've

[55:24] acquired over the years probably close to 40 thousand sound effects in my collections of libraries

[55:30] so that's that's what I've been collecting is because that's you know those are my tools what do

[55:35] you know about Williams trying to acquire Big Bang Bar all I know is from Python who said yeah

[55:43] Williams bought it up and then they dumpstered the whole thing and it's like okay Python tends to

[55:48] exaggerate and change the facts a lot I think and one never knows what's truth and what's fiction

[55:56] yeah it was supposed to be a filler game right before 2000 and they thought well we need a game we

[56:02] need a game now we need a game that's done so they they brought Big Bang Bar at least I don't know

[56:08] about Kingpin in house and they thought it would be easy to modify the Capcom design to to Williams

[56:14] hardware and it turned out it really wasn't and they kind of gave up it was taking too much energy

[56:19] you know and now you just taught me a thing today yeah I hadn't heard all that part of it but that

[56:26] doesn't surprise me because yeah essentially we'd become two different worlds and even though

[56:33] with a lot of ex-Williams people designing stuff but they kind of went in a direction they

[56:38] had wanted to go that Williams wouldn't go although our audio I think was quite a bit inferior

[56:46] well they had basically rewrite all the software do redo everything in Williams on the Williams

[56:52] hardware system because you know they weren't going to sell Capcom boards in a Williams game and it

[56:56] just got to be to the point where I think it was more work than it was to actually design a game

[57:02] so that's why cactus Canyon came out instead of you know them trying to adopt either one of these

[57:07] games well and Tom Capira mentioned I think yeah cactus Canyon they even had to cut that one short

[57:17] right he needed a few more weeks and they told him that you don't have anymore weeks

[57:24] because they were getting ready to in fact I guess they even cut off the production run on that one

[57:30] to get the 2000 series out right what did you think of the Gene Cunningham reissue project

[57:36] it plays pretty well I score very terribly on it but because it's a pretty fast game or at least

[57:42] you know Rob Rob Sabaski his game he's got a set pretty good tilt and it's a fast game

[57:50] but were you happy that that project finally finally came to light?

[57:54] yeah ultimately I know there was some mixed feelings I think part of it because Gene had

[58:00] contacted too many people from the original design staff about it I think Rob Morrison was head

[58:08] I think he had mixed feelings about it but I don't know I'm glad that a few more people get to enjoy

[58:15] what we had done and I certainly hope that perhaps one of those units someday we'll find its way

[58:25] into the pinball hall of fame so even more people can go out and play on it at some point

[58:29] right huh I mean I'm all for entertaining people and I don't want to keep these things bottled up

[58:36] that's why I was really disappointed when incredible technologies decided not to produce

[58:42] you know manufacture the Orange County choppers video pinball that Mark Richey had worked so hard on

[58:47] and we managed to get it completed but again there's another one several people it's been

[58:54] several years working on that game and then only six units went out to test you know they're

[59:00] sitting in the warehouse now and what was the problem there that they didn't want to bring that to

[59:04] market cost you know Elaine looked at the cost of the manufacturer limited run and decided no

[59:11] just too costly to do it's like oh okay gosh I hope one of those will find its way to

[59:18] a museum someday also but I don't know what Elaine's plans are now how was it working for Python

[59:27] how was it working with Python yeah let me do my favorite imitation this was early in the

[59:34] pinball magic game he comes by my office door people who know Python know that he's a very animated

[59:41] person he kind of fails his arm he talks with his hands a lot and you know he's either Transylvanian

[59:48] and just very flamboyant and his eyes just very big like horses eyes you know and he's dancing

[59:57] outside of my office going Jeff you've got to vibrate the covenant more like okay I guess that

[01:00:06] means I got to stick more rumble and thunder into this game but it was just I never forget him doing

[01:00:12] that he's an interesting character I learned a few things from him he's got his detractors out there

[01:00:20] people love him or hate him I had to love him because he was one of the people responsible for

[01:00:24] hiring me a capcom I believe nobody's ever told me exactly who made the final decision but he

[01:00:32] was certainly in on the interviewing process and and also he's introduced me to other game developers

[01:00:39] even since capcom and so you know I give him a lot of credit but you know I whenever I've worked

[01:00:48] with him I have to kind of pull the reins in and say Python out here sit down you know tell me how

[01:00:53] you want this you know and then he's up and out of somewhere else he's one of those types who's

[01:00:58] bouncing off five walls and it's hard to nail him down and stuff but certainly has a lot of great

[01:01:05] ideals what what can I say Python is Python and a lot of guys have heard a lot of stories and they're

[01:01:10] always fun to hear about Python about his antics and and misadventures and whatnot and I certainly

[01:01:19] wish him well at the bay tech where he's been hiding out the last year and a half or so I don't

[01:01:28] know what all he's cranked out up there but and and also to his credit one game that we worked on

[01:01:35] post capcom called wacky ducks little game still selling I still makes the game and they're still

[01:01:43] buying them and every now and then I see a little royalty check come in and so it's like wow

[01:01:49] cool so now did you work on Python's singing bingy game at all you would have to ask about zingy

[01:01:59] bingy had to ask I'm gonna say publicly the crisp banner came to me and very diplomatically said

[01:02:08] he did not want to work on that game so being the only other sound designer at capcom I said well

[01:02:14] okay I guess we never got to a point where there was any audio done on that on the prototype of

[01:02:21] that game so I was kind of relieved because I had misgivings about that project and the level of

[01:02:31] adult material and I really felt that I had come to work on games that were more family oriented

[01:02:38] and I really I really like working on kids projects kids are fun to entertain and easy to

[01:02:46] entertain I guess but it's fun to do games that are oriented towards kids the thing I liked about

[01:02:52] our other cap capcom games is it was yeah we could stick in some adult stuff you know like in big

[01:02:59] bang bar but it was still family enough that you know when I watch some teams walk up to it and

[01:03:05] react to some of the characters you know and and make sarcastic comments back at the characters

[01:03:10] while they're playing it was like oh this is cool I really like the interaction that's going on

[01:03:14] here and I don't think we would have had that same kind of interaction with zingy bingy had that

[01:03:21] gotten any further now python claims that that was more like not so much an adult theme he called it

[01:03:28] more of a you know male and female game you know kind of like something that would be good for you

[01:03:34] and your girlfriend to play I mean and claims that it's not pornographic in any way shape or form

[01:03:40] I mean was that like just his perception are you saying that maybe that's not quite that that's

[01:03:46] certainly surprises me but you know I could understand I can kind of hear python saying something

[01:03:55] like that and trying to be very diplomatic about it but many of us looked at as being very adult

[01:04:02] and that's all I'll describe it as something that was very adult certainly would not have passed

[01:04:12] as a general audience who are family oriented game so if you were going to give it like a movie

[01:04:19] rating it would be like PG PG 13 type thing R or X oh really yes that would have been my

[01:04:31] that would have been my vote if I were on the rating committee are certainly so can you tell me

[01:04:38] any more about this I thought we were going to talk about big bang bar well you got this ball rolling

[01:04:46] is no net sense stopping it well you know if if have you ever talked to foot he's the one who was

[01:04:53] programming on that he's the one who could tell you all about zingy bingy because he had it working

[01:05:00] in his office and could describe it much better than I could I kind of like came in and looked at it

[01:05:06] and like okay I was still shoring up on I think I was still working on flipper football at the time

[01:05:14] that was coming around and so I was kind of like gosh I don't know where this is going to go

[01:05:23] so but you had none you had done music for but no no speech there was no audio to the best of

[01:05:30] my knowledge there was no audio done for that game in any way shape or form well unless

[01:05:36] unless I've forgotten may have given foot some some audio from some other game and we just stuck it

[01:05:42] on as a placeholder but I don't remember doing anything specifically for that game you know from

[01:05:49] scratch right so yeah although had we had the doors they stayed open a capcom a little bit longer

[01:05:59] maybe you know python was really pushing it but I think you know king pin was being worked on at the time

[01:06:10] flipper football just got gotten out the the door and you know they had traded places on the order

[01:06:16] of manufacturing the big bang bar was supposed to have gone out before flipper football and python and

[01:06:24] others managed to do their political muster and get the order reversed thinking that they could

[01:06:32] sell more flipper footballs right away over in europe I think was the thinking behind that but you

[01:06:37] know don't quote me too much that's how I recall and I was kind of removed from the you know

[01:06:44] political hierarchy I'd close my door and do my thing and let the world walk past my office kind of

[01:06:50] but and so big bang bar and we got produced because the doors closed and of course king pin they

[01:06:57] managed to get it finished before the you know the final hammer fell but mark richi had asked me

[01:07:05] to and I was already working on musical concepts for a gun game at the time and asked me to do

[01:07:12] something all our star wars and so I kept working on that piece of music actually finished the

[01:07:17] seven minute piece of music knowing that we were probably going to be history and I was trying to get

[01:07:21] uh you know whatever I could do done on the music knowing that his game probably would never

[01:07:28] get off the drawing board which was uh what ultimately happened how did they the whole

[01:07:33] impulsion of capcom come about there was a lot of writing on the wall uh remember in october of

[01:07:41] 96 they let the first wave of engineers go I think there were 20 people they let go

[01:07:47] and I remember grace uh I'd used the voice talent was one of those let go and there were some

[01:07:52] others and and it was pretty sad day and a real Paul had come over the company and I remember

[01:07:57] sending out an email company wide saying you know we need to like pull together here guys and uh

[01:08:02] although I you know I didn't know I was going on at the top um there are Williams who knew a

[01:08:08] little more of the inside stuff stopped by my office one day and and uh said well yeah suge moto

[01:08:14] when they they first set this up they knew that um they had to be prepared to go about a hundred

[01:08:19] million in the red possibly and and that point by october of 96 sterile told me they were already

[01:08:25] about 60 million in the red so it's like aches so in December that year when they pulled the plug

[01:08:35] on a lot of the rest of us you know that was a very dark day and um and then there were a number of

[01:08:42] people who were there under contract who stayed through to the following march of uh of uh 97 but um

[01:08:51] yeah it was it was it was a sad time do you think it would have survived if big bang bar had

[01:08:57] trumped out flipper football i don't really know for sure i had heard from some people who felt

[01:09:04] that had we got in big bang bar out the door it might have saved the company but you know pinball

[01:09:10] was in such a downhill flight for everyone uh you know Williams included at that point uh and

[01:09:16] you know they were trying to save the day with the the new two thousand series uh shortly after that

[01:09:23] and you know ultimately they they pulled out of it as well and after they had been doing it for

[01:09:27] so many years um that i i don't think ultimately they they would have been able to save it but i

[01:09:34] it would have been nice if they if they had gotten it out the door although in looking back i don't

[01:09:40] think it would have enjoyed the notoriety that it now has the cult following it's it's one of those

[01:09:45] weird things where uh people want what they can't get it's kind of like it's kind of like the

[01:09:54] the old girlfriend that you you wanted but you couldn't have and so or uh because there were only

[01:10:01] fourteen units floating around there um it it sort of developed this um aura i guess and following and

[01:10:11] gene finally managed to uh um you know satisfy the appetite of what 184 i think what did you think a

[01:10:19] kingpin and it doesn't look like you worked on kingpin right i didn't work i health criss-grinter

[01:10:25] on editing a little bit of the speech for that we had pulled Steve rich door fin uh to do

[01:10:31] um some speech i forget what the character was even um steven i do the stay still uh get

[01:10:38] each other with the one of those lines yeah he had some other similar lines he was like a big

[01:10:46] fella in the game and steve is a big fella um those of who know him in real life he's he's a

[01:10:50] truly big fella but um he played this uh big character in kingpin and i edited his lines and

[01:10:58] i think one other of uh christmas characters and and that's pretty much yet we were we were sticking

[01:11:03] in uh text markers to run uh lip sync on the dot matrix screen it's something we actually developed

[01:11:10] on the big bang bar game and uh where we um we could actually fire off these text markers from

[01:11:19] within the audio file that would uh we would have values attached them that would handshake with

[01:11:24] the software uh and then uh they would tell the dot matrix software which facial you know which

[01:11:30] mouth expression to run uh and so it was a sort of lip sync of sorts uh which worked kind of

[01:11:37] well it was kind of crude but it was kind of fun to watch and and uh um and so i was helping

[01:11:42] chris uh do some of that work which is very tedious work but um that's the only credit that

[01:11:48] i could take on that game uh that was otherwise it was criss-grinter all the way what did you think of the

[01:11:53] game i didn't get to play it um didn't have enough of a done at the time i was let go to uh it

[01:12:01] was still you know he had a whitewood going and some other stuff but uh i was i went over and played

[01:12:07] on a few times but i i have i really don't have much recollection of it um so i i really can't

[01:12:14] comment too much on that game i know mark was very sad when he had to sell his prototype uh and

[01:12:20] and i don't blame him uh and and i i kind of hope that uh gene will finally get around to maybe

[01:12:28] reproducing that one as well i'd like to i'd like to see it again um now that there's sort of

[01:12:34] a buzz about that game as well yeah that one's going to be a bit more of a challenge because of the

[01:12:38] Big Bang Bar project you know like for instance the board sets were of it you know gene had gene made

[01:12:44] 180 whatever of them because that's how many board sets he has well now he doesn't have any board

[01:12:49] sets so he's really starting at ground zero now well and i understand he also really lost a lot of

[01:12:55] money on the production of Big Bang Bar so uh i don't know if his wife will let him make another game

[01:13:02] but uh you know i don't i don't i've only met gene once and so i i don't know what his capabilities are

[01:13:12] but uh the one time i did see him down there uh and Bloomington uh he was talking kind of like

[01:13:18] maybe he would uh you know do king pin at some point so uh hopefully right right so now when

[01:13:26] you left Capcom you you did uh what uh vacation vacation america and then you got you and you also

[01:13:33] did the orange county chopper uh well i had that came a little later i i actually went to work for

[01:13:38] anchor or well you know Capcom wasn't Capcom when it started out it started out as rom star then

[01:13:46] became game star uh which is when i came on board and then uh uh about the time they were releasing

[01:13:53] pinball magic is when uh Capcom uh absorbed our division under the main umbrella of you know

[01:14:01] the mother ship i guess out there in japan and and we took on the Capcom name same thing happened

[01:14:07] when i went to work for anchor it was a company formed by a game designer who wanted his own design

[01:14:13] team uh Randy Adams who had developed uh one of the early wheel games out in Las Vegas and it made

[01:14:21] pretty good money on it decided to uh pull together a design team of ex-Williams people you know

[01:14:28] shades of Capcom right ex-Williams people yeah and so again i i'm working with a bunch of people

[01:14:35] who come over from uh games like real him in uh and some other uh slot games from the Williams uh

[01:14:42] side and um so uh we we started out as game works not to be confused with uh spielberg's game works

[01:14:54] but um Steven spielberg came along and uh as Randy said spielberg's four attorneys to his one

[01:15:02] he ended up selling the name game works to spielberg uh so spielberg could use it nationwide

[01:15:08] but uh and then we became ultimately we became anchor gaming chicago we were part of anchor

[01:15:13] games out of Las Vegas which now has been absorbed by i gt which is the 800 pound gorilla in the uh

[01:15:20] slot game world um but uh i chose not to relocate to Las Vegas so but i i spent four years at anchor

[01:15:28] and worked on 29 titles there and uh uh we started out with electron mechanical games and those

[01:15:36] early games used that sound card that had one audio channel and one midi channel and

[01:15:42] there are but yeah you don't like that right it's it's a bit of a challenge but um when i um

[01:15:52] Paul he had done one of their early games for them and i listened to how he had designed the

[01:15:57] music and stuff and i kind of followed suit on the first few games they every place i've worked

[01:16:01] you know just get the party rolling and then you know some kind something happens and the company

[01:16:06] decides out you know out of shut the doors damn now what about uh the vacation america which was a

[01:16:14] non kind of a non commercial home pinball game now that came out of that came out of church hill

[01:16:22] cabinets or chicago gaming which was formed by uh that's all part of the same building that's

[01:16:29] Roger and Doug Dubah Roger Dubah um used to build the cabinets for uh Williams and their

[01:16:36] pin games and and as far as they know they're still doing the pinball cabinets for Gary Stern

[01:16:41] right and uh Roger is the uh this the the dad and and he got Doug to come in uh Doug's an

[01:16:50] accountant and uh got Doug to come in and and help him out and uh vacation america was like the

[01:16:57] first product i believe or one of the first products developed under the chicago gaming name that

[01:17:04] um they put together i forget who even designed it Cordack Cordack yeah yeah i did meet Steve

[01:17:11] uh once interesting gentleman uh with a lot of history i know it was supposed to be a quick

[01:17:17] and dirty little game i shouldn't use the word dirty sorry yeah to remember i came in in the

[01:17:22] on the tail end of the hay day at pinball so i didn't get to work alongside with a lot of the big

[01:17:27] names um i just met tom capara for the first time uh he had worked on uh cactus canyon and uh

[01:17:35] corvette and and something else i just met him for the first time a couple weeks ago uh and there's

[01:17:40] a lot of other names the guys have bandied about there that i wish i had had an opportunity to

[01:17:45] have worked with uh didn't although i feel like i've worked for Williams because they've worked with

[01:17:50] enough ex-Williams people but i've never said and set foot on their their plan right

[01:17:55] so uh it's kind of weird that way um but anyway vacation america was an economy game you know

[01:18:03] scale down for size scale down for sounds and whatever and uh you know they were still experimenting

[01:18:11] with what they were going to put under the hood and what they wanted in the game and uh i ended up

[01:18:16] producing more music than we could fit in the game so uh it it was an interesting little project

[01:18:25] i got one of the kids from our neighborhood don't when we're living up in lake anneals to do

[01:18:30] one of the characters for me she was um she had a she was very directable and i think i did

[01:18:38] one of the characters in that game and i think i got i think i got this kids mom to do uh the uh

[01:18:43] the wife part in that game as well no are those people like the kid and the neighborhood in the kids

[01:18:48] mom are they actually paid to do this um no they well i don't i don't think we actually paid them

[01:18:56] on that one they just they were just happy to do it uh it's sort of like uh lary king last night

[01:19:03] had uh what's his name on the the guy who uh um host the dirtiest job in america program yeah

[01:19:10] microw yeah and they were asking him about do they pay these people you know you know to know we

[01:19:17] go and we see these people doing their jobs and we ask if they want to tell their story to the

[01:19:22] world and they and they said more often than not they're they're yeah i said no those people don't

[01:19:29] get paid probably should have paid them but uh you know they were just happy to do it and uh i

[01:19:35] would have paid them for subsequent work probably but um uh it turns out the game didn't go very far

[01:19:41] anyway right and uh i wasn't making much money on it so um it was one of those things where we were

[01:19:50] we were hoping that the game would uh start a new platform and then we would see you know greater

[01:19:55] dollars further down the road meant uh um it's one of those projects where that doesn't seem to be

[01:20:01] happening how did you get to your current position incredible technologies yeah well there was the

[01:20:10] period off the end of anchor when anchor closes doors in 2001 uh i went out

[01:20:18] forced into working entirely on my own again for a while as a contractor and uh ended up scoring

[01:20:24] a children's video and and had hopes of uh doing a lot more work in that area but 2001 was such a

[01:20:32] a dismal year uh for um the economy that companies uh video animator that i was doing this work for

[01:20:42] uh Chris Olson had his own company down on the range and uh he had actually come out of big ideas

[01:20:48] and had developed a lot of the veggie tail characters and had formed his own company and i came in

[01:20:54] on the middle of a project where he was having had a major problem with a a composer out of Nashville

[01:21:00] and uh i got a call out of the blue like the week before uh anchor was closing down and asked me to

[01:21:06] come out and and uh interview with him finally and and so on on the day we uh got the announcement

[01:21:12] that anchor was closing down he i had interviewed with him um not knowing that we were going to be closed

[01:21:17] down um and decided that i would work for him so i i spent a lot of that spring doing a lot of work

[01:21:24] on on his kid's video which did get produced and he was hoping to do uh yet another one in the series

[01:21:32] for uh word entertainment um they ultimately um sort of cook in their books i guess and uh so that

[01:21:38] project uh the third third video in their series didn't happen uh Chris was trying to get projects

[01:21:44] across the threshold at uh a number of major places like Pixar and Disney and others and got really

[01:21:51] close but again the uh economy was such that many of those places were laying off people and so

[01:21:58] we didn't get that pushed through but i worked on a few projects for him and then uh meanwhile python

[01:22:04] had uh going back to uh python angel oh he had steered me on to some other game designers and so i had

[01:22:09] uh other uh coin up projects redemption games a couple of kitty rides and uh just a whole slew of

[01:22:17] projects um that i was working on uh was working on uh several projects from Brian Hanson who had

[01:22:24] come out of capcom and uh Brian and python were working on some things together before they split up

[01:22:30] and uh they had also introduced me to uh Mark springer who uh another ex-Williams person

[01:22:37] who had designed several pin gains there has his own company um actually while i was still at

[01:22:44] anchor uh was working with mark on a series of projects he had done for disney quest and we did a

[01:22:52] series of games for disney uh and that was a lot of fun a lot of work but a lot of fun he does very

[01:22:57] colorful art and and i really enjoy the uh the toys and things that he sticks into his games

[01:23:06] and he has a great sense of choreography and so um and we still collaborate on some things

[01:23:12] i ended up doing a lot of this and that for a couple years and still doing my voice over work for

[01:23:18] radio and tv uh um commercials and and whatnot so i was doing a variety of things

[01:23:24] mark richie kept telling me stand touch with me stand touch with me and he was at incredible

[01:23:28] technologies by that time you know he said i'm working on something but i can't tell you what it is

[01:23:32] and then finally in uh we had just moved to our new house in 2003 and mark said yeah i think

[01:23:42] i finally got him convinced this time to bring a new sound designer in on this project so i finally

[01:23:46] got to um that the incredible technologies had me do one project one piece of music for them as a

[01:23:53] contractor um i sort of wonder if it was kind of a test in a way and i must have passed the

[01:24:00] test because i'm still employed there and uh it's been four years now since i've been incredible

[01:24:06] technology so i've had the opportunity to work on um golden peak off uh i've done a little bit of

[01:24:13] work on silver strike bowling uh that was mostly mad currents work in that game but uh did do a

[01:24:19] few pieces of music for that and uh but the the the major project that i was brought on board there

[01:24:26] was for the orange county choppers video pinball now whose idea was that that was mark richie's although

[01:24:33] we didn't know when i first came on board they were trying to pitch harley davidson

[01:24:40] and because stern had already done on harley davidson pinball game harley didn't want to

[01:24:47] dilute their name by having yet another pinball-esque project out there's

[01:24:53] kind of sort of how i heard it so they uh they turned us down and i remember a bunch of a sitting

[01:25:01] in mark's office we're tossing this group in that you know like the martin brothers out in

[01:25:06] out west and uh west county choppers and uh but we felt that orange county because of the discovery

[01:25:15] channel show they had the best name recognition and so um our company approached them and they

[01:25:21] agreed and we went up there and did one video shoot with them um and that was a very surreal probably

[01:25:29] the most surreal birthday i've ever had sitting on a video set in the shop at orange county choppers

[01:25:36] with ball and senior and ball junior and i tell you ball senior is a real trip to those guys actually

[01:25:42] do any work on bikes anymore i don't know about anymore i mean uh they certainly didn't do any

[01:25:50] work i actually work on their bikes that day but we had them pretty busy that day plus there was

[01:25:54] another pair of photographers in taking pictures for uh toy uh you know um merchandising stuff

[01:26:02] which just really got ball senior all steamed about uh because he's he's ADD and he switches channels

[01:26:08] a lot and and he's you know he's he's he's he's he's a whole bag of whatever happening upstairs

[01:26:17] and so uh it was a very surreal day he's steamed off of our set and was all we could do to get

[01:26:24] him back in later on that day and gosh uh Paul junior was he's he's very easy to work with

[01:26:33] and uh took over a lot of the lines that we were gonna have his dad do and and uh we got just enough

[01:26:39] of Paul senior later in the day to salvage the project but uh we we we were really wondering uh

[01:26:45] whether we were gonna have enough video to make it worth uh you know completing the game

[01:26:50] so how does the video this is a video pinball how does the video incorporate it itself into the game

[01:26:57] well we had them in little clips they would come up on a little screen in the middle of the game

[01:27:01] every now and then with their their little one liners and stuff um we had them doing a lot of

[01:27:05] help screen stuff you know um describing how the player you know what you should be shooting for

[01:27:11] what you need to do in a particular mode um along with all the usual reactions to good and bad shots

[01:27:19] and stuff like that and was Vinnie or Mikey in the in the thing too Mikey was in it Vinnie was not

[01:27:26] although Mikey did refer to Vinnie in a couple of cases um but uh it it was mainly to be just the

[01:27:32] the principal three um Paul senior junior and Mikey now was Mikey easy to work with

[01:27:39] he was up to a point um Mark wanted to do a scene where he was going to have Mikey zap his dad

[01:27:46] and we're and it would have been really funny and uh we got him all the way up to the point

[01:27:53] he got him got him dressed in the white lab coat coat we um Vinnie even helped Mark finish welding a

[01:27:59] piece on this one box um that we took out there a big big ol switch box that we were gonna have

[01:28:04] him hold that had a piece of cabling off the end and Mikey was supposed to press this button and then

[01:28:09] you know his dad was gonna get sapped in this one mode and then he he started reading through

[01:28:14] the script and kind of realizing what uh what it was all about and he didn't want to do it

[01:28:20] I was like what huh after all his dad has done to him he didn't want his dad his dad

[01:28:27] oh gosh and there was uh and then he also didn't want to be portrayed as the one taking out the

[01:28:32] trash anymore so he wouldn't do any of those lines and we thought okay well that's fine but when

[01:28:36] we got to the part where we wanted to have him zap his dad it's like um we got a few lines out of

[01:28:42] well that should really light things up and then there were the other funny lines and um

[01:28:48] then he just kind of realized and said now I really can't do this like no so these guys were almost

[01:28:54] getting kind of pre-Madonna status here oh well yeah senior certainly um yeah watching him take

[01:29:02] after Mikey at one point and you know they they see these two silhouettes just racing through the

[01:29:07] office door way out there and then this big metal door going boom you know out you know Mikey

[01:29:14] haunted his dad for something like and then uh Paul senior goes freaking retarded you know

[01:29:20] then they're running off and boom it's like we're in the middle of taping Paul junior and everybody just

[01:29:24] you know we had to take a break in the taping for that one it's just typical of what you see on the

[01:29:29] TV show so then that stuff on the TV show isn't so staged and isn't no it is not that is them

[01:29:36] that is the real deal I'm telling you they are they are surreal in their real life

[01:29:45] yeah it was my birthday and it's like gosh I followed the company card that night as we went

[01:29:51] out drinking it was first time in years I done any drinking it was well deserved

[01:29:58] so what you set up like a mini studio right there in their shop to do this

[01:30:04] we uh well they they made room in the middle of the shop um and this was back in the old building

[01:30:09] over in Orange County they're in Rock Tavern they're now in Montgomery but they had a they

[01:30:17] moved a lot of their bicycles aside I mean we got to see things like the Liberty bike and the

[01:30:22] Jet bike and they had a bunch of the other bikes you've seen on Discovery Channel we could not take

[01:30:27] any photos of those bikes because photographic images already belong to the Discovery Channel

[01:30:34] so we had to be careful of what we could videotape there was one gorgeous bike that was not

[01:30:40] used in the Discovery Channel show that we could videotape them you know with them and um

[01:30:48] the the what was the black widow bike I think was in there as well and uh oh these bikes are

[01:30:54] gorgeous god you know I thought they sold all that stuff they were for clients some of yeah

[01:31:01] some of was but a lot of they had a lot of the bikes they had some of the bikes they're in the shop

[01:31:06] that I had seen on the TV show already the jet bike was there and a few others and uh and uh

[01:31:12] these these are gorgeous bikes you know they they're it's like a pinball game you know you see it

[01:31:18] in pictures it's one thing and it's even more gorgeous when you see you you know see it for real

[01:31:23] what can I say nothing beats the real thing so you didn't have like little bicycles for like

[01:31:30] these guys to ride around like you know you're here in the in the lame mode or something like that

[01:31:34] in the right and little miniature you know three wheel bikes doing any action these are all

[01:31:39] head and shoulder shots pretty much you know where they we had them talking and and doing one

[01:31:42] liners and then we take a few things where Paul was sitting on one of the bikes but there was really

[01:31:47] no action involved in this there was plenty of other action going on with animated video in the

[01:31:53] game you know reaction of you know explosions and other things that would happen that you couldn't

[01:31:57] do on a real pinball game you get certain shots and green sprinkly stuff would come out and I

[01:32:04] had a lot of fun sticking sound effects of that kind of stuff and and certain lights would light

[01:32:09] up in a certain way and we we could you know fly bike parts in you know as you were in the build

[01:32:15] at the beginning of the game you're building a bike and and as you would hit certain shots

[01:32:20] the bike part would fly up and fly and automatically be attached to the bike in a center pedestal

[01:32:27] and once you collect it all the parts then you could you could do other things or take that bike

[01:32:33] to the show mode ultimately but so there's so many things we could do in animation and there

[01:32:40] was just wasn't any room to do anymore animation with them except this little square that would pop

[01:32:45] up screen that would pop up in the middle of the game and and would show their face and you know

[01:32:51] they would be talking and you know a little video clip but we had planned to have a lot of them

[01:32:58] throughout the game again with little little little help hints you know off the help screen stuff

[01:33:05] and then a lot of reactions to shots or you know player taunts and prompts and things like that

[01:33:13] huh interesting so with all the projects that you've worked on which was the you know the most

[01:33:18] fun and the most rewarding well ultimately when I when I listen to my demos the Orange County choppers

[01:33:25] I spent about a year on that project alone I think musically and sound effect wise that was the

[01:33:33] most challenging that was I think probably game number 70 for me if I counted correctly and I

[01:33:40] you know I'm starting to lose track of all the projects I've done on worked on in the last

[01:33:44] 14 or so years but I would have to save that one but Big Bang Bar certainly is right up there

[01:33:50] and very near and dear to my heart because that was such a fun game at the time and just you know

[01:33:56] I got to do this spoofie campy kinds of stuff and then dig into this treasure trove sound effects

[01:34:02] and I have to admit that a lot of the sound effects in Big Bang Bar started as off the shelf kind

[01:34:09] of stuff but everything I put into a game has been manipulated and bent and and actually kind of

[01:34:15] learned how to describe this after doing the Orange County choppers game after watching them build

[01:34:20] bikes on the Discovery Channel show building sound effects is is a lot like building a custom bike

[01:34:29] you may start with stock parts like stock fenders and other parts off the shelf but a single sound

[01:34:36] effect for the Orange County choppers game and I know that I ruffled some feathers that I tee because

[01:34:41] you know they're used to a golf game where you just got golf balls you know fumping on the playfield

[01:34:46] and water sounds and ball falling and all and little sound effects that are you know you just pull

[01:34:51] them off of the stock library and stick them in the game as I say nothing big Orange County choppers

[01:34:56] I was really trying to be cinematic a lot of thunder and and rumble and stuff and it takes a

[01:35:04] lot of layering and it's and so like building a chopper where you take this fender and you cut it

[01:35:12] and you weld something else to it and you grind it and you buff it and and maybe that's something

[01:35:17] you welded isn't working so you got to cut it off and weld something else to it and then you grind

[01:35:22] it and buff it some more and then you you you detail it and you know you paint it and then

[01:35:28] detail it and then you know do your final coat on the thing a lot of layers go into just that

[01:35:36] part that goes on the bike well the same thing with sound effects I may pull two or three effects

[01:35:42] out of sound library I may take a an explosion from someplace and a little bit of a jet fly by

[01:35:50] noise from somewhere else and add in a little bit of a avalanche rumble or something for low

[01:35:56] frequency and and throw a dash of maybe a big door you know metal door slamming somewhere and

[01:36:03] mix those things together and and run them through or process the parts separately then mix them

[01:36:09] together into some big blasty rumbley thing and then run it through a compressor or multi band

[01:36:20] processor first then the compressor you know remember everything as loud as possible that's my

[01:36:26] mantra on a game like the orange county game so there's a lot of stages to that and it may take a

[01:36:34] full day to produce a single sound effect sometimes you know the big the bigger sound effects small

[01:36:41] sound effects yeah I can probably do a bunch of those in a whack and certainly on some kids games I

[01:36:46] have to do a bundle of sound effects on a day but I would say the orange county choppers game is

[01:36:53] probably going to today has been the biggest project and the most challenging and probably the

[01:36:57] most rewarding game other than the fact that it never got manufactured and will it ever get

[01:37:04] manufactured if everyone would call in and write to Elaine and tell her you know please make

[01:37:10] this game but I they couldn't do it now because the licenses run out so much would have to be

[01:37:16] changed it would have to be the theme would have to be changed well cool I really do appreciate

[01:37:21] the time and you know I know this was you know a lot a lot of time for you it's been a pleasure

[01:37:25] and you know I better dig out the old files here it'll help kind of refresh my memory and some

[01:37:31] things and they're looking at some of these lights and the speeches like gosh we really did some fun

[01:37:36] stuff well Clay it's been a pleasure glad I finally was able to get off the dime here and give you a

[01:37:45] thank you again all right thank you to do all right bye bye bye I'd really like to thank Jeff
