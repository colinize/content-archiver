[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:11] It's not yet the Topcast we have a designer that designed a number of games for

[00:23] Balli and Williams going from special forces to party animal to Elvira and the party

[00:28] monsters to white water to devil man to scared stiff and now to his current job

[00:34] with stern and pirates of the Caribbean.

[00:37] Special guest.

[00:41] Special guest.

[00:44] So I'd like to introduce Dennis Nordman to Topcast tonight.

[00:48] Again Dennis started working with Balli in the early 1980s and made the transition

[00:53] over to Williams when Williams bought out Balli in 1988.

[00:56] He did a number of very very popular games including the two Elvira games and white water,

[01:03] which definitely is a lot of people's favorites.

[01:06] And he's working for stern, he did Pirates of the Caribbean and he's currently working

[01:10] on a new game for stern.

[01:11] So I'd like to give Dennis Nordman a call right now and we'll give him a little talk here on Topcast.

[01:17] Hello.

[01:21] Hey Dennis, it's Clay.

[01:24] Can you hear me okay?

[01:26] That's not bad.

[01:27] You know what were your roots like to it?

[01:28] Did you play when you were a kid or how did you get involved in pinball?

[01:32] I think the first pinball machine I ever saw I was probably about.

[01:37] I guess seven or eight years old and one of my father's friends had one.

[01:46] I just I didn't play it very much.

[01:49] I just remember being fascinated by all the bright lights and things.

[01:55] That may even have been a flipperless game.

[01:57] That was in the early 50s, mid 50s probably.

[02:03] Then I didn't really rediscover pinball till I was about 21 or 22 and I think I played at

[02:12] Cedar Point in Sandust, Ohio.

[02:14] They said we'd use our case there and a lot of games.

[02:18] Is that where you're from?

[02:20] I'm from Columbus, Ohio.

[02:22] That's when I rediscovered it and then I played on and off and I see later in life I went

[02:29] back to Ohio State University to major.

[02:31] I was about 30.

[02:33] The major in industrial design and during my senior year

[02:38] I designed a really futuristic pinball cabinet.

[02:42] I used to go play pinball a lot as my research.

[02:45] How did you get hooked up with Balli?

[02:48] That was your first real pinball job, right?

[02:53] What I did was I built a model for my design project.

[03:01] I built a model of this game.

[03:02] Then I had to leave college during the second quarter of my senior year to have back surgery.

[03:08] They didn't offer the courses again for another year.

[03:11] So during that summer, while I was recovering I built a full size version of that cabinet.

[03:19] Went to Shaffer distributing in Columbus and showed it to them and they thought it was pretty cool.

[03:24] Chuck Farmer had worked for them and at the time he was president of the Balli pinball division.

[03:32] So they called Chuck and we set up an interview.

[03:35] I put the cabinet in my van and drove from Columbus to Chicago and made a presentation at Balli

[03:41] Pinball Division. They were in Bensonville at the time and they hired me as a cabinet designer.

[03:50] Now what was unique about your cabinet?

[03:52] I mean this was in a whole pinball machine. It was just a cabinet, right?

[03:55] It was just a cabinet and it was designed to have been made in fiberglass

[04:02] because it had an interesting shape. I built it out of wood.

[04:08] But what was unique of it was on a pedestal.

[04:11] It didn't have four legs. It was on a pedestal and I had designed it so that all the

[04:17] circuit boards and components would have been housed in the pedestal.

[04:23] The play field, let's see the glass level.

[04:27] The play field level was about three or four inches lower than a regular pinball game at a time.

[04:33] But I had raised areas where you could rest your hands for the flipper buttons and my reason

[04:38] for making it lower was so that younger kids could see the play field a lot easier than on a regular

[04:44] pinball game. They ever incorporate any of your design design?

[04:49] The thing that I, when I designed this game, this cabinet, at the time I designed it,

[04:58] games were digital, but they still had the digital displays stuck in four places in the back

[05:05] glass like the where the old drum reels used to be. My reasoning was I put all the displays

[05:14] down in an area just above the play field so that players could easily

[05:18] act, you know, view their scores while they're playing.

[05:21] And so the one thing that did come from that cabinet was all the scoring areas being put

[05:28] down at the bottom of the back glass for all four players.

[05:32] What came to they first do that in?

[05:35] I believe rapid fire was the first game that did that.

[05:40] What year was this that this whole thing took place?

[05:43] Well, man, you're going to have to year.

[05:47] I early 1980s.

[05:49] So what was your first, when your first official job was a cabinet designer, but I mean,

[05:54] did you stay as a cabinet designer for very long?

[05:58] Nope, not for very long because after a year,

[06:03] Valley merged with Midway and I got laid off.

[06:06] So the things that I had done during that year, I designed the rapid fire cabinet

[06:13] and the Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man cabinet.

[06:16] And then they had a lot of rapid fire cabinets left over so they turned them into

[06:20] eight ball deluxe limited edition games.

[06:25] Yeah, and sent hard too.

[06:27] That's right.

[06:28] And then I was working on some redemption games, some ideas from

[06:38] a toy company in Chicago.

[06:40] Marvin Glass used to submit ideas to us and I worked on a couple ideas for redemption games,

[06:45] but then I got laid off after a year.

[06:48] And then I went to Gottlieb, which became myelstar.

[06:53] So you were in the middle of all these transitions going on?

[06:57] A lot of transitions and ended up being laid off.

[07:02] How long were you at Gottlieb?

[07:04] I think I was there for a year, a year and a half and I didn't design 10-ball games there.

[07:11] I submitted ideas for video game ideas and my game.

[07:15] Us versus them was their second laser disc game that they did.

[07:19] The first one was Mach 3.

[07:22] And then I wrote the script and built some models and things for the us versus them.

[07:27] But then you got caught in the transition there with premier or was it with myelstar?

[07:33] I think Coca-Cola had purchased myelstar.

[07:38] And so I got lost in that transition.

[07:41] So how did you end up back at Valley?

[07:43] After myelstar, what did I do?

[07:47] I was unemployed for a while and I tried to sell some redemption games to,

[07:54] I think it was grand products.

[07:55] I forget.

[07:58] Yeah, it might have been grand products.

[07:59] That didn't work, but then I submitted a 10-ball game idea back to Valley again.

[08:06] And this was my first 10-ball game and I made a drawing and my theme was,

[08:13] at the time it was called Ranger based on the Army Rangers.

[08:18] And that's right after the movie, Rambo had come out.

[08:23] And that game, and so they liked it and they hired me.

[08:27] Of course, I still knew a lot of people.

[08:29] They were Jim Pat, what was their Greg Flair, Greg Kamek.

[08:33] That game became my very first 10-ball game, which was Special Force.

[08:38] Now, yeah, you see, you were a little head of the curve.

[08:41] If you had waited until that Tom Hanks movie had come out when the,

[08:45] you know, that World War II movie with Tom Hanks, and they were all part of the Rangers.

[08:52] See, you were head of the curve.

[08:54] You could have capitalized on that.

[08:58] So Special Force is when you designed that, you designed that outside of Valley and then

[09:02] submitted it. Did they make very many changes with the final?

[09:07] Actually, I went into Valley and then I designed the game at Valley.

[09:11] With a lot of Jim Pat was helped because I had never done a game before.

[09:15] And I actually wired that game by myself.

[09:18] I couldn't even possibly do that today.

[09:21] Was it pretty fun to do that?

[09:24] Wiring wasn't fun, but it was really fun to design and build my first game, absolutely.

[09:32] Now, I was looking on the internet pinball database and they have a thing called Special Force Girls.

[09:37] What's that all about?

[09:39] I believe that was a German game.

[09:42] That was the German artwork package for Special Force because they were very against war

[09:48] theme, so you couldn't sell a war theme in Germany.

[09:51] So they just put some more, put babes on the back glass and called a good?

[09:57] Back glass made it more tolerable.

[10:01] Now, the helicopter in Special Force is kind of cool.

[10:05] Did you have any resistance from the whole texture to the whole game?

[10:11] It has almost a very molded plastic texture to look like the Vietnam or something like that.

[10:21] Was there any resistance to get all that worked on and all the molding and figures in that?

[10:28] That was my goal, was to make it look very jungle-like and more like.

[10:32] And actually, it wasn't molding. It was all flat butirits that at the time when

[10:39] Bali was doing any butirits stacking, they used nuts and bolts and I used PC board standoff

[10:48] to attach all the butirit pieces together and they all came in white.

[10:52] But I didn't know this. Jim Patlet told me this that you could just use Rit Die and die

[10:57] those nylon standoff greens. So we had ladies in the factory boiling pots of Rit Die and I

[11:04] went out to the store and bought some green die and we died all those post-greens.

[11:09] Were they pretty happy with the sales numbers? They sold like 2750 of those games with it.

[11:14] Was that a pretty good run for them?

[11:17] I thought the run was closer to 4,000 for that game but yeah, they were happy with it. It did okay.

[11:22] So you did pretty good for your first game then?

[11:25] Yeah, oh yeah. And the funnel that I don't think there ever been a funnel on a game before,

[11:30] at least not a modern game that I knew of. These line drop targets, the innovative feature there

[11:35] was that they were memory drop targets so each target had a coil. So if you earned rockets,

[11:41] you could push a separate flipper button, fire a rocket and knock the drop target down without

[11:46] hitting it with the ball. Yeah, that is kind of a cool fixture. Did you,

[11:52] that used the Bally 6803 board system that kind of had like a, you know, they used this kind of

[11:59] weird thing for the computer control lighting where they had one SCR that could control two lights

[12:05] depending on the wave of the AC current. Was that all pretty confusing or you didn't have to

[12:10] deal with that? I didn't have to deal with any of that, thank God. Yeah, I've had to fix a few of

[12:17] those and they've always been tricky. I'm not, I'm not very, very good when it comes to

[12:21] electricity. I can put in a light bulb that's about it. So now your next one was party animal and

[12:27] that was, I had a myth that was one of my first pinball machine purchases and when I heard that

[12:33] game like the audio track Burp and Belch, I just said I got to have this game.

[12:41] Another one of my innovations, a belching game. Well, when you hear those games today,

[12:45] they sound terrible, don't they? No, actually they don't. I think that one is pretty cute, frankly.

[12:52] That game, that was the hardest pinball game for me to design because everybody probably has one

[12:58] good game in them because you accumulate ideas for years and years and years and I used up all my

[13:04] good stuff on special force and to design a second game was very difficult to come up with ideas

[13:10] and figure out how to do it. Now who came up with that theme? See how did that, I don't remember how

[13:16] that came about. You know, it's kind of a cool game. Now I heard that there was two different

[13:22] trans lights for the game like a bar version in all, you know, I don't know what the bar.

[13:28] There was a beer version and a dad's root beer version. Well, the root beer version was more

[13:35] for family locations. And so was that your idea or ballies? It wasn't my idea, it was probably

[13:41] marketing department decided they needed that. Did they actually sell a lot of those, you know,

[13:45] dad root beer ones? I have no idea. I've never even seen the dad's root beer one before.

[13:52] I remember seeing them. I don't have a trans lighter or anything like that. I didn't save enough

[13:58] stuff. My wife used to always say quit bringing that crap home.

[14:05] So it's all in the bottom of some dumpster somewhere. Yeah. She used to work for, I met her,

[14:12] she worked for Chuck Farmer. She was the Chuck was the president of the Ballet Pinball Division and

[14:18] she was his secretary and before that she was secretary to Bill O'Donnell Jr. And she told me stories

[14:25] of just throwing so much stuff out. Every time she needed room in the stock room, she just threw

[14:30] away tons of promotional stuff. Fliers and goodies and plastic toys and this mess, she would just

[14:36] toss it in the trash. Driving all the current pinheads crazy, you guys threw it all out.

[14:42] Oh, the stuff is valuable on each day now. All right, so after party animal, you did the black water,

[14:50] the black water 100, which was kind of like the last ballet game. It's a motorcycle theme.

[14:57] And once again, man, talk about a play field that's pretty sophisticated with lots of what you

[15:04] call a buterit. That one actually had a lot of vacuum forms on it. So that was in flat. It was

[15:10] just flat plastics. And we called them buterits because that's the kind of plastic they remain out of.

[15:16] Play field plastics is maybe what most people call them. But so special force just had stacked

[15:24] flat plastics but black water 100 had actual vacuum form molded plastics. No, that's a wild game.

[15:30] I mean, a friend of mine has that and I play it in. I mean, it's just, I mean, from a design point

[15:37] of view, I mean, that was like, I've never seen anything like that in a game. I really had fun

[15:43] designing that game. I like to try to do things really wild with different my ideas for

[15:49] I'm trying to make it as much like a motorcycle race as I could. Are you a motorcycle person?

[15:55] I used to be. I've actually raced in the actual black water 100 race a few times.

[16:01] And I used to, I used to race a lot when I was back in Ohio.

[16:06] Did you have to get a license to use that name black water?

[16:09] I had to use that and actually the race promoter and his wife came out to Bali.

[16:14] They have a name designed after their race. Was that a hard license to get?

[16:20] Oh no, that was easy. Do you have to pay him any money?

[16:24] Yeah, I'm sure we paid the money. I forget how much we paid them but

[16:29] it was a license like in the other license.

[16:32] And how did you think that game came off?

[16:34] Well, I was happy with the way the play field lay out and all my crazy shots and my

[16:39] up and down ramps and the area backed by the bottom aren't you used to be.

[16:44] I wasn't happy with the sound for the music on that game.

[16:48] Why? What was wrong with the sound of music?

[16:50] I just didn't think there was enough to put in to it at the time.

[16:55] Was that because Bali was kind of sliding downhill at that time?

[16:58] I think so and they were very enthusiastic about putting a lot of effort into the game.

[17:05] How was the transition from when Williams bought Bali midway?

[17:10] I mean, how did that whole thing go down?

[17:12] We just came to work one morning and they told us we were sold.

[17:16] And actually that day I wasn't there for some reason, I don't remember but

[17:20] I went to the prison there and all the other people and they said, yeah, we've been sold

[17:25] the Williams. Something you will be let go so that was kind of a nerve wracking time.

[17:29] But I think the ones that went or it was me and Jim Pat Law.

[17:34] I think Greg Kamehk was already gone by then.

[17:38] And Lord Pemberton, he went and I think that was about it as far as game designers.

[17:44] So when you went over to Williams was the was the company culture a lot different than Bali?

[17:50] The company what?

[17:51] The company culture.

[17:54] Well, we all felt like outsiders for a long time.

[17:57] Each of these I and her head is in an office. I remember at Bali we just had cubicle.

[18:02] Oh no, I had an office. I had an office when I was at Bali.

[18:05] But it was run essentially the same.

[18:07] So it was basically just the paycheck was different, not much more?

[18:12] Yeah, I don't think the paycheck was much more to start with.

[18:15] No, I meant just the name on the paycheck.

[18:19] Oh.

[18:23] That was different and we struggled for a while to get things done.

[18:27] All the Bali designers because we had trouble getting stuff done in a model shop and the prototype shop.

[18:35] But eventually they realized we could do some things.

[18:39] So you mean they didn't believe in you guys at first?

[18:42] You guys were just left over baggage or something it sounds like?

[18:45] That's what we felt like.

[18:47] We were the company that they had to buy.

[18:49] When you came over I mean you were what in Bensonville before and now you were like downtown

[18:55] Chicago right?

[18:56] Yeah.

[18:58] How was that transition?

[19:00] It's just had to learn to deal with Chicago three ways.

[19:04] Now the first game that they had you work on though was Elvira and the party monsters.

[19:10] That's kind of a big theme and a big, you know, it turned out to be a really successful game.

[19:17] I mean how did you land that project?

[19:18] Now the first game that they had you work on though was Elvira and the party monsters.

[19:24] That's kind of a big theme and a big, you know, it turned out to be a really successful game.

[19:31] I mean how did you land that project?

[19:33] Nobody at Williams thought that was going to be.

[19:37] This was their first license I think.

[19:39] Or what are their first licenses?

[19:41] Now the first game that they had you work on though was Elvira and the party monsters.

[19:47] That's kind of a big theme and a big, you know, it turned out to be a really successful game.

[19:54] I mean how did you land that project?

[19:56] Nobody at Williams thought that was going to be.

[19:59] This was their first license I think.

[20:02] Or what are their first licenses?

[20:05] And I don't think they expected much from it.

[20:10] Was it your idea to get that license?

[20:12] No that was Roger Sharpe's idea and Roger Sharpe presented it.

[20:17] I don't know if, if none of the Williams guys were interested or if they all had projects at the time,

[20:25] but I remember they didn't know who to assign it to so

[20:31] I worked on some ideas and Jim Patla worked on some ideas and they eventually selected

[20:39] the way that I wanted to go and I got the project.

[20:41] I mean was that an easy project or a hard project?

[20:44] I mean the game came out great.

[20:45] I mean it's a killer game.

[20:46] Fun project.

[20:47] It was, I think that was the first one Greg and I worked on together and we just had a great time

[20:53] working on that game.

[20:55] Did you ever get to meet Cassandra?

[20:58] Oh yeah we met Cassandra several times for that game and also for scared stuff.

[21:03] And now what is the deal with the broken bone thing on the on the play field?

[21:08] That's a story probably everybody knows about now during when I went to Williams

[21:13] that's when I met Steve and Mark Richie and I hadn't ridden any dirt bikes since I

[21:18] since I started back to college in Ohio and then moved out to Chicago and I found out that

[21:25] Steve and Mark used to ride a little when they were in California and so Steve had some old

[21:31] beat up bike and Mark had a bike and we went down to a riding area in southern Illinois.

[21:37] I'd never been there before I think I think they were so we were riding and we came out of the

[21:43] woods onto this nice little dirt road there was about four I was I forget who some of the other

[21:48] guys were Steve's son was there too and I was I was last and so I was showing off and I went

[21:57] blowing past Mark and I was concentrating on Mark and not on the road and as soon as I passed

[22:02] Mark the road made a sharp right turn there's no way I could make a turn and I hit some rough

[22:09] stuff off to the side of the road and flew over the bars and all I can remember allowed noise

[22:14] and I can remember just kind of laying there on my side and I looked down and my my left leg my

[22:19] femur was bent in a V shape and I was like oh man I really screwed up now and Mark came over and

[22:26] he was really scared and nervous and I couldn't catch my breath as I broke three ribs and knocked

[22:31] a wind out of me and he ripped my helmet off which he probably shouldn't have done he says oh Dennis

[22:36] don't do this to me Dennis hang in there so I spent three months in the hospital and I had just

[22:41] before we went riding I had just about finished the all-virus whitewood so during the three months

[22:46] I was in the hospital Steve did some work on the game and I believe Mark did some work on the game

[22:54] and Jim Patler did a lot of work on the game I think Jim Patler actually kind of like took over

[23:00] as director and they refined a few areas did everything it took to get it into production so

[23:07] they didn't make any big changes to the to the design no but that's why Greg put all the broken

[23:14] bones all over the back glass now in when they were doing this and you were in the hospital did they

[23:20] like bring by you know design pictures or ideas I was drawings and Chris Granar would bring

[23:29] tape to the music and Mark Finatra the program or would come and we'd have meetings so we got it

[23:36] that so when it did turn out to be a really successful game I mean you know was was was management

[23:45] surprised the only thing I can remember was when we won best new product of the show they seem

[23:54] surprised but they just never made a very big deal about it and my this is just my own personal

[24:02] feeling I think they were a little embarrassed that a ballet guy could do that and they just

[24:06] sell enough of them they cut it off too soon yeah because they probably could have really cranked

[24:11] up the I mean they sold somewhere around I don't know 4,000 or so but they could have really

[24:16] cranked the production on that one up oh they sold more police forces yeah go figure that

[24:22] because that game is not memorable compared to El Vira I know so that's what we as ballet

[24:29] desire so we had to deal with was there ever a point in time where you overcame that that I

[24:36] don't know that that that second class citizen feeling I thought I thought like I did with white

[24:42] water because finally I broke the 4,000 barrier and that game did like 7,000 I think well your

[24:50] next one after El Vira was was the doctor dude now whose idea was that for that theme that

[24:58] theme was Greg's idea Greg had a lot of influence on all the party themes doctor dude was originally

[25:07] I had started that I think that was my first game that I had started at Williams it was going to be

[25:16] teenage mutant Ninja Turtles and that spinning disc area was going to be like some kind of

[25:22] doctor doom machine or some kind of machine that the turtles had to destroy but management thought

[25:31] that theme was a little too juvenile so we didn't do it so it's that for a while then I did

[25:35] El Vira and after El Vira I went back to it and Greg came up with his doctor dude in his excellent

[25:42] Ray idea yeah because data east ended up with that you know data east ended up with Ninja Turtles

[25:49] and that their version of that game and it certainly doesn't do anything for me I don't know if

[25:55] that makes you feel better or not so I didn't mind not doing it you know so the whole party theme was

[26:03] really was was Greg's it was Greg's thing it was Greg's influence yeah so he was a party guy

[26:11] well there was a lot to do with there was a lot of things you could do with a theme like that

[26:15] and you didn't have to pay any royalties damn we didn't have to pay any royalties

[26:20] so were you happy with the doctor dude in the end oh sure I was always happy with every game in the end

[26:29] and then you always want to go on to the next one and do better that was basically like a on the

[26:34] hardware platform that was like a system 11 platform but they made a few with the newer WPC

[26:40] hardware I mean how do is there any reason that came about you don't have to ask somebody

[26:45] smarter than me I don't pay any attention to the hardware I just like to have fun

[26:54] so then you did another party theme you went to party zone was that it was the right after doctor

[27:00] dude yeah right after wow we had partying on the brain didn't we you sure did and that was

[27:07] that Greg again helping out oh yeah and that sort of incorporated all of the party games together

[27:16] because I think we had party animals in there and party dudes and in the party zone was like the

[27:23] ultimate party game now that game was our system for that one yeah there you go now that game

[27:30] you was one of the early games to use a dot matrix display did that did that influential design

[27:36] at all no I just thought the dot matrix guy do do what they wanted to do for that one so they had

[27:44] complete rain there but how did you feel about the dot matrix displays compared to the alpha

[27:49] numeric stuff well they look like a cool improvement because we could do so much more with them

[27:55] but at the same time if you're watching the game it's kind of hard to realize what's going on

[27:59] a dot matrix display too but part of it was well it kind of tracked other players because they

[28:07] can see it from across the room and something cool is happening and it made pinball look fresh and new

[28:14] now that at this time the the ballet games had a kind of a different cabinet style than the Williams

[28:19] games were you responsible for that at all no and I don't even remember it yeah they had like they

[28:28] wanted to keep a different look they probably wanted to keep on our remember at the time the

[28:33] the ballet games were going to be the license games the Williams games were going to be the original

[28:38] games and so they wanted to keep a different look to the cabinets to just differentiate between

[28:46] the two brands yeah then your next game was actually a Williams title and that was the one that

[28:51] you really hit the ball out of the park you know of course whitewater now are you a white water

[28:59] type sporting kind of guy no I never did whitewater rafting but I just thought that would be an

[29:06] exciting theme so did you pick that theme yes so did want the convinced management that it would

[29:12] be good I don't remember what I did to convince them but I remember going to the library and

[29:18] getting a lot of books on a whitewater rafting and learning all about it so I can get all the

[29:24] terminology right and and they could seem like a real rafting experience that's where I got the

[29:32] idea for for Bigfoot because in one of the books I read there was I think in a there's a river

[29:38] in Washington state and there's a legend that Bigfoot comes around at night and steals all the

[29:43] rafters supplies so that's how I got the idea for the Bigfoot character in the game I've never heard

[29:50] that before well amazing game I mean I own one of those games and it's just the the the whole thing

[30:00] with the I guess it's kind of your style with that kind of you know modified flat plastic and

[30:08] vacuum-formed plastic stuff but I mean you and you had the whirlpool ramp again and the ramp down

[30:14] the left side that goes up and now kind of like a like a wave that the whole game it just really

[30:19] is cool that game I had I had in my mind with all these different levels but there was I couldn't

[30:26] draw this game because I had no idea how all this stuff was going to fit together vertically so I made

[30:32] a a foam corn cardboard mock-up first so I could check hold it all my dimensions and measurements and

[30:40] see if I had enough space to do everything I wanted to do I think Jim Schalberg still has that

[30:44] foam core model when you went you know to get all these parts made did they like look at your

[30:50] cross-eyed you know with all these funky ramps and stuff no it was it was the nice thing about

[30:57] working at Williams then was that we could pretty much do whatever we wanted to do with our budget

[31:02] I guess we're at the time for the cost of the game we're way higher than what we can do now it's

[31:07] turned and pretty much what we wanted there's always stuff you had to take out but

[31:16] yeah I don't think a game like white water could be made now well was there anything in white water

[31:22] that that had to come out you know for for cost reason there was I don't remember but I always

[31:26] remember the standard joke we always used to put a lot of drop targets in so when something had to

[31:31] come out we pulled them out I've heard that before because they've heard that I was an expensive

[31:37] unit and drop targets are cool but they're expensive and at the time I guess we everybody was

[31:44] really into designing you know wild ramps and other mechanical things so the drop targets would

[31:52] be the first to go was there anything in that game that that you were that you were sorry that

[31:59] you did or that you sorry that you didn't do in white water well I can't think of anything either

[32:07] way right now I was I was really happy that it that it all came together which I wish the the

[32:15] molded plastics like the boulders had been made out of a stronger material now did you do the

[32:23] rules designed to when it comes to these games I do some of the rules Mike Boone did some of the

[32:31] rules it's not like one guy says we're gonna do it this way I'm sure I had a lot of pull because

[32:40] I was like the director and the designer in the game and a lot of the basic stuff was mine but

[32:45] then Mike could incorporate whatever he wanted and I think that Chris and Greg also

[32:54] participated in the rule design that's that's the way it worked for most games it was whoever

[32:59] had a great whoever had a decent idea if everybody liked it it went in the game yeah because

[33:06] Mike's rule was the vacation jackpot I mean that's one of his major contributions and I thought

[33:13] because I'm not a very good player and I thought Mike that's really stupid nobody's ever gonna get

[33:18] that but it turned out to be one of the things that a lot of people talk about yeah the depth of

[33:25] the rules in that game is was was really really quite quite deep at you know I think that was probably

[33:33] my first really deep game and I liked all of the I'm not sure I planned it from the beginning

[33:40] but I liked all the different strategies that you could use to play that game and try to stack

[33:46] things up so you could get the highest points try to stack things up so you could get it to work

[33:50] with 5x playfield thought it was big for what was kind of cool myself I had fun with the big

[33:58] guy like that and and his face was modeled after me John Yalsey came out to my house and did some

[34:03] caricature sketches of me then we gave those to the sculptor and so I'm bigfoot on that game

[34:12] I don't know was that a good thing or a bad thing I don't know if that's something I put on my

[34:19] resume I had a lot of big hair and a dark beard at the time so I kind of looked at time I

[34:29] bigfooty all right we're gonna take a break from our talk with Dennis Norman and we'll be back

[34:33] right after this message this portion of topcast is brought to you by pin game journal covering

[34:39] the world of pinball is them online at www.pingamejournal.com all right we're back with Dennis Norman

[34:47] now the top around that game with the with the waterfall lights who's idea was that that was

[34:53] another wet was one of the happy accidents I say also man called Greg and say he had this new material

[34:59] that he could create motion with in this foil material with chasing light and so Greg said okay

[35:07] come on in we'll look at it and we saw it and it was amazing and I actually forget what he

[35:13] demonstrated I don't know if it was a waterfall or not so we asked if he could do a waterfall and

[35:19] it took a while but we got it working right and it was a pretty cool fact it just happened

[35:26] now whose idea was it to have a blue cabinet I'll probably john jails you

[35:33] so he would controversial no just I mean most or no I mean other than funhouse everything's

[35:39] basically got a black cabinet yeah you know well you know blue water I guess yeah there you go so

[35:46] that was that was the the art the art guy came up with that one yeah that was john did you have an

[35:51] artist that you like to work with I don't you know I it well it turns out that I work with Greg the

[35:57] most so I I always really enjoyed working with Greg now why didn't Greg do the the art for that

[36:02] game for white water was busy on something else and I don't know what else was was around then but

[36:08] Greg did the the the the top or for white water but john did the the back left and I'm sure Greg

[36:19] would remember why but I don't remember so your next game was demolition man and tell me about

[36:27] some of the challenges that went through on that game that game was a little hard because I had

[36:32] the script to work with and some pictures but I really tried hard to make it follow the movie and

[36:40] to make it a lot like the movie I think I was successful at that but when I saw the movie I

[36:45] wasn't really very impressed with the movie but it had a lot of battle scenes in it and I like

[36:50] working with the wider body and that game had a lot of nice flow and ramp shots so I enjoyed

[36:59] building that game and I liked I put those handles on it because the the movie was nothing but

[37:06] weapons and guns and firing and shooting and I thought oh wouldn't it be cool if I could make

[37:11] the player feel like he's part of this and like he's firing guns and weapons and so that's how those

[37:16] those handles came about whose idea was it to make you know the scoring is almost different if

[37:22] you play with the handles instead of the flipper buttons who idea whose idea was that

[37:27] uh whose idea was what the scoring was almost different if you if you use the the the handles

[37:34] versus the flipper buttons whose idea was that I don't remember who's idea that was probably that

[37:42] might have been had f's fridge people to use the handles I don't know and what about the the art

[37:48] what there I heard there was some challenges with the art in Wesley Snipes and and Stallone

[37:54] had a lot of challenges with that art because everybody wanted their head the same size

[38:00] and everybody wanted their head big so that finally just gave up and did what hope but all the

[38:08] talent wanted and and that's how the backlash came out so when you did a backlash like that you

[38:16] mean you'd actually have to give a copy to each one of the actors and they'd have to sign off on it

[38:21] for every license game we have they have to sign off on it sure and was this always easy to work with

[38:28] El Viro was easy yeah she was easy to work with she's got all the attributes and she's the only

[38:36] actress too in the in the back class yeah right you know so here you got three people you know you

[38:43] got Stallone and you got Snipes and I guess to a smaller degree bullet right right now was

[38:49] bullet very hard to work with we really never had we never worked with those people it was just

[38:55] getting the approvals for the illustration for the artwork so who complained the most

[39:02] you know you have to talk to Doug about that I don't know I think I think it might have been

[39:06] Wesley complained a lot because he didn't like looking real sinister from what I remember but he

[39:12] was such a sinister guy in the movie right now the next one he did was Indianapolis 500 and now I've

[39:18] got that game it well it's I don't know neither cars ever crash talked to Andy marketing

[39:29] they go around and around and around and around but nobody ever crashes oh you can't

[39:33] well no we couldn't have crashes I actually had and Mark Wayne reminded me of this I had this

[39:40] little plastic box and I had a bunch of crashed car parts and you were going to hit it with the

[39:45] ball and parts would fly everywhere and they absolutely would not allow any crashing so you couldn't

[39:51] have anything I mean it seems kind of hypocritical well they just didn't want to promote crashing they

[39:58] wanted to promote the the quality racing maybe you guys should have went for the NASCAR theme instead

[40:07] I don't think those guys would have complained no they kind of like crashing don't they hey sure

[40:12] see do they I mean all the six o'clock highlights are always crashes I know yeah but

[40:20] Indy 500 was more upscale uptown huh yeah yeah that was yeah so I mean was that game were you

[40:27] were you satisfied with that game in the end yeah I was pretty satisfied with every game in the end

[40:33] but I mean was it I didn't didn't like a you know a theme limiter like that you know kind of

[40:39] taking a lot of the fun out didn't that kind of you know curtail your creativity yeah there's

[40:43] all especially with license games there's always something that you want to do that you can't do

[40:49] I had problems with pirates and I have some problems with my current game but licensing gives you

[40:57] a different set of problems and an original theme yeah but there's always some things that

[41:05] you feel like your hands are tied you have to work around it yeah the one thing in the

[41:09] Indy 500 never seems like the race ever really comes to a conclusive end yeah I then you don't

[41:16] have to play that game for a while I kind of forget how it all worked now the next one of course was

[41:21] the you know one of my favorite games and that's the the scared stiff which is like basically L

[41:26] pirate too so how was was Cassandra now was a little bit older was she easier harder to work with

[41:34] at this point she was just as easy to work with and just as fun to work with and there's a lot

[41:42] of people at Williams that didn't want to do that game at all because they thought oh we did

[41:45] a viral on so why do you want to do it again so was that your idea to get that theme again yeah I

[41:51] wanted to get it again and then Greg came on board and he wanted to do it again too and I

[41:59] I had gone to a car show in Chicago and I knew Al Vauer was making an appearance there

[42:04] and so I was able to talk to her at the car show and she said sure she'd love to do another game

[42:10] so that's how that got started now the some of the interesting stuff on that game like

[42:17] the glow in the dark parts tell me how did that come about and why didn't that end up in the final

[42:22] you know like in the final production versions well in the beginning the

[42:26] plastic smolder told us oh yeah that glow in the dark stuff that'll be free that won't cost you

[42:31] anything I'll just throw that in there and I just thought it would be nice because I thought at

[42:37] one point like to turn off all the lights in the game and I knew that stuff would be activated

[42:42] by the lights in the game so if you played in a dark room you'd see all these bones glowing

[42:49] but it turned out I guess after I got laid off they decided to raise the price on the glow in

[42:54] the dark bones so they had to leave the glow in the dark stuff out now the the bony beast

[43:01] I had in that why did that have so many different incarnations yeah you know I don't know why we

[43:06] why the sculptor would change it I don't know why it was changed so many times because each one

[43:15] looked pretty cool but maybe he just felt like he wanted to tweak a little bit here and there

[43:22] and maybe some of the early ones would have been too hard to mold because they had too much

[43:26] detail in them now the the skull pile with the LEDs and the candle flames was that just a cost

[43:33] savings thing why that didn't get implemented into the final game yeah that was a cost savings

[43:38] thing I found that when I was at the Disney World and I went through the pirates of the Caribbean

[43:45] ride and I came out and they have a little store there and I saw this pile of skulls and I thought oh

[43:49] wow that might be cool for my next Elvira game so I bought it and I drilled out all the eyes

[43:57] and stuck some LEDs in there and it looked really nice so then we sculpted our own and we had the

[44:02] LED boards made they were flexible they were boards that were designed to be bent and fit in place

[44:10] so they had all the engineering work done and some boards made and everything but

[44:16] for cost reasons they took it out now whose idea was it to include that that decal to hide the

[44:22] cleavage on Elvira I believe that was marketing again those guys screw up everything you know family

[44:31] locations wouldn't get irritated yeah those guys screw up everything don't they

[44:39] on the first Elvira Elvira in a party monsters I had red eyes in the skull and they made

[44:45] us change it to green because they said in the south that the red eyes represent the devil and

[44:51] they could never sell any games in the south okay so that's why the skull mountain

[45:01] Elvira the party monsters has green eyes now there was a change on the play field I mean this

[45:07] is kind of a bizarre one but the stiffle meter level three the face on their change is there any

[45:13] story behind that I don't know what the deal is with that that's something you'll have to ask

[45:18] Greg about was there anything else anything else that was any good stories or anything fun about

[45:23] that game oh it's probably a million other like this I can't remember them all with the one

[45:29] one story I remember is that we had a hell of a time trying to come up with a cool name for that

[45:36] game and we got really far along and Greg needed a name because he was doing the artwork Greg and

[45:44] I kept coming up with Elvira and the spooky spider or Elvira and the hunter house or Elvira and

[45:50] the something or other and it just wasn't working and finally Greg and I thought we had it and I

[45:56] forget what it was that we citer was so great and we went in and we told Mike Boone and and we

[46:02] were Greg and we were so excited and relieved to finally have this problem solved and Mike just went

[46:07] eh that's not so great and so we were really bummed and we went back to my office and we were

[46:14] sitting there kind of feeling glum and Greg looks up in his eyes get wide and he says scared stuff

[46:22] and we knew right then that was the name yeah that is that's a great name now what about the

[46:29] RRR thing on the side of the cabinet another another Greg thing and he like was just an enhancement

[46:39] of rated R this game was rated RRR I think it was rude raunchy and ribbed or something like

[46:49] maybe not rude raunchy and I forget what it all was but it got kind of kind of taken off the side

[46:56] more or less kind of yeah we had to get rid of it so they he put a plum mark through it

[47:03] what was the what it was just a little too too over the edge risk a I guess what happened in 1996

[47:10] like almost done with that project was that did you get caught up in the black Thursday layoff

[47:16] or something I did and man I was so into work on my game I had no idea that was coming that was

[47:22] I was stunned in fact that morning we uh Mike and I and was a Chris Granner or Paul Hage I think

[47:31] was Paul Hage went downtown Chicago for a a sound recording uh Cassandra was going to call in

[47:42] and do some sound recording but they had screwed up their schedule and she wasn't available

[47:49] so we came back home and I mean came back came back to the office and that's when I got laid

[47:55] off it was me and John Trudeau and Barry Aisler and where did you go from there oh I designed some

[48:01] redemption games for ski ball uh tower power which is a pretty popular game you see that almost

[48:07] in every location yeah it's kind of a standard redemption game yeah and um then I tried

[48:17] a few games on my own and I fold one to Bromley did okay but not great and then Joe Kamenka gave me a

[48:26] call to come out and work at IGT and so to design like new mechanical devices for uh slot machine

[48:37] bonus uh top or things and um my wife didn't want to move so he let me work here for my home in

[48:46] Chicago and I fly out there every month with like a new idea they patented a lot of my ideas and

[48:53] used three or four of them on their slot machine games and then one day right hands are

[48:59] giving me a call and asking if I'd like to design 10 games for Stern and I said absolutely

[49:05] so do you still work for IGT like on a part-time basis oh not at all

[49:12] so you mean you blew off IGT and went to work full time for Stern oh so you're like on the payroll

[49:18] then for Stern employee at IGT and now you're on the payroll with Stern right and of course you

[49:25] got great theme pirates of the Caribbean I mean that got a you couldn't ask for a better theme oh I

[49:31] was a tremendous theme a very fortunate to have that for the theme for my first game after 10 years

[49:37] yeah how was it to have like a 10-year layoff and then was it hard to get back in the groove

[49:42] no because I always really wanted to design another pinball game and um it was a little harder

[49:47] it's turned because we had to do a lot more than I was used to doing at Williams at Williams

[49:51] we always had people that would digitize our playfield and make sure everything was correct and we

[49:56] just we had a lot more help at Williams I have to do the designers that Stern have to do a lot more

[50:03] with making sure you got the punch drawing on the bottom of the playfield on the top of the

[50:10] playfield so all your parts are correct you have to do the trap line for the artwork and

[50:17] just a lot more things you have to do so there was a lot of things I had to learn that I hadn't done

[50:21] before was the was the corporate environment um significantly different at Stern compared to Williams

[50:31] but the major difference I see is that Gary has a lot of control over everything but it's Gary's

[50:37] you mean the management kind of stayed out of the way at Williams yeah pretty much yeah they would

[50:44] you know put their fingers in one to a while but they let us we were able to do a lot of stuff

[50:48] that we wanted to do so is is Gary pretty easy to work with or is he kind of a control freak

[50:55] Gary likes to have a lot of control and there's there's certain things that he believes have to be

[50:59] in every game but I like his philosophy is that he really tries to get every game to have

[51:07] something for the novice or beginning player that they can at least begin to understand what's going

[51:13] on so he always fights for things like that what you said that there's certain things that he wants

[51:22] that he demands in every game like do you mean like from a hardware point of view you know like

[51:26] as far as you know this game has to have jet bumpers that's a pinball game every game needs a plunger shot

[51:33] things like that were Williams didn't have those criteria right

[51:39] now was there any good stories and working with pirates that was obviously another

[51:43] license theme from Disney were they easy to work with no they were the most difficult

[51:48] license we ever worked with everything was separate for that license the only thing we got was

[51:54] the title we didn't get actors we didn't get music we didn't get lines from the movie everything

[52:00] was separate so you know in that respect I was a little disappointed with the game because we

[52:07] couldn't make it exactly like the movie but I was still real happy with the way the the thinking

[52:14] ship came out was that your design that toy yeah I mean I I made it like a little model of how I

[52:22] of how I wanted it to work but I had no idea how he could actually do it but I just want I knew I

[52:27] wanted it to to think the way that it looks and the sales fall down but but John Rotherman the

[52:36] mechanical guy he's the guy that made it work I had no idea how to do all that now is you say that

[52:42] you couldn't get any of the you couldn't use any lines from the movie so that must have been now

[52:49] Disney everything is separate it was it was disappointing I mean even Gary I don't think

[52:55] realize that in the beginning and I just I remember thinking wow Walt Disney was still in charge of

[53:01] this this would never happen was it you mean you would you mean everything was kind of like

[53:05] out of a cart where you get the title you pay this much if you want this actor you pay more if you

[53:10] want lines from the movie you pay more yeah and it would just get spin out of control price wise

[53:14] oh yeah so we just couldn't do it basically you had to make your own Pirates of the Caribbean movie

[53:21] yeah that's what we did now the we licensed that the one song uh yoho yoho it's a pirate life for me

[53:29] we had to pay for that Johnny Dap wasn't interested in doing the line but we had to use a

[53:35] Disney supply town the like and um we would have had to have done that for every character in the

[53:42] movie so we just couldn't afford it so you mean you you actually did talk to the actor Dap and he

[53:48] just had no interest we didn't but through through his agent and our representative at Disney

[53:56] that's how that happened yeah so then they give kind of like a fake Johnny has it maybe

[54:03] to speak his to speak your the lines that you're writing yeah and how did you think that the fake

[54:10] Johnny turned out compared to the real Johnny it sounds good but you couldn't use he's the only

[54:16] one that you could basically copy in the whole movie he's the only character that we could use

[54:22] from the movie but we couldn't use line we couldn't even use his lines from the movie they really

[54:28] had you handcuffed oh I know it was it was difficult and then we had uh everything recorded

[54:35] and we had no time to change it and then Disney decided they didn't like half of the stuff

[54:41] because I think Disney we worked with I guess Disney marketing and then Disney Studios got involved

[54:48] and they wanted to change more stuff so at least the third of the script stuff we wanted to use we

[54:55] had to eliminate it because we had no time to re-record it and they made little changes a few words

[55:00] here and there and we couldn't use it did this score up your timeline big time well we missed

[55:07] I don't know if that was I don't think that was the reason we missed the movie opening but it

[55:13] it just meant that there was a lot of stuff we wanted in that we couldn't put in

[55:17] is it something you can go back later and add back in I don't think so now because we'd have to go

[55:22] through Disney again and that's not gonna happen well I'll tell you one thing that you know from

[55:28] best that I could tell that game sold like gangbusters that game I believe is over 5,000 in less than a year

[55:35] and now with the new movie coming out I you know maybe they'll tool up and do it again

[55:40] yeah well we keep running them every once in a while we get more and more orders I mean

[55:46] I guess some hardcore players it doesn't appeal to but we did something right because we've

[55:50] sold a ton of them I think it's a really good game I mean I've never really yeah I guess some of

[55:56] the hardcore people maybe you know it they don't think it's hard enough or something but you know

[56:01] that's that that comment does not come up a lot you know and I have to give Dwight credit Dwight

[56:07] had four months to do that game and I think he did a tremendous job in four months how long does

[56:14] they usually get a six to eight so you have that boy working overtime oh those programmers they all

[56:20] work over we all work over time so what is the secret to creating a pinball that's fun to play is

[56:28] it ball flow toys theme all the above oh my god that's that's a good question yeah it's like

[56:36] the question of the day right question of the year why ask me that question well I can well you

[56:46] got to understand that the the white water is like I mean you set the mark so high with that game

[56:53] you know I mean people just they ran or even about that game yeah that was a very successful game

[56:59] you know and somebody else asked what your next game in stern is there any way that it'll be reminiscent

[57:05] of white water and and I know you kind of spoke to that a little bit that white water was really

[57:11] expensive to make and that nothing could you that you probably don't have the budget to do that but I

[57:15] mean is there any you know anything that's reminiscent of white water in any of your you know the

[57:20] next game or future games boy I don't think you're going to see a white water again

[57:26] I mean we even have trouble trying to budget a mini play field in anymore you mean a plastic mini

[57:33] play field well plastic is more doable than than another wooden one that's for sure it's just too

[57:41] much money huh I believe that yeah in today's market it's just too much money it's you know all

[57:47] of our costs have gone up so much copper and just everything we do everything's gone up and

[57:52] Gary's trying to hold the line on price increases and our budgets become tighter and tighter

[57:58] for what's in the games is that make things really really tough or just medium tough um well I'll

[58:07] say that it makes some medium tough because whatever you design it's just a challenge to work

[58:14] within the envelope that you have and you know you have a certain envelope a certain budget and so

[58:20] that's the challenge is to try to make something fun within that envelope uh sometimes

[58:29] you know I don't have any formulas or anything that I work with I I start with a blank sheet of

[58:34] paper on every game and whatever comes to me or whatever direction the game kind of tells me

[58:43] that it wants to go that's that's the way I go um so I really I have to have a theme firmly in mind

[58:51] before I can even start drawing a play field because the theme dictates what the features are

[58:58] and the shots are to me that's the way I work anyway well I mean is there you're saying some themes

[59:04] or make maybe more flowing and others are more stop and go like that oh no now the reason pirates

[59:11] would stop and go here is here is my thinking on that uh we we we try to attract new players

[59:20] and there's just not as many people playing in public as they used to be now part of that is because

[59:27] there's no arcades I've talked to um experienced hardcore players that can't even find games on

[59:35] location anymore they travel around the different bars and they can't even find games so

[59:39] now trying to attract new players and keep the highly skilled players that's that's a delicate balance and what I tried to do with pirates was

[59:50] my thinking was that if the balls always flying back to the flippers that's going to intimidate a new player

[59:58] or a casual player because he'll be afraid he's got a flip and he's not scorned anything so with pirates I intentionally

[01:00:06] made the ball go places and stay there and score so the casual player would feel good like he's

[01:00:12] accomplishing something like when you go up into the spinning disc or something it stays there for

[01:00:18] island scores and and so I purposely didn't try to deliver the ball to the flipper all the time um

[01:00:26] it must you know I must have gotten something right because we've sold a hell of a lot of those

[01:00:31] games more than a lot of other games um it's a cool yeah it's not my new game that I'm working on now

[01:00:38] it's gonna have a lot more flow just to keep things interesting and challenging to me

[01:00:44] I want to do something different every time so like if I was successful with whitewater I didn't

[01:00:50] start making everything like whitewater I still like to experiment with new stuff and when you

[01:00:55] experiment you you can fail a lot too I not always be successful but that's what makes the design

[01:01:02] process challenging and keeps me interested when we just started doing clones of something that

[01:01:08] was successful or wouldn't be fun for me anymore and did um did the black rows at Williams did that

[01:01:15] have any influence on pirates whatsoever no I I looked at that game but um just to see what it

[01:01:23] was and see what was on it but and then I just didn't look at it anymore and I consciously there was no

[01:01:32] implants I heard that there was I heard that there was like a black rose pirate though in the

[01:01:40] stern maybe that was probably the software guys all right oh yeah probably yeah they do stuff I never

[01:01:47] know about oh really those software guys oh yeah they always do that put in Easter eggs and things

[01:01:54] like that yeah and they and you have in you just they don't tell you sometimes they do sometimes

[01:01:59] they don't I don't really care you know if they want to put in some secret stuff that makes it fun

[01:02:05] for them then I'm all for it all right one other question we got from another another email question

[01:02:11] this one's um well you can judge by this one what why didn't pirates have at least an orbit in

[01:02:18] one direction the lack of an orbit seemed to severely limit flow in the game and and I think

[01:02:23] you would kind of answer that in your in your prior I think that that would be my answer I would say

[01:02:29] the same thing again and I don't remember I'd have to go back and look at all my games but I don't

[01:02:36] know if I've ever done an orbit shot before now maybe you can think off the top of your head

[01:02:43] but I'm not sure if I have an orbit that goes from say from the right flipper to the left side

[01:02:50] of the play field all the way around and comes back to the right flipper I don't know I don't know

[01:02:56] that I've ever really done that before well there you go next game it's it's on this game

[01:03:02] it's not my next game so yeah that's why there's no orbit on pirates again my my reasoning was

[01:03:10] I was trying not to intimidate a casual or or new player how many of those we have I have no idea

[01:03:18] of those kinds of players I don't know peeled to a lot of people because we've sold

[01:03:22] 5,000 of those at this point and that's an amazing run for this time and eight day and age that's

[01:03:27] an amazing run in less than a year and it's back on the assembly line right well a lot of our game

[01:03:33] yeah it's back it'll be back for when it's back for another couple hundred I believe

[01:03:38] so but we do that well you know starting does that a lot now right so I imagine pirates will run

[01:03:44] on and off for a while when they get more orders just like you know we've run Simpsons and Lord and

[01:03:51] we do that a lot Gary does that a lot he can make money doing that so that's cool right

[01:03:56] right no now how are you are you paid for games per sales or you just flat plate paid

[01:04:03] I'm just a salary to employ now are all the designers like that I don't know what all their

[01:04:12] deals are I know they they're the rest of them are in a contract because they don't work for

[01:04:17] Stern they so I get I'm just like an employee I get the health benefits and all that stuff the

[01:04:24] other guys have a contract to do a game and rather they get if they get royalties or not I

[01:04:31] I don't know the answer to all of that but that was different than when you were at Williams right

[01:04:35] him we did get royalties yes was that nice all amount but you know it it helped when a game got done

[01:04:43] I mean it was the so you're saying that the royalties wasn't like the big the big cheese at the end

[01:04:48] no no it was just like a pleasant it was like a pleasant little bonus at the end of every game

[01:04:55] right my royalties or I don't know what the other guys deals were all you mean it could be

[01:05:00] variable per designer it could have been sure I'm sure our salaries were different and so I don't

[01:05:06] know so but he's individual deal with so when you sell 5,000 pirates it's just a feel good for you

[01:05:13] yes well it's a pretty good feel good it's a pretty good feel good and yeah and um you got

[01:05:20] like it you got to like it yeah you got to love it even though you know even though there are some

[01:05:24] people that are happy with it there's more people that are happy with it so no I think it's a great

[01:05:29] game and I don't mind the criticism I um you know you can't please everybody all the time I think

[01:05:36] you please the mass populace pretty well with that game I agree I'll agree with that and

[01:05:42] that's what keeps us in business right so that's so in that respect the game was hugely successful yeah

[01:05:50] now what was your question or whitewater let me see if I can go back and your original question

[01:05:55] what is the secret to creating pinball that's fun is it the flow the toys the theme I don't

[01:06:01] think there's any one secret there's several combinations of all of those elements I would say

[01:06:06] that could make a game fun you don't need all of the elements in every game and um

[01:06:16] but you probably need some of the elements in every game but in different combinations right

[01:06:21] for example pirates doesn't have flow but it's fun and successful so so you know that game's good

[01:06:27] whitewater and demolition man had much more flow and they were successful so I don't know the

[01:06:35] secret to a successful game because there's just dozens of different approaches right and you

[01:06:42] can't take the same one every time I I won't I just won't do it because then it's not fun for me

[01:06:48] right and that's why I design games because I find that rewarding and challenging I really have

[01:06:54] get more enjoyment out of designing than I do playing if you were going to do a game

[01:07:00] a future game was stern could you even have the number of plastic molded ramps that were on

[01:07:07] whitewater and in today's games the ramps possibly yeah but it's the the actual mini wood playfield

[01:07:18] that's the big expense that's a big expense because that that comes out of a whole separate piece of

[01:07:22] wood and so to screen that and to even if you can I was going to say even if you can cut the wood

[01:07:33] out of a regular playfield that is cheaper but then it's expensive to mount it I mean we're really

[01:07:39] cutting we're really cutting pennies out of these games and um so even you know to design some

[01:07:47] Z brackets or whatever come out another playfield those become parts that are 25 30 50 cents

[01:07:56] do you still run that standard joke at stern two where you try and put drop targets and everything

[01:08:01] so you got something to axe out well this is only my second game here at Stern and I haven't

[01:08:07] had even time to do that with either of my games so but stuff gets axed out like on pirates I don't

[01:08:14] know some people know that there was a jet bumper down by the outline and a series of targets

[01:08:21] around it so that when you drained on the left side that was going to be my parlay feature

[01:08:26] and give you a chance to bounce off the jet bumper and hit the targets and spell extra

[01:08:33] parlay and then you would get another chance at life so that feature came out because that was

[01:08:38] too expensive there were in line drop targets and pirates they came out because they were too

[01:08:43] expensive so now you're working on a new game for Stern right yeah can you talk about that at all

[01:08:49] well I can probably tell you that it's wheel of fortune most people a lot of people know that

[01:08:55] I can tell you a lot about it but I can tell you that I think I like the theme and I was happy to

[01:09:02] get the theme because I think it's the kind of game that you're going to walk up to and we keep

[01:09:09] trying to attract we keep trying to do things to attract new players if we just design games for

[01:09:14] the hardcore players we'd be out of business we have to keep trying to attract new people and I

[01:09:19] think with wheel of fortune when anybody walks up to the game they're going to know exactly what

[01:09:24] their main goal is and exactly what they have to do a lot of games are so confusing you don't know

[01:09:31] what you're supposed to do you just to to casual players you just bash the ball around hope something

[01:09:36] good happens but with wheel of fortune you know that you're supposed to solve world puzzles and

[01:09:42] the targets to do that are very obvious right in the middle of the game where everybody shoots I

[01:09:48] think it's going to be cool is it like use a lot of drop targets I don't want to say what it's

[01:09:54] going to have in it because it's a big secret because we don't like to talk about future games

[01:09:59] because we don't want to do anything to slow the sales of current games well did the I mean

[01:10:07] the one thing that I'm sure that people are going to kind of compare this game to is the

[01:10:11] world poker tour in the same basic idea could you know everybody knows how to play poker

[01:10:18] hard yeah you know in and people are definitely going to make that comparison but world poker

[01:10:24] torches did not really do well in are you afraid that that may happen in this case no I don't think

[01:10:32] so I think maybe one of the problems with world poker tour I didn't I don't know how to play poker

[01:10:37] and I didn't play that game a lot because I was busy working on my first 10 ball game after 10

[01:10:43] years so but as I understand there's two games you can play there's Texas hold him and something

[01:10:48] else you can play and I think some people got confused with I don't know with with that and maybe

[01:10:56] that's why I didn't do so well I mean it wasn't simple like a ball now on the on the will of fortune

[01:11:04] license do you get any of the personalities along with the license we're working on that right now

[01:11:11] so that's still up in the air huh you know because I'd like vanna well who doesn't

[01:11:18] I mean are those people easy to work with we're just now getting into it so we'll find out we sub

[01:11:28] I we met with the producers and he liked a lot of my ideas they're very conservative and very

[01:11:36] protective of their license so I mentioned a lot of some of the crazy wild things and humorous

[01:11:42] things I wanted to do and they're very conservative and and don't want some of those things although

[01:11:49] some of the things I mentioned that he liked and laughed about so we'll see we just submitted an

[01:11:54] an initial script about I want to do some funny categories I want to do some funny trips for people

[01:12:02] to win and we'll make you get back to us within the next week or so so I can see if I can get away

[01:12:09] with some of this stuff well you'll know if like you're watching wheel of fortune next week and all

[01:12:14] of sudden your categories now how I mean how far away is this game is this pretty far out it's

[01:12:26] at least September and probably later and did it was this a theme that you actually went after

[01:12:34] it's it's one that Gary mentioned that was available and I said I really liked it and I guess

[01:12:42] everybody else thought it was okay so I told Gary I'd really like to do it and I got it so you

[01:12:50] didn't have to fight the other designers for this one no yeah I can't see Steve Richie want in

[01:12:56] this one she wouldn't do that's not that's not Steve style I don't think Pat Waller would do it either

[01:13:04] you know the I'm surprised I got Steve Richie to do world poker tour yeah I understand he didn't

[01:13:10] really want to but well cool and I wish a good luck with with the with the wheel of fortune I

[01:13:17] mean you know if if anybody wants to follow what you know maybe what I GT did really really good

[01:13:24] with didn't I GT have that or was that Williams had that I GT had that and they did that's become

[01:13:29] a tremendous slot game for them and like I said I think it's I think people are going to be surprised

[01:13:37] because it's not going to be just boring wheel of fortune it's got some interesting things in it

[01:13:43] think about all the trips they give away and modes you can do with that and the programmers are

[01:13:50] they're all pretty hyped up for try this yeah I've got Keith on this game so I'm real happy about that

[01:13:57] and Keith is excited well good I wish a great luck with that one I mean you've done some

[01:14:02] amazing games and hopefully this one will be a big success for you well thank you and I hope

[01:14:07] that we'll too I think I think people are going to be surprised so do you like being back in the

[01:14:13] pinball design you know the seat again I just love I love everything about the whole process

[01:14:20] I don't like the arguing I don't like the stress and I don't like the hours but

[01:14:27] I love everything I love the whole creative process involved I like

[01:14:32] laying out the play field and inventing toys and working the see integrating the same into the

[01:14:37] play field and the rules and working a little with the artwork and writing script and speech

[01:14:47] and the choreography and the light shows and the sounds I love the whole process so when you had to

[01:14:53] submit the script like for the wheel of fortune you wrote that whole script um no I had like three or

[01:14:59] four ideas for trips I want to take we use a writer from second city and he is just fantastic I

[01:15:06] thought I was great for especially even with pirates I thought I was great for coming up with

[01:15:11] fiber six really cool pirate lines and he came up with pages and pages and pages and stuff

[01:15:18] within a couple of weeks he's tremendous so you mean this is like a comedy guy that you hire

[01:15:24] yeah and is that just to sell the theme back to the licensee what when he actually no he writes

[01:15:31] all the stuff that we use in the game really so he does all the games I don't think he did family

[01:15:38] guy I know I don't know what all he's done I know he did pirates and I'm not sure what else he's

[01:15:46] done he oh he did a lot I believe for Simpson his name is um Dylan Eric and this is like a little

[01:15:54] sideline for him I want to put one in because he just comes up with so much cool stuff now

[01:16:01] did you have to write scripts like that when you were at Williams too yeah in fact we did a lot more

[01:16:06] of it by ourselves because we didn't we didn't hire a writer so I would come up with lines Greg

[01:16:13] would come up with line so was that the hardest part about doing a game is just getting that off

[01:16:17] the ground no that's not the hardest part it's the fun part man it would be the hard part for me

[01:16:26] well wiring or doing something electrical would be the hard part for me man the part I want to do

[01:16:31] is kick that big piece of paper and draw out a play field on it oh man that's one of the most

[01:16:36] intimidating things there is is when you're looking at that blank piece of paper where the hell do you

[01:16:42] start I remember with I think with scared stiff I started with the monster ramp you mean the

[01:16:50] bony beast ramp thing but that could be that's the hardest one of the hard that's the hardest

[01:16:56] thing to get started figuring out what toys you want to incorporate where to put them how to make

[01:17:00] everything fit make your shots move that's what I'm dealing with on wheel of fortune right now

[01:17:07] some of my shots just aren't smooth now after a while you have experience for what works and what

[01:17:13] doesn't work but it doesn't always work the way you think it's going to work now do you do that

[01:17:18] with just with paper and pen or is that done all on on computer an auto CAD we do all aren't drawing on

[01:17:23] auto CAD and some all of our engineers work and solve works they do everything in 3d I'm just I

[01:17:31] just don't want to take the time to learn is that like when you started out doing special

[01:17:36] force and party animal in that you weren't using any kind of auto CAD back I didn't I think my first

[01:17:41] game in auto CAD was in the 500 oh so you mean even like white water was done all on just pen and

[01:17:47] paper yeah pencil and paper pencil and mylar we drew on big mylar sheets because that doesn't

[01:17:55] get affected by the humidity huh so in the 500 was the first one was that a big learning curve

[01:18:00] yeah that was a learning curve for sure yeah probably so longer I believe it was in the 500 that

[01:18:06] was my first one and is that the way all the designers have always done it that's the way

[01:18:11] everybody works now yeah well cool hair appreciate you let me call you up and bother you

[01:18:15] so bother it's it's it's an honor just not a very good one that's a great honor it's nice how

[01:18:23] many people have jobs where people call them up or talk to them or email them how much they

[01:18:29] appreciate what you do well cool Dennis I really do appreciate your time and and and again good

[01:18:35] luck to you on this next game well thank you yeah I hope it turns out good and I appreciate your

[01:18:41] calling and talking to me no I appreciate the time I really do and and thanks again oh you're very

[01:18:47] welcome all right take care and good night bye I like to thank Dennis Norman for joining us tonight

[01:18:53] on topcast it was a really good talk and I really do appreciate his time and I hope everyone will

[01:18:57] back to hear us again on another episode of Topcast
