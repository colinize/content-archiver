[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:11] Today on Topcast I'd like to welcome another pinball game designer, this gentleman worked

[00:28] on his

[00:57] for them too. So we're going to give John a call right now on the phone.

[01:00] Hello?

[01:04] John, it's Clay. Okay, are you ready?

[01:16] Yeah, I'm ready. Okay, well, John, you know, you've kind of had a long history in pinball

[01:22] and I see you've been, you've kind of started out as a collector first before you became

[01:27] a designer. What should tell me how you got into pinball? You know, your first memories

[01:32] of it and how you ultimately got to be coming a designer?

[01:36] Well, that's kind of a long story, but I'll go at the beginning.

[01:40] The first time I remember playing pinball was we, I was with my family and we were in Santa Barbara.

[01:51] It's kind of like a coastal town here that has four big people on vacation and things.

[01:59] Then they had an arcade and where I lived, the pinball is illegal in a lot of territories

[02:06] in California, but back when I was growing up, so you know, we came back to a lot of places

[02:12] where it was illegal, but I just didn't have to go. So basically, as I was in, I didn't have pinball.

[02:18] And there was an arcade and I was, there was like a flea market downstairs and arcade upstairs.

[02:26] The family was in this flea market and I ventured upstairs and discovered a whole room full of pinball machines.

[02:33] And all that I can remember was the first game I played was red and that it must have been a manual lip

[02:41] because I remember that I got two balls. So like when you looked at the ball,

[02:47] there were two balls into the runway instead of one.

[02:51] And that would probably maybe nine or ten years old up the time.

[02:57] And then many years went by, to that first black line I was playing, but then many years went by

[03:03] and my very first job I had when I was basically, it had just graduated high school.

[03:11] I was working for a bicycle shop and an operator came by and put in a candy machine.

[03:19] And then he asked the owner of the bike shop if he wouldn't mind a pinball machine too

[03:25] because there was a little area where the candy machine was and there was plenty of room to put another game.

[03:29] Of course the owner said, you know, when you heard that was 50-50 split and all that good stuff, he said go ahead and put it in.

[03:35] And that game was a sweet heart.

[03:39] And that was basically the game I was working there.

[03:44] You know, you just start playing it every day and then after a while, you know, I got to like pinball and would go out at that point

[03:53] and go and search them out and there were places like nature golf courses and other places.

[04:01] This would be the early 70s that had pinball machines.

[04:05] So you mean they put a 1963 Gottlieb sweetheart in in the 70s?

[04:10] So it kind of an older game for that time.

[04:13] That the paint was so worn off, you couldn't read it and that the lighting surf, basically that was the all-over special lighting surf.

[04:21] You couldn't read what it would light it.

[04:25] We always wondered what would light it.

[04:28] And all of a sudden one day we got that all-over special lit and that light came on and every rollover gave a replay.

[04:35] So that was this operator was getting all of his menus worth out of it at that time a 10-year-old game.

[04:43] And of course, you know, if you look nowadays, you see a lot of games that came to roll the roll or being operated.

[04:49] So that was it.

[04:52] And then the owner of the bike shop saw that we were putting all our money into this machine and he went down to Sierra Robinson and bought a golf stream.

[05:04] So he basically kicked out the operator pinball and put it in his own.

[05:12] And that was kind of when I got started to get good at pinball.

[05:17] It was like, you know, it could basically be for free.

[05:20] And he would just open the door and rack of credits whenever it was slow and we would put a pinball.

[05:27] And then when I was, you know, at the time I was going to college and I started playing pinball in ball analyses.

[05:34] One of my favorite locations was Honeyton Lane, Detaining to Beach, which in colonial lanes in Costa Mesa, which were no longer there.

[05:41] And then when I transferred to the university, they had a student union there.

[05:47] At this point, these were late 70s.

[05:51] And they had a mix of election mechanicals and that's in the first all state games that are coming out.

[06:00] And at that point, I decided to start collecting games.

[06:07] And I had a small collection.

[06:09] I met Sam Harvey. It must have been 78.

[06:14] Or so when I met Sam and at the time he only had a dozen games.

[06:19] And I was just starting a collection and I played Sam's games and like slick chick movies.

[06:24] I never played before.

[06:26] And so him and Russ were on the lookout to get me a slick chick.

[06:30] And it was kind of this grass-bubble collecting.

[06:33] It was very grass roots where there were only a few people who knew each other.

[06:36] And there were no conventions.

[06:38] And basically anything that was organized back in those days.

[06:43] And...

[06:44] Well, now wait. How did you find Russ Jensen and Sam Harvey?

[06:49] You know, two guys are like very early on were collectors.

[06:52] How did you find these guys?

[06:55] With Sam and Russ, there was a magazine called the amusement review that Jim Tolbert put out.

[07:04] And it would probably be about 78.

[07:08] And he was just trying to start a magazine and somehow Russ and Sam and me all found out about this magazine.

[07:20] And we all...

[07:23] I think I put an ad in or something one at Old Pinball machines.

[07:27] And that's something that one point.

[07:29] Remember Russ was calling me and we were talking...

[07:32] We talked on the phone for a while and then later on he called me,

[07:37] all those nilic collector near you.

[07:39] His name is Sam. He gave me Sam's number.

[07:42] And I called Sam and came over and visited him.

[07:46] And in the house he still lives in.

[07:49] And that's how I met those guys.

[07:52] And there were no shows yet.

[07:54] And then there was the fun fair where we went to and we met more people.

[08:01] And you know, the fun fairs, while those...

[08:03] Lex Cogelang shows that's basically two box slot machines.

[08:07] But there are some pinballs.

[08:09] And so we went to that show.

[08:12] And this would probably be late 70s or early 80s.

[08:15] And we had a lot of fun show every year.

[08:18] And then in the...

[08:21] I think it was 85.

[08:24] Because we knew Rob Burke also,

[08:26] because I was talking on the phone sometimes.

[08:29] And then he was talking to a pinball expo.

[08:32] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[08:33] Before we talk about Rob Burke and the pinball expo.

[08:36] Something I've always kind of wondered was,

[08:39] what was the population of games?

[08:41] I find that on west of the Mississippi,

[08:44] pinballs seem to be much more rare than on the Midwest and the East Coast.

[08:49] Did you have any...

[08:50] I mean, did you have to go long and hard to find games for sale or games to play in California?

[08:56] Yes, and at that time I did,

[08:58] because I was trying to start a collection.

[09:01] And for example, one of my early wood rails was a dragon egg.

[09:05] And it was up in Portland, Oregon,

[09:08] and then rust found out about the game.

[09:10] And I drove all...

[09:11] It just from Los Angeles.

[09:12] I drove all the way up to Portland, Oregon,

[09:15] which is probably a thousand miles each way just to get the game.

[09:21] Wow.

[09:22] And you know, there was also a newspaper,

[09:28] all those newspapers that people compared free ads in called the recycler,

[09:33] that you would basically...

[09:35] You would know that they're really pinball collectors competing,

[09:38] so you would just look for any pinballs for sale in the recycler.

[09:42] And basically call and go over and look at the games,

[09:47] because a lot of times Sam and I would go out from ads in the recycler.

[09:52] And sometimes we would find two or three ads and go on a Sunday or Saturday game hunt

[10:00] to look up on these games with that in the recycler.

[10:04] And then as years went on,

[10:06] and the hobby became more established,

[10:09] then that became tough,

[10:10] because you had to get the recycler early and call before the other collector call.

[10:16] But in the early years there wasn't really that stress to do that,

[10:20] because there was no one else looking for games.

[10:22] Now how did you know about...

[10:24] You started playing in the metal rail era,

[10:27] in the games from the 60s.

[10:29] How did you know about wood rails?

[10:31] I mean a lot of people don't...

[10:33] I taught too.

[10:34] They've never even seen a wood rail before.

[10:36] And what type of prices were you paying back then too?

[10:40] Well, Sam basically told me about him,

[10:45] because he had been a player since the basically late 50s.

[10:52] And then I was also working part-time for a route operator.

[11:00] Doing his repairs.

[11:02] And my first wood rail was at one of the bars

[11:08] where we had a pool table work,

[11:10] where I don't know,

[11:12] because I was his employee,

[11:14] but where the operator had a pool table cigarette machine,

[11:17] jukebox, and penball machine.

[11:19] The bar made there, you know, new diagnostics games,

[11:22] and she asked me one day what this old game was worth.

[11:26] It was a got laid plain bill.

[11:29] And I had no idea.

[11:32] And she said that, you know,

[11:34] if you want it, you can pay $100.

[11:37] You know, give me $100 and come get it.

[11:39] So I went and picked up the twin bill,

[11:42] and I'd really never played wood rail before that.

[11:45] And I just...

[11:46] It was just a wonderful game.

[11:47] I just fell in love with that game.

[11:49] And at that point I started to look for wood rails.

[11:52] Well, twin bill is actually

[11:55] probably one of the better single player wood rails

[11:58] from the 1950s, certainly from the mid-50s.

[12:00] It's a great game.

[12:02] It is a great game.

[12:04] And I paid $100 for that game.

[12:08] I think that in the late 70s and through the 80s,

[12:14] I paid typically between $100 and $300 for each wood rail.

[12:21] And at the time,

[12:23] because this was by when after I got rid of the Chicago,

[12:26] where there are many more wood rails,

[12:28] and I would go to the Chicago Land Show.

[12:31] I'm Friday morning when the trucks came in.

[12:34] You know, all these guys had, you know,

[12:36] were there sort of booths selling,

[12:38] two boxes, slot machines,

[12:41] and more, you know, non-pinball.

[12:44] And everyone's wanted to have a pinball with them,

[12:46] and they would basically just want you to...

[12:49] They wouldn't even want to bring it inside.

[12:51] They just wouldn't sell out of the back of their truck.

[12:54] And at the early years, like 86 or 87,

[12:58] there were no other collectors there.

[13:00] So I would get there, and I would have to be buying,

[13:03] I think, one stud one.

[13:05] So I must have bought 8 or 10 games.

[13:07] You know, because no one else wanted them.

[13:09] Of course, in later years,

[13:10] by the time you got into the 90s,

[13:12] in the pinball exit,

[13:13] I had established,

[13:14] and there were more collectors,

[13:16] than it was a more difficult.

[13:18] The find them,

[13:19] because there were a lot of other people looking for them at the same time.

[13:22] But, I think that, you know,

[13:26] I was paying,

[13:28] rarely, rarely, over $500 for a wood rail.

[13:33] And at that time,

[13:34] they had to be, you know,

[13:36] just a mint game.

[13:38] You know, these are the years before eBay,

[13:40] because when I see, when I sold my collection,

[13:43] I was forced to sell my collection.

[13:45] I was basically selling it for what I,

[13:47] my collection for what I paid for the games,

[13:49] because I hadn't appreciated it.

[13:51] And the poetic irony was,

[13:53] just three or four years later,

[13:55] when eBay came out,

[13:56] and all of a sudden,

[13:57] everybody, everybody could,

[13:59] the whole country could bid on the games,

[14:01] you know, the prices doubled and tripled.

[14:03] We're five times now,

[14:05] and they were when I sold them,

[14:07] just 10 years ago.

[14:09] What was your attraction to the wood rails,

[14:12] opposed to, you know,

[14:14] wedge heads or, or, or, or,

[14:16] or even solid state games?

[14:18] Well, I always liked the game rules,

[14:20] because the, um,

[14:23] the designer didn't have a lot of budget to work with,

[14:28] so he had to make a fun to play a game,

[14:30] and the game rules part of it.

[14:31] Now, it was kind of always a game rule,

[14:33] specialists,

[14:34] there were almost like my things to study, you know,

[14:37] they were, these were really cool.

[14:39] Like, he did that with his two or three relays, you know.

[14:41] And the, um,

[14:44] well, in the wedge heads were basically the same.

[14:47] I like the wedge heads just as much.

[14:49] I mean, you know, I would say from 1951

[14:54] through the last wedge head,

[14:58] there were just a lot of really good games,

[15:01] in the single player games I like,

[15:04] because they were jackpot games,

[15:06] so that, you know,

[15:08] when you got the special lit,

[15:10] you could, you know, in five or ten games, you know,

[15:13] it was kind of the,

[15:16] the skill, the luck ratio,

[15:18] was such that, that the designers could put those features in the game,

[15:22] because the good players couldn't dominate the game.

[15:24] You didn't have ball time of two or three minutes of ball.

[15:27] You had game, you had,

[15:29] you had ball time of 30 to 40 seconds,

[15:32] and a lot of, a lot of luck factor,

[15:35] whether you lost the ball or not,

[15:37] with those ingredients,

[15:40] you could make a game,

[15:41] or when you lit the special,

[15:42] if they lit the rest of the game,

[15:44] and you could win, you know,

[15:46] basically get the game up to the credit limit.

[15:48] Now, what about, what about Williams and Balli games?

[15:52] How did you, how did you, how did you like those or dislike those?

[15:57] Well, some, some, I, mostly like Gottliebes.

[16:02] You know, I played everybody's games,

[16:05] and, you know, Williams had some really, really good games too.

[16:12] And Balli, of course, Balli's 50s games,

[16:16] which are, you know, I had never really played the ball to pop in our circle,

[16:19] so any of those, you know,

[16:22] the last 10 to 15 years,

[16:25] because they just, I just never saw any.

[16:28] But Williams games, you know,

[16:31] they're all, all the companies,

[16:33] even Balli games, you know, going into the 70s

[16:37] and, and forward,

[16:39] made, made a lot of really good games too.

[16:42] But, you know, I was just, I guess,

[16:44] it was just, you know,

[16:46] the first level was always they, they got the games,

[16:49] and, that's only a collection centered around the Gottlieb games,

[16:53] but I also have a lot of the great Williams games like Four Roses,

[16:57] and, and there were some really good games like Hotline and Things.

[17:05] I mean, they made some really terrific games in the, you know,

[17:09] in the Electro Mechanical Era, you know,

[17:11] Dolphs play Meals, the game that really got me,

[17:14] that, you know, that I played a lot,

[17:16] and they had the interesting combination of the replay and add-able

[17:22] in one game.

[17:23] I mean, you know, it was,

[17:25] the whole stream was a game where you could,

[17:27] it was in Ball Inplay, it was Balls 2 Play,

[17:29] it was starting off a five ball to play,

[17:31] and some of the features awarded you, you know,

[17:34] additional balls, and some of the features awarded you replays.

[17:37] So, you could get up to, you know,

[17:39] it was like an add-able, you could keep the game going indefinitely,

[17:42] but you could also win replays, do another things.

[17:45] So, that was an interesting combination that,

[17:48] at the time, I didn't know how cool a novel was looking back,

[17:51] or only a few games that were ahead of that feature.

[17:55] Now, back to, oh, I forgot to ask you,

[17:59] you said you went to college,

[18:01] where did you go to school and what you graduated in,

[18:03] and out of college, were you working to be able to afford

[18:06] to buy these games?

[18:09] I went to Cal State Fullerton,

[18:13] and I graduated in 81 with a bachelor's degree in art.

[18:21] I went with a photo and design emphasis.

[18:25] And then I had a friend in Northern Cal,

[18:31] I was living in Southern California at the time,

[18:34] and I had, you know, I just loved Pinball,

[18:37] and I wanted to get it in the Pinball industry at the time,

[18:40] Atari was making Pinball games,

[18:42] and I had a friend who worked for Atari,

[18:47] and he said that there's a possibility that I could get,

[18:51] you know, get a job there,

[18:53] because I just had a school at the time,

[18:55] I guess, that Atari was having really good sales with,

[18:58] you know, their games.

[19:00] So, I basically moved up there to try to get into Atari,

[19:05] and I could never get in,

[19:07] but I ended up getting a job looking for undrived laboratories

[19:13] as a report writer.

[19:15] So, that's when I started, you know,

[19:17] making up money with a real job,

[19:20] to be able to start to get a small collection,

[19:24] and to say I really wasn't.

[19:27] I had a pretty small collection up until I was worked for Gottlieb,

[19:30] and I think when I moved to Chicago,

[19:34] I probably brought about 10 games with me to Chicago.

[19:40] I think I had to sell about 10 games at the time,

[19:44] or maybe 15 or 20 games out of my mini-story in California,

[19:49] because the deal with when I was hired by Gottlieb

[19:53] is that they would pay for my move by a writer truck,

[19:56] so they would reimburse me for the rental of the writer truck,

[20:00] so I basically went down and rented the biggest truck

[20:03] I could legally drive,

[20:05] and loaded as many games that I could into it,

[20:08] and had to sell the rest.

[20:10] Now, did you go to the first pin-robberk pinball expo in 1985?

[20:16] Yes, I did.

[20:17] And how did you find out about that?

[20:19] I got the job with Gottlieb.

[20:21] Oh, okay, well, explain.

[20:23] Well, I was working at Under Artist Laboratory,

[20:29] so I was a big pinball nut and a pinball,

[20:33] and I decided to make a game,

[20:36] make a custom pinball machine,

[20:38] and I made a game,

[20:40] and actually had a location,

[20:43] and for a while,

[20:45] and then I took pictures of it,

[20:50] and I think I had a video-cap of it or something,

[20:53] and then I made a little resume,

[20:55] and made a lot of playfield layouts,

[20:57] and I think what I did was,

[21:00] and I went to Chicago to the first pinball expo,

[21:03] knowing that this is my first time

[21:05] to really be able to give resumes to the pinball companies.

[21:09] I took a day to do it,

[21:11] and I gave one resume to each pinball company at the time.

[21:14] I think there were, I think, five at the time,

[21:17] five pinball companies that were at the pinball expo,

[21:20] that there were Williams, Valley, Gottlieb,

[21:25] Game Plan, and...

[21:28] Stern, maybe?

[21:30] No, Stern has already liquidated.

[21:34] Maybe it was just those four.

[21:36] I remember I brought five resumes with me,

[21:38] but maybe I brought one back,

[21:41] and didn't get it out.

[21:43] And this would be, you know, pinball expo is always in the fall.

[21:48] You know, I was just, you know,

[21:50] I'd young kid and would love to get into pinball design,

[21:55] and then that really didn't think I'd ever hear back

[21:58] from any of these companies,

[22:00] so my plan at the time was to build,

[22:03] but I called it emulator,

[22:05] or the pinball cabinet,

[22:07] where there were plugs in the cabinet,

[22:13] so that I could make a pinball playfield

[22:17] and screw the parts on,

[22:19] and then plug each of the part like a slipper

[22:21] and a pop-up in the same shots into his board,

[22:25] so I could experiment with all these different playfield layouts,

[22:29] and I was going to build this action emulator

[22:32] and actually ship it to Chicago,

[22:34] and get a booth,

[22:36] and have this thing with all these different playfields,

[22:39] and show how I could plug one playfield in,

[22:42] and you know, two minutes,

[22:44] or change playfields over,

[22:46] and that's how I can have like three playfields with me.

[22:48] But as I was just getting started on that project,

[22:52] I got a call from Gil Pollock,

[22:55] and he asked me,

[22:57] he had my resume,

[22:59] and he asked me if I knew how to program on Gilgames.

[23:01] He needed a sound programmer,

[23:03] and I said, no, I go,

[23:05] I really don't know how to do that I could learn,

[23:09] but at the time I would obviously be willing to go there and learn,

[23:14] but they weren't really looking for a trainee,

[23:16] they were looking for someone who could come up and be productive.

[23:21] But then I said to him,

[23:24] I'm always willing to come in as a junior designer,

[23:27] and pinball designer.

[23:29] And then we talked for a while,

[23:33] and just, you know, whatever,

[23:35] and then that probably was a month or two after pinball expo,

[23:40] and then in May of that year,

[23:42] which would be 86,

[23:44] because pinball expo would have been like October,

[23:46] or probably October, or November of 85,

[23:50] and then the next year,

[23:52] in February,

[23:54] or still I got the call from Gil about the sound programmer job,

[23:58] which I didn't qualify for,

[24:00] but then probably late April,

[24:02] I get the call from Gil,

[24:04] and saying that, you know, they're doing well,

[24:06] and they'd like to bring me the fly me to Chicago for an interview.

[24:12] Wait, wait, wait.

[24:14] When the game used to that,

[24:16] you designed your own game,

[24:18] and were operating it, was it a lecture mechanical,

[24:20] or was it solid state?

[24:22] It was a hybrid.

[24:24] It was a solid state.

[24:26] So I used iron stars,

[24:28] but I used to, you know,

[24:32] to convert over into Tour de France,

[24:35] which is the game I made.

[24:39] But then there were some features that I wanted to add

[24:42] that I didn't know how to program or do that,

[24:45] so I put stuff switches

[24:47] and realize things in that,

[24:51] and that would be a lecture mechanical circuit,

[24:54] and that would be a hybrid of a two.

[24:56] So basically, it was a step switch

[24:58] that every time you hit a target,

[25:00] it would advance the light

[25:02] on the flight field insert,

[25:04] when it got to the end,

[25:06] a special light,

[25:08] and then whenever you hit it,

[25:10] at that point,

[25:12] the relay, that click,

[25:14] would just close the switch to the ad credit,

[25:16] to an ad credit,

[25:18] like coin slot switch.

[25:20] So I basically kind of was kind of just made a hybrid,

[25:23] and I think at that game had the first,

[25:25] it was the first game to ever have music,

[25:28] because this is like,

[25:30] copy,

[25:32] this is novelty,

[25:34] what they did in the video games they had,

[25:37] like an 8 track,

[25:39] and then whenever the game was on,

[25:41] it would play music.

[25:43] And no pinball had done that.

[25:45] They had like flash,

[25:47] where you just played a sound,

[25:49] that got louder and louder or higher and higher,

[25:51] and it would play music.

[25:53] So I did a light,

[25:55] and it was a boom box,

[25:59] and I got one of those endless cassettes,

[26:01] a six minutes long,

[26:03] and I recorded the MacBooks to the France,

[26:07] in that whatever,

[26:09] the flip or enable relay was on,

[26:12] it would turn the boom box on.

[26:15] Right. The reason why I asked that,

[26:17] is that, you know,

[26:19] you thought maybe you had to do some programming,

[26:21] and that would have made some decision

[26:24] at the Gottlieb job.

[26:26] Now, I,

[26:28] I didn't, I basically didn't know any programming,

[26:32] I knew pinball real well,

[26:34] and I loved pinball,

[26:36] and I was enthusiastic,

[26:37] and I think that probably more or less,

[26:39] what, you know, weighed their decision.

[26:41] I was all I bought in as a junior designer,

[26:43] I was basically just working on other designers,

[26:47] and I was working on other projects for the first year or two.

[26:49] I made a couple of my own games,

[26:52] but they were never, ever really considered

[26:55] to go into production,

[26:57] so I was still learning,

[26:58] you know, how to make a game that was,

[27:00] a play field that was manufacturable,

[27:02] it's one thing to have a play field layout in your head,

[27:05] and then the other thing for it to go down the assembly line.

[27:08] So I was basically the first year and a half,

[27:12] or so I was just learning, you know,

[27:14] I would stand at a play,

[27:16] designing John Ferdot,

[27:18] and Gil Kamiko, or the designers,

[27:20] and I would work on their, on their games,

[27:22] help build them, help wire them,

[27:24] and then basically just learn.

[27:26] So that's why you didn't, you know,

[27:28] I went to work there in 86,

[27:30] but I, you didn't see a game for, you know,

[27:33] until I think of 88 when Diamond Light came out.

[27:37] So,

[27:38] and how did you get that,

[27:39] how did they, uh,

[27:40] promote you to have in your own game,

[27:42] because Diamond Light, you worked on by yourself, right?

[27:44] No, there wasn't any other designer that helped you.

[27:46] Right, it was my first, it was my first game that I did myself,

[27:51] because I would basically, you know,

[27:54] at the time of year working on other designers' games,

[27:57] there's a lot of holes in time,

[27:59] like you have to weed on something,

[28:01] then I can go back and work on my game,

[28:03] and then, I put the prototype up,

[28:06] and, uh,

[28:08] a white wood that I built,

[28:10] and, uh,

[28:12] and,

[28:14] it was kind of, you know,

[28:16] people liked it, it was kind of fun to shoot.

[28:18] It was a fun to shoot a playpeel,

[28:20] and, you know,

[28:22] it comes upon the game,

[28:24] and we're going to make that game.

[28:26] And, uh,

[28:27] and at the time,

[28:28] Ray had Ray Cancer,

[28:29] at his first game too,

[28:31] and, um,

[28:33] you know,

[28:34] so we were basically,

[28:36] at that time,

[28:37] John Trudeau had done everything,

[28:39] and of course,

[28:40] we also had,

[28:41] when we were на that time,

[28:42] you know,

[28:44] been working on the game and Chopin was my first game.

[28:45] I know I'm fine and I would confidently say,

[28:47] this is a great idea,

[28:49] talk to the back executives of the show Brunner were waiting

[28:52] it wasn't really a great idea,

[28:54] but, see,

[28:56] it was necessary to,

[28:57] to make it look like a pulp,

[28:58] and played games and things like that.

[28:59] There,

[29:00] no matter how funny the game was,

[29:03] people would study,

[29:04] they did game games

[29:05] and some kind of,

[29:06] of course,

[29:07] programming. I had worked in the assembly language programming. I would make the basic program.

[29:14] They didn't have any bells and bells, but it would kick the ball out of the hole and

[29:20] score the points. Those lines jumped to sub-routines and sub-routines were on the operating system.

[29:26] So you just called sub-routines from a library in the operating system. It really wasn't

[29:32] complicated to make a game. The ball goes to the hall. It advances value and scores

[29:40] points and kicks the ball out or whatever. The limitation I had was that you couldn't really

[29:51] do anything. You couldn't put any really cool features in the game. That's why when my first

[29:56] game came out, it had so many features. I had to wait and wait and wait to put these

[30:01] features on a game because the system wasn't the earlier system wasn't capable of

[30:06] putting a lot of those features on the game. Now you did diamond lady by yourself, but then

[30:13] the next game, it looked like the next game you did was robber war and you did that with

[30:17] John Trudeau. Now why did John help you on that game? Well John, robber war was a

[30:24] John Trudeau game. He was his play field layout. You see what I would do in those days was

[30:36] I would basically, if I did a game, I would do the play field and rules for a game.

[30:44] I did both. The play field and rules. It's kind of like we write a song. You do the lyrics and the

[30:49] music. But a lot of the other designers didn't really want to be bothered with writing the

[30:56] rules. They would let me do rule steps for their games. That was basically all throughout

[31:05] Godly. I would write the rules. Basically that frees the designer because the designer doesn't

[31:13] have to do that. They can spend all their time doing the mechanicals and engineering and

[31:20] getting ready for the assembly line and managing the project. I got the game designer

[31:29] also project manager where I gave her a part of the rules. Even if I was working on my own

[31:36] game, I would have a lot of time if you were working on the other designers, I would design

[31:43] rules that would get other designers games. I would probably put more time and effort into

[31:48] doing that rule set for their game. I would have won for my own game.

[31:53] Now Diamond Lady sold about 2700 units. You must have been pretty proud of your

[31:58] accomplishment. Yeah, I was. I fired call for Ants to love the game.

[32:05] We sold a lot of games to France. At the time there were one of our main customers.

[32:12] France was a really big hit over there. I was looking back at the game. The game was way too

[32:23] hard for the average player. It took me a few games to learn to design games for the average

[32:30] every day. Person just wanting to have fun for three or four minutes rather than try to design

[32:37] games for our level players. I was good player and I was designing games to challenge me on some

[32:43] of my early games. As the time went on, I learned to design games that would try to appeal

[32:50] to beginners, medium levels and advanced players. When I looked back at Diamond Lady, that was

[32:59] one difficult game. There were a couple things that I was allowed to do on that game.

[33:06] Because it was my first game and I was told I had to do it a certain way. One was the kickback on the

[33:12] drain. I wanted it to do like Williams did it or when you lit it, it would stay lit until the

[33:18] player used it. I was overruled that it would time out once it was lit.

[33:25] The player would have to keep trying to qualify it and that was the weakest part of that game

[33:31] was that it should have stayed lit until the player used it and then would have to do something at

[33:37] that point to try to rely it again. Maybe it would be more difficult the second time and

[33:42] you could be more difficult for fair time and so on. But I was kind of overruled on that.

[33:47] The other thing I wanted to do is I wanted to put a play more post in the game and they didn't want

[33:54] to put the time and money into making molds and things to play more post because

[34:02] they did not have a play more post than flipers. So I had to be creative and I put the drop

[34:08] target there so the player got one saved. So the ball hit the drop target and it saved.

[34:14] The drop target would go down. Now what did you just call it? A play more post?

[34:19] You are talking about an up post between the flipers? Yes. Gotcha. Like a ball save.

[34:25] Yeah, like Valley used a lot in the 70s. Right.

[34:32] So Williams and Valley had it, but got it and never had it. I finally got it on Mario and

[34:40] Dreddy which was my last game. I eventually got one but it took several years to get it.

[34:48] Now it looks like you did bad girls after Diamond Lady and working on Robo War.

[34:55] Tell me about that one. Bad girls was supposed to be kind of they wanted to remake

[35:06] a big ball of the lucks. So a bad girl is kind of a ball of the lucks dish but it's different

[35:16] and different rules and stuff. And as a matter of trivifery for bad girls is there

[35:26] are 10 bad girls in this world with system 3 in it because that's the game system 3 was tested in.

[35:33] Yeah, but it was a system 80B game, right?

[35:37] System 80B game but there are 10 bad girls that we made that we sent all over

[35:42] different places to have system 3 in it. So if somebody ever comes up with a system of 3 bad girls

[35:48] they have themselves a rare game.

[35:51] It's a matter of trivia. A trivia item.

[35:56] Yeah, that's great. I love that stuff.

[35:59] But that was another one of those early games for me. That was basically way too hard for the average player.

[36:07] If I had the two over again I would have made it a little more user friendly and so on.

[36:17] But that was a kind of brutal game. It had very short ball time.

[36:22] We had a lot of features, a lot of specials and things.

[36:26] It was probably one of the last balls that had a bunch of specials on it.

[36:32] Yeah, it probably had three or four different specials.

[36:35] Kind of like originally ball, the last had a lot of specials.

[36:40] Just a few years later we lucky to have one special on it and there's usually in the outlane.

[36:48] Right, yeah because basically specials were, you know, it's kind of like a consolation in the outlane.

[36:54] It's going to drain anyways but you win a game.

[36:58] Yeah, but that was basically kind of going into the 90s, the special.

[37:03] In the reason why I've done a lot of thinking about it and the reason why is because the game's got had too much of a skill to luck.

[37:11] Too much of a skill factor and the skill to luck ratio.

[37:15] And if you had specials, good players to sit there and stay on the game all day.

[37:19] You know, back then I'd got the 90s because the ball time had increased.

[37:24] And there were less luck factors to make the ball drain and ball in and so on.

[37:29] So you really couldn't put specials on games anymore because you'd get, you know, someone at the time like me on a game.

[37:36] And then I could stay there all day and the operator, operator's not going to make any money.

[37:41] But, you know, up until the mid 80s you could put specials on a game because the, you know, there wasn't.

[37:51] The drains were a little bigger and the distance, the distance was a little further apart.

[37:57] So there were other factors that could, that would, that would, you know, the players really lucky had that long winning streak where they can just win and win and win and win.

[38:08] Although I go to my partner, we're eight on the left so I can stay on the ball the luck.

[38:11] And I was, in fact, when I was a player, I could stay on the, on the left.

[38:15] As long as I wanted to.

[38:17] And a lot of times the operators in the places I used to go would ask me not to come in at certain hours, you know, that, that was a busy hour so they made the money.

[38:27] And if I did, they'd let me stay on the game and in the off hours.

[38:34] And there were a couple of times I remember when there was one point when I was playing a game and the owner of the arcade walked over and turned the game off and said that this game is out of order.

[38:51] So it just came out of order.

[38:53] It gave me a token or whatever for another game and not sure the moment I left that that game was turned back on.

[38:58] But, you know, that that was the, you know, the going back to the specials is that if I were, if I were to ever get back into the pinball, I would try to design games and have shorter ball time and a little bit more luck in the luck of skill ratio and bring the special back.

[39:23] And I'm going to give the players because I remember back when I was just learning that was that was the reason why I played pinball is because other things, you know, you play and when your game was over, it was over.

[39:35] But with pinball, if you got, if you were really executed your shots or you got lucky, you could, you could win several games in a row before you had to put money in the game again.

[39:46] Those days are gone. You could design the game so that you could bring that back instead of, instead of, you could still have, let's say you're trying to shoot for a four minute game time instead of having a three ball game where each ball is a minute and 10 seconds.

[40:10] You could do a, go to a five ball game, reach ball is only 35 or 40 seconds. You still get the game time so you can value out of the money. At least that novice player gets to plunge five balls instead of three balls.

[40:28] So there are a lot of thought that I put into if I ever get back into pinball and try to design games to attract the next generation of players rather than trying to get the pinball fixing how those to give it a big thumbs up.

[40:48] Now, ex-Caliber was another John Trudeau game that you did the rules for, is that right?

[40:57] Yes, ex-Caliber was, it was, that was the first game that they really came up to me and it was on November eight off sites junior at the time was running engineering.

[41:15] And eight off came up to me near quitting time on a Friday and said that we were basically going to go with ex-Caliber and already had the artwork and everything was done at the time.

[41:31] It just wasn't really fun to play, but I hadn't worked on the rules on the game. I had already done the rules on a couple of other games that were fun to play. So I think at the time they saw that I was proficient in developing rule sets.

[41:45] And eight off came to me and said how do you like a challenge John and I go what's that he says. I'm Monday morning and I need a rule set for ex-Caliber and all you get to change is the pipeline screen.

[41:59] So any of the other people, whenever you screen the play field there are four or five or six screens and each screen costs a lot of money to be remade.

[42:11] So you can change the black line screen which is what most of the type bases written on the play field. But I can't change any of the inserts where they're at.

[42:21] So I basically had to make new with what was already on that play field. I came up with a new rule set. So I basically worked out weekend and came up with a rule set and gave it to the programmer and that's what ex-Caliber ended up being.

[42:37] How did that execute? How did that come out?

[42:40] I thought it came out pretty good. It was the first game that really had a bonus round as a fact that it was, it was where the game rules changed.

[43:00] Then the prior had a timed event where the task to complete a task. And then when it was over if you were able to accomplish it you got the jackpot and if you couldn't you didn't when it timed out.

[43:15] Up to that it was multi a multi ball had that where you had to do your make your shots very multi ball. Once it went out of multi ball basically the rules went away.

[43:25] That was the first time that we basically changed all the rules in the play field. So it was they had 15 seconds or whatever to accomplish the event in one ball play rather than multi ball.

[43:38] And then that kind of led to a light scan reaction that was a mode based game.

[43:47] Now before light scan reaction the last systematic B game you did was hot shots and that was your design right?

[43:53] Yes, watch out for my design.

[43:56] And we'll tell me about that.

[43:58] Hot shots was going to be an aircraft carrier jet fighter game in that lot the ball launcher was going to be like the catapult that launches airplanes off an aircraft carrier.

[44:11] And all of the drop targets there were I think 16 drop targets on that game were enemy planes.

[44:21] So it was like this action adventure you know naval aircraft battle game.

[44:27] And then as we are as we committed to the game.

[44:33] Data East came out of torpedo alley.

[44:37] Right. You know what's it's right then they came up to a real alley so they held a meeting and they say well got to go with this game but we need to change teams now.

[44:48] Well as well these things were it was decided in a meeting what we're going to do we'll just go make it into because there are so many targets we'll do the hit shooting gallery game.

[44:58] So that's how it ends up being hot shots.

[45:01] And it's matter trivia.

[45:04] The guy had a photographic backlash in the Carvel Barker the elderly gentleman with the gray hair is Louis Gianini who had been a god of employee for about 40 or 50 years.

[45:22] So it's kind of you know not that's another trivia thing but that's kind of a neat thing about that game as it had Louis on there and he was basically the tool room guy who made all of our custom parts for us when the custom parts made by hand and he was a really excellent craftsman.

[45:43] So it is you know skills are really appreciated in my first instance with Louis is first time I ever went down working on the in the tool room on the bandsaw or drill press or something is probably making a big probably on the drill press drilling inserts for a black play field.

[46:04] Of course it makes all kinds of saw dust and wood chips all over the place and Louis we solid I was doing making this huge mess and he went and got a broom and a dust pan walked right lean them up against the machine I was using and walked away.

[46:25] And it's suddenly telling me when you're done you can get your mess.

[46:33] So no so hot shots the name stayed the same but the theme changed is that what you're saying.

[46:41] No the name changed to and I don't remember I see a lot of times I will call a game something but the name will change and the theme will stay the same.

[46:56] I have to look at my notes I don't remember what I called it the reason why it being hot shots was because I think Connie Mitchell we were in the meeting I think he came up with that name and everybody seemed to like it so that's what it is.

[47:16] We needed a name and we need one today it was like we were under the gun and time crunch there to get this thing you know it was changing the artwork was to get a going.

[47:28] That was one of the games that changed theme but there are a couple others that changed the theme too.

[47:39] Either that I had nothing to say or had to do a license and then you license things so.

[47:48] Now how about licensing how hard was it for you to actually get a license theme.

[47:55] Well it took 80 East to force Williams and us into going into the license because you know a total camincal I've been doing that for a couple of years and it was obvious where you know I basically keep up with the Joneses or whatever is that we had to you know start considering license games.

[48:24] In license games you know I have positive and negative about it license game you add the element of license approval and you take away some creativity in the theme when you make your own theme up and whatever you have control that is created people the pinball company have control over the whole thing.

[48:51] Where if you were the license name like Mario not I mean I see from our brothers I mean we're sitting there having to every time that we're working on the artwork or whatever we're having to submit the artwork to the Nintendo and have them say yes or no change this.

[49:18] So it kind of you know as long as the game makes more money and sells more that's the whole that's the whole thing you're trying to do and that's the whole reason for a license.

[49:32] But I really didn't enjoy it as much as working on a unique theme.

[49:42] I think I only worked on this like all the games near the end that got live all license games.

[49:50] All those early games like diamond lady and and that girls and hot shops life camera action run license.

[49:59] Yeah basically everything before super Mario brothers was on license.

[50:04] Almost everything after it was licensed.

[50:07] Right.

[50:09] You know if you look at if you look at if you look at why I think why that was I had to kind of think of the ones that weren't.

[50:23] There were very few that weren't license at that point.

[50:29] Well let's go back to 1989 and after hot shots you did the first your first system three game which was lights camera action now I played that game today and I had never even seen that game before and that's a pretty cool game I gotta admit it's got the back box animation thing I thought was really well done.

[50:53] Well the that game the one you play have the flood lights on it.

[51:01] No this one did not have the flood lights it just had the you know the gun draws the guy the two guys in the back box that drew the guns.

[51:09] Right well the game itself had that had the I wanted to do an animated I wanted to animate a backlash and I wanted something that would be very inexpensive because of the budget.

[51:33] And I think that the reason why that's a.

[51:40] I got an approves because the money to the cost to do those was very low can't remember.

[51:51] At this point how I got those flood lights on because that was a really expensive unit my guess is one of our competitors must put something on the top of the back box.

[52:06] Then the company allowed me to do it now did they all light act light camera action today all have these flood lights are just some of them all have the flood lights.

[52:17] Okay because the one I played today didn't have it.

[52:19] Well time unit so a lot of them over the years may have been lost or if the game was in a place where it had a low ceiling it couldn't fit that it would have been.

[52:32] You know not installed and put it and it ended up being in the back of the person's warehouse so now what was the purpose of these lights.

[52:42] Well the lights was to.

[52:47] The artwork was designed with blue light in a red light and the artwork was designed so that most of the artwork was blue or red.

[52:58] So whenever the lights went on the play field lights I forgot they went off or were damn I don't remember what we end up going with.

[53:08] But it creates an ambience and what a neck it goes back to but I saw many years before that there was an arcade back when I was a player before I was in the industry it was in scott's valley it's called special effects.

[53:24] They had a room set up with black light or some then there are some games that have black light artwork where you know the used to the fluorescent paint and I think valley black track and roller disco and there were several pinball games made that had fluorescent paint.

[53:45] That would fluorescent black light when you put that work into a black light room and I also thought that was really cool but then I also know that if you use a red light on a red artwork or a blue light on a blue artwork that there are almost copper pen recolors and you can get a really weird effect if you go between the red and the blue.

[54:09] I made a game called red alert that whenever you went to a red alert the light light to go on to create tension and climatic feeling whenever you are at that point in the game.

[54:26] I basically resurrected it from that game because it was a movie and it was supposed to be kind of being the same as the climax so that's how that unit got on the game and I think that the unit was about 25 or 30 different games that's a lot of money.

[54:51] Now this was the first system 3 game for you. Was system 3 a much better system to work from from my design point of view?

[55:01] It was a different night and day. There were a lot of features that were on lights camera actually I could catch up feature and automatic skill that we just couldn't do before that because since maybe B couldn't do it.

[55:17] When you say couldn't do it why couldn't system 80B do it?

[55:21] I didn't have enough memory, I didn't have enough drivers. I think I had to do it more than memory. It was like automatic skill feature.

[55:33] That program would require a lot of memory because they had to keep track of the player how the player was doing in the game to figure out what their skill level was in order to adjust the features for that player.

[55:47] A lot of people don't talk about automatic skill because a lot of people don't know that it existed in those games.

[55:54] What automatic skill does it looks at how the skill it's making decisions on what the skill level of the player is.

[56:05] Whether they're looking both the players at the same time, whether they're catching the ball, showing that a NAS player.

[56:14] What they're when you have little shots, how many flips are before they complete. There's all kinds of data that's being collected on the players.

[56:27] The game is in doing so adjust the timers for the time to routes so that the beginner would have a lot more time to complete their tasks than a proficient player would.

[56:39] I had no idea. I never even heard of that.

[56:46] I don't know if all of them did, but that's the feature that I wanted to put in all along.

[57:03] There were a lot of features I wanted to put in the games that nobody would ever, even when I was working for Sega, they never wanted to do.

[57:12] One of the things was I wanted to design a system where the operator could buy the system, it would be a sub-middle system.

[57:22] I wanted to go with other game companies and it would be a cell phone.

[57:29] What the game would do is it would use this. You would have the cell phones in all your games.

[57:42] You would program one game to call in at 12.30.

[57:53] Every game would call in at 12.30.

[57:59] You would have to go to the game and transfer data to a computer program.

[58:09] You would get to work and get a report from all your games to see how much money they're making.

[58:22] I always had all these ideas that could never get down, but at least I got the auto skill.

[58:29] The other one was the catch-up feature where the lights camera actually had the catch-up feature.

[58:38] It would look to see the auto skill as part of it if it would award the catch-up so that you could catch up with the other player's score.

[58:49] I've heard of that feature in other games.

[58:52] We used about it often in maybe a half a dozen games, but light cam action was the first game they had the catch-up feature.

[59:00] These are features that I wanted to put in the earlier system, but I could put it in the system.

[59:06] That's why you saw all these features suddenly appear on this one game because I had thought of them, but this is the first time we had to cast the implement button.

[59:16] John Burris programed that game and he probably looked back at it. He probably hated me at the time because I thought he's featured a lot in this game.

[59:25] What about that turning play field, that little mini turning play field? That was pretty cool.

[59:30] John Borg came up with that. Also, if I light camera action, it has the ball through the air with those deflector plates.

[59:43] John Borg at the time, before he was a designer, he was working as a mechanical engineer, a mechanical draft person or whatever, that got leave.

[59:55] He basically would put these cool features on his own.

[01:00:01] He would talk about it and say, can we put this on? I said, that sounds really cool. I'll put that on my next game.

[01:00:11] What it was that was rotating play field. That's really cool. We'll put it on the next game and that's what we did.

[01:00:20] He went to work for Data East. Obviously, he was still there until Stern. Then I guess when they did their cost cutting, seven or eight years ago, he was one of the ones who was making the loss of his job.

[01:00:40] He's back at Stern, if that means anything.

[01:00:43] He's back at Stern? Yeah, I guess the next game off is his game. I don't know much more than that, but I know he's back at Stern now.

[01:00:53] That's good. I was hoping to try to get back. I was hoping to try because I left Stern.

[01:01:00] Wait, wait, wait, wait, let's hold off on that story. We're getting there. Let's work through Gottlieb a little more.

[01:01:09] What was it like after Light's Camera Action, you did Vegas. Tell me about Vegas.

[01:01:14] Well, that was the company decided that a low cost game basically was over sluggish, which is a John Treadel game, was the first game.

[01:01:29] A low cost game. Yeah, the street level game as they call it.

[01:01:33] That wouldn't have ball hanging up, so it would be highly reliable. They were trying to find a niche in the market that no one was exploiting.

[01:01:42] So basically they told all the designers, and this was a management decision, that no longer going to make games full-page games with grants, we're just not making single level games.

[01:01:54] Well, I kind of really played in the buying hand being a game rules guy, where, well, okay, all this little game that has kind of cool game rules, they now have to worry about an expensive game.

[01:02:06] So I did basically my two SL games where Vegas and Car Hop.

[01:02:12] And both the games, they were low cost games, but the problem is, is we found that the distributor can sell games for whatever they want to sell for.

[01:02:24] And we had to suggest a price, but we found out that most of the distributors, even though they were costable or less than the competitors, they were trying to sell them for the same price, or just a little bit under, trying to make more profit on the games.

[01:02:40] And after a while, the operators had enough of them and the sales fell off.

[01:02:48] Yeah, I mean, this was about 1990 that the street level games were happening, and you're coming out with, you know, like you said, single layer play, single layer play fields, you know, no habit trails, no ramps, you know, as kind of a simplified game, but you're competing against Williams Funhouse.

[01:03:07] And that had to be a tough road to haul.

[01:03:11] Yeah, and that was the, that's what we were up against.

[01:03:18] It was, it was pretty, I think that if you look at the production numbers on all those games, you'll see that each game, we sold less and less and less on each game.

[01:03:31] And then we went back to regular, you know, fall feature games with cactus jacks, and those games that we started having good sales again.

[01:03:41] So it was, it was an, the decision that designers had nothing to say, as the company came in, all of us, what we were going to do, and we just tried to make the guest best game we could with what, with, on that decision.

[01:03:55] Well, I didn't like on Vegas, because I didn't like the pink cabinet. I didn't mind the pink play field and plastic field set, but I won, I came to have a black cabinet.

[01:04:06] They said, I got out of the pink cabinet, so yeah, the pink cabinet.

[01:04:12] So now, when, when they came, when management came to you guys with this street level, you know, simplified single layer game, what, what was your reaction to it?

[01:04:21] Did you think it was a good idea? Did you think, yeah, you know, we're kind of, we're competing against, you know, these other manufacturers, this is never going to work, or, or did you guys think it would?

[01:04:30] I thought it was a novelty at that one game, one street level game, every two or three years, because there was, there at that operator who has those really, really, really remote locations, but they want something really, really reliable.

[01:04:45] And they've got a captive audience, so that location will play any game that works, doesn't need to be a big, fancy game.

[01:04:53] As long as it works, it's fun to play it, I'll play it.

[01:04:55] But I think maybe one street level game, every two years, two and a half years, maybe it's a summer release, because some of the games always had the low sales.

[01:05:04] You know, that was the slowest time. It would be good, but not every game.

[01:05:09] In both reign, I were concerned that Ray wanted to keep working on a full-feature game, have his backup.

[01:05:18] And I, right, in the end, Ray was right, because they decided to go back to regular games, we had to scramble for a couple of models to come up with games on time, you know.

[01:05:30] Now, when you did Scramble, you came out with cactus jack in 1991, and that's actually a pretty cool game.

[01:05:38] With cactus jacks, and both cactus jacks that I finished, Rayney did the play field in 1990.

[01:05:47] Rayney had brought that play field to China, trying to sell the play field.

[01:05:54] And that would be maybe three months before we decided to abandon SL games.

[01:06:02] And wait, this is Rayney, what is it, Bang and Tur?

[01:06:06] Yeah, okay.

[01:06:09] And so he was like an outside contractor almost?

[01:06:13] Yes, he was an outside contractor, and he left the game there for us to evaluate.

[01:06:18] And at the time we were, we weren't going to make the game, you know.

[01:06:23] But whenever we decided to go back to full-feature games, that game was ready.

[01:06:29] He was ready to make it a real game to go down the line, and we were doing a good game.

[01:06:37] Now, did he present it with Gottlieb System 3 boards and the software already all done?

[01:06:44] No, it had 80 East boards, we had to re-engineer the whole game.

[01:06:49] But, you know, at least we knew it was a decent fun to shoot game, they had the shots tweaked.

[01:06:55] So, that cut a lot of development time.

[01:06:58] A lot of times when you're doing a play field front scratch, you're just making shots work.

[01:07:01] You're spending a lot of time making shots work, and making it so that it can be assembled and all that stuff.

[01:07:07] And basically, running had already done all that.

[01:07:10] Because running probably spent six months or a year working on that before he brought it in.

[01:07:15] So, we made that game, I worked on that game, and Ray Tanser took his game,

[01:07:24] that he took on was Class of 1812, which was an old game off the rack, which was a game that we basically, when a game had gotten, was killed, or never made, it went onto a rack.

[01:07:38] So, people could use the parts on it.

[01:07:40] There was a little rack, then Ray was going over there and found that old game on the rack, and decided to take it.

[01:07:46] They could make it into a game.

[01:07:49] And that was end of the class of 1812, which started off being a game designed by Joe Caminco called 911 Carrera, which was a joke call.

[01:08:03] Well, that's kind of interesting. And actually Class of 1812 is actually a pretty good game.

[01:08:08] Yeah, you know, so it was, you know, considering what we were up against, both those games came out pretty good.

[01:08:17] Because I think I did cactus jacks in six or seven weeks, or most games, or a lot of my games, I do them in eight, ten weeks, and we didn't have a lot of time to do games.

[01:08:37] You know, the player doesn't care. The player doesn't care whether you had eight weeks or ten weeks to do a game, or a year to do a game.

[01:08:44] You know, the player is playing the most fun game to play.

[01:08:47] So, you know, I was always thought that we were really at a great disadvantage, with comparison with Williams designers, because Williams designers had a year, or even sometimes more, to do a game.

[01:09:00] And we only had, you know, six to ten weeks to do a game.

[01:09:07] You know, it's all like a difference between doing a TV show or doing a movie.

[01:09:13] Alright, we're going to take a little break from talking with John Norris of Gottlieb, and we'll be right back after these messages.

[01:09:19] Hi, I'm Ed. This is Doc Pimbal, to remind you about New York State's largest game room show coming up April 11th through the 13th.

[01:09:28] In beautiful Rochester, New York, check us out on our website at RochesterGamerungshow.com.

[01:09:35] We are going to have a P3 pinball tournament, where you can gain walker points.

[01:09:40] We also have a big ball ball tournament, and as we speak right now, we're posted to have Capcom's big bang bar making an appearance at this game room show.

[01:09:49] April 11th, 12th and 13th, 2008.

[01:09:53] Check us out on our website for more details and special rates on hotels at RochesterGamerungshow.com.

[01:10:00] Deep in the forests of Eastern Canada, you will find something...

[01:10:05] Well, ground breaking. And something that's very, very pinball, but something that's really, really small.

[01:10:14] Presenting classic play field reproductions.

[01:10:19] Two guys in their basement.

[01:10:22] We've got the passion. We've got the gear. And we've got the quality.

[01:10:26] Doing our very best to remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts.

[01:10:32] Classic play field reproduction.

[01:10:37] Play fields.

[01:10:39] Backlasses.

[01:10:41] Plastic sets.

[01:10:45] On the web at classicplayfields.com.

[01:10:49] We're back with John Norris, game designer for Gottlieb.

[01:10:52] Now, what about Surf and Safari?

[01:10:55] That was a full feature game, and that game came out pretty good.

[01:10:59] Well, that one was designed from scratch of the full feature game.

[01:11:03] It was probably six months after the decision was made to go back to full feature games.

[01:11:16] So, Surf and Safari was designed as it was supposed to be.

[01:11:23] So, that game came out pretty good.

[01:11:27] It was tweaked a little bit more than 1812 and get extracts.

[01:11:34] We had a little more time to tweaked that game.

[01:11:37] Now, did that game have any sort of licensing connection at any point?

[01:11:43] Not really.

[01:11:45] You know, even the music or anything?

[01:11:48] What?

[01:11:49] Maybe the music?

[01:11:51] Oh, the music.

[01:11:54] We may have done a song or two, licensed a song or two on that game, but we weren't doing game licenses yet.

[01:12:03] That was before that actually the first time we were going to talk about doing a game license was class of 1812.

[01:12:09] We were talking about licensing monster mash and calling a monster mash.

[01:12:15] But it was too much money at the time.

[01:12:17] It cut me down to much money and ironically looking back, it was cheap.

[01:12:23] It was like $3,000 or something, one time fee.

[01:12:27] I mean, that's compared to what some of the licenses cost.

[01:12:30] That was a modified bargain.

[01:12:34] You'll be able to call a monster mash instead.

[01:12:37] That was my decision and a raised decision.

[01:12:41] It was a management decision.

[01:12:43] At the time, they were just, you see, but I'll put myself in the manager's point.

[01:12:49] Management's point of view.

[01:12:51] It's a headwind doing licenses yet.

[01:12:53] We're just getting into licensing and when you're just trying to do something, you really don't know what you're up against yet.

[01:13:02] Also, when you're seeing this large expense that you didn't have any at all in any of your previous games,

[01:13:10] that's probably the factor why they decided not to go.

[01:13:14] There's nothing that was digested later on.

[01:13:17] Maybe we should have done it.

[01:13:19] Let's start doing it on all the future games.

[01:13:22] I guess it's part of the learning curve for everybody.

[01:13:26] We all need to learn how to deal with this new facet with regard to game development.

[01:13:34] Now, at this time, you were still collecting games at home.

[01:13:37] You still had a pretty good wood rail collection going?

[01:13:40] Yeah, at this time, at that point, I had a pretty good career going, making decent salary, having a lot of fun,

[01:13:49] making a good looking ball collection.

[01:13:51] I was really happy back then.

[01:13:53] That was a wonderful life I had back then.

[01:13:56] Looking back, those were some of the best years of my life.

[01:14:01] That was wonderful.

[01:14:03] That's something I could do to change and get back to that time.

[01:14:11] That was really designing and looking for a pinball company having a pinball collection.

[01:14:17] Having a lot of fun.

[01:14:20] That was great.

[01:14:22] Your next game was the first dot matrix game that Gottlieb did.

[01:14:26] That was Super Mario Brothers.

[01:14:28] Also, in 1992, that was your first real license game.

[01:14:34] Yeah, that was...

[01:14:36] We got that...

[01:14:39] At the time, Mario was doing the Mario Brothers mushroom world.

[01:14:44] Both of us were basically being indoctrinated into license games at the same time.

[01:14:50] You have to go through the license approval process.

[01:14:53] The offer has to be submitted.

[01:14:55] It has to be okayed the whole nine yards.

[01:14:59] That was basically at that point.

[01:15:03] After that, we never looked back because we had good sales on those games.

[01:15:07] At that point, we were getting there after probably the license came.

[01:15:11] Yeah, sales on that game basically...

[01:15:14] I mean, it's surfaced so far.

[01:15:16] He sold about 2,000 units and then Super Mario Brothers sold about 4,200.

[01:15:20] So, that...

[01:15:21] Things really pumped up.

[01:15:23] Well, I also want to do the dot matrix display.

[01:15:26] You know, a lot of people don't know that we had the chance to be the first company of the dot matrix display.

[01:15:30] Because I forget, Cherry, or whoever was who came up with that full-sized display came to us first.

[01:15:38] This would be a year until before.

[01:15:41] And I think the deal was, if you get it, you will have exclusive rights to use it for a year before anybody else gets to use it.

[01:15:50] I think we turned them down.

[01:15:52] Obviously, Williams didn't...

[01:15:53] They put it on Gilligan's Island or whatever the first game they had with the pitch back game they had.

[01:15:59] We had to wait the year for that exclusivity to run out.

[01:16:05] But then we were right ahead and put it on our games.

[01:16:08] Now, how was that as far as being a designer?

[01:16:12] Did that change much or no?

[01:16:15] No, I put the video mode in things.

[01:16:18] I've got a lot of video modes where perviel.

[01:16:22] And, you know, especially on some games, like Super Mario Brothers, it fit the game.

[01:16:30] Because it's a video game, Wicens, and so it made sense in that game.

[01:16:37] But if I were going to start a timball company today, I'm like, go back to this Padelli season.

[01:16:44] Back in the game and get rid of the video altogether.

[01:16:47] Save the time of programming and make a game that can sell for $500 less.

[01:16:53] That was...

[01:16:55] You know, if it did some games and Super Mario Brothers, it was one of the games that it really did fit.

[01:17:02] Now, did that... did the damage display increase the amount of time needed to develop a game?

[01:17:08] Not so much the time.

[01:17:11] Give me a couple more people on the staff.

[01:17:14] One person to program it.

[01:17:17] One person to do the artwork.

[01:17:20] Or, you know, so basically it increased the resources needed to do the game.

[01:17:27] And obviously added $100 or more to the bill of materials for the game.

[01:17:34] I think that the dot matrix unit was $100 from the control board, probably for another $40.

[01:17:41] And then also it was a very noisy display added a lot of noise for like FTC compliance.

[01:17:48] So it made it tougher to do for the radio missions testing and things like that.

[01:17:53] So there were a lot of things that basically added to the cost of the game adding that to the game.

[01:18:03] I don't know if on all games if it was really worth it, or when it gave you, you know,

[01:18:11] you can do more elaborate track modes and things like that with the actual play of the game.

[01:18:18] You know, I could see having maybe a game that would...

[01:18:26] maybe a cheaper line of games that maybe weren't in the game.

[01:18:31] Maybe your dogs or your arcade house it.

[01:18:35] You know, again, if you have a game in a location where you're...

[01:18:39] if you get a lot of other games then you need to... the game's all about some whistles.

[01:18:43] If you're going out in some guy's bar, out in the middle of the sticks somewhere,

[01:18:48] and they'll play that game if it works as well, it, and find the play.

[01:18:56] Well, you know, that's just my thought, but the dot matrix.

[01:19:03] Of course, these days are different because, you know, the cost of the screen displays and all that's come down so much.

[01:19:13] But, you know, back in the early 90s when that was coming out, that was a very pricey addition to the game.

[01:19:20] So did that increase the retail price of the game, or did you have to take 100 bucks out of there, or $140 out of the game somewhere else?

[01:19:28] I think it increased the retail price of the game at the time.

[01:19:31] I don't know where that could be research, but I'm pretty sure we passed that on to the customer.

[01:19:40] You know, it's like anything else is your expenses go up to the price of the product's...

[01:19:46] the product's got to go up along with it.

[01:19:49] And, you know, of course, the price of the ultimate customer, the player, was ultimately increased too,

[01:19:58] because that's what you started, the really good 50 cents.

[01:20:02] Looking really into 50 cents play.

[01:20:05] Right. For a $34 or whatever the incentive is, but up until that had been just 25 cents a game.

[01:20:12] So, yeah, so...

[01:20:14] Now, your next game was Cueball Wizard, and that was the game you sold the most of 5700 units, and that was a really big hit for Gottlieb.

[01:20:22] Yeah, that was a game that I put to Cue.

[01:20:28] That was the game where I went to the show, Amo A Show.

[01:20:33] I think the only game I ever designed at what the Amo A Show.

[01:20:37] In all the years I was in the industry. That was the one game that went to the Amo A Show.

[01:20:42] That was the game where I forget who it was, and the management didn't like the pool ball.

[01:20:51] And Todd got on the way.

[01:20:54] So, I had, during the game development, so what they did was they said,

[01:20:59] eventually the ball's going to break, you know, the pool ball, and the playfield's going to break.

[01:21:05] So, they said, we're going to have to test it, and they said,

[01:21:08] this test texture, that took a pinball with our strongest coil, that point blank range, maybe an inch from the pool ball.

[01:21:17] And just fired it, we're going out every 3 seconds into the pool ball.

[01:21:23] And then, in the management of, you know, the people in the management were probably all assured that eventually the,

[01:21:29] we're going to give it in the morning, and the pool ball's going to be in 2 pieces.

[01:21:33] And it's sad. It's, it's, it's, it gets big, but when I checked it, every day is going, it's still going.

[01:21:40] And one day, they, they come in the morning, and the thick test texture had fallen apart.

[01:21:47] The screws fell off, and it's holding it just fallen apart.

[01:21:52] It had gone over a million cycles, and there the pool ball still intact in one piece.

[01:21:57] So, that passed, it passed the flying colors.

[01:22:00] So, they've been, they've still been like it.

[01:22:03] So, I suggest, well, why don't we do this?

[01:22:07] Why don't we, we're going to, we always get the games in Gala lanes and Carol's stream.

[01:22:11] Why don't we, is there a test in one game?

[01:22:15] Let's test two games side by side.

[01:22:18] One will have a pool ball, and one will not have a pool ball.

[01:22:22] So, we did an alternate set of rules.

[01:22:25] But basically, and the rules are still on the game, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, adjustment in the game,

[01:22:31] because that was never taken out.

[01:22:33] So, there's, and just in the game, for what, what if the pool ball, or without the pool ball?

[01:22:38] And, but we didn't have, because it was going to the game, well, we show,

[01:22:42] that we didn't have time to test it in, in the, in the bowling alley, right?

[01:22:46] You know, in that, it was getting on Gala lanes.

[01:22:48] And so, they decide to fool us, send us the show, and half of the games will have the pool ball, and the other half will.

[01:22:57] On the floor, without the operators decide.

[01:22:59] You know, I didn't, you know, because the diner didn't get to go to the show, so I get the phone call the, the, the next day, after the first day of the show.

[01:23:07] So, the second day of the show, I get the phone call in the morning, and they said, John, we'll put in the pool balls and all the games.

[01:23:14] So, obviously the feedback was, we want the pool ball to the game.

[01:23:19] Yeah, and the way that works is there was a little miniature cue stick that, um, would, would hit the ball, but when you were playing, the pinball also hit the ball, and it was like the cue ball was in a, kind of like a confined area,

[01:23:33] kind of dead center middle of the playfield, right?

[01:23:36] Right, there was, there was a cue ball, there was an eight ball, and there was a cue ball.

[01:23:40] Right, right.

[01:23:41] The pinball, the pinball, the pinball would hit, would hit.

[01:23:45] Basically the cue ball was like a big giant messenger ball.

[01:23:49] So, there are targets up really high that the pinball couldn't hit, but the pool ball could hit.

[01:23:55] So, you would hit, you would use the pinball to smack the, um, the cue ball, and it would, then hit the target, the elevated targets, and score the points.

[01:24:10] So, you couldn't score the points with the pinball. You had, you had to use the pool ball to score the points.

[01:24:17] Then, then there was an upper playfield with a, with a, I think was, you know, I think it was eight ball, I don't know if I'll probably put it there.

[01:24:29] Yeah, eight ball.

[01:24:31] But it was a, a turret, one of the turrets shooting things, it would rotate back and forth, and whenever you, um,

[01:24:39] it would start rotating back and forth, and then whenever you made your, it was a skill shot, whenever you made your skill shot, it would shoot, and you try to hit with a target.

[01:24:48] So, that was basically the plunger skill shot.

[01:24:50] So, that would, that would be triggered from an optical switch on the ramp, and the problem with that game, how those big heavy duty resistor,

[01:24:59] with an optical switch, that would fall off the vibration.

[01:25:05] And so, so, so, while the, the, the cue ball was just out there, when it, ball crossed the op-dow, I wouldn't see it because if the resistor fell off, then the switch was basically always open.

[01:25:21] And then, then there was a second op-dow on the backside, over on the left side, when the ball's already passed point no return, when it's already going down, the, you know, the other side, another op-dow there, as a fail safe.

[01:25:35] So, a lot of times, if you, if you are overplaying the game, you make your plunger shot, and it doesn't kick that ball, the turret, the turret shooter, until it's passed the point no return over on the fail safe switch.

[01:25:49] So, that means you have a bad, a bad, a bad optical at the ramp opening.

[01:25:54] Right.

[01:25:55] Good tip.

[01:25:58] But cool, cool game and, and a big seller for you guys.

[01:26:02] Yeah, so you must have been pretty proud.

[01:26:05] It's a real well, but that was, that was 92, when everything was done real well.

[01:26:12] And, and you know, that was, that ended up, it was a real good game, a real good earner.

[01:26:20] And, that still seek a whole location every now and then.

[01:26:24] I saw one today on location, which is quite amazing because, you know, at that point, the game is 16 years old.

[01:26:32] Right. Right.

[01:26:33] Yeah, I saw one today and I talked to the operator about it and he goes, you know, that he goes that damn game, he goes, I got people to come in.

[01:26:39] And he goes, I pull money out of that game every week. He says, I got some customers that just love that game.

[01:26:45] So, this is amazing, kind of 16 year old game.

[01:26:48] I'm thinking of years and years ago, you know, a game that would last seven or eight years, would be a really, you know, exceptional.

[01:27:01] Of course, with the lack of a whole, there only been one pinball company.

[01:27:06] I guess it's like the ballet bingo machines, they'll probably be operated for years and years and years to come.

[01:27:12] Right. You know, it's, you know, it's okay.

[01:27:17] Well, tell me about Street Fighter 2 now, was that a ray design that you helped with?

[01:27:21] Yeah, that was a ray tanser design and my rule set.

[01:27:26] And again, a leather license.

[01:27:32] Now, Cuba, Wizard didn't get any licensing of any sort, right?

[01:27:39] Well, that was a, that's a pretty good license. The Street Fighter 2 was a really big hit video game.

[01:27:46] And it was really, you know, we thought that we got, we had scooped data east because data east was always good, those real good licenses.

[01:27:58] But maybe it's because it was Capcom and the data east made video games that maybe we had the advantage on that all along.

[01:28:06] We didn't make video games where Williams and data east did.

[01:28:10] Right. You know, that was what got us that license.

[01:28:13] But it was interesting that that's, that's the game that had the progressive multi-ball where every time you went into multi-ball, you had to make a progression and shots.

[01:28:24] And the next time you went into multi-ball, a game remembered where you were at.

[01:28:28] So you could continue on the progression.

[01:28:30] Well, I always thought that was a pretty cool feature because, you know, most games, when you got the multi-ball, it was climax and you went into the multi-ball again.

[01:28:38] You basically started over again and had to do whatever you needed to do where that game had memory from where you left off.

[01:28:44] So next time you went into multi-ball, whatever shot was, you know, you had to work the way up the shot to the play field and you had to, you know, always remember where you were at.

[01:28:57] Now, now you also helped off on, with TD off, which was another ray design, right?

[01:29:04] Yeah, I did the rules, did the rules on TD off.

[01:29:09] At that point, I was doing the rules for just about every game we made.

[01:29:15] I guess that we were having good success in people like my rules.

[01:29:19] And I basically would be the person to direct, you know, work with the programmers and for saves the games and in babies at the game tunnelcation and do all the other tasks that were needed for the person to do the rules.

[01:29:33] And I really enjoyed doing the rules. So I did the rules for all of Bill Parker's games and all of Ray's games with the exception of Wipeout.

[01:29:48] I didn't do the rules for him. At that time Ray wanted to do his own rules set. So I didn't do them on Wipeout. I think I did them on every other game.

[01:29:58] Now, what about, um, gladiators? That was your design, right?

[01:30:04] Yeah, gladiators was the game with a theme of strange twice.

[01:30:09] Originally when we got the Nintendo license, I think we could make three games.

[01:30:16] We made, you know, obviously the two Mario Brothers games. We had one more Nintendo game we could use.

[01:30:23] The license, and I was told to pick a game.

[01:30:30] And I basically at the time had their, you know, their whole video system whatever it was at the time and got a lot of cartridges and was playing all these games inside.

[01:30:40] I want to do the Legend of Zelda.

[01:30:43] I do a pinball game of Apple Legend of Zelda, which is kind of like a little adventure game that they had.

[01:30:48] I don't know how successful it is these days, but back then it was a pretty cool game.

[01:30:53] And I started basically designing gladiators to be the Legend of Zelda.

[01:30:58] And then we had a license for our new upcoming EVH called American Gladiators.

[01:31:08] And we had to come out, they decided to have to come out again soon because the show is coming out and they wanted to have the game come out the same time.

[01:31:16] The TV show is coming out. So we dropped Zelda and we decided to make it to American Gladiators.

[01:31:24] So at this time we're reviewing the rules and make it to an American Gladiators game where you have to go through all these events to get to the end or whatever.

[01:31:34] And it was designed that the rules were for change from Zelda to the same play field, but the rules were changed.

[01:31:40] The answer to change the law and then the license fell through at the last minute.

[01:31:46] So we were kind of stuck and we decided to hold this big gladiator.

[01:31:53] So how did you feel that worked out? I mean the game sold 2000 units.

[01:31:59] For all the trouble it was, it sounds like it was worth it.

[01:32:04] I think it was, I really think that if it was the Legend of Zelda it would have sold more.

[01:32:10] I really do.

[01:32:13] But again, it's like I said earlier, I have that original theme, but not one you get at the last minute.

[01:32:23] You know, are you going any time to develop something make it cool on Gladiators or you'll almost put the Gladiators.

[01:32:29] We need to get all the game in five weeks or whatever. We need the artwork now.

[01:32:35] So that's all of my thoughts on Gladiators. Gladiators is one of the favorite games I ever designed.

[01:32:42] If I ever have a small pinball collection which I'd tend to do, I will have a Gladiators.

[01:32:52] You know, at the game, at the game to play, I thought it was a really fun game.

[01:32:59] Now, it has a double feature, a lot of really cool features on it.

[01:33:04] I really enjoyed playing that game.

[01:33:08] It had that there was a, we went a while to change the e-commerce to tweak rules.

[01:33:21] We're Williams and Data Eastwood.

[01:33:24] So, you know, if you found out that the spinners worked too much points, then you could always tweak the rules.

[01:33:32] And this change your e-commerce revision number, and it's fine.

[01:33:37] But it got lived. They wouldn't allow us to do that.

[01:33:41] It was a software bug that caused the game to crash or something, and yes, they would.

[01:33:46] But if it was just to change a rule to make a game, we had a little more fun to play or bounce a little bit better.

[01:33:54] We weren't allowed to do it.

[01:33:55] Right, right. Gottlieb always felt that there should just be one ROM revision, not this multiple thing like Williams did.

[01:34:02] Yes, and I felt the multiple thing was better because you could tweak the game making to a better game, especially as it gets out.

[01:34:10] Then you could feed back to customers.

[01:34:12] Well, evidently, there was an oversight. There was partially my fault.

[01:34:16] There was a feature where you could just use the upper footboard to keep catching the ball and looping it, catching the ball and looping it.

[01:34:23] And not put the ball in risk and keep storing points.

[01:34:26] And they call it something that's called raping the game.

[01:34:29] Right.

[01:34:30] And I wasn't allowed to fix it.

[01:34:32] And so the game got, when it basically, when the game finally got the production, and the players are talking about,

[01:34:39] they all basically put big thumbs down on the game because they had this great feature on it.

[01:34:44] And if it had been made in Eastern Williams, that would have been fixed. That would have been a really easy fix because basically you make the shot once.

[01:34:53] And then some of the switch players from the play field would be required before you make the shot again.

[01:34:57] So you could just sit there and catch shoot, catch shoot, catch shoot all day long, looping the ball.

[01:35:02] And it was one of those things that would have been called two lines of code to fix, but I wasn't allowed to fix it.

[01:35:10] Now, when your games were on test, you didn't pick up something like that.

[01:35:16] I did. I was probably working out two games at the same time.

[01:35:20] Or I just, another player did it. No one figured that out yet.

[01:35:25] Or I had to give that yet because I don't play like that. I don't, you know, maybe you need to look for weaknesses in the game.

[01:35:32] And I just hadn't discovered it because there are so many other things to do when a game's coming out, especially when you're rushed by that last minute on a game like that.

[01:35:39] A lot of the games, the first time I'll see a complete game with the artwork and the rules and everything all together is when it's on test.

[01:35:51] Because sometimes we get the play fields and the game goes down the line on Thursday, gets done on Friday, goes right on test, and the production starts on Monday.

[01:36:03] Or the production starts, that's that e-problem is finalized. So I would have only got one weekend to find that problem on that game.

[01:36:13] So you mean they only ran test for one weekend?

[01:36:16] A couple of games only one weekend.

[01:36:19] Wow, that's pretty short.

[01:36:21] Yeah, well, that's a lot of time where, you know, it's to keep the line going and give people a free point laid off, you had to do that.

[01:36:31] And if you're waiting for a part or something to come in, or maybe that bug wasn't there, and then it appeared on the last revision of code before it went out on test.

[01:36:45] And then we didn't find it on test.

[01:36:48] So there were, but if you leave, it was of all the policies that Gottlieb had, that was my least favorite.

[01:36:54] We couldn't tweak game and go to a revision 2.0 or revision 3.0, which is standard these days with all software.

[01:37:03] They wouldn't let us do that.

[01:37:06] Now, what about, you know, 1994 World Challenge Soccer?

[01:37:11] And you know, at the same time, I think Williams was coming out with their soccer.

[01:37:17] You're going to love this story.

[01:37:18] We were, the World Cup Soccer term was coming out.

[01:37:24] At about six months before, ultimately, we're going to go get the license.

[01:37:29] We found out that Valley had already had the license.

[01:37:33] So we knew the Valley Williams Valley was going to be coming out with a World Cup Soccer game.

[01:37:41] At the same time, we were going to be bringing, that would be going to the Spring Show.

[01:37:47] We were going to be bringing Rest 9-1-1 to the Spring Show.

[01:37:52] And the game before, which was World Challenge Soccer, really, I guess that the game that was before World Challenge Soccer, could a little bit short.

[01:38:04] We saw that we wanted to bring this Rest 9-1-1 to the Spring Show.

[01:38:10] And the other game is going to hand.

[01:38:12] And we have about six weeks of production.

[01:38:16] We need to fill the little filler game.

[01:38:19] So what we did was we said, well, it is going to take an existing playfield that we have.

[01:38:24] Make a couple of changes and make it to the soccer game.

[01:38:28] Just to steal the spotlight a little bit away from Williams Valley.

[01:38:36] So I took Car Hop, a single level game, to a couple of wire ramps on it.

[01:38:45] And basically, if we came out with that little goal thing and we came out with the soccer game, the thing is, we saw that game out.

[01:38:53] We thought that we were going to have to close it out or something.

[01:38:56] And it sold, we were all going to make about 12 out of that game.

[01:39:00] You know, we were going to make 12 out of those ourselves.

[01:39:03] Because we knew we were going to come out with the rest of the 9-1-1 for the Spring Show, which was our, you know, more of a blockbuster kind of game.

[01:39:11] And so it was basically filled the niche to keep the line going for six weeks before the other game was going to come out.

[01:39:20] And basically, the customers must like the game because we sold that game out.

[01:39:26] Yeah, nearly 1500 units.

[01:39:29] Yeah, I remember it was 12 or 1500, but that was all.

[01:39:32] When you look at this production statistics, it's lower than all the other games.

[01:39:36] It was like a flop, but that's all we were going to make of that game anyway.

[01:39:40] Because it was just a stopgap before the other game came out.

[01:39:46] Interesting. Now, you went for a big license with Shaq and did Shaq attack?

[01:39:51] Now, did you ever meet with Shaq?

[01:39:54] No. The only of all the licensed games, the only personality we ever met was Robert England on Freddy.

[01:40:04] And that's because he came in, we flew him in to do the speech for the game.

[01:40:12] The only, what I ever met, the only personality I ever met, you know, all the years of working on those games.

[01:40:19] So who was getting these, who in your management was getting the licensing to in that work?

[01:40:24] LJ Green, at the time, was working for us and she was getting most of those licenses.

[01:40:31] And I think that, you know, I think she's still in the industry working as a consultant for licensing to this day.

[01:40:38] I'm not really sure because I lost track of it, but that's, you know, after she left, I think she was doing that.

[01:40:45] And that was, you know, that was the person who got most of the licenses.

[01:40:52] As far as I know, we got most of the licenses. It was really, really my department.

[01:40:56] A lot of times they had come to us and say, well, we just got this license.

[01:40:59] This is the game you're working on.

[01:41:03] You know, it was a license game, you make it.

[01:41:06] Or the shack and the shack, the shack license, we got through electronic arts.

[01:41:13] Because, well, we had some other work with the company, we used to work for electronic arts.

[01:41:17] So we got, they had electronic arts and license, shack, and we basically had, had, last on to that license.

[01:41:26] Now, that didn't, so that wasn't a competition thing against, again, Williams-Balley in their NBA fast break.

[01:41:33] No, I think that we were, we were before the NBA fast break.

[01:41:37] I think fast break must have come out a year or two later.

[01:41:40] Okay.

[01:41:41] I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, the years off in on the games.

[01:41:44] But I think our game came out first. We didn't know about their game.

[01:41:49] And were you, were you happy with how Shack's tack came out?

[01:41:55] I hate, I hate of the artwork, I hate of the backlash.

[01:41:59] I would lose backlash in a game of mine.

[01:42:02] And there was an earlier backlash, really cool backlash of Shack breaking the backboard.

[01:42:09] That was rejected by the licensed company.

[01:42:13] Why?

[01:42:14] I think I have no idea. I wasn't told. It was really cool.

[01:42:19] And that was rejected. They wanted this giant thing.

[01:42:25] And I thought the backlash was hideous.

[01:42:28] The nuisance coach on the game, I'll tell anybody who has the game, that's an adjustable setting.

[01:42:37] You can turn the coach off.

[01:42:39] And I was, again, mocking while that on there.

[01:42:42] And I had no say in that coach.

[01:42:45] The one who's irritating, he's telling me what shot to make.

[01:42:49] Yeah, you can turn him.

[01:42:51] And I made the program or put the adjustment in the game.

[01:42:55] We had the ship to game with an on, coach on.

[01:42:58] But it's in there. You can turn that coach off.

[01:43:01] Anybody who has that game, I'd recommend you to turn that coach off.

[01:43:05] Because you will give you a headache after a while.

[01:43:09] Other than that, the game was fine.

[01:43:12] Yeah, it is kind of an ugly artwork.

[01:43:15] You know?

[01:43:17] I have all the games that, that and the biggest backlash.

[01:43:22] The biggest backlash, the biggest cabinet and the entire package for Jack Attack,

[01:43:28] where the, where the artworks speaking were my worst, you know, the game with my games were the worst.

[01:43:36] Now, you worked on Stargate and Waterworld, which were both Ray Tanzer games.

[01:43:41] Tell me about that.

[01:43:43] Well, Stargate, Stargate, a lot of people really, I did the rules and Ray did the play field.

[01:43:51] It was a really good game.

[01:43:54] And we're all really happy with the rules.

[01:43:56] We all went to the premiere of the movie Stargate.

[01:43:59] I went back and wrote the rules.

[01:44:01] And, you know, I thought they came out really good.

[01:44:06] Then Ray did, after that, the Waterworld, it was supposed to be another big meal.

[01:44:12] That was the Stargate that moved you to OK, but Waterworld, it was going to be flopped.

[01:44:16] But Ray had made the game that they came out with.

[01:44:24] Oh, it was not the game that Ray designed.

[01:44:27] They decided that must have been when we started getting into financial trouble,

[01:44:30] and they came in, they cost, they cost that game down by $200 or $300.

[01:44:36] And one day Ray went on vacation, and then the management came in,

[01:44:40] and they just arbitrarily took four or five units off the game, mechanical units off the play field.

[01:44:47] And put them on Ray's chair.

[01:44:50] So when you come back on vacation, you saw the units on his chair and realized that they had been yanked off his game.

[01:44:56] And obviously, the company was struggling at that point, and financially and all.

[01:45:04] So they were costing the game down.

[01:45:06] But the game Waterworld really wasn't the game that was originally designed.

[01:45:14] Yes, Stargate was quite a good game, and you sold $3,600 of them, but Waterworld,

[01:45:20] yeah, you only sold $1,500 of them, and that was what 1995, so that, you know,

[01:45:24] things were starting to come down for Gottlieb.

[01:45:27] Yeah, and say a lot of people don't realize they think that Pinball killed Gottlieb.

[01:45:32] Pinball did not kill Gottlieb.

[01:45:34] It was gaming to kill Gottlieb.

[01:45:36] What do you mean?

[01:45:38] Well, Gottlieb in the early 90s, when Pinball was really going well,

[01:45:44] decided to buy a company called SNS, which made lottery terminals.

[01:45:50] Basically, they're not slot machines, but they're poker machines that state lotteries run.

[01:46:00] That state lotteries can run legally to play poker machines on bars and towers and places.

[01:46:08] And the company wanted to diversify and get into the video lottery, because at the time of state lottery

[01:46:14] they were just coming out and looking at an emerging field that could make a lot of money,

[01:46:18] and maybe eventually they eventually get into full gaming, you know, full slot machines.

[01:46:23] So they paid a lot of money for this company, SNS, and couldn't get any licenses.

[01:46:31] So SNS became a bleeding wound, and eventually they couldn't sell any games anywhere,

[01:46:43] and the company could basically blood the company dry.

[01:46:47] Even if you look at the last few games, Pinball games, they said better than a lot of the single-level games did,

[01:46:55] but because of the financial bleeding wound from SNS, trying to pay interest on his loan,

[01:47:02] for a company's not selling any product, they bought the company down.

[01:47:08] Interesting. I didn't know that.

[01:47:12] You can do the research, and you can find out more particular on it.

[01:47:18] But from my point of view, that's the way I saw it.

[01:47:21] If you look at those last few Pinball games, I don't think there are any Pinball games that sold less than a thousand units.

[01:47:30] Yeah, the lowest selling one, at least of your games, was Mario and Tready, which was your last Gotleab,

[01:47:35] at the end in 1995, and that sold more than 1100 units, yeah.

[01:47:42] Yeah, I think, hey, look, I could single-level games, a car hop sold less than that.

[01:47:48] Yeah, like deadly weapons sold 800 units, for example.

[01:47:53] Yeah, that's what I'm saying, as I'm saying, it wasn't...

[01:47:56] For Pinball, it wasn't as dark of a year as those years, but we survived those years,

[01:48:02] because we could make it on selling those low amount of Pinball units.

[01:48:07] Because all you do is you just cut back your late, late few people off of the factory,

[01:48:12] and survive those lean years, and gear back up when Pinball comes back.

[01:48:18] But, you know, it wasn't Pinball, Pinball wasn't the culprit, it was a gaming.

[01:48:25] Keep this thing.

[01:48:26] Now, tell me about Mario and Tready, that was your last Gotleab.

[01:48:31] Mario and Tready was the game that I really, at that point,

[01:48:39] wanted to design a game for the average player, just for the average player.

[01:48:44] I really didn't care about Pinball Wizards, you know, all I could put features on there for them and stuff.

[01:48:49] But I wanted to do a game for the average player,

[01:48:54] so I put a lot of bank ball time percentage, you know, in that game.

[01:48:58] And, you know, the actual, the odd bank ball time percentage was,

[01:49:05] that looked at the ball time that the average player at that location had.

[01:49:11] The player could, the operator could adjust the ball time to what they wanted to,

[01:49:14] and the game would adjust features to hit that ball time.

[01:49:19] And we could do that because they had that center of post,

[01:49:22] so we could raise the center of post, you know, and tie them it out or whatever.

[01:49:29] And, you know, make the, make the game hit that set ball time.

[01:49:36] So, that was kind of the feature on that that I was pretty proud of.

[01:49:39] And we also, at that point, were starting to get Pinball League, Pinball League software,

[01:49:46] and we were ready to go with that, and all kinds of other cool stuff that never got into games.

[01:49:53] So, now, you were, how you, how got lead kind of close,

[01:49:58] you kind of have a depressing story about that. Are you willing to tell us that?

[01:50:04] You mean about when they brought us all down the lunch room and gave us our pink slips?

[01:50:09] Well, prior to that, like a month before that, you were buying a new house for your,

[01:50:13] your pinball collection and what happened there?

[01:50:16] Well, I had, I had up until then, I had a house without a basement,

[01:50:22] so I had pinball for, the living room full of pinballs,

[01:50:29] and a couple of mini storages with pinballs in them,

[01:50:33] and one of the bedrooms had pinballs and I had a workshop,

[01:50:37] and I decided, you know, I was, I just, I just thought, two years before that,

[01:50:42] and pinball sales are still pretty good.

[01:50:45] I really wanted to get a house with a big basement,

[01:50:48] so I could have all my, like, pinballs up the table.

[01:50:51] Now, I'm not a big risk taker, and I decided, now, I'm, I'm, I get, I'm going to take a risk,

[01:50:57] I'm going to buy it, buy a new house, have a house built for me with this huge basement,

[01:51:02] and, and I'll be, unfortunately, I'll be financially vulnerable for a couple of years at the time.

[01:51:09] Things are looking really good, so I didn't think I was taking that risk.

[01:51:12] So, it took about a year to build a house or so, and then I'm, and then, and then,

[01:51:17] and then I moved into the house, and it was 10 days after I moved into the house,

[01:51:21] that the company declared financial that, it came finally announced to everybody

[01:51:25] that they have financial difficulty.

[01:51:27] Now, I didn't, I didn't see a clue of this going,

[01:51:30] because the sales had been, like, a thousand units or more of each games,

[01:51:34] so I didn't think there was anything, a big deal, but they declared financial difficulty,

[01:51:38] and, uh, that was 10 days after I closed on the house, and, uh,

[01:51:44] I'd say, six weeks later, the company has closed.

[01:51:48] Yeah, but didn't you, like, go and ask them if there was any, you know,

[01:51:51] if there was a problem or something, and they kind of said, no, no, no, no, there's no problem?

[01:51:55] Yeah. Yeah, I had, I had, I had, I had, I had, I had, I had,

[01:51:59] because I, I think it did do a layoff, maybe three months before that,

[01:52:05] and they said there was no, they said there was no problem,

[01:52:08] but that was because they were, at the time I didn't know that they were in,

[01:52:12] in discussion with, with Sega, Sega, Sega hand,

[01:52:18] maybe three-fourth Sega, about the east, I'm not really sure of the timeline,

[01:52:22] but they were in discussion with Sega to, um, to buy out the company.

[01:52:29] They thought that, they thought that Sega was just going to take over the company

[01:52:32] and everything would be fine.

[01:52:34] I think, I think that's what it was.

[01:52:36] Then the Sega deal fell through, then after that, that's the major

[01:52:40] cleric financial difficulty, and, um, eventually closed the company.

[01:52:45] Now, what is this about the lunchroom meeting?

[01:52:48] Well, they just basically brought, brought on the lunchroom for a meeting,

[01:52:53] and, uh, they were basically, uh, they were down there with pink slips,

[01:52:59] and everybody who company is now closed, you can,

[01:53:02] get your personal possessions off your desk, you had to have the guard,

[01:53:05] to take out, there's a guard, you were escorted with a guard,

[01:53:08] to go back up, and get the stuff from your desk,

[01:53:11] and, uh, my biggest loss was, on my company computer,

[01:53:15] I had had all my, um, pinball league, and all the data and research I was doing

[01:53:21] to do, uh, handicapping, pinball handicapping, and league play, and all that,

[01:53:25] and that was all my computer at work, and that was all lost.

[01:53:30] You mean they wouldn't let you recover anything from the computers?

[01:53:33] No, no, they wouldn't, you had to, you had to, you had to,

[01:53:37] take your personal possessions, put it in my card bar box, and leave right away.

[01:53:44] And, you know, what did, uh, what did you do at that point?

[01:53:48] I mean, you did manage to get a job over at, uh, at D.D.

[01:53:53] slash, at, say, at one point, right?

[01:53:55] Yeah, I got a job there, maybe in two or three months afterwards,

[01:54:00] but see, at first they're thinking, they kept saying, you know, people saying,

[01:54:03] we're going to get a financial back, and we're going to reopen this thing.

[01:54:06] We're going to, you know, that, we're going to, so, they're still kind of optimistic,

[01:54:08] we're going to reopen this thing, and when it became,

[01:54:12] one after they have, then they decided to also invent the next thing,

[01:54:15] another's an auction, and I guess they had, that they still have,

[01:54:19] maybe, some possibility to do a last minute deal.

[01:54:21] I think they had, uh, a financial backer who's going to do it.

[01:54:24] I don't know, I'm not really sure, but they seem like,

[01:54:27] they still have optimistic point of view that,

[01:54:29] that we're going to be going back to work, and then next thing you know,

[01:54:33] they're going to have, oh, we're going to have the auction,

[01:54:35] and then the day of the auction, you knew it was all final,

[01:54:38] so, about a week after the auction, I went to work for Sega.

[01:54:42] As a quality control person, because they couldn't,

[01:54:47] because, say, Sega does, does, is, they only have a window,

[01:54:51] the higher people, once a year, the engineering,

[01:54:54] when they do with a new bug, and they couldn't get me in until that window,

[01:54:59] and three months from then, or whatever,

[01:55:01] so I came, went in, worked for three or four months,

[01:55:03] and quality control, and then I finally went into the,

[01:55:05] into the engineering of the game designer.

[01:55:08] Now, how was the company, you know,

[01:55:12] what was the difference in, like, company philosophy between Gottlieb and,

[01:55:16] and Sega, and Diddy, and Slash Sega?

[01:55:21] Uh, it's, you know, the culture as it may be.

[01:55:27] So what?

[01:55:28] You know, the company culture, was it,

[01:55:30] dreaded and dramatically different?

[01:55:32] Not really. It was set up, I think,

[01:55:37] as more beta-heast, Slash Sega, or,

[01:55:41] I could go on with it, with a Sega, was basically,

[01:55:46] the, that Gottlieb, the game designer,

[01:55:49] was responsible for the rules, where at Sega,

[01:55:52] it was more like Williams, where the program was responsible for the rules.

[01:55:57] So the only time I got to do rules at Sega,

[01:56:02] was Golden Queue, that was my concept,

[01:56:06] and games that Neil Falkiner would program,

[01:56:09] because he really didn't like, well, I guess he really didn't like doing the rules,

[01:56:12] or whatever, or Joe Kamikawa wanted me to do the rules on some of the games,

[01:56:16] and he worked heavily on the rules sets for Biper,

[01:56:20] and for Godzilla.

[01:56:23] But the games that Lonnie robbed program,

[01:56:27] Lonnie didn't want many or near the rules of those games.

[01:56:30] There were basically his games, you know?

[01:56:33] So I didn't get to work on those rules.

[01:56:35] You know, like, he had gained a Lonnie program that I did the rules for,

[01:56:38] was Golden Queue, because that was, you know,

[01:56:41] that was my concept from the beginning,

[01:56:44] and other than Golden Queue, you know,

[01:56:49] and the games that Lonnie did, I basically had no say.

[01:56:52] Now, Golden Queue, they never really actually made,

[01:56:55] what was the deal with Golden Queue?

[01:56:58] Golden Queue, it was a tournament game that,

[01:57:03] that basically the idea was to have a,

[01:57:09] with the Golden Queue Golf,

[01:57:13] that incredible technology it makes,

[01:57:16] wanted to do a work with incredible technologies

[01:57:19] using their infrastructure, but do a pinball game.

[01:57:21] So I was told to come up with a pinball game,

[01:57:24] where the player could pay an entry fee,

[01:57:28] and play, and basically get cast prizes.

[01:57:32] And, well, it's Golden Queue,

[01:57:37] with Golden Queue,

[01:57:40] when we went from Sega to Stern Pemball,

[01:57:45] it was basically the project was dropped.

[01:57:49] Why?

[01:57:52] Why would they drop it?

[01:57:55] Mostly of concerns over cheating,

[01:57:58] because with a video game, you can't cheat.

[01:58:01] You get a high score.

[01:58:03] The Pemball game, you can slide the glass

[01:58:05] and cheat by hitting, just with your finger.

[01:58:09] And I had suggested, instead of giving cast prizes,

[01:58:14] having a location, cast prizes for the locations,

[01:58:17] that way the operator wouldn't be cheating,

[01:58:20] because they're not going to cheat his cast paying players,

[01:58:24] and then the players would wonder,

[01:58:26] who's this person who won the tournament?

[01:58:29] So, but the, for the national thing,

[01:58:32] I suggest, instead of giving cast prizes,

[01:58:35] you give invites to a tournament,

[01:58:37] where you have to come and play in person.

[01:58:41] So, you can still win cast prizes for the bar,

[01:58:44] but for the USA, instead of winning cast prizes,

[01:58:48] maybe the top five places would be giving invites,

[01:58:51] you know, at the end of each term,

[01:58:54] a cycle of top five players would be giving invites

[01:58:56] to come to the regional tournament, or something like that.

[01:58:59] So, the only good players would prevail,

[01:59:03] you could cheat in the win money.

[01:59:06] You'd still be forced to play games against real players,

[01:59:09] but they didn't want to go that route,

[01:59:12] and the game was dropped.

[01:59:14] Yeah, the game kind of didn't the game...

[01:59:16] The best game I ever designed.

[01:59:18] It was the best game you ever designed?

[01:59:20] The best game I ever designed.

[01:59:22] Now, did it morph into Sharky's shootout?

[01:59:26] Yeah, they gave it to John Borg,

[01:59:29] and John Borg with the mutual sword.

[01:59:32] And the story changed it into a new one.

[01:59:35] Now, why wasn't the best game you ever designed?

[01:59:38] The problem with the tournament was that,

[01:59:41] with Kim Bolving and Kim Askill,

[01:59:43] how are you going to get average players

[01:59:46] to play in a tournament where good players play in it?

[01:59:50] And that's what it looked like to me,

[01:59:52] like you were me trying to play pool,

[01:59:54] and a pool tournament, and that's my pool tournament.

[01:59:57] You know, you're not even going to try

[02:00:00] because you know you can't stand the chance.

[02:00:03] And you don't want the tournament just before Kexi Nautos

[02:00:06] you want to be forever day people.

[02:00:08] And I think in the score...

[02:00:10] in a typical Kimball game,

[02:00:12] the score difference between a poor player

[02:00:16] and a good player is five or sixfold.

[02:00:19] So if I...

[02:00:20] if my best score,

[02:00:21] I guess game on the Kimball machine is 30 million,

[02:00:24] and I see a high score table of 250 million,

[02:00:28] I'm not even going to try to play in the tournament.

[02:00:31] So what I did was I made it like a real pool game,

[02:00:35] where the game, instead of it being...

[02:00:40] what a game where good players play longer,

[02:00:46] the good players play starter,

[02:00:48] when you complete the goal of the game ends.

[02:00:51] And...

[02:00:54] and the...

[02:00:55] all the players play all the shots of...

[02:00:58] there were...

[02:00:59] I think, 10 shots that you had to make.

[02:01:02] And when you complete the 10 shots, the game ended.

[02:01:05] You got a limited balls.

[02:01:07] I think there was a five minute limit or something,

[02:01:09] but basically every time you lost a ball,

[02:01:10] you could replenish it.

[02:01:11] There were no balls in play.

[02:01:12] It's like pool.

[02:01:13] It was you...

[02:01:14] you play until you complete the last shot.

[02:01:17] And of course, at this point,

[02:01:20] good players will play faster,

[02:01:22] because they're more professional with the shot making.

[02:01:24] So a good player's game might last a minute and a half,

[02:01:29] but the Lazy player,

[02:01:31] who's not going to win the tournament,

[02:01:32] is going to get more aircams,

[02:01:33] because their games get in the last three or four minutes.

[02:01:36] And the way it worked was every shot,

[02:01:38] all the shots,

[02:01:39] when you complete all that last shot,

[02:01:41] just for 99 million.

[02:01:43] So whether you were a good player or a bad player,

[02:01:45] your score is 99 million,

[02:01:47] but then there's a countdown bonus.

[02:01:50] That starts at one million and counts down.

[02:01:54] When you complete the last shot,

[02:01:55] the countdown bonus values added to your final score.

[02:01:58] So if that player plays in a minute and a half,

[02:02:02] the countdown bonus may only go down to 200,000 points.

[02:02:05] So you'll be at 99,800.

[02:02:10] If you're a Lazy player,

[02:02:11] that countdown bonus may have counted down

[02:02:13] five hundred thousand points.

[02:02:15] So his final score will be 99,000,

[02:02:18] and going to 200,000.

[02:02:20] So at least it's only three or four hundred thousand

[02:02:23] between the good player and the bad player.

[02:02:27] That's that mutual sort of score.

[02:02:29] So basically we're saying that the score is going to be close.

[02:02:33] And how did that game go on test?

[02:02:37] The game never really went on test.

[02:02:40] We took it to some shows,

[02:02:42] pinball or expose, and herb,

[02:02:44] or whatever,

[02:02:45] but the game was really all along a ruse

[02:02:52] to try to steal thunder away from Williams,

[02:02:57] pinball 2000 in my opinion.

[02:03:00] I don't know for a fact in my opinion though.

[02:03:02] It was never really meant to,

[02:03:05] to, I guess it really,

[02:03:07] it's all about cheating problem that we would have made it,

[02:03:11] but in the end it was never really meant to be.

[02:03:16] Now why was that to steal thunder from pinball 2000?

[02:03:19] How was it going to accomplish that?

[02:03:21] I don't know.

[02:03:22] It's just so,

[02:03:23] because whenever we were working on it,

[02:03:25] we took it to pinball expo,

[02:03:26] and we took it to the shows.

[02:03:27] So it ended up being in train publications,

[02:03:29] and we're working on this.

[02:03:31] It was like,

[02:03:32] we're working on something revolutionary,

[02:03:34] because everybody knew that Williams was working on pinball 2000,

[02:03:37] so I think it was just a marketing thing for motion.

[02:03:43] Now what about high roller casino?

[02:03:46] You worked on that, right?

[02:03:48] Yeah, I did the play field,

[02:03:51] and the concept of the rule,

[02:03:53] I didn't write the rule,

[02:03:54] because I was gone by then,

[02:03:56] and I said I had the play field,

[02:03:58] the play field was almost exactly like I left it,

[02:04:01] when I left the company.

[02:04:03] The end of the couple of inserts,

[02:04:05] but even all the inserts are the same,

[02:04:07] the point shots are all the same.

[02:04:09] That's basically the game that I left

[02:04:11] with tweaks that's obviously

[02:04:14] as they're a percentage in the game.

[02:04:16] But I just wanted to,

[02:04:17] I wanted a pinball game,

[02:04:19] a full featured Vegas style pinball game

[02:04:22] that were the gambling games you're playing,

[02:04:27] that are closer to real as we can get.

[02:04:31] When you're playing whatever is blackjack,

[02:04:35] you have to hit and hold or whatever,

[02:04:37] just like the real version,

[02:04:40] because you know the real version of the game.

[02:04:43] That was basically the concept of that game.

[02:04:46] But then,

[02:04:48] when Stern consolidated with two buildings,

[02:04:51] and went from two buildings to one building,

[02:04:54] they went from Osmondon smoking building,

[02:04:56] and they closed the Osmondon smoking building,

[02:04:59] and they put everybody up to the smoke-friendly building.

[02:05:02] I left, I resigned on the day of the change.

[02:05:06] I gave my notice long,

[02:05:08] that I'd be leaving on the one-day move,

[02:05:11] probably three months notice.

[02:05:13] But that was my last day,

[02:05:14] it was the last day they had

[02:05:16] the not-smoking building open.

[02:05:18] You had health problems or something

[02:05:20] that couldn't deal with smoking?

[02:05:21] Yeah, I had a little bit of asthma,

[02:05:25] and breathing problems sometimes.

[02:05:28] And it's aggravated by cigarette smoke,

[02:05:32] and I can't be anywhere near cigarette.

[02:05:36] I thought it was this way forced out.

[02:05:39] But that was an intentional on their part, right?

[02:05:43] No, it wasn't targeted toward me.

[02:05:45] It was targeted toward me.

[02:05:46] They didn't want people taking smoking breaks,

[02:05:49] and fully their deaths.

[02:05:52] It was just a matter of trying to...

[02:05:56] Gary is very good at being a company on a shoe-string.

[02:06:01] I mean, he's financially...

[02:06:04] Obviously, he's the only company to remain,

[02:06:07] and not a lot,

[02:06:09] because of his able to cut company out

[02:06:11] to one thing on a shoe-string.

[02:06:14] And that decision at the time was made

[02:06:19] so that people would be at their desks,

[02:06:23] and not take its smoking breaks.

[02:06:27] That was...

[02:06:30] I under the decision I left,

[02:06:32] and I thought that was a good term,

[02:06:34] but I tried to make efforts towards doing a game for them

[02:06:39] and do an all-avail.

[02:06:42] I'm very sorry.

[02:06:45] Right, so you're still interested in getting back

[02:06:48] as a pinball designer again?

[02:06:50] Yes.

[02:06:52] Right now, I'm in grad school,

[02:06:54] and I work a couple days a week at a job.

[02:06:58] I've got to be working a couple days a week,

[02:07:00] working on a play field.

[02:07:03] But maybe in the future,

[02:07:06] with the weak dollar and the struggling economy,

[02:07:11] the income ball is always an industry

[02:07:14] that did very well under a struggling economy and weak dollar.

[02:07:18] Yeah, yeah.

[02:07:19] You mentioned that too when I taught you before,

[02:07:21] the interview, you said that pinball

[02:07:24] is does well in a weak economy,

[02:07:26] which is kind of backwards,

[02:07:28] well, what you might think.

[02:07:30] Well, remember when it was pinball's law

[02:07:32] and during the Depression?

[02:07:34] In the 1930s.

[02:07:36] It's a week after recession, depression.

[02:07:39] It's always done well, recession, depression times,

[02:07:41] and the times of prosperity is done poorly.

[02:07:44] You like the late 90s, times prosperity.

[02:07:47] And then a weak dollar,

[02:07:49] because when we have a weak dollar,

[02:07:52] it's an export product, you know,

[02:07:54] and it becomes more appealing to people

[02:07:56] to buy over full receipts,

[02:07:58] because they can get more from their currency

[02:08:00] by more pinballs.

[02:08:02] Well, I think right now,

[02:08:05] we're looking into the center of recession coming.

[02:08:08] A weak dollar,

[02:08:10] it might be a good time for a pinball company to be an upstart.

[02:08:15] And you'd be interested in getting involved with that, obviously.

[02:08:18] Oh, yeah. Yeah. If I,

[02:08:20] if something like that happens,

[02:08:22] I'm going to, at least, make an attempt

[02:08:24] to try to, try to,

[02:08:26] try to, you know, work something out

[02:08:28] or be part of, be part of a company.

[02:08:31] Now, what do you think?

[02:08:32] Have you seen the new Stern Games,

[02:08:34] you know, in the last couple of three years?

[02:08:36] Have you seen them? What do you think?

[02:08:38] I haven't seen any games.

[02:08:41] The last new game I saw with T3.

[02:08:46] There's already no games around where I live.

[02:08:49] There's no new games or all old games.

[02:08:52] All the games around here are older games.

[02:08:56] Now, why is that, do you think?

[02:09:00] Because the operator can go to an auction here

[02:09:04] and they can get a 90s game

[02:09:07] for $1,1250.

[02:09:10] Instead of spending three times that much for a new game.

[02:09:14] It's like in the new games,

[02:09:16] I can make them that much for money.

[02:09:19] Right. Right. Right.

[02:09:22] You can go back to ROI, return on investment.

[02:09:25] That's why IELS.

[02:09:28] Yeah, because your feeling is,

[02:09:30] is that if a new company did come out,

[02:09:33] that they have to have a price point

[02:09:35] that's lower than what Stern is currently at.

[02:09:38] I've been a business plan for about a year ago.

[02:09:42] I was trying to get people interested

[02:09:45] in doing a startup company.

[02:09:47] I've got a business plan together.

[02:09:50] I figure that if I can come out of the penball,

[02:09:54] that's sell for $29.95, you know,

[02:09:58] street price. Maybe suggested retail

[02:10:01] would be $34.95,

[02:10:03] if it really sells for $29.99,

[02:10:05] $29.95 out of the distributor.

[02:10:07] I'll bring it back to you if I can.

[02:10:10] It's a little bit more than you use game,

[02:10:13] but it doesn't have a brand new game.

[02:10:16] A little more reliable and a little more modern.

[02:10:19] And make teams that appeal to kids.

[02:10:21] Get the kids up.

[02:10:23] The 15 to 24-year-old

[02:10:25] makes games that make appeal to them.

[02:10:28] Now, what do you think of Herb Silver's

[02:10:31] in his startup of these classic

[02:10:34] designs?

[02:10:37] You were involved with that project, huh?

[02:10:40] Yeah, I pretty much did the Playfield design

[02:10:43] and worked with Herb and Reini for several years.

[02:10:48] Now, when you say you did the Playfield design,

[02:10:51] I thought the Playfield was largely based on King of Diamonds.

[02:10:55] It was, but basically you still have to do the layout

[02:10:59] and the drawings and the drawing for the mechanical parts.

[02:11:03] I think that was a great idea.

[02:11:06] I think that was the idea of the design and the design

[02:11:10] and the design and the design for all the

[02:11:15] unique parts and the Playfield layout and the inserts.

[02:11:20] Do you think that they can sell that game?

[02:11:24] I think they can sell some of that game.

[02:11:28] It's like a few years ago when the company

[02:11:33] came out with the 10th of the TeenJoop box

[02:11:36] and the Played CDs.

[02:11:38] There's always going to be some customer

[02:11:42] who is not an operator trying to buy something for the house

[02:11:47] and wants to look good in their rack room

[02:11:50] and look like a vintage game.

[02:11:53] Yeah, I think that they'll be some good sales.

[02:11:57] Oh, yeah.

[02:11:59] Pinball, so pinball 2000.

[02:12:01] You mentioned that you guys got some kind of idea about it.

[02:12:05] Tell me how you guys knew about it, what you knew,

[02:12:08] and when you first saw it, what your reaction was.

[02:12:11] Ray Tanger and I both figured out what it was.

[02:12:16] About probably about a year before it came out when it was announced.

[02:12:21] And the reason why is because we both worked at Gottlid

[02:12:25] Premiere Technology.

[02:12:27] And we knew, see, we didn't know what the design

[02:12:30] or pinball 2000 was.

[02:12:32] We thought it was probably John Trudeau.

[02:12:35] Because John Trudeau had that concept game with pinball 2000

[02:12:39] back at Gottlid.

[02:12:42] It would have been done probably in the early 80s.

[02:12:47] Right, yeah, I remember an article about it in the Pin Game Journal.

[02:12:51] Yeah, it was the kids ghost game.

[02:12:53] You'd have to talk to him about it.

[02:12:55] But we figured out that it was probably a video version

[02:12:59] of John Trudeau's ghost game concept.

[02:13:02] And that's basically exactly what it ended up being.

[02:13:06] So basically, when we saw the game, it just confirmed our suspicions.

[02:13:11] Did you think it was well executed by Williams?

[02:13:15] Yeah, I thought it was pretty well executed.

[02:13:18] I mean, I thought the bill materials was probably incredibly high on the game.

[02:13:25] And I thought that the mistake that Williams made with the platform

[02:13:35] was the same mistake that Gottlid did with the SL games.

[02:13:38] In that step, it's something that the industry could probably observe one game

[02:13:45] like that maybe every year to two years.

[02:13:50] But to go just to abandon regular traditional pinball

[02:13:55] and go all of pinball 2000 was I kind of like Gottlid will name

[02:14:00] abandoned full feature games and went to single level games.

[02:14:04] And basically, in my opinion, they didn't learn from our mistake.

[02:14:09] That you basically knew that what they should have done

[02:14:12] is brought, kept on going with regular pinball games and brought one out.

[02:14:16] This is how it does.

[02:14:18] And then from that, the sales and its reception,

[02:14:22] and then you basically make subsequent models.

[02:14:25] Right, and you could have multiple price levels,

[02:14:28] like the dot matrix one would be less expensive than the 2000s.

[02:14:32] Yeah, and they could have done that.

[02:14:35] So I was, and actually we were all really surprised

[02:14:38] when they just were the only games they were going to make,

[02:14:41] following the events from Mars onward were pinball 2000 games.

[02:14:46] And I was kind of surprised, and I think everybody else was,

[02:14:51] but that was, you know, I really don't know what made that decision to do that.

[02:15:00] You know, what was there?

[02:15:02] Why they did that?

[02:15:04] But, you know, I wasn't there.

[02:15:06] But, you know, I thought that like the,

[02:15:10] some of the future models that we never saw,

[02:15:14] it sounded like if they were going to make the each game

[02:15:16] a little bit better and better, but I really thought that they should have made

[02:15:20] a regular dot matrix, you know, traditional pinballs.

[02:15:23] And came out maybe one of those models per year.

[02:15:28] And, you know, if they did, then maybe they would still be in business today, you know.

[02:15:34] Yeah, the gambling thing bit them was the bug that bit them too.

[02:15:38] You know, I think that the management really didn't want to do pinball anymore.

[02:15:43] They wanted to make slot machines.

[02:15:45] Yeah, but I mean, as long as you made money with pinball,

[02:15:48] it's like, you know, if they were losing money,

[02:15:51] I could see getting out pinball, but if they were actually making money,

[02:15:55] it's probably something that they should have maybe continued.

[02:16:04] But, you know, I can't be real objective about the decision because I like pinball, you know.

[02:16:11] Right.

[02:16:12] It's, you know, Williams did a lot of expenses on their games.

[02:16:20] We're developing on games, compared to the other companies,

[02:16:23] the way that they set it up, where the, yeah, several teams were coming games.

[02:16:27] And they had a lot of time to do each game.

[02:16:29] So it must have cost them a lot of money to, you know, to go up each game because of that.

[02:16:37] But they could have, in my opinion, maybe streamlined,

[02:16:40] if there were certain to lose a little bit of money,

[02:16:42] or not make as much as they have been in previous years,

[02:16:45] they could have maybe streamlined it a little bit and cut back and been profitable again.

[02:16:51] But, you know, I really don't know.

[02:16:53] Since I don't know, yeah, look at the books, I really don't know.

[02:16:56] I think back at pinball 2000, yeah, it was a pretty cool concept.

[02:17:00] But, I think that it was more of a kind of more of a boarded-on novelty.

[02:17:06] And, which is probably really good for certain locations,

[02:17:10] where the players aren't really, you know, die-hard pinball players.

[02:17:17] And they basically were video game players crossing over to pinball.

[02:17:22] So, you know, because you can have the superior graphics and video graphics on the pinball 2000 platform,

[02:17:30] that can be part of the experience of playing the game that you can't with traditional pinball.

[02:17:36] Well, the speaking of which, like, if you were going to,

[02:17:40] if you could have like a little time machine and go back in time,

[02:17:45] would you want to be a designer in any particular era, like, you know,

[02:17:50] a game designer in the pre-flip era, in the Woodrail era, in the 60s era,

[02:17:54] in the 70s EM era, or early solid states, or, you know, classic dot matrix,

[02:18:01] or pinball 2000.

[02:18:03] I mean, if you had an era that you could pick the design in, what would it be?

[02:18:10] Well, I really like games from, you know, as a player, from the games from the 50s on forward.

[02:18:18] But really, I would pick solid state era because there's so much more you can do with the games in the solid state era.

[02:18:28] You know, you're not limited to, you know, the cost of putting in extra rely in to make this feature,

[02:18:36] where you just a little bit more programming to make the feature.

[02:18:40] So you can really put more features in a game, you know, from, you know, the solid state era on.

[02:18:48] And, but I see I'm really as far as the players concerned, I really enjoy games from the early 50s all the way to the present day.

[02:19:01] I don't know if I really have one favorite era over another, but there are certain things that amaze me,

[02:19:10] what the designers were able to do, like, playing nines, who had just a set amount of relays to put on in a couple of step switches.

[02:19:23] And the limitations are basically a flat play field and make a really fun game.

[02:19:29] Yeah, and speaking of which, I mean, did you think, you know, like, take a game from the 50s and its play appeal?

[02:19:36] Did you think that, you know, that a lot of that was maybe lost this time marched on, or do you think that games really just evolved and did get better as time went?

[02:19:48] I think that the time went on the games evolved with respect to entertaining and entertaining the player.

[02:20:04] And, of course, the license is what didn't exist in those days.

[02:20:12] As far as gameplay itself, you know, if I had, basically, if I, you know, when I start my collection again some day, I'm not going to have a very mixed collection for eras.

[02:20:29] I'm going to have a few 50s, a few 60s, a few 70s, a few 80s, a few 90s, and so on.

[02:20:38] I just think that has time went on that the game changed and evolved to be, to appeal to a different kind of player.

[02:20:49] And, you know, I think I said, so, grievously is that I think that a lot of the new games coming out in the last 10 years or so are really oriented to be designed towards baby boomers.

[02:21:03] Especially with a lot of the things that not all of them, because there are some themes that have come out in the last five years or so that weren't.

[02:21:15] Yeah, like Lord of the Rings or Simpsons or something, right?

[02:21:19] Yeah, even even of Simpsons, you know, Simpsons has been around for 20 years, maybe not baby boomers, but then I don't think the Simpsons really appeals to the 15 maybe because it's an animated shuttle, but I don't think it really appeals that much to the traditional pinball demographic aid group.

[02:21:47] Yeah, I got Lord of the Rings and maybe Roller to the Coast of Tycoon and some of those, but then I guess there are some titles like Monopoly that appeal to everybody.

[02:21:58] So I can't say all, but there are a lot in there that are basically, it looks like, you know, okay, it's something that people who are my age would really like to theme.

[02:22:10] You know, I was a designer, we were making games that tried to appeal to a different demographics and then I see today.

[02:22:19] Well, speaking of which, like games from the 50s, I mean, do you think that the attraction or at least the initial attraction was the artwork or do you think it was the gameplay or a little bit of both and as time progressed, did those things change to where the artwork became less important and the gameplay became more important or vice versa?

[02:22:39] Well, I think the artwork is always critical importance, especially in getting that first impulse player to try it once.

[02:22:48] I mean, it's, I was so disappointed on a couple of my games. I thought I had interior artwork because I thought that, you know, you don't even get that first quarter in the machine.

[02:22:59] Well, what games did you have that you didn't like the artwork?

[02:23:03] I did not like the artwork on Jacketack.

[02:23:06] Right.

[02:23:07] And I really didn't like the other than the play field, I didn't like the artwork on Vegas.

[02:23:13] Right.

[02:23:14] And I think that after you get that first quarter in the game or, you know, the first play, then the game holds, then the play field, the design of the game.

[02:23:26] And the steps holds on that point. The artwork is if they had fun on the game and they like playing the game, they'll play it again.

[02:23:32] But, you know, to get that person to play that for that game for that one time, then the best example is even a good license.

[02:23:40] Our number one working at Sega, SashStorm and we came out with South Park is that when we put that on location, I saw a lot of people playing that game.

[02:23:53] Because of the theme and the artwork, that only would never play a come ball machine.

[02:23:57] Right.

[02:23:58] And then if they really had enjoyed the game, then they'll come back and play it again.

[02:24:02] And ironically, you might, that might be recruiting new pinball players.

[02:24:06] So that's the ultimate thing is you give people who wouldn't play pinball to try it.

[02:24:10] And then they become a pinball fix you not, oh, and they'll play future models.

[02:24:15] It's like building a new, you know, building the next generation of players is really dependent on theme and artwork.

[02:24:22] If you see how we're on coming from there, you know, they really enjoyed the game and they got their money's worked out the game and they want to play it again.

[02:24:35] And they might try pinball again.

[02:24:37] Oh, okay, I really don't like that game. Let's try this one too, you know.

[02:24:42] And that's what my thoughts is.

[02:24:46] The artwork gets the first play in the game.

[02:24:51] It keeps them coming back.

[02:24:53] Well, was there anything in the 50s of the Woodrail era that you felt was really the key draw, the key, you know, either the artwork or the design or the multiple, you know, ways to win specials?

[02:25:06] Or was there anything in the 50s you thought that was particularly unique or do you think it was just, you know, right time, right place?

[02:25:15] Well, I think that at the time, you know, obviously you didn't have the big licenses, but then if you look at the themes of the games, they were popular themes like things in the 50s, westerns and space and things that were popular in the 50s were on the games.

[02:25:35] So maybe they didn't have that movie license or TV show tie in, but they were things that people could identify with popular themes.

[02:25:45] So I think that among those lines, it was the same thing where it's a, you know, you're, you have the, you know, split Nick going up in the space race and next to you know in the late 50s and early 60s, you have all these space games.

[02:26:01] It must have been in three or four years, there must have been a half a dozen space team games come out.

[02:26:07] And in these videos, true, you know, through, and then in the late 60s or early 70s, all these hippies, psychedelic kind of themes coming out.

[02:26:19] So they were always trying to tie in to pop the popular culture with the themes of the games, right?

[02:26:26] Whether it was the 50s, 60s or up until up until the up value wizard when the licenses were established on pinball games.

[02:26:35] Right.

[02:26:36] You know, prior to that, you still saw popular themes on games.

[02:26:39] And again, you know, that's trying to get that first play on the game.

[02:26:43] Did you ever try and get a, you know, or encourage any of the people that you work for to get a particular license, something that you wanted to, you know, to work on?

[02:26:53] I asked for a couple and never got any. I asked for monopoly early on.

[02:27:00] I asked for...

[02:27:04] Let's see.

[02:27:06] When you asked for monopoly, was that with Godleiber with Sega Stern?

[02:27:10] That was with Godleiber.

[02:27:12] It was too expensive.

[02:27:15] All they thought it was going to be too expensive and they didn't look into it. I don't know. We didn't get that.

[02:27:20] With, with Sega Stern, Jill Camenco, as his department, he got all the licenses and he's the best in the industry.

[02:27:27] He's doing that, so I never even tried. Jill has always wanted to step ahead.

[02:27:31] You know, one or two, move the head of everybody and you always got the best licenses.

[02:27:38] But back at Godly, there were a couple I asked for and I, the only one that I knew that I asked for that initially God was when we had the second Nintendo license and I asked for the Legend of Zelda after evaluating several of the licenses.

[02:27:56] There were license properties and I had started on the game and then we got the American gladiators and that's what push I will already talk about.

[02:28:08] That was kind of one that I kind of asked for but I had a narrow range of juice from.

[02:28:16] Most of the other ones were basically the marketing department got and we were told that we're going to do this game and they saw which designer had the most interest in that license and that designer got the game.

[02:28:32] That was the way that I company operated.

[02:28:41] Okay, well cool, John, is there anything else that you know you want to throw out there?

[02:28:47] Not that I can think of right now, I'm probably thinking of something later but it's too late.

[02:28:53] All that I have to say is that I love being in the industry all those years and is the best years of my life and I really miss being in Pimbal.

[02:29:05] I'm going to the next stage, I'm a graduate student right now and I'm going back to school with my master of finance degree and hopefully I can start over and then have the career after I get my degree.

[02:29:17] Maybe Pimbal will come back and I'll be able to get back in the Pimbal.

[02:29:21] Hopefully the latter happens but if not I have my self-covered degree.

[02:29:30] Right. Well cool, I really do appreciate you coming on and talking to us about it is a great interview.

[02:29:38] Great, great interview, great, I really appreciate it.

[02:29:40] Thanks, please. Good luck with the interview and I always want to talk to Pimbal.

[02:29:47] Okay.

[02:29:49] I'd like to thank John Norris for joining us tonight on Topcast for really appreciate his time and I hope you all come back and hear us again on Topcast,
