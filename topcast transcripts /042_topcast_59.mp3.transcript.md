[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast celebrity voice impersonated.

[00:22] Tonight on Topcast we have a gentleman that is a voice actor.

[00:26] That is somebody that does voice recordings for many of the pinball companies.

[00:31] And situations where a pinball company would need a new voice,

[00:36] something innovative and different,

[00:39] or maybe somebody to simulate an actor, a famous actor's voice.

[00:45] This guy is the man that does that.

[00:48] And he's done it for about 50 different coin-operated games in his career.

[00:56] Special guest.

[01:01] I'd like to welcome Fred Young to Topcast tonight.

[01:05] He's a voice actor like I was saying.

[01:08] He's done about 50 different coin-operated games.

[01:11] All the Alvin G pinball games had Fred Young as the voices.

[01:18] And many of the Dede East Sega and Stern pinballs also used Fred Young

[01:24] for many of the voices in their games too.

[01:28] And these aren't just unique voices, different voices.

[01:31] They're also voices of famous actors say they went into a recording session

[01:36] and they forgot a line from the famous actor that they were dealing with.

[01:40] And they couldn't get them back to do that line over.

[01:44] They'll call in Fred Young to take over that chore so that they can get the game out

[01:49] with the voice call that they need.

[01:52] And we're going to give Fred Young a call right now here on Topcast

[01:56] and see how he's doing and talk to him about some of the games he's done.

[01:59] Hello.

[02:10] Fred?

[02:11] Yeah, this is me.

[02:13] Fred, it's Clay. How are you?

[02:14] Hello Clay. How are you?

[02:16] Glad to shoot.

[02:17] Okay, so tell me, like, one thing I read about you is that you had some sort of like

[02:22] tonsillitis operation and that had some, when you were seven years old or something?

[02:27] That's right. I've been doing voices since I was seven years old.

[02:30] That's absolutely true.

[02:32] And so what happened like when you were seven and you had this tonsillitis thing?

[02:37] Did that, was that like something that actually changed your vocal cords?

[02:41] Okay. Shall we go back?

[02:44] Yeah.

[02:45] 1957. This is what happened.

[02:50] Now I don't know how it happened with other people.

[02:53] They'll get me wrong.

[02:55] But this is what happened to me.

[02:58] Okay?

[02:59] I had the worst tonsillitis that the world has ever dealt.

[03:06] I had poisonous toxic tonsils.

[03:09] Not only were they toxic, but they were killing me.

[03:14] And I remember forget this.

[03:17] I mean, it got to be ridiculous.

[03:19] I mean, I'm missing school.

[03:21] You know, it just horrible.

[03:23] And finally the doctor sent me to a throat surgeon.

[03:27] And I'll never forget this.

[03:29] And he says, okay, open your mouth.

[03:31] And he took one look and he said, oh, brother.

[03:35] Now, that was scared.

[03:37] I kept seven years old.

[03:38] I was going to say, was I doing any voices at that time?

[03:41] Yeah, I was only doing one.

[03:43] And that one happened to be Donald Duck.

[03:46] Believe it or not.

[03:47] Yeah.

[03:48] And he said, oh, brother.

[03:50] And he said, let me just tell you something.

[03:53] Those tonsils have to go.

[03:55] And he said, oh, my God, I have to go.

[03:58] I said, well, he says, let me put it here this way.

[04:01] I'll never forget this either.

[04:03] Either they go or you do.

[04:06] What?

[04:07] Yeah, it's poisoning your bloodstream.

[04:10] It's poisoning your blood and everything.

[04:12] And then just to give you a bigger perspective on that,

[04:17] you remember the Bixby the actor.

[04:19] Yes, yes.

[04:20] And he was made to bend the bane.

[04:23] And they had a son.

[04:25] They had a son.

[04:27] And they're all gone, by the way.

[04:29] God rest her soul.

[04:30] Anyway, use literally what I found out that her son had plays

[04:35] in the toxic tonsils and he died.

[04:39] Yeah, they gave me a real big perspective.

[04:42] This is what happened.

[04:43] They're going to do.

[04:44] Oh, my God.

[04:45] Okay.

[04:46] So now I'm going to go in and have a ton of select to me.

[04:50] So they did the tonsil.

[04:53] Now they have lasers and everything.

[04:55] Even now my, my, you know, is a throat doctor.

[04:58] He said, well, they got rid of them.

[04:59] Not with laser, but remember, I had to be able to eat all their ice cream

[05:02] in the world afterwards.

[05:04] Right. Right.

[05:05] So they got it out and they took out my adenoids also.

[05:08] If there was a two-foot one, say on that day, you know what I mean?

[05:10] Like, yeah.

[05:11] And they took out my adenoids.

[05:14] And then that was the day that changed my life forever.

[05:18] But I didn't know what was going to happen.

[05:21] One day I'm watching the old Huckleberry Hound show, Hannah By Bear.

[05:25] And I started talking with Huckleberry Hound's voice.

[05:29] And that's starting it all.

[05:31] Could I do down and duck anymore?

[05:33] No, they took out my adenoids for some strange reason.

[05:37] After the operation, I couldn't do, I kept sneezing his voice

[05:41] and tried to admit, I couldn't even see it anymore in that voice.

[05:45] But all of a sudden this happened.

[05:48] And I thought nothing of it.

[05:50] And then like taking a penny and doubling it every day, all of a sudden,

[05:53] all of a sudden, other things started to happen.

[05:56] But it changed my vocal cords.

[05:58] I don't know, but I'll tell you something.

[06:01] I don't think I could have, I could do what I do without that happening.

[06:05] I mean, I was seven years old.

[06:07] Huh.

[06:08] Yeah?

[06:09] Yeah.

[06:10] Strange.

[06:11] I mean, all of a sudden.

[06:12] All of a sudden, you know.

[06:15] And then it got crazier and crazier.

[06:18] Right.

[06:19] Yeah, I mean, at that time, I had mine out probably when I was seven years old.

[06:22] I was a little younger than you, but it didn't affect my voice that I know of.

[06:31] But boy, I treated something to me, I'll tell you.

[06:34] Yeah.

[06:35] Yeah.

[06:36] I don't know.

[06:37] I don't know.

[06:38] I couldn't talk for a long time.

[06:39] And I was spearing up, you know.

[06:41] Now there's a more mild with lasers and things.

[06:45] And I don't know.

[06:46] Did you have to eat all the ice cream in the world because I was all swollen?

[06:49] Yes.

[06:50] Yes, I do remember that.

[06:51] Yeah.

[06:52] And boy, I was a pain.

[06:53] I was bleeding and all of a sudden.

[06:57] And then that's exactly what happened.

[06:59] I'll never forget that because before I couldn't do anything.

[07:03] And this is before any type of voice changing, you know, as you're growing older, any kind of voice changing

[07:08] which normal vocal chords happened.

[07:10] Right.

[07:11] So this was like a precursor.

[07:13] You know, and I never thought anything of it.

[07:15] I said, well, big deal.

[07:18] At that time, you know.

[07:20] Right.

[07:21] But then I started to then things started to do other things and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[07:26] Well, like what was like the first event changing voice that you did?

[07:31] Well, I started doing, okay, first we did Huckleberry Hound.

[07:34] And then all of a sudden I started doing Yogi Beer.

[07:36] Then I started doing Boo Boo.

[07:38] Then I started doing Ranger Smith.

[07:39] Then I started doing, I mean, it started all of a sudden, I'm doing quick, I'm doing quick trauma grime.

[07:44] I was doing all those buttons, voices all of a sudden.

[07:49] And then after that happened, then all of a sudden, and this is by the way, this is way before you in the seventh or eighth grade.

[07:57] So for the time I'm, you know, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I'm doing all of the Hannah by Boo Boo's voices.

[08:04] It's basically done, messic, and I was about to run very big fans of it.

[08:08] Now, then it got crazier and crazier.

[08:11] So you're saying, what was the next thing?

[08:13] I started to imitate the teachers.

[08:16] Huh.

[08:17] You mean that one over real big, let me tell you something.

[08:20] Yeah, you mean in your classes?

[08:21] Oh yeah.

[08:22] In How Old Were You?

[08:24] What, Pymie?

[08:25] How old were you?

[08:26] Oh God.

[08:27] Well, that was, then we got into high school.

[08:30] Then we're in high school already.

[08:32] And, uh, let's see, fourteen, fifteen.

[08:37] But one of my cousins remarked, because I was showing these voices, look, at eleven, twelve years old, you can do all these things.

[08:44] It's amazing.

[08:45] And I didn't still think anything of it.

[08:47] But then I started to imitate the teachers.

[08:50] And the teacher, you know, you know, it's on the website.

[08:53] But I had that question, they asked me a question, I answered them in their voice.

[08:59] And they didn't pick up on it, like, with a laugh, you know, all of a sudden.

[09:02] Hey, you know, but I didn't want, when I was in the eighth grade, this friend of mine, let's just show you.

[09:08] The jealousy, you know, you're going to lose your identity by doing this.

[09:14] And I've yet to lose my identity.

[09:17] Yeah, you're going to lose your identity.

[09:19] I said, why don't I, because I could do these things.

[09:22] Why don't I lose my identity and claim it the father's somebody?

[09:26] You know, you know, and he was just jealous that he couldn't do it.

[09:31] I said, let's see you do it.

[09:32] And he couldn't do it.

[09:33] And I thought, and I thought, I reached a point where I said, well, anybody can do this.

[09:38] And then years later, when you finally start studying, getting serious about specific things, you find out that's not the case.

[09:46] And when you graduated high school, did you, I assume you went to college, right?

[09:50] Yes.

[09:51] And what did you graduate in?

[09:53] Okay. I graduated from, well, you're really well in all of this stuff, huh?

[09:57] Yeah, yeah.

[09:58] You're readers are interested, huh?

[10:00] So everyone's got blackmail on me, huh?

[10:02] Yeah.

[10:03] I graduated from Bonsdupet High School in Chicago.

[10:06] And then I was broke, so I went to, uh, white junior college.

[10:13] And I graduated there.

[10:16] And then I went to, well, I was accepted to all the universities right in Northern and Southern.

[10:22] Oh, the Paul, you know, Roosevelt University.

[10:25] So I decided, I want to scholarship.

[10:28] And then by the way, this has nothing to do with show business.

[10:31] This has nothing to do with voices, nothing to do with anything.

[10:34] Because in high school, I would show them that I could do Jerry Lewis, you know, and all this stuff.

[10:40] But no, I never did a play in high school, believe you're going to say you're kidding.

[10:44] Honestly, I never did a play in high school.

[10:47] They said they didn't want me.

[10:49] I don't talent.

[10:51] Oh, my God.

[10:53] And I kept the kind of, kind of low-key.

[10:56] I don't want people to think I was weird.

[10:57] Right.

[10:58] But I mean, but I could imitate the assistant principal one time.

[11:01] Somebody called up there.

[11:02] They have these intercom systems in the school.

[11:03] You know what I mean?

[11:04] Yeah.

[11:05] And I ended up imitating the assistant principal.

[11:09] Yeah.

[11:10] Yeah.

[11:11] Of course, they pulled me downstairs.

[11:12] You know, they couldn't prove anything.

[11:14] You know, because I wouldn't doubt, how can anyone do that?

[11:17] You know, I think in ignorance.

[11:20] But once I write you in your college, I want a scholarship.

[11:23] I finished up at Roosevelt University.

[11:26] So I got my general certificate.

[11:27] I got my AA.

[11:29] And I got my BSBA.

[11:31] And at that time, I was so overqualified.

[11:33] If I went from a master's degree, I'd be aware of a qualified.

[11:37] So all these degrees were in just general business degrees, right?

[11:41] Well, as a business management, and I'm mitered of math.

[11:43] Sure.

[11:44] Okay.

[11:45] Okay.

[11:46] So nothing to do with voices.

[11:47] No.

[11:48] Absolutely nothing.

[11:49] Nothing to do with voices whatsoever.

[11:52] I was the furthest, because you see, I want to be a normal, everyday person.

[12:00] And I just didn't work out.

[12:03] And just didn't, you know how you're saying, there's a higher calling for everyone,

[12:08] but you don't know where that calling is and how it's going to happen, everything.

[12:11] Well, I tried to be an ordinary schmo, and it just didn't work out.

[12:16] And, oh my god.

[12:19] No.

[12:20] Let's get a couple of facts straight here.

[12:22] First of all, no.

[12:23] Just want you to know, and for all the listeners and everybody, no.

[12:28] I don't drink.

[12:29] I don't smoke.

[12:30] I don't do drugs.

[12:32] I'm not gay.

[12:33] I know that would make a lot of interesting situations.

[12:36] No.

[12:37] They'll have to make something up about me in the National Aquire.

[12:39] I don't know.

[12:40] Whatever.

[12:41] So I get bad.

[12:42] I don't even get bad, either way.

[12:43] But no.

[12:44] This had absolutely nothing to do with any of this stuff.

[12:47] Nothing.

[12:48] And I was also working.

[12:51] I was the manager of a watch store.

[12:53] Watch repair, and I was handling a lot of accounts and everything.

[12:58] But one time, I started to imitate the owner of the store.

[13:02] And they actually bought it with me.

[13:04] And that went over very big.

[13:06] But that was pretty funny.

[13:08] Okay.

[13:10] So after that, after a while, I actually believe it or not.

[13:14] I know you're going to start.

[13:16] This is going to start.

[13:17] I actually want to work for an insurance company.

[13:20] Doing what?

[13:21] Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

[13:23] Doing what?

[13:24] What?

[13:26] Well, this was 1978.

[13:28] And I wanted to be a ordinary person.

[13:32] You know, you're trying to...

[13:35] And I said, okay, no more voice.

[13:41] I'm a ordinary person.

[13:42] So I was...

[13:44] There were no longer any existence.

[13:46] I was...

[13:47] I was interviewing.

[13:48] It took me about a month to get it.

[13:50] It's called a watch communicator.

[13:52] It's a wide area telephone service.

[13:55] When you get the incoming calls and everything.

[13:57] Right.

[13:58] That is for the Montgomery Words Insurance Company.

[14:00] So I got a job with the Montgomery Words Insurance Company.

[14:04] But before...

[14:05] Remember, I said, don't know a voice.

[14:06] But before I could get the job, I was trying to take it a physical.

[14:10] I didn't love this.

[14:11] You ready, Clay?

[14:12] Yeah.

[14:13] They wanted to hear how I sounded over the phone.

[14:16] Oh, brother.

[14:18] I say, here we go again.

[14:20] So then, I know you're loving this.

[14:23] I'm sure you're loving this whole thing.

[14:26] What did you do?

[14:27] Like, 14?

[14:28] Exactly.

[14:29] I'm over the interviewing and he wanted to hear.

[14:31] And I'm there.

[14:32] Now, you know, I've got my degrees.

[14:34] You know, I'm not a stupid person.

[14:35] You know, I could...

[14:36] Because I'd have to know these policies.

[14:38] You know, the actual debt.

[14:40] This member in policy, all these writers and term lives and all of life.

[14:45] And there's all this stuff and people would be calling up.

[14:47] They ask in question because that's how they got people.

[14:49] To go on this, they had a hot, a real-come thing.

[14:52] And it worked on them.

[14:54] It was going to reach credit card.

[14:56] And you wanted to know how I sounded over the phone.

[15:00] So what I did was, are you ready?

[15:03] Over there, I'm on a phone and he's on a phone.

[15:09] And I turned on one of my announcer voices.

[15:12] So, this is the voice I normally talk with, okay?

[15:17] Now, you can imagine.

[15:19] He said, let me hear how you sound.

[15:21] So all of a sudden, he started hearing this voice.

[15:24] Well, this is how I'm actually talking right now.

[15:27] And I want you to know that it's a pleasure to be here working for your company.

[15:31] So that's fine, Fred. That's a box.

[15:34] So he didn't get it.

[15:36] You know, that it's wonderful to be here.

[15:39] Now, he gets off the phone.

[15:41] He says, in the next slide, I had a bite my lip to keep them laughing.

[15:45] I'm ready with the guy said.

[15:46] Wait, so he wasn't getting it then.

[15:48] Oh, yeah, he was, he was, he was, wait.

[15:51] I'm talking like this.

[15:52] And all of a sudden, I'm doing one of my announcer voices, all right?

[15:55] So all of a sudden, he says, you know, Fred, you have a different voice when you talk on the phone.

[16:02] Yeah, I said, oh, isn't that interesting?

[16:05] Isn't that amazing?

[16:07] You have a different voice when you talk on the phone.

[16:10] I said, hey, how about that?

[16:13] So he liked the announcer voice.

[16:15] Bravo, bra, bra.

[16:16] And then, then, remember, I'm going to be an honorary person.

[16:22] Remember that? Yeah, I'm going to be an honorary person, sure.

[16:24] All of a sudden, you see, at that time, they really didn't have like,

[16:29] where we have the digital stuff today or they have the voice mail.

[16:32] When they shut off the phones, they'll be like, recording.

[16:36] So, before, before I went to them, I also really suggested that I tried to do it.

[16:41] I suggested that I try going into radio.

[16:44] So what I did with that took a course, which is the school's long-winded existence for a mega-state institute,

[16:50] where I would train to pass the FCC license.

[16:53] So I had my FCC license, first class.

[16:57] First class, I had that.

[17:00] So I had that in my arsenal, personal portfolio, and I was like, pass the classes and everything.

[17:07] So now I'm working at this place.

[17:09] So they found that I had an FCC license.

[17:11] So right away, well, since you've got an FCC license, you can record the outgoing message for the company.

[17:19] Oh, I said, I looked up in the sky and said, I wanted to get an order,

[17:24] I'm going to start with the honorary person, I wanted to get away, I wanted to get away from this,

[17:28] and I'm back doing the same thing all over again.

[17:30] You see how things shift back into the focus?

[17:32] Yeah, you can't escape it.

[17:34] No, you can't. You can't escape.

[17:36] So now I said, well, you know, this is like a little dictophone thing.

[17:42] And you have to flip the switch to record.

[17:45] So that's what I did, I flipped the switch to record.

[17:47] Now the vice president of this insurance company, Absorbed me, he says, that's 23 seconds.

[17:53] How did you happen to do that so perfectly?

[17:55] I said, 25 years experience. Now, I'm back the way.

[18:01] You were 25 years old?

[18:03] That on the outgoing message, on the outgoing, when they close down, they call up an 800 number,

[18:09] and they use that on the outgoing message.

[18:12] So then I was working there from whatever, and then I'd go upstairs, and I'd be coding policies,

[18:19] which is how insurance companies code their policies out.

[18:23] So they thought they were going to groom me for one of the executive positions.

[18:27] But literally that I know was about to happen.

[18:30] Needless to say, somebody knew somebody at this radio show called Audio Jam.

[18:36] It was a very fine person, Steve Hart.

[18:39] And I called him up, and he was an eventualer crystal.

[18:42] He had this show every Sunday on National Public Radio and WBZ here, locally.

[18:48] And he said, I'd like to talk to you and blah, blah, blah.

[18:51] And they all found out, and I was kind of frustrated this time.

[18:55] I don't know what I'm supposed to do, I don't know what the situation is.

[18:58] So he basically ran and met him.

[19:04] And he said, how would you like to be on my show?

[19:08] And at the front of the night, I tried to interview with this radio state.

[19:12] Then we didn't give him the time to do it, and then he met me.

[19:15] And then the stationer says, well, he can do that, and he's got a job here, whatever.

[19:19] Which wasn't really just every single Sunday.

[19:23] And it was a lot of fun, and I did voice calls, and I had a characterizations on the show with the federal individual.

[19:28] And it was just fun, but I still was working at the insurance company.

[19:33] Then I was talking to somebody else, because maybe I'm crazy that I had this ability, and they said, where you do, and why are you working for an insurance company?

[19:41] The world is your playground.

[19:43] I said, you know, yeah, the world's my playground, but I stopped to pay the radio.

[19:46] I got to make money here.

[19:49] So you know, it was survival, you know.

[19:52] So, from that point, so now I'm on idol drama and everything, okay, fine.

[19:58] And I am really, really frustrated.

[20:01] For some reason, I'm frustrated with that, well, the girl I was going with time, she made a couple of bad statements.

[20:10] I got very angry.

[20:12] I suppose you want to know what that is.

[20:14] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

[20:15] Now, this is terrible.

[20:17] You never ever let somebody tear you apart for no reason because you have tell.

[20:22] But I want you to know, let me back up back in 1975.

[20:26] I called up one of my other friends.

[20:28] I've known in high school, and she's crying, and this is all true.

[20:32] And she said, and I said, what's the matter?

[20:35] And she's got to do this massacres degree thesis, and she doesn't know what she's going to do.

[20:40] And she said, what happened to say?

[20:42] Well, I don't know.

[20:44] I just called up and said, hey, what about Pradin or something?

[20:47] I said, well, how would you like the head of the Sesame Street characters to teach the kids in the class on a little cassette?

[20:58] And she said, hey, that's a great idea.

[21:03] I said, yeah, where am I going to get the voices?

[21:05] And then I said, well, I have a secret to tell you.

[21:07] I can do those voices.

[21:10] I was dead silence on the phone.

[21:14] So I said, you don't believe me, do you?

[21:16] So you turn, I got a party, said, yeah.

[21:19] And people try to do voices.

[21:22] I said, yeah, they don't sound any different.

[21:24] I said, would you like a little demonstration?

[21:27] So then I showed her, and I said, wow, this is fantastic.

[21:30] But the time in 1975, I was standing up at a wedding.

[21:35] And I didn't have time for this nonsense.

[21:38] And then from there, when I got the job of the insurance company,

[21:42] and then from there, with this radio thing on the weekend,

[21:46] so basically, what happened was it was like a transition.

[21:50] But I, all of a sudden, now I'm doing stuff.

[21:53] And she's writing scripts for the kids.

[21:55] And the kids are all going crazy.

[21:57] And I became part of her master's degree thesis.

[22:00] So I am part of this individual's master's degree thesis.

[22:03] And we call it psychological behavior

[22:05] is for external stimulation to teach children.

[22:08] And it worked fine.

[22:09] I actually came up with the talking story,

[22:11] but to that I should have, I should have copyrighted her something.

[22:14] Yeah, you should have.

[22:15] Yeah, I should have.

[22:16] But okay, okay.

[22:17] Well, we know.

[22:18] Yeah, well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[22:19] What happened to her?

[22:20] Did she, you know,

[22:21] I know her very well.

[22:23] I talked to her.

[22:26] I know her over 40 years since 1968.

[22:30] And I met in the type in class.

[22:31] What happened to her?

[22:32] She's still, I talked to everybody.

[22:34] Unfortunately, she's having some trauma right now.

[22:37] I'm not going to go into that.

[22:38] We talked to everybody.

[22:40] And I've been at her wedding.

[22:44] Or weddings, as we say.

[22:46] Yeah.

[22:47] And we talk.

[22:49] We talk a lot.

[22:50] And it did come up at one time.

[22:51] And some little boys out can't be trusted.

[22:54] No, I said, ask her.

[22:55] Is everything is true?

[22:56] Let me tell you, everything is true.

[22:57] And she said,

[22:58] which was getting her masters in psychology.

[23:01] And I read her thesis.

[23:03] And she said, if it wasn't for you,

[23:06] I wouldn't have gotten this masters.

[23:07] And I would have wanted to drag you up on the stages

[23:09] and receiving my degree with you.

[23:11] I thought that was kind of nice.

[23:13] Yeah.

[23:14] And getting back.

[23:15] Okay.

[23:16] So now I'm in this radio show.

[23:17] Okay, fine.

[23:18] But the world, though.

[23:19] So now I'm talking to a few people.

[23:20] And now I'm in this radio show.

[23:22] And I'm frustrated.

[23:23] Boy, I got a good idea.

[23:24] You got a good idea.

[23:25] What is it?

[23:26] Why don't you have your own radio show?

[23:28] So I wrote, produced, and stared in my own radio show.

[23:33] Because I know that you've been through.

[23:35] If you're producing and writing a new radio show,

[23:38] if a lot of hard work isn't it?

[23:40] Yeah.

[23:41] Yeah.

[23:42] And here you're doing it.

[23:43] But you were doing a lot more than I'm doing.

[23:45] Well, I'll tell you what the name of the show was.

[23:47] It was called, and I was trying to find a word.

[23:49] Because I wanted to do science fiction, science fact,

[23:52] or infranously, because I really enjoyed it.

[23:54] I really enjoyed that.

[23:55] And I said, well, if I enjoyed, other people enjoyed it too.

[23:59] And I was right.

[24:00] Well, better than I was.

[24:02] So I came up with a call that I finally found the answer.

[24:07] It's called, fantasy world.

[24:08] I did fantasy world with Fred Young.

[24:11] And we did that.

[24:12] I ran for 13 weeks.

[24:14] And we had a lot of fun.

[24:15] And we taught me a lot of things.

[24:16] The boy was at rough.

[24:18] I mean, it was tough to write a show every week.

[24:20] It was just one day a week.

[24:21] So what these guys go through on the year, writing like the

[24:24] tonight's where I was in the land, or what they go through my

[24:26] God.

[24:27] I mean, so much hard work.

[24:28] But it taught me a lot of things.

[24:30] And then I decided, you know, hey, I'm going to tell my

[24:34] mom about that.

[24:35] I think maybe I should study acting.

[24:38] And instead of saying forget it or no, even my friends, instead of

[24:44] saying forget it or no, they said, well, it's about time.

[24:47] Oh, my God.

[24:49] There's a lot of time.

[24:51] Because they saw all this stuff coming out.

[24:53] And you know what I mean?

[24:54] Right.

[24:55] And I said, aren't you saying no, forget about it?

[24:58] No!

[24:59] No!

[25:00] No, not at all.

[25:02] Not at all.

[25:03] Anyway, at the time, I wanted to sort of take a leave of that

[25:07] from the insurance company.

[25:09] I was seeing this girl and there was a couple of bad comments.

[25:12] And I'm going to tell the comment that was made.

[25:14] I swear to you, this is the truth.

[25:16] All of a sudden, out of the blue, this individual who I was seeing for about a year,

[25:21] said to me, and I quote, you're not going to like this.

[25:28] Never let anyone tell you about it.

[25:31] I don't like your voices.

[25:34] And this was 1978, and I happened to be with it.

[25:38] And I happened to see a commercial on me and I said, you know,

[25:40] I can do that just as good as this person.

[25:42] And she made a nice kind of, quick fantasizing.

[25:45] You're never going to do anything.

[25:47] Isn't that nice?

[25:49] Yeah, yeah.

[25:50] It's a sweetheart of a comment.

[25:51] A sweetheart, yeah.

[25:52] And then, I'm on the phone with her for whatever reason.

[25:55] And I don't like your voices.

[25:58] I said, why not?

[25:59] Because it's too unique of a talent.

[26:02] Unquote, which is redundant statement.

[26:05] And then she had to mention because I've been paid a piano.

[26:07] I don't like your piano play.

[26:09] I said, why not?

[26:10] Because anybody can pay the piano.

[26:12] Hey, so what do you do that's so great besides telling me?

[26:14] You're putting me down.

[26:16] Oh my God.

[26:18] And oh, whether we're getting married,

[26:20] or you have beautiful dreamer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

[26:23] Everything was negative.

[26:24] Everything was, how much money you got in the bank?

[26:27] I mentioned her amount.

[26:28] I never had that amount before in your life.

[26:31] All right, then finally, then this is terrible.

[26:34] I know you could, I know you could try this away.

[26:36] And this is just terrible.

[26:37] All right, tell me when you're going to call me again.

[26:39] So I can get you off the phone.

[26:41] Yeah, so we did the Mickey Mouse routine with that.

[26:44] Now it's time to say goodbye.

[26:46] Right, right.

[26:47] So the thing is,

[26:49] 12, and then I can't understand why I haven't heard from friends

[26:53] such a long time.

[26:55] Yeah, you run, you get your car run to another country.

[27:01] Oh, wow.

[27:02] Yeah, terrible, terrible.

[27:04] But nobody else said they did that.

[27:06] Well, what happened with the acting classes?

[27:08] What did you say?

[27:09] What happened with the acting classes?

[27:11] I'm going to go into that.

[27:12] I'm getting to that right now.

[27:13] Okay.

[27:14] Anyway, I saw an ad in the audition news one day.

[27:19] And I'm frustrated.

[27:20] I don't know what, you know, I'm frustrated.

[27:22] So I called up, and I had my radio show on the air.

[27:24] This is now 19.

[27:26] It's got to be 1979.

[27:28] And I had my radio show on here,

[27:30] and I called up a TV actor studio here.

[27:33] And I said, listen, this is Fred Young,

[27:36] and I have a radio show.

[27:37] And I have a radio show.

[27:38] Yes, we heard you radio show here on Evanston, WPN.

[27:42] I said, yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:44] I see here you teach on camera classes, acting, you know.

[27:50] Have you ever been in a business before?

[27:53] I said, no, I know his radio.

[27:54] I know his voice is a radio.

[27:56] And I did have a terrible demo tape at that time, but whatever.

[27:59] So we'll come on, listen, come on down town.

[28:02] We want to talk to you.

[28:04] So I came to us and said, all right, what do I do?

[28:06] I read about what happened there in Manalo.

[28:08] He was, should he go to Juliet,

[28:10] should he go to business school?

[28:12] Either I did the business school, and you're starting

[28:14] to go to Juliet, so I forgot to have one.

[28:16] I got to lose.

[28:17] I went downtown, and nobody was there.

[28:19] This person wanted to talk to me alone.

[28:21] And I said, where's everybody?

[28:23] Are there people there that I want to specifically talk to you?

[28:26] Have you ever been on camera before?

[28:28] No.

[28:29] So you got your radio show on the air, huh?

[28:31] Yeah, and you're frustrated, huh?

[28:33] Yeah.

[28:34] And you're like, I'm going to have a voice, sit down.

[28:37] Yeah.

[28:38] Well, I understand.

[28:40] You need that experience.

[28:42] But we're not going to let you in if you can't talk.

[28:46] And you ever been on camera before?

[28:48] I said, no, we're going to be on camera today.

[28:50] And they put me on camera in an audition in front of everybody

[28:53] for the school, you know, in this room.

[28:56] And everybody else gets up there, and I get up there,

[28:59] and I start doing this.

[29:00] I have a commercial in front of me.

[29:02] And then they stop taking.

[29:04] The guy says, the guy's running the camera.

[29:06] So are you sure you've never been this before?

[29:08] I said, no.

[29:09] I've only known about radios.

[29:11] Everyone says, will it show us?

[29:13] And then he announced, now just a minute,

[29:14] and maybe if they may have a little more experience here,

[29:16] but he's not any different than anybody else here.

[29:18] Okay.

[29:19] And then they're all sat down and listened to my demo tape.

[29:22] They were like, wow, amazing.

[29:24] How do you do that?

[29:26] Wonderful.

[29:27] So I attended TV actor studio,

[29:29] and I was the best in the class.

[29:32] And I met Paul Krook, who was a fine actor,

[29:35] who was in many, many movies, including somewhere in time

[29:37] and all this other stuff.

[29:39] And I learned, and I learned.

[29:42] And learning was very, very important to me

[29:45] because I needed that information.

[29:48] And then from there,

[29:51] as we say, my picture composite together,

[29:55] I have my demo.

[29:57] And six months later,

[29:59] through talking with some agents and things,

[30:03] I had, I was on television.

[30:05] I was actually, yeah,

[30:07] it took me six months to get my first on camera as we say, gig.

[30:10] And the other agent in town said,

[30:14] well, forget about the voices,

[30:16] but actually I met somebody.

[30:18] It was very, very important to me.

[30:20] And he said, forget about what they're saying.

[30:24] Keep on doing it, because not everyone can do this.

[30:26] And he turned out to be a writer and producer.

[30:29] And he had some ideas.

[30:30] And then we started to record with him.

[30:32] I mean, I started to record with him.

[30:34] Then, somebody mentioned that you need other things

[30:39] at your disposal,

[30:41] take some classes at the second city here.

[30:43] Now, you've read about second city in Provocation or everything.

[30:46] And it's called the Players Workshop of Second City.

[30:49] So I read them and I took the classes.

[30:52] And I learned about that.

[30:53] And all of a sudden now, I'm in the Children's Theater,

[30:57] a edition, but you have to add,

[30:59] and I'm in the Children's Theater of Second City.

[31:03] And this is 1984.

[31:06] And I have a pivoted world in this thing.

[31:09] I'm on the main stage,

[31:10] and I'm playing the Frankenstein Monster,

[31:13] narrating Beauty and the Beast.

[31:17] And then I got a nice review in the newspaper.

[31:19] Isn't that nice?

[31:20] Yeah.

[31:21] And I got a nice review in the newspaper.

[31:24] And because I was using a different voice for the monster.

[31:27] Now, what now?

[31:28] I put one of those Frankenstein headpieces on.

[31:30] So I'm 64, and it made me look like with 8 feet tall.

[31:33] So now I have three directors,

[31:35] and they said, you know, for you really,

[31:37] and you have your lines,

[31:39] you know, I had to do a musical number.

[31:42] The monster, I sang the monster blues.

[31:45] Yeah.

[31:46] We were cute a little bit.

[31:48] And it was so awesome as part of it.

[31:50] I said, my God,

[31:52] you know, because I met some kids,

[31:54] and they're going to be scripted,

[31:56] if I said no, the monster or the creature.

[31:58] He was a sympathetic character.

[32:00] So I'm going to play him like that.

[32:02] Instead of bouncing around with a scary one,

[32:04] I won't.

[32:05] The voice is enough to carry everything.

[32:07] And I would wear glasses on the monster

[32:09] just to tone things down a little bit.

[32:12] So when I came, when we had Mark Twain,

[32:16] I had some of those that was Mark Twain,

[32:19] and we had Wilhelm Grimm,

[32:21] and then there was the Frankenstein Monster.

[32:23] And this was all the first time this was ever done.

[32:26] So they're all looking at the stage,

[32:28] and they don't know where I am.

[32:29] And I said, and I said, I'll wait a minute.

[32:31] And then they start playing the Adam's family.

[32:33] And then he says, I think,

[32:34] isn't that the monster Dr. Frankenstein made?

[32:36] And the kids, you know, they're not scared.

[32:38] They're just, they're seniors.

[32:40] Kind of love everything.

[32:41] So there's a lot of fun.

[32:43] We did that for about 13 weeks,

[32:45] and then we got to the second city.

[32:47] And the person that did the master's degree,

[32:49] she came, my mom came, you know,

[32:51] we're on the main stage, and kids want to...

[32:54] I even run casting as you went to this thing.

[32:57] I'll never forget this.

[32:58] And she said, I've never seen a children show like this,

[33:01] or standing in the middle of the league.

[33:03] I mean, I think that I want to see you.

[33:05] I said, no, no, it's all a group effort.

[33:07] And in the newspaper, I got a nice review saying,

[33:09] I taught my, I said,

[33:11] first played by Fred Young,

[33:13] and then I was on Rift.

[33:15] They said I was so non-risk,

[33:17] mischievous and forwarded.

[33:19] I'm a voice monster because it felt like an FM DJ,

[33:21] because I was doing, I was doing the FM DJ voice.

[33:25] And I would narrated it and,

[33:27] and it was wonderful.

[33:29] And in between all this,

[33:31] I was still doing commercials on the internet and everything.

[33:35] Now, are you enjoying it so far?

[33:39] Yeah, it's interesting how we're getting there.

[33:42] Now, now we're coming to something that I knew nothing about.

[33:47] Remember, I was still doing industrial films.

[33:50] I was doing commercials.

[33:52] And auditioning.

[33:54] And I did a number of Empire Cup commercials

[33:57] and television, local things.

[33:59] And then finally, we had to join the unit that comes up.

[34:03] But now we're getting to another crucial, crucial situation.

[34:09] All of a sudden, this is what happened.

[34:12] We love it.

[34:15] I was recording for all state insurance.

[34:19] And, as I usually do,

[34:23] when I'm at another studio,

[34:25] I need to production studios in town,

[34:27] even today, unless they know me,

[34:29] which they do,

[34:30] I would leave a cassette tape.

[34:33] Now, on this particular cassette tape,

[34:35] this was my second character tape.

[34:37] My first character tape was the old Ed Sullivan show.

[34:40] Now, you're showing all different characters, whatever.

[34:44] On these tapes, you're like three minutes, that's all.

[34:47] On this particular one,

[34:48] it was PB Herman's Playhouse.

[34:50] And I was PB Herman.

[34:51] I was everybody on it.

[34:52] I still have.

[34:53] I still give out the tape sometimes.

[34:55] And I'm everybody on it.

[34:58] So I'm recording this stuff from all state insurance.

[35:01] And I left my cassette there.

[35:03] Little did I know what was about to happen.

[35:06] That continues to this day.

[35:09] Little did I even know.

[35:12] Because I just won an audition to be on NBC.

[35:17] This DJ in town, which I will not mention,

[35:20] he was having this show.

[35:22] And on the show,

[35:24] well, I was just sent in and do voices.

[35:27] And no one else could do anything that I could actually do voices.

[35:30] So I'm going to be on the show.

[35:35] And I thought, well, this would be a nice big break for me.

[35:38] It really broke my neck.

[35:40] I got basically hurt.

[35:42] I got actually hurt on national television.

[35:45] But that's another story as to why.

[35:47] Because they were very, they were,

[35:51] it was not going away.

[35:53] And the show never went anywhere.

[35:55] And we were asked for a couple of weeks,

[35:57] and that was the end of it.

[35:58] People couldn't stand it.

[35:59] And he wasn't good on camera.

[36:01] And even when he tried to do an interview with show,

[36:03] and he was not good at the audition, his name,

[36:06] he felt fat in his face.

[36:08] It was no good.

[36:09] But it nearly killed me.

[36:12] It nearly killed me.

[36:15] It was not good.

[36:17] Anyway, letting back what happened at the studio.

[36:20] So I left the cassette tape.

[36:22] Little I know was about to happen.

[36:24] All of a sudden, I get a phone call.

[36:27] Now, before I got this phone call,

[36:30] I'm sure you read about this.

[36:32] One of my friends,

[36:34] this father died.

[36:37] And I moved him for many, many years.

[36:40] So I'm going to go to the funeral,

[36:42] and I'm going to go to the house,

[36:44] and console and everything.

[36:46] I got a phone call from this production house.

[36:49] It turns out a company was in there.

[36:51] I said, yeah.

[36:53] And they want you to do Star Trek for a pinball machine.

[36:58] I said, what?

[37:00] Yeah.

[37:02] They heard your cassette.

[37:04] Because I didn't hear the rest of the strings for later.

[37:06] They want you to do Star Trek for a pinball machine.

[37:09] I did put Star Trek on there.

[37:11] I mean, the classic Star Trek stuff.

[37:13] There was no next generation at that time anyway.

[37:15] And I said, well, I don't know how to record for a pinball machine.

[37:19] I never knew what he think about it.

[37:21] And I said, I know about, you know,

[37:23] industrial films and commercials.

[37:25] And there's slide films and animation.

[37:33] And all of a sudden, I said, I said,

[37:35] a pinball machine.

[37:37] So I said something that, well,

[37:40] luckily, I said, well, can you get me out of it?

[37:43] It's true.

[37:45] I said it.

[37:46] Everything in place is actually the truth.

[37:48] I know it sounds crazy and strange,

[37:50] but this is what makes everything fun.

[37:53] I said, well, can I get out of it?

[37:55] We don't know who the people were that came in here.

[37:57] I said, well, I don't know.

[37:58] Well, you left the cassette.

[38:00] I said, well, I always wanted to cassette.

[38:02] Yeah.

[38:03] Well, call me back tomorrow.

[38:06] So I call up my friend, you know, his dead pest.

[38:09] And I said, well, listen.

[38:11] I don't think I'm going to be able to come to see what.

[38:13] Well, they want me to record for some gain, some pinball machine.

[38:17] I was talking about what you're not sure are you, Crane.

[38:20] I said, no, you're not going to start your Star Trek.

[38:22] I said, wait, I'll let you know.

[38:24] Let me call you back later.

[38:26] All right.

[38:27] They call me up again.

[38:28] And we don't know who the people are.

[38:29] We can't catch out of it.

[38:30] Will you do it?

[38:32] I said, I want to be in Crane Star Trek.

[38:35] So I said, never forget this.

[38:37] I said, sounds like fun.

[38:40] I said, sounds like fun.

[38:42] Okay.

[38:43] I said, all right.

[38:44] I go, I call my friend.

[38:46] I said, I'm not going to be able to come to Fure Barbie either that night.

[38:49] I'll be there every single night for you.

[38:51] I'm definitely.

[38:52] But they want me to record this thing Star Trek.

[38:55] I don't know.

[38:56] It's like, we can't turn it down.

[38:57] I said, oh, yes, I could.

[38:59] But I don't know who they are.

[39:01] They don't know why they are.

[39:02] They are.

[39:03] They are.

[39:04] Okay.

[39:05] I get over to the studio.

[39:06] Here it comes.

[39:07] And I meet the great Joe Kamikaw.

[39:09] I meet Brian Schmidt.

[39:11] And I'm sure you're familiar with Joe Kamikaw.

[39:13] I'm the leader of UN.

[39:14] Yeah.

[39:15] And I met Brian Schmidt.

[39:17] I'm sure you know him too.

[39:18] Yeah.

[39:19] No, you don't?

[39:20] Yes, you do.

[39:21] Okay.

[39:22] I'm Brian Schmidt.

[39:23] And this is the story that I heard after was because Brian had a time at the start.

[39:29] First of all, I get in there.

[39:30] I'm going to pay the story that was told to me like six, seven months later.

[39:35] They were really.

[39:36] They had this contract or whatever to do Star Trek.

[39:39] They're the one with the transporter.

[39:41] Right.

[39:42] That thing.

[39:43] Yeah.

[39:44] Okay.

[39:45] You got that?

[39:46] Yeah.

[39:47] And I need a.

[39:48] You know the characters, they're the people.

[39:52] So they happen to be over at the studio.

[39:54] And so they pull all the audition tapes, all the demo tapes from everyone in town here.

[39:59] So for two must be two, two and a half hours.

[40:03] They're listening to the truth to try and find someone to do this.

[40:09] Nothing.

[40:10] I mean, those characters like you're the husband, you're the employee, you're the cost of the

[40:15] job, you know, but no voice voices.

[40:17] You know what I mean?

[40:18] Right.

[40:19] Okay.

[40:20] I mean, he's doing it on man, he's doing the magician, he's doing this, you know, whatever.

[40:23] But nothing you can actually say no.

[40:26] So two and a half hours and Joe was bombed and Brian was bombed.

[40:30] So the engineer was also bombed and he said, we are not, there was a guy in here.

[40:34] He was doing some equating for all state.

[40:36] We left this and he was doing a lot of voices in here.

[40:39] Would you like to listen to this?

[40:41] And we've been listening to stuff for two and a half hours.

[40:43] We are now at the end of the day.

[40:45] I had just been listening to the show.

[40:47] How did you know?

[40:49] So they lifted the PV Herman's play house.

[40:51] What is this over?

[40:53] So they popped it in the minute they heard the first couple of minutes of PV.

[40:57] They were in throttles.

[40:59] And I was doing, yeah, I was doing probably here.

[41:01] Oh yeah, I was listening to PV Herman.

[41:03] And by the way, I can do the voices.

[41:05] I'm not, I'm not PV Herman.

[41:06] I'm just showing them, I just do a demo tape and a demonstration of your, of what you can do, you know what I mean?

[41:09] Right.

[41:10] I don't really think we heard it.

[41:12] It must be very quick.

[41:13] It's a matter of fact.

[41:14] I don't know what you're talking about.

[41:16] So we would do...

[41:17] So on that.

[41:18] So then all of a sudden,

[41:19] I'm a specific part of it.

[41:21] I thought I'd be kind of interesting

[41:23] on the Star Trek,

[41:24] with the trans...

[41:25] You know, with the...

[41:26] with the...

[41:27] with the...

[41:28] with the...

[41:29] with the engines going and all of that.

[41:30] So I put that...

[41:31] we recorded that on there.

[41:32] All of a sudden,

[41:33] when my Star Trek set...

[41:34] they said,

[41:35] that's it!

[41:36] That's the guy!

[41:37] That's him!

[41:38] So,

[41:39] when you do the Star Trek,

[41:41] what did you do like?

[41:42] Did you do the Kirk and the Spock and the...

[41:44] and the...

[41:45] Yeah.

[41:46] Yeah.

[41:47] And that's what they heard,

[41:48] and that was the,

[41:49] of course, immediate trust.

[41:50] That's when they made the decision.

[41:51] That's him!

[41:52] That's after two and a half hours of listening.

[41:54] After two and a half hours of reading,

[41:57] I'm like,

[41:58] you know, you can hear all these tips all over the time.

[42:00] Nothing!

[42:01] You know what I mean?

[42:02] So now, what year was this?

[42:03] This is about 1990?

[42:04] 1889.

[42:05] 89.

[42:06] That's right.

[42:07] And that's it!

[42:09] That's the guy!

[42:10] So I can now come in,

[42:11] I'm meeting everybody.

[42:12] And they're showing me...

[42:14] It's a whole new difference.

[42:15] I might say,

[42:16] to do this stuff,

[42:17] it's a whole different recording.

[42:18] It's not...

[42:19] like you do a commercial.

[42:21] A commercial is a commercial.

[42:22] This...

[42:23] it's a whole different...

[42:24] ballgame.

[42:25] To tell the truth.

[42:26] It is.

[42:27] And I learned that very quickly.

[42:28] But anyway, I walk in there,

[42:29] and I don't know who I am.

[42:30] And I knew one of the girls

[42:32] that had recording over there.

[42:34] And she wanted to wake

[42:35] to hear me do stuff,

[42:36] but she had a go.

[42:37] And I was such a goodie,

[42:38] so I heard other...

[42:39] other venues.

[42:40] And by the way,

[42:41] when...

[42:42] interestingly,

[42:43] when I started to do this,

[42:44] like freelancing,

[42:45] everything,

[42:46] I was so...

[42:48] it was...

[42:50] like...

[42:51] I'm now, you know,

[42:52] people respining,

[42:54] and they're very happy to be with me.

[42:56] You know,

[42:57] they're...

[42:58] I see it...

[42:59] not finding a nice,

[43:00] nice, nice work instead of...

[43:01] they're at auditions,

[43:02] and...

[43:03] and a nice deal,

[43:04] you know,

[43:05] performing, you know,

[43:06] blah, blah, blah.

[43:07] So I thought, you know,

[43:08] I said, hey, you know,

[43:09] come a lot of me here.

[43:10] Hey, nice.

[43:11] So all of a sudden,

[43:12] I get there,

[43:13] and I'm not saying anything.

[43:15] I'm saying,

[43:16] oh, are you sure you can...

[43:17] you know,

[43:18] you heard your demo,

[43:19] a very impressed...

[43:20] I'm sure you can...

[43:21] yeah, I can do this, yeah.

[43:22] Because they didn't hear me.

[43:23] Are you sure you'll be alright?

[43:25] You know, you're not going to be like that.

[43:26] Frog,

[43:27] and one frog you do,

[43:28] you know, hollow,

[43:29] and the baby,

[43:30] hollow, and the dog,

[43:31] and then nothing,

[43:32] and then the frog goes,

[43:33] bruv, and nothing.

[43:34] And that day,

[43:36] well, all of a sudden,

[43:38] as they're doing the Star Trek,

[43:40] and they're plodding,

[43:41] and the booth,

[43:42] and they're plodding,

[43:43] and they're, my guy,

[43:44] a blah, blah, blah, blah.

[43:45] Then they're going crazy.

[43:47] John is going crazy,

[43:48] but I'm going crazy.

[43:49] And that day,

[43:51] you don't do this anymore.

[43:53] You know how many twins

[43:54] I recorded that day?

[43:55] Like, four or five?

[43:57] Four or five.

[43:58] He's four or five.

[43:59] I remember it most vividly.

[44:01] Yeah, you did the...

[44:02] You did the...

[44:03] You did like King Kong,

[44:04] and...

[44:05] King Kong, right?

[44:06] That's right.

[44:07] King Kong,

[44:08] check point.

[44:09] Right?

[44:10] Batman.

[44:11] Star Trek,

[44:14] and another one.

[44:15] It was like a marathon,

[44:17] like, eight, nine hours.

[44:19] But they went crazy,

[44:21] and then they wanted to show me,

[44:23] the King Kong poster,

[44:25] and all the artwork,

[44:26] which is beautiful stuff.

[44:28] You know, I've never seen any of this stuff before.

[44:30] I don't know.

[44:31] I play on games, you know,

[44:32] in high school hangout,

[44:33] you play the baseball games.

[44:35] You know, you remember those baseball games and things.

[44:37] Sure.

[44:38] But I didn't know anything about this.

[44:39] And...

[44:40] And...

[44:41] This is interesting.

[44:44] And you said,

[44:45] do the whole movie,

[44:46] Vocalty of King Kong.

[44:47] And I just happened to see it the other night,

[44:48] so I had everything memorized.

[44:50] So I knew all the lines and everything.

[44:52] Fed it all to churches,

[44:53] and whatever went in,

[44:54] went in,

[44:55] because that's a long time ago.

[44:56] That's where only specific things

[44:57] would go in there.

[44:58] Now,

[44:59] there can throw anything in there,

[45:00] you know what I mean?

[45:01] The database is so large.

[45:04] The memory is so large,

[45:05] you control almost anything in there, you know?

[45:07] Well, you know,

[45:08] back in the day,

[45:09] when you did this,

[45:10] the four or five games,

[45:12] I mean, did you have any prep time for any of this?

[45:15] No.

[45:16] No.

[45:17] No.

[45:18] No.

[45:19] You prep time?

[45:21] I was hit with King Kong.

[45:25] Checkpoint,

[45:26] King Kong,

[45:27] and it was say,

[45:29] I said, well, I can do all this.

[45:30] I didn't have any preparation.

[45:32] No.

[45:33] No.

[45:34] I knew all this stuff already.

[45:37] So right away they say,

[45:39] my God, you know,

[45:41] you know,

[45:42] you know, you know,

[45:43] you have a line,

[45:44] you know, the whole thing,

[45:45] the whole movie would vocally.

[45:47] So that's what happened.

[45:48] Now, I didn't prep time new.

[45:50] The prep time I had was when I got there,

[45:51] because I didn't have a script in my hand.

[45:52] It was better and more spontaneous,

[45:54] because you can over-practice anyway,

[45:56] but I found that out later.

[45:57] But no one, there's no preparation time.

[45:59] I just went and I just did it.

[46:02] Now, were you still working for the insurance company?

[46:05] No.

[46:06] When did the insurance stop?

[46:07] Right, I ended in

[46:09] seventy,

[46:11] thirty, seventy-nine.

[46:12] I took a leave of absence,

[46:13] and then all of a sudden,

[46:14] everything else started to happen.

[46:16] All of a sudden,

[46:17] God on the River Show,

[46:18] I had my own,

[46:20] had my own,

[46:22] River Show on the River,

[46:23] seventy-nine,

[46:24] eighty.

[46:25] And then I decided to make the decision.

[46:27] You have to make the decision,

[46:28] because you see,

[46:29] you can't get away from it.

[46:30] You know what I mean?

[46:31] I'm trying to get away from

[46:32] the almost-time recording tapes for the,

[46:34] I mean, the Dictafone tapes

[46:35] for the insurance company.

[46:36] And I don't know how to work,

[46:37] but so I don't really

[46:38] federal figure it out,

[46:39] which I did.

[46:41] And then,

[46:43] and then I'm doing a number of different things.

[46:44] Then, the TV after studio,

[46:46] training them,

[46:47] and then,

[46:48] then,

[46:49] a post-work shop,

[46:50] a second city.

[46:51] You know.

[46:52] And then,

[46:53] an eighty-nine,

[46:54] all of a sudden,

[46:55] all of a blue,

[46:56] this happened.

[46:58] Well,

[46:59] that's a true story.

[47:00] Well, of all of these,

[47:01] of these voice gigs that you do,

[47:03] what, you know what I mean?

[47:05] What is pinball machine

[47:07] in the big picture?

[47:08] Is doing pinball machines?

[47:09] Is that a very good,

[47:10] from my behind?

[47:11] Well, I'll be up,

[47:12] but I mean, was it a-

[47:13] About games?

[47:15] But was it a very good,

[47:17] paying gig?

[47:18] Did I just say?

[47:19] Was it a very good,

[47:20] paying gig?

[47:21] I guess, at the time, yeah.

[47:24] I thought it was very, very good.

[47:26] Yeah.

[47:27] Yeah.

[47:28] But remember,

[47:29] that was back in 89.

[47:31] Not so far from ballgame,

[47:33] you know, with situations and things.

[47:35] But yes, it was a good,

[47:36] paying gig.

[47:37] Yeah.

[47:38] Besides, I've never done anything like this,

[47:40] and when I asked,

[47:41] where's this thing going?

[47:42] Where's these things going?

[47:43] All over the world.

[47:44] I said, what?

[47:45] All over the world.

[47:46] I said, what?

[47:47] All over the world.

[47:49] All over the world.

[47:51] So you mean to tell me that this is going, yeah.

[47:55] Well, now, the other stuff came in

[47:57] because you see,

[47:58] unfortunately, but,

[48:00] as we say, the powers that be,

[48:02] it turned out that,

[48:04] uh, Mr. Schattener,

[48:07] one of the certain amount of money,

[48:09] for me to do his stuff on the game,

[48:12] and they had to pick all my stuff off the game.

[48:16] So I'm not really,

[48:18] I'm only on one part of that particular star trick game,

[48:20] believe it or not,

[48:21] because you have to professional.

[48:22] They say, you know what I mean.

[48:23] Right.

[48:24] But they say, uh,

[48:25] they really request that, you know,

[48:27] even recorded,

[48:28] all the recording was done, everything.

[48:30] But,

[48:31] we have to take your stuff off.

[48:33] So they did go to the forest Kelly,

[48:37] and they went to Jimmy DeWayne,

[48:38] God rest their souls,

[48:40] and the forest Kelly recorded for that game,

[48:43] for, uh,

[48:45] for scale.

[48:46] And Jimmy DeWayne,

[48:47] because his wife,

[48:48] Ness Pinball,

[48:49] said, well, what do you want?

[48:50] And he just wanted a game?

[48:52] Wow.

[48:53] I didn't give him a game.

[48:54] Right.

[48:55] If then people far was actually me on there,

[48:57] and no,

[48:58] it wasn't.

[48:59] And I said, I'm only on one part of that game.

[49:01] Have you ever played a net game?

[49:02] Yes. Yes.

[49:04] Okay. Remember at the end,

[49:05] you hear the person say,

[49:07] live long and prosper?

[49:08] Yes.

[49:09] Yeah, that's me.

[49:10] Huh.

[49:11] Uh-huh.

[49:12] I couldn't sound like,

[49:14] Spock.

[49:15] I couldn't do it like,

[49:16] live long and prosper.

[49:17] No.

[49:18] I think it went with long and prosper.

[49:20] Now, interestingly enough,

[49:22] when that happened,

[49:24] interestingly enough,

[49:25] and I said, okay, okay.

[49:26] I met Junior Edinburgh in 1981

[49:29] at North Park College.

[49:30] They had a sci-fi,

[49:32] there was a sci-fi,

[49:34] um, convention going on

[49:36] that weekend at North Park College.

[49:37] And they invited Dave Prouse,

[49:39] who plays Darth Vader,

[49:40] and then he invited Gene Rodbury.

[49:43] And I had a chance to meet him.

[49:46] And he was just terrific.

[49:48] And I met him in 1981.

[49:49] Now, time passes.

[49:50] 1989.

[49:52] Now, in 1990,

[49:54] they decided to take this over

[49:56] to come out,

[49:57] studies were the filming,

[49:58] the next generation.

[49:59] And it turns out,

[50:01] unfortunately, I was very sad to hear

[50:03] that Gene Rodbury passed away,

[50:05] he died.

[50:06] So they dedicated it to

[50:08] good over there,

[50:09] and people are crying,

[50:10] and you got the Patrick Stewart coming out

[50:11] to see this thing,

[50:12] and everyone from another film,

[50:13] the next generation.

[50:14] And, you know,

[50:16] and they dedicated a plaque

[50:18] to this game

[50:20] to the memory engineers,

[50:22] Mr. Gene Rodbury.

[50:23] And I said, very right and proper.

[50:24] Very right and proper.

[50:25] So that was that.

[50:29] And then,

[50:30] Joe calls me up and says,

[50:33] there's a thing called the Pinball Expo.

[50:35] And I said,

[50:36] what is that?

[50:39] Well, I was a person at Rodbury,

[50:41] and I think it would be a kick

[50:44] if he'd go to the,

[50:46] go to the Expo,

[50:47] maybe do a little talk.

[50:49] I think they really have a lot of fun.

[50:52] I said,

[50:54] you need me?

[50:55] He says, yeah.

[50:56] I said, all right, you got me.

[50:57] So then I called Rodbury up,

[50:59] and you know, everyone around me,

[51:01] I just want you to know quite.

[51:02] Everyone around me tries to do voices.

[51:04] You understand?

[51:05] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[51:06] Oh, Rodbury.

[51:08] So all of a sudden,

[51:09] I said,

[51:10] what's the work, how do you do?

[51:11] I'm Fred.

[51:12] And he started doing Yoda.

[51:14] The rest, I mean,

[51:17] he's a wonderful person,

[51:18] but I tell him,

[51:19] you practice everyone does this.

[51:21] You know, come on.

[51:22] I have an animal trick.

[51:23] I said, okay, I said that's my,

[51:25] and then he,

[51:26] I met him at that time as a remodel here,

[51:29] and went away here,

[51:30] and we had breakfast,

[51:32] and we talked,

[51:34] and he even spelled my moon wrong

[51:37] on the list of people

[51:38] that were going to be speaking.

[51:40] Now this is 1990,

[51:41] and there's video tape for me, all right?

[51:43] Wait, wait, wait.

[51:44] How can you misspell, Fred Young?

[51:46] Yeah, I did.

[51:47] All right, so they did.

[51:48] How can you misspell?

[51:49] I don't know, but they did.

[51:50] All right, so what?

[51:52] So I took a couple of the peony hermita

[51:54] and I had about maybe 20 of the tapes there.

[51:56] All right, you know, all right.

[51:57] Maybe people have some fun with it.

[51:59] And the other side of that's my narration tape.

[52:01] It's called narration.

[52:02] It's narrating your teaching.

[52:04] So I get over here,

[52:07] and then this blue auditorium, you know,

[52:09] and Rob announces me,

[52:12] he does a yogi bear,

[52:14] and you know, that puts mine to shame.

[52:16] Here he is, Fred Young.

[52:17] And like you see on those,

[52:19] you know, you see on those other things,

[52:21] where you hear the cricket's chirp,

[52:23] you get all your ears like this.

[52:25] Okay, you're not see.

[52:26] And here he is, Fred Young,

[52:27] and I get up on this pony.

[52:29] And all of a sudden you think it out.

[52:31] You know, one of these things, right?

[52:32] Right.

[52:33] Yep.

[52:34] And the cricket's chirp, you know what I mean?

[52:37] Yeah, is that because...

[52:38] That may be 50, 30 to 50 people.

[52:40] There's a big thing, it's a big thing, right?

[52:43] Okay. Right? Right?

[52:46] Yeah.

[52:47] Okay.

[52:48] And somebody reminding me about this last year

[52:50] because they were there.

[52:51] And I forgot about this.

[52:53] So this is what happened.

[52:54] Are you ready?

[52:56] Ready?

[52:57] Yep.

[52:59] I started, thank you everybody.

[53:02] And by the way,

[53:04] I subsequently got called in to do other games.

[53:08] Okay?

[53:09] Which I didn't want to talk about because, you know.

[53:12] Yeah, you can't talk about new stuff.

[53:14] Yeah, I can't because, you know,

[53:15] I don't know if I was supposed to because you see what,

[53:17] in 1989 when I got the toy of the place,

[53:19] the game that was coming out

[53:21] was called Phantom of the Opera.

[53:23] But they used some kind of DJing.

[53:25] He wasn't an actor.

[53:26] He wasn't acting.

[53:27] He couldn't really act, act, act, act, act.

[53:30] Okay?

[53:31] But that was the one that was as we say on the line

[53:33] that we're making and everything.

[53:34] And my other stuff was coming up later.

[53:37] So I started, you know,

[53:39] I showed them the announcement boys

[53:41] and then I started showing other things.

[53:43] So this is what happened.

[53:45] Are you ready?

[53:46] Yep.

[53:47] And somebody had a reminder about this.

[53:49] The cricket's a champion.

[53:50] I was going to say,

[53:51] oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[53:52] Okay.

[53:53] And the video taken, you know.

[53:55] All of a sudden,

[53:56] because I started doing other things.

[53:58] And I said, well, I have some questions.

[53:59] All of a sudden,

[54:01] from 30 to 50 people,

[54:03] the place starts loading up.

[54:06] Somebody said something out there.

[54:08] They said, hey, there's this guy.

[54:09] He's doing some stuff.

[54:10] Well, well, well.

[54:11] And by this is before the Simpsons

[54:12] and Famigain, all of a sudden.

[54:14] And all of a sudden,

[54:15] there's more people coming in.

[54:19] Now, you've got the Waders

[54:21] and the Wafers back from out there.

[54:24] They're coming in.

[54:26] Now, the whole place,

[54:28] I started doing other,

[54:30] just to show,

[54:31] I started getting a prize.

[54:33] The whole place goes bananas.

[54:36] The whole place.

[54:38] Were you doing like,

[54:40] like, bulls?

[54:41] I was showing them,

[54:42] Hannah Biber.

[54:43] I was showing them,

[54:45] Warner Brothers,

[54:46] the Bugs Bunny,

[54:47] and a few,

[54:48] and I was showing them other things,

[54:50] you know, whatever.

[54:52] And the whole place is going nuts.

[54:56] Now they're asking me questions,

[54:59] and very nice questions,

[55:01] and I'm responding.

[55:02] And then I'm only there for an hour.

[55:04] I thought, okay,

[55:05] the whole place is going crazy.

[55:07] But 20 cassettes I brought.

[55:09] Well, you couldn't find them.

[55:10] They took them boom.

[55:11] There they are.

[55:12] I don't know.

[55:13] Yeah, they're gone.

[55:14] But they're gone.

[55:15] They are gone.

[55:16] They went crazy.

[55:19] They just,

[55:20] I was doing a regular beer,

[55:22] and I was doing all this stuff.

[55:25] And I was showing them a Martian voice,

[55:29] which almost sounds like Elmo,

[55:31] and I was showing them all this stuff.

[55:32] And they're going nuts.

[55:34] My God, it looks like a right now.

[55:36] I mean, from 30 to 30,

[55:38] the other place is going to be one of the big rooms

[55:41] over the remote at that time.

[55:43] My God.

[55:44] Okay.

[55:45] So, every other one of them,

[55:47] the bank,

[55:48] the bank, the bank,

[55:50] was going to be there.

[55:52] So crazy was that.

[55:54] And at the bank when I was Saturday night,

[55:56] you've been there.

[55:57] You've been at the expo.

[55:58] Yep.

[55:59] Well, I get home tired.

[56:01] Even Joe's asking, you know,

[56:03] it's about quarter to four in the morning,

[56:05] and Joe wants me to do voices.

[56:07] I get tired.

[56:08] You know, it's, I get home

[56:10] four o'clock in the morning.

[56:11] The phone rings.

[56:13] Are you ready?

[56:14] You love the stonchia.

[56:15] Yeah.

[56:16] You're going to work on the phone rings.

[56:18] It's Rob Book and what are you doing?

[56:19] You're doing Yoda.

[56:21] Bad Yoda, you mean?

[56:22] Yeah, bad, yeah, bad, yeah, yeah.

[56:24] It's not up to my standards, okay?

[56:28] Yeah.

[56:29] Yeah.

[56:30] So, you weren't used to.

[56:34] But it's testing.

[56:35] He wanted to invite me out to breakfast.

[56:37] I'm telling you, it's four o'clock.

[56:39] I thought God forbid we died, you know?

[56:41] Right.

[56:42] But he was so thrilled with me.

[56:44] I said, every single year,

[56:46] are you saying that you're not used to

[56:51] any of this sort of response to your work?

[56:55] I wasn't used to any of this as we say,

[56:57] as you're saying,

[56:59] mainly because what I do,

[57:02] I say, okay, fine, because it's just one aspect.

[57:06] I know it's going to get crazy and crazy with me.

[57:09] But I've only one aspect of it, you see.

[57:13] I only see it in one aspect.

[57:16] I didn't know, I mean,

[57:18] 1990 there was more than one tin ball company out.

[57:21] At the time, I was just doing a staph of data east.

[57:24] And after that's finished, after that's finished,

[57:28] one of my agents called me up.

[57:30] You see, things start to snowball, you know what I mean?

[57:32] Right.

[57:33] Yeah.

[57:34] One of my agents called me up on a Saturday.

[57:37] And there was another company

[57:41] which was Williams looking for a wife.

[57:45] She called me up.

[57:47] And I said, yes, yes.

[57:51] And it was for the T2 machine over at Williams.

[57:55] And can you call it over there and do an urinal?

[57:59] I said, that kind of thing is the tin ball.

[58:02] And he said, oh, here we go again.

[58:04] I said, here we go again.

[58:05] What the hell?

[58:06] So I called up, I basically won the audition.

[58:10] And Arnold wasn't going to do it, but Mr. Shen,

[58:14] I got paid everything, but Arnold,

[58:19] he heard me and he did it.

[58:22] And then somebody told me a little while later,

[58:25] you couldn't tell who you might take and his tape for the thing.

[58:28] But he did it and I didn't, so I'm not on the game.

[58:32] But am I used to the adulation?

[58:34] No, not really.

[58:35] Not really.

[58:36] I see, it's a business.

[58:38] You can get crazy.

[58:39] You know, when I see these other people,

[58:41] we get everything handed to them.

[58:42] I'm so glad I didn't appreciate anything.

[58:44] You know what I mean?

[58:45] And I'm sure you've experienced some of that stuff where you talk with people.

[58:47] And they're having that added to the joker,

[58:49] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all.

[58:51] Look at me and blah, blah, blah.

[58:53] Well, that's awful nice, but you're still a human being.

[58:55] So when I see these people like a Lindsay Lohan

[58:58] or the Spurs or something, going crazy.

[59:00] They've got millions and millions and millions of dollars.

[59:03] And they're taking their account and their abilities

[59:05] and throwing them at the garbage can.

[59:07] It doesn't go well because here you're given something

[59:10] and you've given a lot of opportunities.

[59:14] A lot of people would die for.

[59:17] You know what I mean?

[59:18] Right.

[59:19] So I'm not really used to that.

[59:21] Even though I don't mind it, I think it's kind of crazy.

[59:24] You know, I know it's news and everything.

[59:27] I've had a joke one time.

[59:29] I said, you know I've made it in the industry, how?

[59:31] You'll read that I'm sleeping with somebody on the national inquiry.

[59:34] Right.

[59:35] Which is true.

[59:36] Which unfortunately it's true.

[59:38] It's a bad response to the way things are.

[59:41] But people get a little, you know, they get a little

[59:43] a little ride.

[59:44] You get in town here.

[59:45] And I'm sure you've experienced some of that too.

[59:47] They get a little bit of a ride.

[59:48] He goes right to their heads and right away they think

[59:50] that they're better than sliced bread for everybody.

[59:52] But the problem is, unfortunately, you're still a human being.

[59:55] And you've got to respond like a human being,

[59:58] instead of being a, you know, whatever.

[01:00:00] Because you think you're mourning yourself then.

[01:00:01] Then you lose it.

[01:00:02] Then you lose your own self respect and everything.

[01:00:05] So I'm not really used to that kind of agilist I was getting.

[01:00:08] It was nice.

[01:00:09] It was only wrong.

[01:00:10] Yeah.

[01:00:11] And I still have a mind.

[01:00:12] Sure, I'll take pictures.

[01:00:13] I'll sign autographs.

[01:00:14] That's nice.

[01:00:15] That's wonderful.

[01:00:16] That's great.

[01:00:17] Probably it's getting me used to other things that will happen.

[01:00:19] But you still don't forget that you're still a person.

[01:00:22] And those people like you.

[01:00:24] And because they like you,

[01:00:26] that's why I'm the final autograph, you know what I mean.

[01:00:28] So it's nice that people get a little bit of a ride.

[01:00:31] And I always say,

[01:00:32] hello.

[01:00:33] I always say,

[01:00:34] I do, I do.

[01:00:35] I do, I do, I do.

[01:00:36] I don't see you do, you know it.

[01:00:37] And so that's not bad.

[01:00:38] Because I remember when I was going from a second to a second city,

[01:00:41] one of the other,

[01:00:42] the first workshop of second city,

[01:00:44] one of my other colleagues,

[01:00:45] he was in California and he looked at the box.

[01:00:47] But who did the voice of Yogi Bear and he did Huckleberry,

[01:00:49] how to cook, how to grow,

[01:00:50] and all these other voices that you've seen on the earth.

[01:00:56] And he called them up on the phone

[01:00:58] And he called him up on the phone.

[01:01:01] He was in the phone where he called and he said,

[01:01:03] it's Charles Dawson Butler.

[01:01:05] He says, Mr. Butler, I'm a big failure.

[01:01:07] I know if in a position, I would left to hopefully meet you someday.

[01:01:12] And I hope you have a position that I'm calling you up.

[01:01:16] And he says, oh no, no, that's wonderful.

[01:01:18] I thank you very much.

[01:01:19] I said, I'd left to meet you.

[01:01:21] He says, what are you doing now?

[01:01:22] This is Dawson's number.

[01:01:23] The number one guy with Stan Friedberg and Hannah Bebber.

[01:01:29] He says, what are you doing now?

[01:01:30] He says, nothing.

[01:01:31] He says, come on over.

[01:01:32] So he invited him over to his house.

[01:01:35] I said, that's a human being.

[01:01:36] So he says, I do yogis.

[01:01:37] He says, let me do yogi bear.

[01:01:39] So he says, no, you're not going to know your diary.

[01:01:41] He's teaching how to do yogis.

[01:01:42] He's teaching how to do that.

[01:01:43] We give him a cassette of some of his stuff.

[01:01:45] And he forgot that.

[01:01:47] So you're always a human being.

[01:01:48] You have to be a gentleman.

[01:01:50] Let me say, tonight I'm a trotter.

[01:01:51] So it's like talking to you tonight.

[01:01:53] It's not like I'm talking to you.

[01:01:56] This is a privilege.

[01:01:58] I can't thank you enough.

[01:01:59] No, it's privilege for me.

[01:02:00] Trust me.

[01:02:01] I mean, as you're able to say,

[01:02:03] what did you do today?

[01:02:06] That's a propaganda.

[01:02:09] So now, what games did you end up doing for Williams or did you?

[01:02:14] Or...

[01:02:15] That was the only one.

[01:02:16] That was the only one.

[01:02:18] The only one I auditioned for was on a Saturday.

[01:02:22] And that was that.

[01:02:23] And then it got back to Joe.

[01:02:25] I was like, I don't think you're recording for...

[01:02:27] I said, no, I didn't.

[01:02:29] It was an audition.

[01:02:31] I did do it, but it never went anywhere.

[01:02:33] Sometimes you do stuff and it doesn't go anywhere.

[01:02:35] So that was the only time.

[01:02:38] And you did all the Alvin G games, too, right?

[01:02:40] That's what I did.

[01:02:41] Yeah.

[01:02:42] And was Joe mad about that?

[01:02:43] No.

[01:02:44] No.

[01:02:45] It wasn't mad.

[01:02:46] It just...

[01:02:47] You see, I walk in there.

[01:02:49] You walk in the Williams, too.

[01:02:51] I know I've been over there.

[01:02:52] I mean, the only thing that was on California Avenue here.

[01:02:54] And immediately when I walked in there, because the guy on the phone was saying, you know,

[01:03:02] about our games.

[01:03:03] So I said, yes, I happened to know about you.

[01:03:05] And he says, what do you know about it?

[01:03:06] So I happened to say, um, a fun house.

[01:03:09] How do you know about fun house?

[01:03:10] Why I thought if the expo was just there?

[01:03:12] Yeah.

[01:03:13] Yeah.

[01:03:14] Yeah.

[01:03:15] I thought it the expo.

[01:03:16] So, Lucy, I walk in and what's there?

[01:03:19] A big pinball game back to the future.

[01:03:22] Yeah, the dead.

[01:03:23] You mean the dead east?

[01:03:24] Oh, everyone listens to everyone else's games.

[01:03:26] Right.

[01:03:27] Yeah.

[01:03:28] And they have to respect you.

[01:03:29] Just that he says, Joe happened to say, I heard you were over there.

[01:03:32] That's all.

[01:03:33] He wasn't mad.

[01:03:34] I heard you were over there.

[01:03:35] But he wasn't mad.

[01:03:36] But all the Alvin G games, yeah.

[01:03:38] Okay.

[01:03:40] Okay.

[01:03:41] Well, let me, I got a list of the data east games.

[01:03:44] Tell me, tell me what ones that you did did.

[01:03:48] What's that been involved with?

[01:03:50] Right.

[01:03:51] Yeah, here we go.

[01:03:52] I'll just, I'll rattle off.

[01:03:53] Well, we talked about these.

[01:03:54] King Kong, Phantom of the Opera.

[01:03:56] Back to the opera.

[01:03:57] So you did nothing on Fend-

[01:03:59] Found that, but that's in the pinball contendium.

[01:04:01] Somebody made a mistake about that, but I'm not in Phantom of the Opera.

[01:04:03] Okay.

[01:04:04] What about the Simpsons?

[01:04:05] No.

[01:04:06] What happened was that the powers that made the Empire

[01:04:08] the powers that made the Empire everybody over there

[01:04:11] to record, whenever they could get them to record.

[01:04:14] They, they all recorded that.

[01:04:16] And I said, okay.

[01:04:18] Okay.

[01:04:19] I mean, I, I, I say, okay.

[01:04:24] You know, I don't, I don't get involved.

[01:04:26] No.

[01:04:27] That's fine.

[01:04:28] But no, I'm not on the Simpsons.

[01:04:29] I'm sorry.

[01:04:30] Okay.

[01:04:31] With Checkpoint, we talked about that.

[01:04:33] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, boy.

[01:04:36] That's awful.

[01:04:37] Yes.

[01:04:38] What, what did you do on Turtles?

[01:04:42] You do all the Turtles?

[01:04:44] Yeah.

[01:04:45] So you did everything then.

[01:04:47] Yeah.

[01:04:48] Okay.

[01:04:49] Well, I had to go to see the movie about ten times.

[01:04:51] Okay.

[01:04:52] That's too bad.

[01:04:53] Yeah, that's too bad.

[01:04:54] I had it, I had it, I had it.

[01:04:55] And the thing is, you still in love.

[01:04:57] You see, uh, though, you see, I always say,

[01:05:01] do people, you see, the powers that made me be give me,

[01:05:05] and not to get, see, I don't know exactly how they get certain rights and permissions,

[01:05:10] because I don't get involved in that.

[01:05:12] And that's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

[01:05:14] But they say, yeah, we give you, uh, you, you, you, you can record.

[01:05:20] We give you the permission.

[01:05:22] The permission is granted.

[01:05:24] I'll put it to you that way.

[01:05:25] And I don't get involved with that area.

[01:05:27] Plus, I don't know about what goes on.

[01:05:29] Say the truth.

[01:05:30] How that is obtained.

[01:05:31] But, um, that's what happened.

[01:05:33] Yeah.

[01:05:34] Yeah, but Teenage Mutant and Jeter, that was 1990.

[01:05:37] Yeah.

[01:05:38] Now, now Batman, I mean, how did you know what voice to do for Batman?

[01:05:44] It happened to see the movie.

[01:05:49] Okay, now, you're talking about the original movie or the movie with Keaton.

[01:05:54] I'm with Adam West.

[01:05:55] We're talking 1989, but what was Michael Keaton?

[01:05:58] Right, with Keaton.

[01:05:59] Right.

[01:06:00] It's your Nicholson shirt.

[01:06:01] Okay, so now, did you do any Nicholson voice?

[01:06:06] Yeah.

[01:06:07] So you did...

[01:06:08] I put it.

[01:06:09] Pardon me?

[01:06:10] I don't know where they put it.

[01:06:11] Where they put it in the game.

[01:06:13] But I did do some recording for that.

[01:06:15] Yeah.

[01:06:16] It wasn't a lot of recording.

[01:06:17] I did some recording for it, sure.

[01:06:18] So they would try and get...

[01:06:20] I'll put it to you that way.

[01:06:21] They would try and get the principal actor to do it.

[01:06:24] Sure.

[01:06:25] Absolutely.

[01:06:26] I remember this was a long time ago.

[01:06:27] Now it's a little more...

[01:06:28] But you see, you don't want to have P.O. anybody.

[01:06:33] But sometimes, other situations have to step in because other people are busy.

[01:06:39] That's why when they can get that, they will be original people.

[01:06:44] They can do that.

[01:06:45] So that's what happened.

[01:06:46] But it's okay.

[01:06:47] That's okay.

[01:06:48] That's okay.

[01:06:49] I'm very, but I don't know where I am because I've never heard the game after I did it.

[01:06:54] So that's the reason they're there.

[01:06:56] But that's okay.

[01:06:57] That's okay.

[01:06:58] Keep on reading the list.

[01:06:59] Well, we talked about Star Trek and then there was...

[01:07:03] How about Hook?

[01:07:04] Yes.

[01:07:05] What did you do in Hook?

[01:07:08] Well, I was...

[01:07:11] All the people.

[01:07:14] When I say all the people, we'll even go at that because I don't want to bore you with the...

[01:07:20] And remember once again, as I said, Joe was very infatic when he called me in for anything.

[01:07:27] Everything was up and up.

[01:07:30] So nobody's going to get mad at me.

[01:07:33] I don't want somebody to be mad at me.

[01:07:35] You understand what's coming after me.

[01:07:36] You understand what I'm saying?

[01:07:37] You have to be careful about this.

[01:07:40] The powers that be...

[01:07:42] I don't know...

[01:07:43] I don't get involved with that.

[01:07:44] But they don't get involved with me.

[01:07:45] The intricacies of doing places and voice refraction, everything.

[01:07:50] The thing is, a long time ago and I won't say this is for another company.

[01:07:55] I don't want to go into it too much.

[01:07:57] I did something for another company for whatever it was.

[01:08:00] And all of a sudden I received a phone call from this individual's lawyer from LA.

[01:08:07] And I was involved in a roundabout where I lawsuit.

[01:08:12] And that's why you have to be very careful.

[01:08:14] Because remember what I'm doing with the power.

[01:08:17] So I don't get involved with that.

[01:08:19] But everything has to be done as everything has to be on the up and up.

[01:08:23] Otherwise I say, I remember that very vividly and we don't want to go through that anymore.

[01:08:29] Well, like for instance with Hook, you know the principal actor in Hook,

[01:08:37] you couldn't... you had to come up with a different hook then.

[01:08:42] Uh...

[01:08:44] I had to come up with a different hook.

[01:08:48] Yeah, different hook voice or sort of speak.

[01:08:51] Well, over this way, we practiced the principles and we didn't...

[01:08:58] we recorded for whatever.

[01:09:01] And the thing is I was involved with the project.

[01:09:07] Well, I mean like what about Robin Williams who was like the star of the movie?

[01:09:11] I'm sure he's in there. I'm sure he's out there.

[01:09:14] But I mean you didn't do any lines for him.

[01:09:18] Well, I'm going to put it this way.

[01:09:21] If I was given permission, if I was given permission, okay.

[01:09:26] But this is how I was involved with the project.

[01:09:28] Well, like how often do you get permission and you have to patch up somebody?

[01:09:34] Well, it's not a matter of patch up.

[01:09:37] No, no.

[01:09:39] If they give me whatever lines they ask me to do and that's that.

[01:09:42] I don't... wherever they do with anything, that's up to them, wherever they put it,

[01:09:46] except to them.

[01:09:47] Don't forget, other people have to listen to that too to make certain that they're happy.

[01:09:50] So there's a lot to this.

[01:09:52] So if they're not happy, you know, they can take stuff out too, you know.

[01:09:56] Right.

[01:09:57] Yeah. So everyone has to be happy.

[01:09:59] In other words, it has to pass mustard.

[01:10:01] And people do count on me as I count on them to make certain that nothing would screw up.

[01:10:07] Remember that about that lawsuit?

[01:10:09] And a long time ago there was another lawsuit with a very famous singer on the ear.

[01:10:13] And they got, as we say, a sounder like.

[01:10:16] And they didn't go to her and get her permission.

[01:10:18] She didn't want to do it. And she sued and she won.

[01:10:21] So I'm saying, you have to be very, very careful with this.

[01:10:24] You know, in the reality wise. You know what I mean?

[01:10:26] But... Next question.

[01:10:30] Okay.

[01:10:32] Lithal Weapon 3.

[01:10:34] How are you involved with that one?

[01:10:37] Everything.

[01:10:39] Oh, you mean they didn't... couldn't get the principles for that?

[01:10:44] Well, they got me permission to do whatever... no.

[01:10:50] If they... if it's on there... if it's... if they're on there fine.

[01:10:55] It depends, as I said, as I said.

[01:10:57] Since... since...

[01:11:00] when they can get the principles they do.

[01:11:03] If not, and they get permission, and no one's PO'd, then I'm brought in.

[01:11:10] Well, like on that particular one, I mean, how much... you know, how much did you have...

[01:11:15] end up actually getting into the game?

[01:11:17] But when I'm recording, I'm recording.

[01:11:19] Now, whatever goes in there, that's somebody else's decision.

[01:11:22] So I don't know what... what's put in there.

[01:11:24] Okay.

[01:11:25] As long as I have permission, in other words, if you're giving me permission to do the stars, as we say, of Lithal Weapon.

[01:11:31] Okay. But you gotta get... you gotta... I have to have that permission, that's all.

[01:11:35] So is it like...

[01:11:37] It's... I don't get into that legality situation.

[01:11:41] I don't know what goes into that.

[01:11:43] What they have to talk to, who they have to talk to, what the situation is.

[01:11:46] I just go and say, okay, you got the rights to do this.

[01:11:50] So I get... I as I say, we get involved in the situation, and very specifically say, okay, you can do this.

[01:11:59] What they specifically say, no.

[01:12:02] You can do this, but you can't do that.

[01:12:04] Because whatever the powers that be said, something else.

[01:12:10] So I mean, is it typical that they'll have you record all the lines for all the principles for an entire machine,

[01:12:17] and then they'll just basically add it... they'll trim that down to just the stuff that they...

[01:12:23] that they couldn't get from the real principle or whatever.

[01:12:26] Well, the thing is... the thing is the front part is not knowing where I am,

[01:12:31] because I usually disappear in characters and the characters and things.

[01:12:34] The thing is, it's all... like anything else, it's just like doing a cartoon show, basically.

[01:12:40] And whatever... whatever script they give me, you know, okay, we'll do this, this, this, and this.

[01:12:46] Whatever goes into that, somebody else's decision.

[01:12:48] And that goes also with any legalities with...

[01:12:52] I don't know what... anything goes on in the layers.

[01:12:56] I said, I don't get involved in that area.

[01:12:58] But, that the thing is, they can count on me.

[01:13:01] That's the whole thing.

[01:13:02] And we don't step into anybody's toes.

[01:13:06] Like, for example, with that lethal weapon game,

[01:13:10] there was that the premiere and it was on television, and they said...

[01:13:16] they liked that one of the actors and they were screaming at them.

[01:13:20] It's amazing.

[01:13:21] And I called up and I said, I think that's me.

[01:13:25] And Joe said, you can't... you can't really say anything,

[01:13:28] because it'll piss off a couple of other people.

[01:13:31] You don't want to do that. You don't want to pee on anybody.

[01:13:33] So I said, okay, I'm not saying we would rather go at that,

[01:13:37] because you have to be professional too. You know what I mean?

[01:13:39] Right.

[01:13:40] There's a certain amount of artistic integrity, but you have to be professional.

[01:13:43] It'll be in the book. You know what I mean?

[01:13:45] Yeah.

[01:13:46] The stouter stuff will be in the book.

[01:13:48] Now, on Star Wars, what forces did you end up doing there?

[01:13:54] Okay.

[01:13:56] With once again, once again, I've been given a invitation.

[01:14:01] I am everybody on that believe it or not, you're not going to believe me.

[01:14:07] I am everybody except I, Trudin, and Princess Leopold.

[01:14:11] You mean that they actually got a broader robot?

[01:14:15] I said, I recorded it. Whatever they decided to put into that up to them.

[01:14:21] I recorded it, and I told you I recorded it, and you've got to keep it low key.

[01:14:26] I don't like that people get crazy with this, because you didn't even ask me how many voices do I have.

[01:14:31] Yes.

[01:14:33] You have over a thousand, right, or something?

[01:14:35] I'm curious. It said 787. It's about 780, 880, 990.

[01:14:39] I lost count already with that.

[01:14:41] I'm supposed to have 990 voices. Everyone said a thousand voices.

[01:14:45] No, no, no, 998, how funny or definite.

[01:14:48] Yeah, it kind of does.

[01:14:50] That's why I said, 998, because sometimes I have to come up with original stuff.

[01:14:54] Not just for the games, or anything. I don't like for commercials and things.

[01:14:59] I have to come up with different characters or whatever.

[01:15:02] I've got 998 voices, and it goes into all different areas, all different categories.

[01:15:11] You see, that's where the voice actors are.

[01:15:14] I've been called the voice master or whatever.

[01:15:17] That's what you go through.

[01:15:19] The thing is, I said, OK, I'm not going to say anything.

[01:15:22] When I record, it's another person's decision.

[01:15:26] I don't know what. I'm just there to do what I have to do.

[01:15:30] Somebody makes a decision what goes in that game.

[01:15:33] Hopefully it sounds good. For years it sounds good.

[01:15:36] What was the hardest voice that you ever had to?

[01:15:41] You would have to throw it out at me, would you?

[01:15:44] Like you haven't been asked that before.

[01:15:47] The hardest voice, my god.

[01:15:50] Oh, man.

[01:15:53] Let's see.

[01:15:55] There I had to do, I never had to do for a quote a game.

[01:16:01] Both.

[01:16:02] Both?

[01:16:03] Yeah.

[01:16:04] Let's see.

[01:16:05] Let's see now.

[01:16:07] Well, there's a couple of things.

[01:16:10] The real heart, let's see.

[01:16:12] Something that took like 35, 36 years.

[01:16:15] That's pretty tough.

[01:16:16] Yeah.

[01:16:17] That's Elmo in Sesame Street.

[01:16:20] Really?

[01:16:21] Yeah.

[01:16:22] Yeah.

[01:16:23] A very man-a-lose voice when I was, that took six months.

[01:16:30] Now, what did you need Barry Manellow's voice for?

[01:16:33] Just to do it.

[01:16:35] I got a challenge from some, but whatever.

[01:16:38] I, in some, he was doing karaoke.

[01:16:41] So the one you do, I write the songs.

[01:16:44] So in six months, I had his voice talking and doing and singing.

[01:16:51] Just to do it, just for the hell of it, just to see how, you know,

[01:16:56] how technical, you know.

[01:16:58] The hardest voice, god.

[01:17:00] Well, that's a, Elmo was pretty tough.

[01:17:04] Manellow took six months.

[01:17:07] I'm trying to think in what area?

[01:17:10] God.

[01:17:11] There's so many, right, my god.

[01:17:13] Can you sing in voice too?

[01:17:18] It depends on the person, the character.

[01:17:24] And the song has to be, it has to be the right song also.

[01:17:27] So it really depends.

[01:17:29] I'm not going to sing in Yoda's voice.

[01:17:31] No, no one can sing in Yoda's voice.

[01:17:33] I'm not going to sing.

[01:17:34] So get that audio mind.

[01:17:35] I know I'm going back to Yoda.

[01:17:37] Sometimes it depends.

[01:17:39] Yeah, it depends.

[01:17:40] It's got to be the right voice.

[01:17:42] It's also got to be the right song.

[01:17:44] It depends.

[01:17:45] Because a lot of the stuff, you know, doing out loud voices, it depends.

[01:17:50] Let's see.

[01:17:51] Another tough voice.

[01:17:52] Well, you know that I got a phone call one time from Joni says, by the way,

[01:17:55] do you do Jeff Goldblum's voice?

[01:17:58] And I said, no, I really don't.

[01:18:00] He's really better than I know it out.

[01:18:02] Now, how do you respond today?

[01:18:04] Do you do so?

[01:18:05] So I know I really don't really know how.

[01:18:08] What do you do?

[01:18:09] You learn.

[01:18:11] You learn.

[01:18:12] You learn.

[01:18:13] You're right.

[01:18:14] And he counts on me.

[01:18:15] He trusts me enough to be able to come up with it.

[01:18:18] And I did.

[01:18:19] That was for a close Jurassic Park.

[01:18:22] Now, what is like the strangest thing that you had to do a voice for?

[01:18:27] The strangest situation or movie or commercial?

[01:18:30] Let's see.

[01:18:33] There was the nice commercial I came for, Rat Pleisen.

[01:18:37] That was interesting.

[01:18:39] Yeah, I was for Rat Pleisen.

[01:18:41] But I was called...

[01:18:43] That was a product called Pow.

[01:18:45] These Rat Pleisen, I don't know, are the strangest.

[01:18:48] Okay, I got a phone call for one of my agents.

[01:18:50] You asked for it.

[01:18:51] It was for Orgy Sounds.

[01:18:54] Yeah, I was going to ask if you were working in the porn industry.

[01:18:57] No.

[01:18:58] Yeah, I sure you were.

[01:19:00] No, I don't want anyone to see my shortcomings.

[01:19:02] No.

[01:19:04] I got a call for one of my agents.

[01:19:06] And they actually wanted me to record for Orgy Sounds, for porn.

[01:19:12] And now your artistic integrity comes into play here.

[01:19:17] Come on, give me a play here.

[01:19:20] You know, you think you're going to pick up a couple of bucks?

[01:19:24] A couple of bucks.

[01:19:25] That's why it's you sound.

[01:19:27] Why would I want to do Orgy Sounds?

[01:19:31] So, we must say I said thanks, but no thanks.

[01:19:38] And there's another thing I'm going to bring up.

[01:19:42] No, there are inscrutious people in the world.

[01:19:45] And I got a call one time.

[01:19:49] Somebody wanted to use my abilities for evil purposes.

[01:19:54] I'm not kidding.

[01:19:58] You're talking about it.

[01:20:00] Think about it.

[01:20:01] Gee, get my hands on this guy.

[01:20:03] You know, really.

[01:20:05] But you want me to do some stuff?

[01:20:07] And I said, you know, that's really unethical.

[01:20:10] What was it?

[01:20:12] I'm not going to go into what it was, but trust me.

[01:20:15] Trust me.

[01:20:16] It was pretty bad.

[01:20:18] All right.

[01:20:19] Let's get back to the pinballs then, OK?

[01:20:21] OK, so the adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.

[01:20:24] No.

[01:20:25] No?

[01:20:26] No?

[01:20:27] Come on, this is your calling and you didn't take it?

[01:20:30] If they went to Bill Scott's son, Bill Scott Jr., you needed it.

[01:20:33] OK.

[01:20:34] They went to June for range, he did it.

[01:20:36] And that's that.

[01:20:38] OK.

[01:20:39] All right.

[01:20:40] Jurassic Park, we talked a little bit about this.

[01:20:42] Yeah.

[01:20:43] Yeah.

[01:20:44] Other than Gold.

[01:20:46] The Blue and Sam, the...

[01:20:48] Yeah.

[01:20:49] Yeah.

[01:20:50] That was interesting.

[01:20:51] That was a very interesting game.

[01:20:52] And I got a chance to do a demo which was presented in front of Steven Spielberg.

[01:20:58] It was just Spielberg.

[01:21:00] For now, for the game.

[01:21:02] This is back.

[01:21:03] This is 15 years ago, long time ago.

[01:21:07] Tales from the crypt.

[01:21:09] It's a rid of that they had the person to do him.

[01:21:12] But I can do the crypt keeper.

[01:21:14] Yeah.

[01:21:15] I could do that for sure.

[01:21:16] But that's not me.

[01:21:17] So it's not me on the game.

[01:21:18] No.

[01:21:36] They got the lights on me and everything.

[01:21:38] They want to hear stuff, you know.

[01:21:41] Right.

[01:21:42] Right.

[01:21:43] Yeah.

[01:21:44] You're always on stage, aren't you?

[01:21:46] Yeah.

[01:21:47] I'm getting out candy and right away.

[01:21:48] What did you do, Stan?

[01:21:49] Where were I, where the kids?

[01:21:51] Yeah.

[01:21:52] But then they come to the door with the, I came to the door and they had the mini cam with

[01:22:03] the lights and the whole brick.

[01:22:05] And they're recording.

[01:22:06] You know, I'm cameras.

[01:22:07] Oh, I hope they Halloween.

[01:22:08] Do something.

[01:22:09] What do you do?

[01:22:12] if

[01:22:14] you're stuck you know i need what you do

[01:22:16] i'd for the kids anyway you know

[01:22:18] maverick i know you did something that

[01:22:20] yeah okay what would you do a maverick

[01:22:23] once again the powers that make you any permission to do whatever i had to do

[01:22:27] but i'm not jody foster

[01:22:28] yeah i was gonna ask how good are you with female voices

[01:22:32] i'm not a female person that i have what i did do you just bunker

[01:22:37] on a commercial one of the word

[01:22:40] but i really don't do female voices i'm not a female impersonator

[01:22:43] so that's a completely different talent then huh well

[01:22:46] what the thing is the thing is there's

[01:22:49] female what the thing is

[01:22:52] if you're gonna do something a female

[01:22:55] vocal your minds will get it go to a female and do it

[01:22:58] and i can never example i cannot

[01:23:01] do

[01:23:02] but simpson

[01:23:04] nor do i pretend to do but simpson

[01:23:07] however

[01:23:08] because that says we got to show me how to

[01:23:11] go so i can show a woman how to get to that

[01:23:15] voice but i can't do it

[01:23:18] vocal because it's just not there on the other hand they can't do all the other

[01:23:21] stuff that i can do so it balances out so we let other people do that

[01:23:25] we let other people as first females concern what is a

[01:23:27] female situation you know they do what they have to do

[01:23:31] you know the powers that be as i say right

[01:23:34] yeah now are there i assume there's got to be

[01:23:37] equivalence female equivalence of you right

[01:23:42] a female equivalent of me let me think

[01:23:48] around here or united states i have another yes

[01:23:53] i have not met her yet no i would there was let's see no let me think no

[01:24:01] not even one of my cow no you're one of my other colleagues i didn't have

[01:24:04] to show her how to do some stuff see i'll say sometimes you get this one my

[01:24:08] car's car's like oh right i thought i'd

[01:24:09] gotta do this is what is it i got into the church lady i said so

[01:24:13] let's do the car to say i don't know any of the lines

[01:24:18] so i have to coach her and she goes in she won the audition

[01:24:22] i coached her she knew all the lines i showed her how it went and that was

[01:24:25] that but she did that and but i have to coach her even though it's almost like

[01:24:29] a male cross you know whatever right right but

[01:24:33] but you gotta help me so i have to be up to date with all this stuff you know

[01:24:37] so then she won the audition same thing with the person doing but

[01:24:41] they say that but i but then they say well i we don't have you at the

[01:24:44] twire that takes many many years to do what i do

[01:24:48] many many many years i'd like to take a break of talking with

[01:24:52] Fred young tonight on top cast and we'll be right back after this message

[01:24:57] deep in the forest of eastern canada you will find something

[01:25:01] groundbreaking and something that's very very pinball

[01:25:07] but something that's really really small

[01:25:12] presenting classic play field reproductions two guys in their basement

[01:25:18] we've got the passion we've got the gear and we've got the quality doing our

[01:25:22] very best to remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts

[01:25:28] classic play field reproductions

[01:25:33] play fields back glasses plastic sets

[01:25:41] on the web at classic play fields dot com

[01:25:44] all right we're back with Fred young a voice actor for many of our favorite

[01:25:48] pinball games here's one i know that you that you're gonna

[01:25:52] robin what space jam yes and no now you're gonna say yes and no well what

[01:26:00] happened was i got a phone call from john

[01:26:06] and he says hi all right as it fine and he says uh can you do uh you know

[01:26:16] bugs body and mireland the martian said sure no blank my god he had 1200

[01:26:22] voices you know that now so so use up on you by by 202

[01:26:28] yeah something like that yeah but he he actually created these characters you

[01:26:33] know and i said so i would that and we had really clear on the phone and

[01:26:39] really clear was doing this stuff because he was going to be on this thing

[01:26:43] and they said they asked me if i would do it and i said no

[01:26:50] yeah i can say no to right well why would you say no to this

[01:26:54] i'm getting to that i'm getting to that i said no the reason why is once again

[01:26:59] the power is with me i said i am not going to get these are actual

[01:27:04] you know they are the treasures of

[01:27:09] Warner brothers and no blank and everything and i'm not going to do something

[01:27:12] that's going to peel somebody without giving me the rights

[01:27:15] so the deal that situation when that situation came up not to

[01:27:19] not to undermine everybody they said well we'll record you

[01:27:24] and i said and i will take it over there for you know for whatever reason

[01:27:28] and suppose they don't like it i said that it won't be then it won't

[01:27:33] more have nothing to do with the game i said okay

[01:27:37] as long as you you know go to them and say hey what do you think you know what i

[01:27:42] mean right and that's in that circumstance there are other

[01:27:45] different structures once again i don't get involved in that area but i said no

[01:27:49] because right away you don't want to get in trouble

[01:27:51] the same thing when that thing happened back to the future i said no i'm not

[01:27:54] going to get in trouble with all these because none of them are not going to

[01:27:57] you know so it's you worry about that well you know you didn't really talk

[01:28:01] about the back the future incident one of that yeah that that yeah i'm

[01:28:05] i was involved in that trip and and was that a a problem game

[01:28:11] well uh not not for three but i did get involved that's that's

[01:28:17] way that's back in that's 18 years ago too it's just that

[01:28:21] once again you don't want to upset you don't want to upset any apple cut you don't

[01:28:25] want to make somebody feel uncomfortable or make somebody mad at you you don't

[01:28:30] want that you know what i mean because they'll come back at you you understand i'm

[01:28:33] saying yeah and as long you know Joe called me a

[01:28:39] predicate nine o'clock that a certain particular

[01:28:42] person didn't want to do it and i was just two lines

[01:28:45] and he wanted me to do it and i said no because i'm not going to get in trouble

[01:28:51] with god knows who you know and he says no no no you know

[01:28:55] everything would be taken care of you know but the power is that be what's

[01:28:57] going to be i said i said okay but i don't have a studio in the house i

[01:29:02] recorded on the cassette and then that's what happened there that was 18

[01:29:06] years ago so that's what happened there but

[01:29:10] uh there wasn't difficult for me but they were having problems i heard that

[01:29:14] 18 years ago you know it's a nice game you know whatever you know but it's got to

[01:29:20] right it gets around town certain things get around town very quickly you know at that time

[01:29:24] i'm sure it doesn't know too sure so you ended up did they end up approving your space jam

[01:29:30] they didn't say what what didn't they like nothing that i did

[01:29:38] that to that game so i say so that's why i have to say yes and no

[01:29:42] i swear i'm telling you the truth i know it's

[01:29:45] incredulous but remember uh whoever has whatever decisions and whatever

[01:29:51] situations come up i don't have that final decision i only i can i only do

[01:29:56] what they're asking to do and then then it's out of my hands completely and a final

[01:30:01] decision came up and it wasn't me so that's what happened there i'm telling you the truth

[01:30:08] no i think yes and no i did require i don't know where that session is either i think brine

[01:30:12] must have it in the lock and piece and what i don't know now what about the star wars trilogy

[01:30:19] which one well there was they they had the original star wars game and then they came out with one

[01:30:26] four years later that was star wars trilogy uh the the the the the the the the the original i am

[01:30:34] involved with the original star wars game and that was the only one i

[01:30:40] that was involved with starship troopers yes tell me about that one well once again i'm over

[01:30:49] brine house and because i didn't see the i didn't see any movie or anything so they had to tell

[01:30:57] me what was going basically sometimes i'd ever see the movies or anything you know and it was at the

[01:31:04] which is have to tell me what's what's going on so i'm out of walkie talkie in the back yard with

[01:31:11] brine and we're doing some some recordings and by the way you didn't even ask me what i do these

[01:31:17] recordings is does actually approval come up for some of these lines and things yes and it

[01:31:23] doesn't come for me and that's handled by somebody else also so that's that's the other thing

[01:31:29] everything has to be on the up and up you know what i mean so but as if the powers that be and that's

[01:31:33] the story and i'm keeping too bad you know but we i forgot i know it was some nondescript stuff

[01:31:41] but i was involved in that in that game trip and you know and nothing i missed preface by saying

[01:31:47] this and i think it's wonderful that you're interviewing me and it's a pleasure to ask you

[01:31:51] play but you guys really know more about these games i mean from the pinball thing i did get calls

[01:31:57] to do video games and redemption games to i'm also on a few other thing if you have a

[01:32:04] other types of games but you guys are the experts you guys know who does the artwork and who best

[01:32:09] electronics and who best verse and who's been bad and who did them the play feel and whatever

[01:32:14] the heck it is i don't know any of the stuff yeah but the weird thing is like your name doesn't come

[01:32:22] in any of the credits on any of the online stuff you know that's fine that you're okay with that

[01:32:30] yeah yeah i'm okay with that shit it's nothing and the people know the people know

[01:32:39] no the people that don't that don't know that's fine with me because the fun thing is

[01:32:46] is that him isn't it and that's where the fun stuff comes in because you'll never you'll never

[01:32:53] know i don't like to actually show you where where i am that'll be in the book someday too i

[01:32:59] obviously but that's okay with me that's that's fine with me because i'm hurt all over the world

[01:33:11] and as i said at the seminar that's pretty nice you know what i think about that i'm hurt all

[01:33:18] over the world now how many other people can actually say that they're hurt all over the world

[01:33:25] and somebody else made mention of something which i don't know if it's true or not but they said

[01:33:31] you know it's probably a Guinness book world record that you're on more pinball machines in the

[01:33:36] entire world than anybody i said yeah but that's nice to know but if i thought i'm hurt all over the

[01:33:44] world all right that's kind of nice you know it's kind of i and besides it's a tribute to my

[01:33:51] talent the ability in acting and everything because remember when you're on camera you can do all

[01:33:55] kinds of little tricks and understand the other thing and you can do expressions when it's just

[01:33:59] you in the mic you have to do it vocally i have to do it with my voice with the acting and everything

[01:34:06] because without the acting it just doesn't come through now what would voice are you most proud of

[01:34:12] boy that i'm most proud of hmm it's an interesting question uh let's as well

[01:34:19] almost pretty technical it took there 36 years to do um i don't know they're all my they're all my

[01:34:27] friends i really um most proud of boy that's a that's an interesting question that is kind of

[01:34:36] interesting i have to say i have to say all of them no the reason why sometimes i have to create

[01:34:44] this stuff but that's not the question that comes up normally normally i get with the highest

[01:34:50] voice in the world the world is pretty difficult almost pretty difficult um what the question

[01:34:57] that mostly comes up which you'll find interesting is do you go through with all these people

[01:35:06] on these shows go through like american idol or dancing with the star you know where they're

[01:35:12] constantly belated and criticize you and you know you go in you know good you know you know

[01:35:18] you know what you end my god america's got talent you know whether whether we actually

[01:35:23] take the bag and just stand you know whatever you are you know good you know they give you the

[01:35:26] buzzer you know good you stinkin all that no that really doesn't happen what an agent calls

[01:35:32] me up and one of my agents calls me up they know i'm professional i go in whether i get it or not

[01:35:37] that's that's not me it's up to decision of the producer whatever it's up to whoever's

[01:35:42] a commercial whatever that somebody else says okay i want this person this person if they don't

[01:35:46] choose me well i have a standard phrase you know my phrases what they have no taste

[01:35:54] well here's one you know when you've got these 998 voices now can you go back i mean once you learn

[01:36:03] a voice is that burned into your memory forever can you go back and recall that voice and do it

[01:36:10] again at any point yeah really yeah i have what's called an autobiographic memory which i had to

[01:36:18] understand that for a while i can hear a little more distinctively than a lot of people i can hear

[01:36:23] a new one from and sometimes i have to now blanket it does buckle and true headed domestic

[01:36:29] had against it who's down mess it grow he was the original voice of school be do and he was also

[01:36:34] astro on the jetsons and if you listen to astro on the jetsons remember astro on the jetsons

[01:36:39] you heard the same thing in school you do right yeah but i gave you that key you know

[01:36:44] you sometimes i need to hear i need to hear since sometimes it depends on how hard you have to

[01:36:48] practice to make it look effortless you know what i mean and then i have another i have other

[01:36:54] techniques and things i'm not going to tell you all of my secrets that it's a lot of listening

[01:36:59] i write a rehearsal i'm a lot of practice practice practice practice and a lot of a lot of

[01:37:08] you know like the counterpart with jose says uh get some information you know and i have to go

[01:37:15] and get videotapes or not the DVDs or whatever i have videos and things still just to see you know

[01:37:21] just to just to rehearse and practice but yeah i can recall it i can record very quickly

[01:37:30] now do you uh and to figure out you know do you have to practice by in front of a tape recorder

[01:37:37] because of the way you hear yourself is slightly different than the way it sounds recorded

[01:37:42] everybody has a head tone you have a head tone everyone and everyone hears differently

[01:37:49] i found that after many many years of doing things i'm also part of a book i'm also in a book called

[01:37:55] the business of voiceovers a child's foot it's not the other child's foot's a child's foot

[01:38:00] at Columbia College he passed away a number of years ago that's where about two years ago

[01:38:05] and he was my colleague and friend and i was guest lecture over at the acting voiceover class

[01:38:13] at Columbia and that was one of the things when they heard themselves on the air they said yeah

[01:38:18] that's me you have a head tone now i have to know how i sound which middle at that time had to know

[01:38:25] how he sounds i have to go past that to make certain and then i record myself and see what's going on

[01:38:33] when the time you're in the studio now with the digital technology we have today they control it

[01:38:37] you know i i want to hear that last line and i can hear myself and i said well i maybe i have

[01:38:42] a tweak a little bit we have to do something somehow i don't some other focus you understand i'm

[01:38:46] saying right yeah i you have everyone who's differently and it depends on the context that

[01:38:52] they're hearing it okay so when you hear these things coming out of me that's what that's what

[01:38:59] that's people crazy they're all of a sudden you know like last week what am i near this kid

[01:39:05] also they're bang at my brain what the heck is this and they're saying trick-a-treatish

[01:39:09] you guys talk right get out of here and they said would you do me a favor what would you do

[01:39:13] Homer let's get out of here you got me i'm busy doing what you do Homer not not when the kids you

[01:39:21] can't disappoint kids can you you could yeah i can't come on you get clear you say yeah

[01:39:29] they're having them no no no no you can't disappoint kids so i do then they start laughing you

[01:39:34] know and then they want to hear the family guy you know you know here's two of your brine or something

[01:39:41] he can't disappoint it's just that then man how do you do that nicely very well thank you

[01:39:48] what are you supposed to you can you teach me to do that uh no i see a thing in the class

[01:39:57] i can show you and then some of us to go to the class i still got called him i can show you

[01:40:02] different acting techniques but during voices you do it when you don't and if you can do it

[01:40:09] you find if you can't do it fine too you know everyone has their limits uh

[01:40:19] everyone had it vocally everyone has their limits but everyone hears differently so i have to

[01:40:23] get past that head tone and it takes many many many years to get past that so i have to know how

[01:40:31] i sound for example if we'll go back to home and our home is then castling at it and i work with

[01:40:38] him back in eighty six and he was with the second city ectc troop and i got called to do an

[01:40:46] industrial as we said industrial recording and they brought him in and i did the press and

[01:40:51] wall the crank i because we called wall the crankcase and he did the success alone and Aaron Freeman

[01:40:57] the waiter and Freeman's in the back and listening laughing his head off as we're going through this

[01:41:01] and i met him and that is wife my home is voice if you let the key to home it's really

[01:41:08] well in that value we want to map out what's going on oh yeah sure sure remember the odd couple

[01:41:12] yes think about that now think about the odd couple voice okay yeah Felix i can't take it

[01:41:20] Felix i'm backing up that's actually Homer if you think about it you get the key you get

[01:41:28] the you see the similarities yeah yeah i do and originally when band with Homer you sounded like

[01:41:36] rather than about it was like oh my god what are we going to do today there we have to do something

[01:41:44] then he says i can't sustain that for thirteen weeks thirteen weeks nineteen twenty years later

[01:41:50] right so what he did was he raised it here and there became the normal Homer Simpson Bush

[01:41:56] you know the year every day they huh so you so these are the tricks to come up with a new voice

[01:42:05] something yeah that's one of the one of my tech i have other techniques but that's one of the

[01:42:10] things and you when you example you'll be there you wouldn't remember you'll be there sure okay

[01:42:16] you know who that was no not a clue i'm going to tell you think about it you see the hat

[01:42:22] you visualize the hat you see the hat on the set you see the bow tie right you know who that

[01:42:26] was that does but the boosted out this what he based on i's karni huh think about it

[01:42:34] hey what they buy right right hey boo boo like there was just a ranger sir right that see what i mean

[01:42:42] yeah and that's with some of the other characters came from leave it in that again back to that

[01:42:50] question i have to get past that head tone and that takes many many years and a lot of practice

[01:42:56] for make it look i make it look easy don't i want to go in and out of the voice right right right

[01:43:01] yeah i make it look like anybody can do it right yeah well i know that it's not the case

[01:43:07] no i found out later it wasn't the case yeah i thought well you know and something really tricky

[01:43:14] like almost voice now i'll do almost for you right now and i'm going to tell you right now i just

[01:43:19] take 36 years and i'm not Kevin clash he does the voice of emel i'm just doing it i'm just doing

[01:43:27] it in a mimic and impression of it okay okay okay i'm going to do ammo for you right now all right

[01:43:33] then i'll get freaked out by this please and this will show you i'm difficult i'll show you i'll show

[01:43:39] you trick right now you ready yeah all right yeah i'm ready it's the same time it's a three yeah

[01:43:47] it's a three sometimes a special and i'm a new one

[01:43:55] now why what makes that voice so difficult because it's breathy you're okay let's see you do it

[01:44:04] yeah you're you're not going to see me do it i know i know it's it's that it's what we call a trick trick

[01:44:11] voice okay and to do it thanks many many years of practice practice practice practice practice

[01:44:19] now what did the original actor that did it i mean did he still does it he still operates

[01:44:23] oh my left Kevin clash yeah yeah does did is it something that comes natural to him obviously

[01:44:29] because we're not talking em is voice over time i don't know but he doesn't do any other voices

[01:44:34] that's the only voice he has i have to go beyond that and do it but do these other things that

[01:44:39] was just part of my package of tricks through the years but it was pretty well but turned it on isn't it

[01:44:47] yeah it's nice that you could like slip on a dime you know and you're in you're doing it oh well

[01:44:52] it depends on how long you have to sustain it too you know no i can i can keep it up you know

[01:44:58] somebody asked me uh Elmo would you record from my answer machine and i said yeah i got this

[01:45:03] yes yes we have got this many of you pretty well uh now what okay let's get back to some of

[01:45:12] these games uh Harley-Davidson yes for Harley-Davidson okay what basically you're the whole game yeah

[01:45:21] yeah yeah and one of the voices had to be changed because it was too good what do you mean

[01:45:28] well you see everyone here's differently and so when it when the powers that be heard it

[01:45:34] remember it has to whatever that's out of my hands once i record i don't know what's going on

[01:45:38] and whatever over there they just heard something that sounded like somebody else and i had to

[01:45:47] re-record some stuff but the thing is i wasn't doing anybody that i thought i was doing so and

[01:45:53] that's why i say everyone here's differently understand what i'm saying yeah so they heard

[01:45:56] they heard something that maybe we didn't think that they kind of left here and almost sounded

[01:46:02] like like somebody they didn't want in the game or something never didn't want in the game and

[01:46:07] i wasn't doing it so that's why i get to that point everyone who's differently sure now at this

[01:46:13] point we changed gears to the news to the current stern company and you're you're still involved

[01:46:18] with them right oh sure okay and now so now on some of like let's take a title like

[01:46:32] get the principal if they can right right right and besides there's certain as I said there's

[01:46:36] certain rules and regulations that i don't get involved in and of course we're abide by those

[01:46:42] rules and regulations you know we don't you know big it's you know whoever's at the right now

[01:53:00] yeah who is he still here's my money back on the stock redden

[01:53:08] yeah well okay here's the one that i'm dying to know about and i really hope you can say

[01:53:15] you can say yes to this one Elvis did you do anything in Elvis no all man why not

[01:53:22] why not why not because they had somebody in there that was a true obviously Elvis impersonator and

[01:53:43] i was not involved in the project gotta be professional i was not involved in the project sorry not

[01:53:50] everyone is right for every part think of trying to get more and some livia god rest the soul to be

[01:53:57] to be uh doing uh uh then canobean uh star wars not everyone is right for every part

[01:54:04] he wouldn't be a more and some really a great actor wasn't too easy but he wouldn't be good as rocky

[01:54:09] all right okay continue you gotta get him up through this uh yeah pirates of the Caribbean

[01:54:15] yes what what how are you involved with that one well that in this time and that's my 30th game

[01:54:25] and i am not i am not the Johnny Depp character no i am uh big squealing i'm a parrot and um all the other

[01:54:36] pirates and all that as i said how to be taken care with other people say you can do this you

[01:54:42] can do that you can't do this you can't do that now why would they have you do Johnny no they

[01:54:48] no somebody else is doing that why because that because once again and i said if somebody if the

[01:54:57] legality's i don't know what the legality's are why because you don't say well i'm gonna do it

[01:55:04] in the heck no you can't do that because you see who dictates certain policies okay and there's

[01:55:13] so many different people that are involved outside of what i do i don't ever said once again i don't

[01:55:20] know well do they have like two actors have um you know voice doubles that they they want people to

[01:55:28] use yes probably so yeah but what that is as i said i don't get involved if they say we

[01:55:36] they have somebody has to do that that's fine and then even i stay out of it i'm not involved

[01:55:41] as far as that's concerned because there's a lot there's a lot as i said you'd have to call with

[01:55:48] the you know it's like everything else you're allowed to do certain things and if i'm like

[01:55:58] i record all that stuff for space jam but nothing went in it there's no i'm saying because the

[01:56:03] powers that be said they had other ideas they had other situations or people or whatever so i

[01:56:09] say fine and then i don't make waves or anything because that wouldn't be that wouldn't be a professional

[01:56:16] right yeah it would not be professional as far as the grout is a concern it probably has to go

[01:56:22] into the reality but that's okay that's okay that's okay but everything as i said has to be

[01:56:30] you know if it's not there it's not there you don't start making waves you don't want to do that

[01:56:36] because then there's a people in trouble and you don't want to get me in trouble and i don't want to

[01:56:40] get in trouble that as i said that happened i wasn't almost involved with lawsuit but i didn't want

[01:56:43] that to happen and i got into it got very festie and i'm not going into whatever i just want you

[01:56:49] know it's trouble when you bring subpoena right and you don't want to go through that so i'm just

[01:56:54] saying you're asking me why because that's the way other individuals which i'm not in control with

[01:57:02] want sit you know you wouldn't say you wouldn't say hey uh other whatever i want mr.

[01:57:11] mr. lucas rigid right i mean if certain other individuals are big-time policy that's fine

[01:57:19] and i do not you know one time just to let you know one time i received a phone call

[01:57:32] from from another another person was a protection officer in town and they want to maybe do

[01:57:38] something in regard to a Disney character and right away i said we're gonna get sued he says i

[01:57:43] know i know i said you know you know we're gonna get sued it didn't it's subsequently it didn't

[01:57:50] go and i said no because of that situation and i said that as i said no no no you don't want to

[01:57:59] you don't want to bother with that you know and that's why i don't get into that area but i can say

[01:58:07] no if i want to but as i said i it's one for being proud because they see when people trust you

[01:58:16] that's most important thing and they never have professional to say hey it didn't work okay

[01:58:26] no what about family guy uh no that was an awful slow no

[01:58:34] you know you like that slow no don't you yeah the reason why okay okay i originally for whatever

[01:58:43] when the when the situation came up and you know it was always talks and things you know what i mean

[01:58:47] yeah and i basically said you know who the person who who does those voices you know who that

[01:58:56] person is i'm sure and i said you know let them do it unless something else comes up where they

[01:59:05] say they don't want to do whatever you want that's another story but that's why i said no now can

[01:59:12] i can i do family guy voices oh yeah so that's where that's where you see that's where the

[01:59:21] once again if you want me to do i'll show you how those how they how they go if not that the

[01:59:27] you know it's another time it's another area of as we so expertise that i could show you how those

[01:59:34] voices go any but as i said i'm once again i'm not the person who actually does that i'm just

[01:59:41] showing you i'm just showing that i can't do it but i'm i separate voices at one all times i'm

[01:59:46] impersonating as far as this is concerned these characters you know that's that's you know that's

[01:59:51] the that's the prime joy it's like you know you don't want to go out you know you don't want to bother

[01:59:56] them you know but now you'd like to hear some family guy stuff huh oh of course of course

[02:00:02] clean stuff of course right yeah of course yeah sure lowest shallots see how can i do this

[02:00:08] how can i really say this i'll always shine blind the dog oh i'll do that line that i do this

[02:00:14] oh blind it's terrible you know that's tried don't have to show it all that back there's got big

[02:00:17] faces yes i do Peter i know that one really well i like that white you know

[02:00:25] you so stupid you know that you tell me he's got out of that sector he says well first of all i

[02:00:30] don't know what that means in second of all and always shall i do that

[02:00:36] yeah then you want to hear stew now right yeah oh that's the uh

[02:00:40] uh uh brown yeah what is it stewie if anybody has any question at this is the bottom

[02:00:47] the uh who's that fist over there that your father stewie that's i mean who's that

[02:00:52] the other uh so over all the voices you do what is i mean what's the one that you have the most

[02:00:59] fun with oh my god most fun with yeah uh most fun with how would you like to live with this

[02:01:10] How would you like to live with this, right?

[02:01:12] Oh, great, thank you, dear voice.

[02:01:15] You don't understand the kind of trouble I'm with?

[02:01:20] There's gotta be one that you're just...

[02:01:22] You always are out of fun.

[02:01:25] It depends on what I'm doing.

[02:01:28] One day I was talking to Bugs Bunny's voice all day for some reason, some strange and explainable reason.

[02:01:35] So it just got the madness because you get tired of doing that.

[02:01:39] As far as most fun is concerned, they're all pretty much a lot of fun, depending on circumstances.

[02:01:46] But sometimes, sometimes it gets a little crazy.

[02:01:53] You know what I mean?

[02:01:55] Okay, well here's a better question than what's the best practical joke you've ever come up with using a voice?

[02:02:00] Oh, I don't do that. Well, I'll put it this way.

[02:02:03] When I was...

[02:02:05] When I was running with the best one?

[02:02:08] Yeah, yeah.

[02:02:09] Is this off the record?

[02:02:10] No.

[02:02:12] No, but I'm not gonna tell you.

[02:02:14] Oh, come on.

[02:02:15] When I was 13, 14, I called about hotel as a celebrity.

[02:02:20] To see how far I can get away with.

[02:02:22] I won't tell you what hotel I won't tell you what celebrity, but they went nuts.

[02:02:26] What do you mean they went nuts?

[02:02:28] They actually thought it was him on the phone.

[02:02:31] You were 13, so this was like a million years ago. Come on.

[02:02:35] Yeah, I'm not gonna tell you.

[02:02:37] I'm not gonna tell you.

[02:02:38] And I never called back the hotel.

[02:02:40] What you're still worried about it to this day?

[02:02:42] No, no, no.

[02:02:43] But that's what I don't really...

[02:02:44] When you get...

[02:02:45] When you're a professor, you don't pay practical jokes, but I will tell you what happened a couple of times.

[02:02:49] I'll tell you how some of this stuff gets ridiculous, okay?

[02:02:55] This is true now.

[02:02:57] Outside of the realm.

[02:02:59] Okay.

[02:03:00] I was getting an obscene phone call.

[02:03:04] A couple of obscene phone calls are living in Chicago.

[02:03:07] And I got to a point where I usually slam the phone.

[02:03:10] It'd be disgusting.

[02:03:11] You know what I mean?

[02:03:12] I mean, absolutely disgusting.

[02:03:13] So finally I said, if the next guy that calls me up, I'm gonna fix him for the rest of his natural life.

[02:03:19] Three o'clock in the morning, the phone ring, if I swear to you this picture.

[02:03:24] And I'm cleaning this up a little bit, okay?

[02:03:27] But he said, Basie was gonna kill me and kill my whole family.

[02:03:31] Okay.

[02:03:34] I wake up real fast.

[02:03:36] I've been tired of coming out of my wifey's, coming out of my husband.

[02:03:39] So what did I do?

[02:03:42] What did I do?

[02:03:44] And not a clue.

[02:03:46] I did Randy Dangerfield.

[02:03:50] I did Randy Dangerfield get arrested so I was doing an impression of Randy Dangerfield.

[02:03:54] He probably was talking about me.

[02:03:57] I'm like, you know what I said?

[02:03:59] I mean, you got trouble.

[02:04:00] I do this part.

[02:04:01] My wife, ooh, my wife, oh she drives me nuts, ooh, my wife.

[02:04:05] It's a long Mr. Dangerfield turn it very slowly.

[02:04:07] It's just a put on.

[02:04:08] I'm just...

[02:04:10] I'm sorry, you see my wife, ooh.

[02:04:12] I'm talking about the birds and the bees, you talking about my wife and the butcher.

[02:04:15] You know what I'm doing on all these lines, all these stuff, because I saw him perform in Vegas.

[02:04:19] And I had the guy going for 20 minutes and finally the guy was saying, listen, I'm a sick person.

[02:04:24] I do this.

[02:04:25] I punch up numbers on a keypad, just take me know whatever.

[02:04:29] So I had this guy going for 20 minutes.

[02:04:31] Like, my goal was every move, she was literally out of the way.

[02:04:34] I was like, he asked me how I got to say, she was a true buyer.

[02:04:36] That's where we were bumping over here and it's a bumping back over her head, brakes.

[02:04:40] Oh, she had picked his under her armpits.

[02:04:42] I let the pet of cat in with the head and her legs.

[02:04:45] I took her to a dog show.

[02:04:46] She walked out with two blue ribbons.

[02:04:48] A couple of guys, broken through apartments, she had not raped.

[02:04:51] They all don't know.

[02:04:53] So I mean...

[02:04:54] The Empire State building, claims started to attack her.

[02:04:57] Look up ugly in the picture, there's her picture.

[02:04:59] I think I got going for 20 minutes.

[02:05:01] So this is what happened.

[02:05:02] This is the kicker, the whole thing.

[02:05:03] He said, I'm terribly sorry.

[02:05:04] He thought he was calling some hotel.

[02:05:06] He didn't know he's that guy.

[02:05:07] You know, sick person, he says, I'm terribly sorry.

[02:05:11] And so I said the main line that drove him nuts.

[02:05:13] The main line was, oh yeah, like a news point.

[02:05:15] We had done the whole line enough.

[02:05:16] We traced this call.

[02:05:17] He left down the scene.

[02:05:18] We know we are. We're coming to get you.

[02:05:20] This is the office.

[02:05:22] Blood curving screen.

[02:05:23] Ah!

[02:05:25] Ah! He went nuts.

[02:05:27] Now the guy starts crying to me over the phone.

[02:05:30] Please, please, please, though.

[02:05:31] So I got news point.

[02:05:32] We know we are coming to get you.

[02:05:33] And the fear and fear of the island tracing this call.

[02:05:36] So the guy went nuts.

[02:05:37] Oh please, Mr. Danger, please don't touch us.

[02:05:40] Do you mean, I'm not going to do this again, I...

[02:05:42] You know what I'm going to do this again, I...

[02:05:43] No, no, no, I'm not going to do this again.

[02:05:44] Well, certainly, because we know we are.

[02:05:46] We're going to come to get you.

[02:05:47] You know the guy never called me back.

[02:05:50] Well, then you were successful.

[02:05:53] Another time I had some kids calling me.

[02:05:57] And they were around.

[02:05:59] She too, these kids, in fact, they had a recute.

[02:06:01] I told them I was a police officer.

[02:06:03] I used to be stopped.

[02:06:04] They didn't stop.

[02:06:05] It's a family I called the phone company.

[02:06:06] I told them what I do.

[02:06:08] And they say, well, what do you want to do?

[02:06:09] And the protrusor?

[02:06:10] I said, no, no.

[02:06:11] Let them call me one more time.

[02:06:12] What are you going to do?

[02:06:13] I'm going to give them the nightmare they never had in their life.

[02:06:15] So they called me up.

[02:06:17] And then I said, excuse me, something wants to talk to you.

[02:06:20] So who did I put on the phone?

[02:06:24] I put Freddie Krueger from the nightmare in Elm Street.

[02:06:27] I'm scared they're living crap out of me.

[02:06:33] You want to know what I did?

[02:06:35] Yeah.

[02:06:36] I was supposed to push me.

[02:06:38] If you ever call this phone number again,

[02:06:43] I will tear a lip of flesh from your bones.

[02:06:48] And they never called me back?

[02:06:52] You notice that I don't really get too many prank calls.

[02:06:55] I think you get them all.

[02:06:57] No, I don't get any prank calls anymore.

[02:06:59] No, I used to.

[02:07:01] Not anymore.

[02:07:02] They know better.

[02:07:04] You started with me?

[02:07:06] You started with me? Come on.

[02:07:08] Oh, go ahead.

[02:07:09] All right, wait.

[02:07:10] That was a long time ago.

[02:07:12] That was like 24 years ago or something.

[02:07:16] But these kids thought they were, you know,

[02:07:18] that of your new phone number and, you know, that time.

[02:07:20] At that time, now it's so, you know,

[02:07:22] rigid you can tell from caller ID was calling you, you know what I mean?

[02:07:25] Right.

[02:07:26] So now there's not that that limited in all these

[02:07:29] all these nonsensical ridiculous calls because now you got caller ID.

[02:07:32] So that really, even if you don't, you can always hit the dash 69

[02:07:35] and get the phone number.

[02:07:37] Yes.

[02:07:38] Unless they hit whatever you can always put a trace right at things like that too.

[02:07:41] And somebody was pranking me,

[02:07:43] but I put a stop to that too.

[02:07:45] They were just stupid pranks and everything.

[02:07:47] But I see they, unfortunately, I recorded it

[02:07:50] and I played it for the phone company.

[02:07:52] You see, they were stupid enough to do that.

[02:07:54] And I had my hands machined, so I recorded.

[02:07:56] They thought that that was funny, you know.

[02:07:58] That happened too.

[02:07:59] But that's a long time ago too.

[02:08:01] That's 10, 15 years ago, you know.

[02:08:04] That's true.

[02:08:05] Yeah, some of this stuff.

[02:08:06] Now another funny thing happened.

[02:08:08] I mean, certain other things happened.

[02:08:11] Even at my mom's funeral, God rest her soul.

[02:08:14] Certain things happened.

[02:08:15] When I was called and I, you want me to say about that very briefly,

[02:08:18] I'm at my mom's funeral.

[02:08:20] And before the funeral, you know, I'm thinking that I'm not thinking correctly.

[02:08:25] So I wanted this funeral pilot to call the cemetery.

[02:08:31] And how did I get them to do that?

[02:08:33] Because they said, well, you have to call yourself.

[02:08:35] Well, I don't want to do that.

[02:08:36] So what did I do?

[02:08:37] I did some voices for them.

[02:08:38] And I was a little older, whatever, for them.

[02:08:41] Well, let me tell you.

[02:08:43] But they had a funeral.

[02:08:45] You're not going to believe this.

[02:08:47] I swear to you, this is the truth.

[02:08:49] The owner.

[02:08:50] And I'm sitting there and I'm upset.

[02:08:52] You know, my mom always said you're a great voice master.

[02:08:55] Never give up, you know.

[02:08:57] Because you know, sometimes you think about hanging it up.

[02:08:59] You know, you think about, hey, you know, I can do other things.

[02:09:02] Not any.

[02:09:03] Right.

[02:09:05] But the owner comes over to me and he said, I want it to meet you.

[02:09:09] Now remember, I got people behind me.

[02:09:11] I got actors, actors, producers, music producers.

[02:09:14] My music producers behind me.

[02:09:15] Everyone's upset.

[02:09:16] This guy comes over and he says, I want to just meet you

[02:09:19] because you have embraced all of us.

[02:09:22] I said, oh, they're all here in the tobacco.

[02:09:26] What did they know?

[02:09:27] Now, I was like, what does Fred do?

[02:09:28] What did he know?

[02:09:29] I wanted to meet you because you were embraced.

[02:09:31] I was like, well, surely they could deal with death all the time.

[02:09:34] You know, and you did stuff for us.

[02:09:36] You did voices for us.

[02:09:37] And I just wanted to show you.

[02:09:39] You see, I got a Scooby-Doo watch.

[02:09:42] That's nice.

[02:09:45] And I got Scooby-Doo socks on.

[02:09:48] You had a showman with Scooby-Doo watch.

[02:09:51] I was doing Scooby-Doo also for them.

[02:09:53] You know, you know.

[02:09:54] Yeah.

[02:09:55] No, no, no, no, no.

[02:09:58] A finesse Scooby-Doo want a snack?

[02:10:00] Yeah. Watch out for that dog.

[02:10:02] Move, move, move, move, move, move.

[02:10:04] Move, move, move, move, move.

[02:10:06] You had a show with me and I got people.

[02:10:08] Now people come over.

[02:10:09] What the hell were you doing?

[02:10:10] What the hell's going on?

[02:10:11] Right?

[02:10:12] I did a couple of, I turned around.

[02:10:14] I said, I did a couple of voices for them.

[02:10:15] And they were in the power of my hand.

[02:10:17] I don't know.

[02:10:18] True.

[02:10:19] I swear to you, it's true.

[02:10:21] And they got with you know something happened last year.

[02:10:24] Very strange.

[02:10:28] I met somebody else's.

[02:10:30] One of my friends, the one I did the last degree for, her, her friends, son.

[02:10:36] He had a drip from here indeed.

[02:10:39] 28 years old was not born there.

[02:10:41] Yeah.

[02:10:42] So I went there to pay my respects.

[02:10:45] And, a lot about the blah, and next day's going to be a funeral.

[02:10:50] And subsequently, they said, you want you a luncheon later.

[02:10:55] But you don't have to be one of the Paul Bears.

[02:10:57] I subsequently became one of the Paul Bears because somebody didn't show up.

[02:11:00] That's another story.

[02:11:02] So now it's about 9 o'clock, 9.15 o'clock, 9.30.

[02:11:05] Now they have an open casket.

[02:11:08] Okay?

[02:11:09] You got that?

[02:11:10] Yeah.

[02:11:11] And a certain amount of decor.

[02:11:13] You know what I mean?

[02:11:14] Yeah.

[02:11:15] But, you know this here, right?

[02:11:17] The great, the great, the great, the great, the great, right?

[02:11:19] Uh huh.

[02:11:20] It's about 9.30.

[02:11:21] I swear to God, too.

[02:11:23] All of a sudden, and you got a, you got a person lying there.

[02:11:27] And right away, well, do some, do some voices.

[02:11:30] We're going to do some, uh, had a funeral.

[02:11:34] I said, you know, a little reverence here, a little decorum.

[02:11:40] This is, you know, there's a time and a place for everything.

[02:11:43] Yeah, they're going to break them and not need them.

[02:11:45] And not need them.

[02:11:46] There's a place for lying there.

[02:11:49] There's a pattern, not like a sketch from a sign, though, right?

[02:11:52] There's a place for lying there.

[02:11:54] And you love me to do, yeah, do a lie.

[02:11:56] Yeah, do, do, do a lie.

[02:11:58] Yeah, do some stuff.

[02:11:59] Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead, do a bug spot, you want to...

[02:12:01] There's a place for lying there.

[02:12:03] I subsequently couldn't leave unless I did one.

[02:12:09] So I did one voice, and that was that.

[02:12:11] Okay?

[02:12:12] Swear to Raddy's the truth.

[02:12:15] I was, uh, ever called him for jury duty.

[02:12:19] Yeah, yeah.

[02:12:20] Oh, isn't that a trip?

[02:12:21] Yeah.

[02:12:22] Yeah.

[02:12:23] Well, I get called him, and I'm sitting there.

[02:12:28] And you got to write down what you do.

[02:12:32] So the judge is questioning, and then I come to me, the judge.

[02:12:37] And he says, I see, uh...

[02:12:40] And this is a judge.

[02:12:43] And he says, what does it mean that you're a voice artist, the voice master?

[02:12:49] What is that?

[02:12:52] You could have heard a pin drop in that court, and then all the eyes shift to me.

[02:12:59] You know what I mean?

[02:13:00] I can see in the movies where all the eyes look, zoom in on you.

[02:13:05] And somebody else said, you didn't get a court of law.

[02:13:09] Come on, I said, of course not.

[02:13:12] So I had to give an explanation, so the judge says, oh, you do looping for like movies.

[02:13:16] That's something like that.

[02:13:18] Yeah, something like that.

[02:13:19] And I let it go.

[02:13:23] And then of course, the restaurant things.

[02:13:26] I'm having lunch at a restaurant with one of my colleagues.

[02:13:30] And all of a sudden, this person, the person, excuse me,

[02:13:34] or a true friend, you know, I said, yes I am.

[02:13:37] I choose the one that best of the voice is in the acting.

[02:13:40] Well, I heard you over at Sweet Tomatoes,

[02:13:45] wherever the hell I was before.

[02:13:47] I don't know, I remember.

[02:13:49] And you're just wonderful.

[02:13:51] I was wondering, I had my sister and my sister's boyfriend over at the center table.

[02:13:55] Could you drop by and do some stuff for us?

[02:14:00] Yeah, how do you respond to that?

[02:14:02] I said, sure, it's a sure.

[02:14:04] My college was on the phone with her age.

[02:14:06] I've been more than happy to come over and say hello.

[02:14:10] Always be nice.

[02:14:12] Yeah.

[02:14:14] Yeah.

[02:14:15] So I went over to the set hello,

[02:14:18] and you've got to be polite.

[02:14:22] And luckily I wasn't eating a little bit.

[02:14:24] But we're just having a tea and dessert and everything.

[02:14:29] So that's fun.

[02:14:30] Normally I would just say, excuse me,

[02:14:32] I'll be over as soon as I finish.

[02:14:34] I'll be over as soon as I finish.

[02:14:36] Excuse me.

[02:14:39] On the other hand,

[02:14:41] it gets to be very touchy

[02:14:43] when you're recording you

[02:14:46] and photographing you,

[02:14:47] and you have no place to run,

[02:14:49] and you get hit with something.

[02:14:51] My friend with the master,

[02:14:53] who was reddened, I was standing up.

[02:14:56] And my business manager, CPA,

[02:14:58] and his wife is there.

[02:15:00] And I was supposed to go up.

[02:15:02] Of course, they had kids.

[02:15:04] A bunch of them, this undertaker,

[02:15:06] had some kids with a bug in the all-light, long-do voice.

[02:15:08] They didn't care if I was eating.

[02:15:10] And I said, after I finish eating,

[02:15:11] I'll do something for you, you know, whatever.

[02:15:13] All right, you know, probably be nice.

[02:15:15] But now we're at the wedding,

[02:15:16] and I'm supposed to serve you words with the pulpit.

[02:15:18] Okay?

[02:15:19] And I'm just supposed to,

[02:15:20] they gave me some poems that they wanted me to say,

[02:15:22] and they had nothing to do with any voices.

[02:15:24] And I'm not going to do any focus-pocus.

[02:15:26] Okay?

[02:15:27] So I get up there,

[02:15:29] and I'm really be called with the pulpit.

[02:15:32] This what?

[02:15:34] What?

[02:15:36] This what?

[02:15:37] What?

[02:15:38] The priest never called me up for the pulpit.

[02:15:40] That's good, right?

[02:15:42] No, it's not good.

[02:15:44] No!

[02:15:46] Run!

[02:15:47] Run!

[02:15:48] Run!

[02:15:49] No!

[02:15:51] So anyway.

[02:15:56] Why didn't we call you if you're supposed to go up there

[02:15:59] with some poems?

[02:16:00] I wrote to the priest, and I say,

[02:16:02] and this was the church that they actually filmed call

[02:16:05] let's say it's 7-7-7-7-7,

[02:16:07] which really stood as an own Polish church.

[02:16:10] And I say, excuse me, Father,

[02:16:12] you were supposed to call me up.

[02:16:13] I was supposed to read some poetry here

[02:16:15] with the bad room, wanted to read.

[02:16:17] Oh, were you?

[02:16:19] I said, yeah, we talked last night,

[02:16:20] you should remember,

[02:16:21] a person has to be heard,

[02:16:22] so good actor has to be heard.

[02:16:23] He's telling me a good actor has to be heard, right?

[02:16:25] Yeah, I need to hear that.

[02:16:27] That's why I was practicing the right before.

[02:16:29] I was about to pick up the flowers,

[02:16:31] and you know the whole bit.

[02:16:33] And I said, you know,

[02:16:34] you're supposed to call me,

[02:16:35] remember, you're rehearsing everything?

[02:16:37] Oh!

[02:16:38] Oh, you said, well,

[02:16:40] well, next time.

[02:16:41] Next time,

[02:16:43] if that's the time around for both of them,

[02:16:44] it's subsequent to the merge that's all

[02:16:46] about left and left of the story.

[02:16:47] So next time, let's do it.

[02:16:49] So I told them,

[02:16:50] so they decided, are you ready?

[02:16:52] Are you ready, Clay?

[02:16:53] Yeah.

[02:16:54] They decided, I'm going to read the poetry after reception.

[02:16:59] Isn't that a great idea?

[02:17:01] No.

[02:17:02] No.

[02:17:03] No, it's not a good.

[02:17:05] Now this is what happened.

[02:17:07] I know you're waiting for it.

[02:17:08] You're waiting for a kicker for this, aren't you?

[02:17:10] Yeah.

[02:17:11] Yeah.

[02:17:12] Uh-huh, uh-huh.

[02:17:13] Yeah.

[02:17:14] You love this, don't you?

[02:17:15] You love to see somebody squirm, don't you?

[02:17:18] All right.

[02:17:19] So I got the reception.

[02:17:21] I'm talking to the DJ,

[02:17:23] and we discussed that I'd better read this

[02:17:26] before they served the soup course,

[02:17:28] because otherwise people are going to get tanked up at the bar,

[02:17:31] and then they're all going to be like, you know,

[02:17:33] they're already got tanked up, right?

[02:17:36] Okay.

[02:17:37] So the best thing that's happened,

[02:17:39] nervous is hell.

[02:17:41] The best thing is very shakily and brave

[02:17:43] and you can tell, you know, whatever.

[02:17:46] So now I got another film in the video thing.

[02:17:48] I come up with all my simpleias and everything.

[02:17:51] I told him a story about the priest.

[02:17:52] I said, you know,

[02:17:54] I have to tell you, he said, next time, next time.

[02:17:57] This is it.

[02:17:58] So I'm going to read three poems that they asked me to read,

[02:18:01] and then we're going to have dinner because we're hungry.

[02:18:05] I want to eat.

[02:18:06] I get to the first poem.

[02:18:08] Remember, I got no place to run,

[02:18:10] and there are video tapes.

[02:18:11] You ready?

[02:18:12] And all of a sudden,

[02:18:14] from out of the left, left,

[02:18:16] out of somebody,

[02:18:19] and it's on the tape.

[02:18:21] I'm getting to the first part.

[02:18:22] I'm about to read all of a sudden,

[02:18:23] and I'm like, hey, do a hammer!

[02:18:25] So my business manager,

[02:18:28] he is that now becomes a free-for-all, right?

[02:18:31] So I'll be straight from the other side here.

[02:18:33] Hey, do a bird's body!

[02:18:35] Now I'm going to throw crowd of people, right?

[02:18:39] I don't, I decided, no, we better not do anything.

[02:18:43] Okay, okay, I thought that was not.

[02:18:45] All right, we got through that, and we ate.

[02:18:47] Okay, fine.

[02:18:51] The DJ thought it would be a real lot of fun.

[02:18:55] Are you ready?

[02:18:56] The DJ thought it would be such a wonderful kick for everyone

[02:18:59] at this reception.

[02:19:02] To get me on the mic.

[02:19:04] We're a spread, you know, so I said, what is it?

[02:19:06] What is it?

[02:19:07] He throws the mic in my face,

[02:19:09] like I'm deep-trying the mic and says,

[02:19:11] do home with for everyone.

[02:19:15] This is not my, you know, good thing.

[02:19:18] I don't want to be the center of attention.

[02:19:21] I grabbed the mic over the here, over the PS2,

[02:19:25] you know, I get a lot of money for doing this.

[02:19:27] There's all else, so it's a lot of fun.

[02:19:30] Now I'm at a place to run, so now I'm stuck.

[02:19:32] All right, so I do that, not for that.

[02:19:33] Right?

[02:19:34] Run!

[02:19:36] The bride's sister comes over to me sheepishly

[02:19:40] and wants me to go over to her table to entertain

[02:19:45] and do some voices.

[02:19:49] May I add that the dessert table was already set up.

[02:19:53] And I think everyone was pre-tanked up as we say alcohol.

[02:19:58] But they wanted to hear voices.

[02:20:00] So I'm over there and they asked me to tell stories.

[02:20:02] I'm telling some stories, some other things.

[02:20:05] Well, now, the whole reception,

[02:20:09] it's like I'm on the tonight show.

[02:20:12] The whole reception's listening to me and the,

[02:20:14] where's the bride and groom?

[02:20:16] All right.

[02:20:17] One guy comes over to me and he says,

[02:20:19] you ready for this?

[02:20:20] He says, listen, I'm getting married in two weeks.

[02:20:23] Would you come to my wedding?

[02:20:25] I'm a plumber.

[02:20:27] So basically that you can't escape this?

[02:20:32] No, no, I can't, I'm in my truck, and everything.

[02:20:35] I mean, you know, I can't run, I'm stuck.

[02:20:37] Yeah, I think, excuse me, you really want me to come to,

[02:20:40] first of all, I don't even know who you are.

[02:20:42] And second of all, I'm sure you're a nice person,

[02:20:44] you're a bride, that I'm pretty good.

[02:20:45] Yeah, here she is.

[02:20:46] You're introducing me.

[02:20:47] Yeah, all right.

[02:20:48] You know, and I'm sure you guys are nice,

[02:20:51] really nice, but let me ask you something.

[02:20:54] You really want me to come to your wedding and do voices

[02:20:58] and be the center of the tension at your wedding instead of you guys

[02:21:02] being the center of the tension?

[02:21:05] You really want that?

[02:21:09] Reality setting.

[02:21:11] Yeah.

[02:21:12] Yeah, I bet.

[02:21:13] Because who would they be looking at?

[02:21:15] They'd be looking at me and they'd come going with me.

[02:21:17] They'd be like, the bridegroom after me.

[02:21:19] And I said, what?

[02:21:20] Oh, that's it, oh, oh.

[02:21:22] So strange, crazy, crazy things happen.

[02:21:26] And these are all true, I can't make this up.

[02:21:29] I cannot make this up.

[02:21:31] I swear to you.

[02:21:32] I swear to you.

[02:21:34] And then I get it from the other end.

[02:21:36] Oh, you always want furniture table.

[02:21:38] There's a ball.

[02:21:39] Oh, Fred's got to come over to my table.

[02:21:40] He's got to be at it.

[02:21:41] Where's he going to sit here?

[02:21:42] I'll sit here.

[02:21:43] Sit here.

[02:21:44] Now you got to be over here.

[02:21:45] No, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:21:46] Sit here.

[02:21:47] Hi, you know.

[02:21:48] You can hear it?

[02:21:49] I can't get a...

[02:21:50] Yeah.

[02:21:51] It's going to get probably worse and worse.

[02:21:53] But at all times, at all times,

[02:21:56] there's only one time I was talking.

[02:21:58] I got only testy one time.

[02:22:00] I was talking to my friend, CPA, whatever.

[02:22:03] And his wife.

[02:22:04] And this little boy was talking about my prox.

[02:22:07] I said, what's the matter?

[02:22:08] Would you do some sessions if you can't just rest against you?

[02:22:11] I've been more than happy with a half the fish and conversation.

[02:22:13] I said, listen, I'll do it.

[02:22:15] The one that his mother comes over.

[02:22:17] I said, I'm so sorry.

[02:22:18] I know he's such a...

[02:22:19] He's bothering you.

[02:22:20] But he's so...

[02:22:21] He's so enthralled with you.

[02:22:22] He's so...

[02:22:23] He loves you so much.

[02:22:25] I even know him.

[02:22:26] He cared to me.

[02:22:27] He loves you.

[02:22:28] He wasn't talking.

[02:22:29] I said, yeah, but I have to finish this conversation.

[02:22:32] In other words, no.

[02:22:33] Please give me a break.

[02:22:34] One minute.

[02:22:35] But that's the crazy stuff that happens.

[02:22:38] That's the fun stuff.

[02:22:39] But I'm telling you, it gets nuts.

[02:22:41] And can I escape it?

[02:22:42] No.

[02:22:43] Yeah.

[02:22:44] Well, okay.

[02:22:45] Back to the games.

[02:22:48] Well, we're going to get to the games.

[02:22:50] When they call, I get involved with it.

[02:22:52] When I don't, I don't.

[02:22:53] So I'm not really involved with every single game.

[02:22:57] But you're involved with the current game in the Stern line, right?

[02:23:02] Yes.

[02:23:03] I will say yes, but I don't want to talk anything about it right now.

[02:23:12] And whatever.

[02:23:13] But Mr. Say, I'll say I'm involved.

[02:23:17] But certain I've read enough to speak about it.

[02:23:20] I'm going to talk about it.

[02:23:21] But yes, I am involved.

[02:23:22] And in some way, I just say to the powers that be I am involved.

[02:23:26] And that's all I'm going to say on it.

[02:23:28] Am I allowed to say the title?

[02:23:31] If you get this DVD of this one movie that I've voiced,

[02:23:34] that's called The Legend of Ivan Ho, I do a lot of voices on that thing.

[02:23:38] And these are original things.

[02:23:40] And the front stuff is trying to, ever about 15 voices on that thing.

[02:23:44] That's called, as if it's called The Legend of Ivan Ho.

[02:23:47] And if I'm DVD, I think if I'm video, I don't know if you can get a hold of it.

[02:23:51] But the front part is where I am on that thing.

[02:23:55] That's the front stuff.

[02:23:57] I did that, I think I did that 98.

[02:24:00] So I'm on that.

[02:24:02] The game back to the games.

[02:24:05] I want you to everyone from Lani and Dwight and Gary Stern and John Boig

[02:24:12] and everyone over at Stern.

[02:24:15] And even when John Chemical was there and Brian Bansch with Nowworks from Microsoft,

[02:24:21] they all been wonderful.

[02:24:23] And they respect me and I respect them because they, the truth,

[02:24:27] they put together some of these things.

[02:24:29] And when I see the stuff, I mean the artwork is beautiful and all the other stuff.

[02:24:32] And the intricacies with the dot matrix and the computer and putting the stuff in

[02:24:38] and how the stuff works, I mean there's so much involved.

[02:24:41] I have somebody said, and I don't buy it because I'm only involved in a little portion of it.

[02:24:48] It's just another dimension with the sound and everything.

[02:24:52] I'm the glue that holds everything together.

[02:24:54] I said, no, I don't think I'm the glue.

[02:24:56] I'm just another component.

[02:24:58] I'm just another part of it.

[02:24:59] Like a commercial.

[02:25:01] You know.

[02:25:02] But everyone's been wonderful over there.

[02:25:05] Everyone is just very intelligent.

[02:25:09] And they'll never get in count on me.

[02:25:11] That's the most important thing.

[02:25:14] I wish the origins in town.

[02:25:16] See, some of the agents in town don't believe that I can do what I say I can do.

[02:25:19] And then I have to be there in front of them.

[02:25:20] Like I just recently found one in an agency here.

[02:25:23] Another agent.

[02:25:24] And they said, they heard me just through a couple of commercials.

[02:25:27] And at the time I was kind of sick.

[02:25:29] I went through a couple of commercials.

[02:25:31] And when you heard the other people go and read, it wasn't there.

[02:25:34] The energy just wasn't there.

[02:25:36] So they said, you're going to teach us.

[02:25:39] So that was interesting.

[02:25:40] That's a new one.

[02:25:41] I'm going to teach them.

[02:25:43] But that hasn't happened before.

[02:25:45] So I have to keep up to date.

[02:25:47] And I have to constantly watch staff and listen.

[02:25:51] And if a constant, it's constant studying.

[02:25:54] And I think that's what a good performer actor has to do.

[02:25:57] You have to constantly study and everything.

[02:26:00] And if you don't, then you're not going to be fresh.

[02:26:04] You're not going to be able to do the stuff.

[02:26:07] And that's why a lot of people get sad.

[02:26:09] I've heard, I've heard other people prefer to performers.

[02:26:12] Like one of the biggest writers.

[02:26:15] I mean, he's got a 40 million dollar contract.

[02:26:17] But the problem is, is he an actor?

[02:26:19] No.

[02:26:21] And how does this stuff is good?

[02:26:23] Some of this stuff is not so good.

[02:26:25] But can he do what you do?

[02:26:27] No.

[02:26:28] And I don't want to do what some of the stuff of he does

[02:26:31] because he's doing it for different things.

[02:26:33] So does he give him take in everything?

[02:26:35] Right.

[02:26:36] And you have to have a certain study plan.

[02:26:41] And you have to have a certain study quality to it.

[02:26:44] Sometimes I think, like you see on the ear,

[02:26:47] you put a lot of people in the middle of the trade.

[02:26:50] That right away, they get a little bit of right

[02:26:53] and get their heads swelled and right away.

[02:26:55] They're the greatest thing in the world, some fleshbed.

[02:26:58] And I'm the greatest thing in the head with everybody.

[02:27:01] And that's a bad attitude to take.

[02:27:03] Right.

[02:27:04] And it is, I'll tell you one thing quick.

[02:27:06] It is a power.

[02:27:08] So I don't really abuse it.

[02:27:11] But it is a power.

[02:27:13] Can I shut it off?

[02:27:14] Oh yeah, I shut it off.

[02:27:15] I don't dream in voices.

[02:27:17] I said to the ass, you dream and I need, need, need, need, need, need.

[02:27:22] And sometimes it's very difficult to live with

[02:27:26] because I'm doing all these other things.

[02:27:28] You know, I'm doing all these other voices.

[02:27:30] Like, for example, this is a long time ago.

[02:27:33] I got a phone call from somebody.

[02:27:35] I have nothing to do with it.

[02:27:37] The, you've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

[02:27:39] Sure.

[02:27:40] Ever played the Bows or the Bucket Games?

[02:27:43] No.

[02:27:44] Well, they lost the coat and this is nothing to do with them.

[02:27:49] I think.

[02:27:50] And they said, can you do the voice of Bows or from the original cartoon?

[02:27:54] And I said, yes.

[02:27:56] And so I got a couple of cassettes at practice and I recorded

[02:28:00] and the nice compliment about this was,

[02:28:02] it was sent to Mary Harmon who controls the copyright

[02:28:05] of the name and the whole persona of Bows or everything.

[02:28:09] And he heard it and I disappeared.

[02:28:13] It says, hey, that's Bows or I said, well, that's really a pain before I said.

[02:28:17] You disappeared.

[02:28:19] That's Bows or I said, yeah.

[02:28:21] So Mary, he says, I never sounded so good and said, that's not you, that's Fred.

[02:28:24] But he gave, he had the final face on it and went into the, uh, the double bucket game.

[02:28:30] Which is that one of those redemption things over in Chuck E. Cheese.

[02:28:33] Sure.

[02:28:34] And that was nice.

[02:28:35] So sometimes that, you know, that you, sometimes you worry, you know,

[02:28:40] but you got to be professional and I'm not, I don't do every single thing on the jiggy,

[02:28:44] but, um, at least I never went over it, Stern is wonderful.

[02:28:50] And very, very intelligent.

[02:28:52] I mean, you've got some, there's some pretty smart cookies there.

[02:28:56] But that's whether they know they can count on me and everything and,

[02:29:00] well, it's a lot of studying, you know.

[02:29:03] As far as my favorite boy sick and said, I like you, that I like all the,

[02:29:07] I like the Simpsons, I like Family Guy, I like, uh,

[02:29:11] Oh, Hannah by parents, Warner Brothers and,

[02:29:16] and even regular, regular human being voices, regular, regular,

[02:29:20] they got a phone call.

[02:29:21] Uh, they want you to voice Kyle off for some commercial.

[02:29:26] Did I get it?

[02:29:27] No, I was sick that was.

[02:29:28] Oh, yeah.

[02:29:29] Uh, at six auditions, I was sick.

[02:29:32] But I, but I take the auditions, yeah, but I said, listen, I'm not up to snuff.

[02:29:36] But when I get sick, you never ask me that.

[02:29:38] What happens when I get sick?

[02:29:40] Uh, I lose control.

[02:29:41] I start talking to different voices and things.

[02:29:44] Hmm.

[02:29:45] I get sick, that's it.

[02:29:47] So I got to wait until I pass everything.

[02:29:50] Right.

[02:29:51] It's true.

[02:29:52] It's true.

[02:29:53] Well, cool Fred, I look forward to hearing or trying to figure out exactly what you did in the Indiana Jones 4, you know.

[02:30:01] I look forward to that, trying to figure it out.

[02:30:03] Oh, right.

[02:30:05] But the thing is, we, the situation, the movie will be out there this month is going to be fantastic.

[02:30:14] So you'll enjoy all that stuff.

[02:30:17] And it's, that's why I don't want to talk about it because I know you asked John Boyz about that too.

[02:30:22] Sure.

[02:30:23] And he said that's all I can say.

[02:30:24] I am involved, as John is involved in it.

[02:30:27] But that's all I can say.

[02:30:28] And I don't want to say anything else.

[02:30:30] But my own thing is, you know, the fun is actually seeing the whole thing.

[02:30:37] You know, I mean, the whole thing actually in front of you.

[02:30:39] Because when I do all these things, you know, when I do any recordings, I don't see any of the stuff in front of me.

[02:30:44] You know, it's a visualization thing.

[02:30:46] When you see the actual thing in front of you and you can actually put your hands out and play the thing.

[02:30:51] It's, it's wonderful you know.

[02:30:53] Well, cool.

[02:30:54] But, as I said, as I said,

[02:30:59] I'm involved with that form, but I'm going to say this thing.

[02:31:02] Right.

[02:31:03] No, that's not fun.

[02:31:04] I'm not going to talk about it.

[02:31:05] I'm not going to say anything right now.

[02:31:06] And you got it.

[02:31:07] And by the way, if people ask you, hey, that's not the same thing.

[02:31:11] Then I don't say anything.

[02:31:12] In fact, that's not the same thing.

[02:31:15] That way you don't get any trouble.

[02:31:17] And clear, you understand that.

[02:31:19] Oh, yeah, sure.

[02:31:20] Yeah.

[02:31:21] That's not a problem.

[02:31:22] But, but, but.

[02:31:24] Like John said to you, he's involved, and that's all I can say.

[02:31:27] And that's all I can say too.

[02:31:28] And that's my story.

[02:31:29] I'm sticking to it.

[02:31:30] All right.

[02:31:31] One last story.

[02:31:32] You're right.

[02:31:33] I got welcome up out of a thousand.

[02:31:35] One of my friends, the turns out, he was little and that he was sick.

[02:31:40] And they said, we notice them in positions.

[02:31:43] But we would really love to talk to, uh,

[02:31:47] rover somebody from Sesame Street.

[02:31:50] They're making fuel well.

[02:31:52] So I said, put them on the phone.

[02:31:54] They want to talk to Big Bird or whatever, which is Kiel Spenny.

[02:31:57] And I can imitate it.

[02:31:58] So I started talking to this little boy.

[02:32:01] And then the extension laughing here in him talk.

[02:32:04] And he got better.

[02:32:05] And, and then I drew some other Sesame Street characters on there.

[02:32:10] And he just got better.

[02:32:11] And they, the parents were crazy.

[02:32:13] And what are you doing?

[02:32:14] New years, Commando, Rada, house.

[02:32:16] So, well, I'm going to be making pizzas at the center.

[02:32:19] How should you be making pizzas?

[02:32:21] I said, it keeps me humble.

[02:32:22] You're cooking?

[02:32:23] I said, yes, I cook.

[02:32:24] It keeps me humble.

[02:32:25] You're cooking?

[02:32:26] I said, yes, I cook.

[02:32:27] It keeps me humble.

[02:32:28] You own it all with power and ability.

[02:32:30] I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

[02:32:33] You want to see my, you want to see the S under my T-shirt?

[02:32:36] Under my T-shirt, you want to see the Red S?

[02:32:39] Right.

[02:32:40] Yes, I'm cooked.

[02:32:43] And you cost me a, yeah, it's a long time ago.

[02:32:46] And what you did for my son, I'll never forget that.

[02:32:51] That's the nice thing, you know?

[02:32:53] So when the kids come to their bed, you do something, what are you doing?

[02:32:58] I don't mind it.

[02:32:59] That's okay.

[02:33:00] It's all right.

[02:33:01] And besides, what you put out, you got to return.

[02:33:04] You got to be nice about it.

[02:33:05] There's other people in this town.

[02:33:07] Well, they wouldn't do any voice.

[02:33:09] They wouldn't do any voice.

[02:33:10] They wouldn't do any page play.

[02:33:11] It's not that you're giving it away.

[02:33:13] It's a matter of making people happy when they hear it.

[02:33:16] So, what the heck?

[02:33:17] You know, what's it going to hurt?

[02:33:19] I don't mind it.

[02:33:21] So Clay, if you don't have any other questions, I'm going to make myself a tuna for sandwich.

[02:33:25] All right, Fred.

[02:33:27] You take care.

[02:33:28] Hey, I really appreciate the time.

[02:33:30] And I look forward to hearing you in an upcoming game.

[02:33:32] Yeah, and upcoming, yeah, yeah, you'll never know.

[02:33:35] Yeah, you'll never know.

[02:33:36] That's, let's give you with one small voice, Clay.

[02:33:41] And by the way, I look forward to seeing you.

[02:33:44] Well, it's a long way.

[02:33:45] I don't know when the expert would be this year again.

[02:33:48] Yeah, in October.

[02:33:49] I look forward to seeing you.

[02:33:51] If I've never met you before, I look forward to meeting you at the expert.

[02:33:55] Yeah, same.

[02:33:56] I look forward to it.

[02:33:57] And it's been a pleasure.

[02:33:58] It's been a privilege and an honor.

[02:34:00] And I want you to know.

[02:34:01] I appreciate you interviewing me.

[02:34:03] And I hope I was able to answer your question,

[02:34:05] give you a little insight of what I've been through.

[02:34:08] Oh, you did great, Fred.

[02:34:09] I appreciate it, too, and I appreciate you coming on.

[02:34:12] Oh, no, no problem.

[02:34:13] I leave you with Ben Kenobi.

[02:34:15] I was going to say to you,

[02:34:17] remember the first to be with you.

[02:34:20] And we...

[02:34:21] I'd like to thank Fred Young for joining us tonight on Topcast.

[02:34:26] Love hearing all those voices that he does,

[02:34:29] and all the stories that he has.

[02:34:31] It's got some great stories.

[02:34:33] Really do appreciate his time.

[02:34:34] And I hope you all come back and hear us again on Topcast,

[02:34:37] the Internet Pinball Radio Show.
