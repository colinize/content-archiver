[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:24] Welcome to another episode of Topcast, the pinball internet radio show.

[00:28] Tonight we are talking to a gentleman that has opened up a pinball museum in San Francisco.

[00:36] It's called the Lucky Juju and the website is uju.com.

[00:44] And this gentleman has opened it up as a nonprofit under the umbrella of the Neptune Beach amusement museum.

[00:52] And we're going to talk to him tonight about how his museum differs from the Tim Arnold pinball hall of fame and Las Vegas and what he's trying to accomplish and how he's doing things a bit differently than how Tim Arnold is doing it, how he got into collecting and what is the emphasis of the museum.

[01:12] Special guest.

[01:18] So we're going to talk to Michael Sheath of the Lucky Juju.

[01:22] Yes, the Lucky Juju.

[01:24] What a name and we're going to find out about that name.

[01:26] We're going to ask Michael about that name and how he came up with the Lucky Juju pinball museum in San Francisco.

[01:34] And also we're going to talk about the second annual Pacific pinball exhibition which is coming up October 3rd, 4th and 5th of 2008.

[01:44] And his show is very electro mechanical pinball oriented.

[01:48] And in 2007, the first year was a phenomenal success.

[01:53] And he hopes to follow it up again in 2008 to have even more games.

[01:58] Last year he had like 300 electro mechanical games, undisplayed and available for play.

[02:06] And this year they hope to top that.

[02:08] We're going to give him a call right now and see how he's doing.

[02:11] Hello.

[02:19] Mike.

[02:21] Yeah.

[02:22] Hey, it's Clay.

[02:23] Are you ready?

[02:24] Yep, I guess so.

[02:26] Okay, would Michael tell me about the Lucky Juju?

[02:30] Let's just start with the Lucky Juju.

[02:32] Since you know, that's like the central focus of this and what everything comes back to is the Lucky Juju.

[02:41] Give me the history of this and how you got started in doing the Lucky Juju and why?

[02:50] Okay.

[02:53] It started when I was taking a break from work.

[02:59] I finished my house and I was starting to rent it.

[03:03] And I wanted to do something artistic.

[03:06] And I decided that I was going to build interactive art.

[03:13] And I was working on that concept when all of a sudden I realized that it had already been done.

[03:20] I wanted to do interactive kinetic art.

[03:23] And then one of the more I thought about it, the more I thought, well, hell, that's pinball.

[03:27] I was always into pinball.

[03:30] I even had a pinball machine.

[03:32] So I thought, well, heck, why don't I do this?

[03:36] What would be to maybe get pinball machines and re-seem them?

[03:41] So I started looking for older pinball machines.

[03:46] And I happened upon this lady who was close to here who had about 36 machines.

[03:52] So I started emailing her and finally ended up with 12 of them.

[04:00] And then I went back and haggled some more and I got the rest of them.

[04:06] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[04:07] I said they took them one by one and re-seemed them.

[04:10] And these are all like electro-mechanicals from the 70s because that's the era that I really liked.

[04:15] Okay, wait, wait, wait.

[04:16] But wait, Mike, most people start out with like one game and maybe go to two and then maybe go to three.

[04:25] And you're saying you went from zero to 60 in like 3.4 seconds.

[04:31] Well, I had a Gulf Stream.

[04:33] Okay, that was my first machine and I had that just because I was like that machine.

[04:39] I had that one for about six years.

[04:42] I went to that many machines because I had a different purpose in mind.

[04:46] I wasn't going to do some art with it.

[04:51] I had this grand idea and I was going to make a real artistic statement by taking old machines

[04:58] and coming up with my own crazy bizarre theme for it.

[05:02] And I picked some real winners.

[05:04] I got Jubilee and I picked some ones that I thought at the time had really crappy artwork.

[05:13] Yeah, I mean Gulf Stream.

[05:16] That I didn't like the artwork on and I didn't know that much about which ones were really great players or anything like that.

[05:26] So that's why I bought so many.

[05:27] I was going to fix one up just as is and then I was going to take another one because this lady had

[05:34] doubles of several machines.

[05:37] So I was going to fix one up to make sure how it worked and everything and then the other one was going to be an art project.

[05:44] Well, as much as I tried no matter how much whiskey I drank, I just could not get the sand paper onto the play field.

[05:54] I just couldn't do it.

[05:56] I kept looking at him and going gee, these things are too precious and I just couldn't do it.

[06:01] So then I said well crap, what do I do?

[06:03] I got all these pinball machines and I don't have any place to storm and I hate having them fit their collect and dust.

[06:09] They should be played.

[06:12] I didn't want to do it at my house because I didn't want to subject my wife to that kind of terror of having pinheads come over.

[06:21] So that's where I decided well, I found a place, a friend of mine,

[06:28] turned me on this little shop that was an upholstery shop and it was empty.

[06:34] It had been vacant for a year.

[06:35] So rent was like 500 bucks a month.

[06:39] So it was enough room for 19 pins.

[06:43] So I got 19 of them going and I moved them in.

[06:50] It's kind of funny, I went to the city and I was going to do it all of a shit, get a business license and everything.

[06:55] But then they said oh yeah, for pinball, any coin op amusement machine, you got to get a business license.

[07:03] And then you got to get a license for each machine and it's $60 per machine per year and it's non-transferable.

[07:12] You know, it goes with the machine.

[07:14] So I just kind of went, ugh.

[07:17] So I said oh, well thank you, you know, I said you're not at least.

[07:21] So you can open up a pinball parlor and I said no, no, no.

[07:27] And I left and I went ahead and put all the machines in there.

[07:32] I took all the coin mechs out, put them on free play and I put a donation jar out.

[07:37] And that's kind of how lucky Gigi started.

[07:41] I didn't do any advertising.

[07:43] In fact, I was actually kind of hiding from the city of Alameda because I didn't want the

[07:48] athlete, I didn't want them to come down and go you know you're running this without a business license.

[07:53] Because there's no way I could afford it.

[07:55] I don't, you know, no wonder that our kids went out of business.

[07:59] So I ran it like that until the fire marshal showed up and

[08:09] inspected me and at that point the city found out that I had, that I was indeed, you know,

[08:16] running a pinball parlor.

[08:18] Wait, wait, wait, Mike, how did the city, how did the fire marshal find out about you?

[08:26] I mean, what, I mean, were you just like spreading the action of the whole building?

[08:30] There's other businesses and you know, it's kind of a weird old building.

[08:36] So they were just making the rounds.

[08:38] They make the rounds every two or three years and they just happen to come in and

[08:44] they didn't care about a business license or any of that thing.

[08:46] All they wanted to do was inspect it for fire.

[08:49] So you know, they came in and did their thing and then they made a report out and sent it

[08:55] to the city and that's when the city went, oh, you know, so the city all of a sudden,

[09:00] you know, when I get this thing, oh, well, it looks like you've been doing business and so,

[09:05] you know, you got to cough up this amount of money for however many years you've been doing it

[09:11] blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, well, what if I was a non-profit, you know?

[09:17] And they go, oh, if you were a non-profit, you wouldn't have to pay anything.

[09:20] Well, I've been working on my non-profit thing and right when I got the letter from the city,

[09:28] about two days later, I got approval from the IRS as a non-profit and they did it retroactive

[09:35] for almost a year retroactive from when I asked.

[09:39] So it was with much pleasure that I see Roxette copy of the 501 C3 and mailed it to the city and

[09:47] the city basically had to leave me alone. And what is a 501 C exactly?

[09:54] Oh, 501 C3. It is a tax exempt non-profit status. It's a tax exempt status that the IRS affords

[10:09] any entity that is the follows under the guidelines for the 501 C3 which basically it is,

[10:22] it can be a religious organization, it can be a community benefit, a public benefit entity,

[10:34] it can be an educational facility, it can be a museum, it can't be like a social club.

[10:49] You know, they have limitations. If you do it, if you, you know, like this, there's a train club,

[10:59] it's a kind of a hobbyist train club, they collect trains and they form to 501 C3. I kind of

[11:07] looked at how they did it. And basically what it is is you have to do something that benefits

[11:13] the community that you live in. So I was already doing the art shows along with the pinball

[11:23] and I was doing some free community work like letting some community groups in and I've given

[11:31] lectures on pinballs how they worked and the history of them. So I sent them all that material

[11:39] and they granted me the 501 C3. How difficult was that to do? I mean is this the same thing

[11:46] like that Tim Arnold did and I mean how long did this take you and how much work was it?

[11:50] Yeah it's exactly what Tim Arnold did. In fact, Tim Arnold and I have talked about this a little

[11:59] bit. He had got his before I got mine. It took about a year and a half to two years and

[12:10] it's filling out a lot of paperwork and you know you have to register with the state. You just

[12:15] basically have to go through the whole process. Some people you know hire the lawyers and in fact

[12:25] there's a lot of nonprofits out there now and it's almost it's become a business almost

[12:31] not almost it has become a business. A lot of people are making money off the nonprofits because

[12:37] it's hard to do it's hard to run one. I pretty much do it. I've had a little bit of help and we

[12:48] have a board of directors but basically the same way Tim did it which is you know you sit down

[12:53] you fill out the forms and you submit them and I remember Tim had a little glitch with his and

[13:00] they sent it back and he had to you know fill in some more forms and you know correct something

[13:06] and they sent mine back once and basically it was because I hadn't signed something. So I you know

[13:12] I was but I first got a back of that. Oh crap they're not going to give it to me but then I read it

[13:17] and I said oh okay they just want me to sign this form here so I find and send it back and then

[13:21] another three months went by and then all of a sudden I get the letter you know so once we had

[13:27] that then we were able to actually charge admission and that was real key to making the thing work because

[13:37] the donation thing was it was great but it did work financially because a lot of people you know

[13:47] when you ask for donation they you know they'd feel like well I don't really want to put anything

[13:54] in so I'm not going and so I couldn't force people to put money in I could give them a dirty look

[13:59] but that was about it. So going to going with the 501c3 allowed me to put up a sign that said admission

[14:08] and I didn't have to get a business license at least pay you know pay the all the fees that they

[14:15] wanted and I could legally ask for admission so that finally made it financially feasible because

[14:22] before that we were we were basically losing money. So were you covering the $500 a month and rent

[14:31] and the electric and so on and so forth? Yeah we're up and you know we're in parts all that.

[14:39] Yeah. Now you're early open a couple days a week right?

[14:44] Actually we're open three days a week now we used to be just Friday and Saturday night and then we finally went

[14:54] to Sunday and eventually our goal was to open up every day except for Monday.

[15:03] And what you're at? You're in what Alameda California? Yeah Alameda California it's on the

[15:10] east side of the San Francisco Bay area we're right next to Oakland it's actually an island.

[15:21] Okay and in the only reason you picked this location is just because the rent was cheap.

[15:26] No I live here. Okay. All right. I didn't want to have to travel too far.

[15:31] You know because we've got an EM pinball club here in Detroit and we had and kind of like a clubhouse

[15:39] and we lost it you know and at the time it was it was basically free and you know we were going

[15:45] to we were looking for a place to rent but it was just it was just turning into a huge hassle

[15:50] finding somewhere that was a big enough B everybody would access to and C we could afford to pay for.

[15:59] Yeah well there wasn't any we at that point it was just me and you know my whole purpose

[16:09] at that point was besides having all these machines that I just didn't want sitting around

[16:16] collecting dust there was no place to play pinball and it kind of there was there was a friend of mine

[16:24] Mac who's kind of infamous in the in the Berkeley Oakland area and he had this basement thing going on

[16:32] and he would do it every Friday night in fact he still does it and it was it was such a

[16:38] cool scene but the problem was is that you couldn't tell anybody about it you had to it was purely

[16:47] it was a kind of scene it you know it was it was his house his basement and so the rule was you

[16:52] couldn't tell anybody about it you had to bring them down there and that way you you were responsible

[16:59] for them so wasn't really open to the public and so I actually talked to Mac and said hey look

[17:08] you know what I really like what you're doing here but I'd like to make something that the public

[17:12] could come to so you know would you mind if I do that now when I'm just going to put out a donation

[17:18] jar and ask for donations and try to pay for the rent with that and he said he said yeah go ahead

[17:24] you know I think that's a great idea but I don't think it'll work and you know then it turned

[17:30] out to work pretty well and he was pretty happy because it took kind of took the load off of him

[17:35] well when you say like you mean just every Friday night he essentially has a pinball party

[17:39] yeah basically and why how many machines does he stop for a while because he had a he got married

[17:47] and had a kid and and that's kind of taken up a lot of his time still but he was he was close

[17:54] for about a year and a half and that's kind of right when I was starting to open up so actually

[18:00] we took up the slack because there were people that were used to going to max and now they were

[18:05] then they started coming over to the juju and they didn't mind you know kicking in the five bucks

[18:08] and supporting it you know now with Mac did he have any donations no you just basically brought

[18:16] some beer or wine or something else and can you have can you have alcohol at your place no

[18:24] not anymore we used to do that and then we had some neighbors they called the beverage control

[18:33] people on us and I had to go to court on that one well what do you mean can you explain

[18:38] with that can you explain that one well basically every month the other way I was getting people to come

[18:46] to check out pinball with I started this kind of a unique building it's inside but there's

[18:56] these glass windows around the whole space so I had all these machines lining and you got to kind

[19:02] of imagine it's just wide enough for two rows of machines with about six feet in between them

[19:09] so you can get people can walk back and forth really easily but it's just nothing but machines

[19:14] and on one side there's windows and so from the outside you're basically looking at the back of

[19:20] a bunch of machines which you know I thought well that's kind of a waste so I I started I built

[19:28] all these panels to put into the glass wall and what I do is is that hang hang artwork up in there

[19:38] and put it up into the window around the whole thing facing outward that I have these art shows

[19:44] so people come and look at this look at the weird art and then and then they they wanted to

[19:48] to pay make a donation and go in there and play pinball and that's what really made it take off

[19:56] for us because up until that point we weren't really making the rent so after we did that we got

[20:04] a lot more people interested in the pinball but what was the deal with with the alcohol the I mean

[20:13] what was I'm sorry I kind of skirted that question didn't I well with every art opening you know

[20:19] usually serve alcohol right wine or whatever and we never would sell it we'd just buy some bottles

[20:25] and cheap bottles of wine and you know we'd have that for people and she got a funny because

[20:33] we weren't even selling it and we still have people bringing their own beer you know and it was

[20:37] all cool all the neighbors upstairs started getting tweaked because they they had just had a kid

[20:45] and I've done all these favors for them and everything but I guess we were getting a little

[20:49] noisy or down there and even though we had an understanding and it really wasn't the kind of

[20:54] place that you should be bringing up a kid and they started complaining and we just basically said

[21:01] hey look you know we're not going to go anywhere you know you guys might think about going somewhere

[21:07] because you know every the the noise here it is the better we're doing you know I'm not going to stop

[21:14] that so they figured oh the way to get rid of us would be to call up the ABC and have them bust us

[21:20] and then they also call the cops up on us well you know for making too much noise well the cops

[21:25] basically kind of looked at them and said what are you guys doing here you got a kid and you're living

[21:31] so kind of backfire on them they had to leave I went to court over the charges and they were dismissed

[21:40] but basically I said yeah it's it's too much to risk at this point to get busted again

[21:46] because I think we kind of lucked out it's it's a gray law about even though we weren't selling

[21:53] alcohol they call it the bottle club I guess if you have like a some kind of form of entertainment

[22:01] and you charge for it and you don't sell alcohol but you let people bring it in it's basically

[22:07] encouraging a nuisance I guess so that's that's how that went down so for private parties we can

[22:16] let people bring in liquor but for when we're open to the public we have to tell them now

[22:24] huh now what the artist thing you know how do you get artists to display their their wares at

[22:32] at a pinball place I mean it seems really kind of odd well basically they they usually get a

[22:39] hold of me and show me some of their work and if it's strange enough or cool enough then then we

[22:48] make arrangements to to show it it's got to be pretty much flat art because it goes in between a

[22:53] window basically they can go online we got two websites they can go to and send stuff in

[23:04] a lot of it you know would amount they come by they come by for a show and they go on that's

[23:09] pretty interesting and I tend to show people that don't get into galleries you know like there's

[23:15] a lot of photographers that that takes some pretty interesting pictures and a lot of it I try to

[23:22] tailor to have something to do with either pinball or the circus or amusement or

[23:29] there's some facet of that you know science fiction you know any of that stuff that appeals to

[23:39] to I guess kids that never grow up like me now where did the lucky juju name come from

[23:48] well that came from she that goes way back uh give it to you tarzan movie where um where the

[23:57] you know the the uh blana is marching through and he's got you know uh the natives are carrying

[24:05] his stuff and they they stop and they go on and he goes well what's wrong why why are you putting

[24:10] this stuff down they they they point and they go oh that's for us bad juju we don't go and he goes that's

[24:19] nonsense so that's where I heard juju the first time was that that tarzan movie and then I looked it

[24:25] up and juju turns out to be this west african belief kind of like voodoo but it doesn't have any

[24:31] evil connotations necessarily it just happens to do with luck and she I don't know it just

[24:39] sounded so cool I couldn't call it the lucky mojo all right all right no no did you ever realize

[24:46] your dream of you know of taking a pinball machine and and re-arting it as it may be well

[24:53] you know yes to a certain degree I have um I'm still working on and actually a full size pinball

[25:04] machine that I that's going to be re re done and it's um she do I want to spill the beans now

[25:11] probably not oh come on oh uh but I I am still working on that and I have several other ideas

[25:17] that I've already been working on and the whole concept behind that is I don't want to ruin a pinball

[25:23] machine I I'm I decided that I'd only do ones that you know the play field was really worn

[25:29] so the one I'm trying to work on now is a hot shot it's a you know got leave for a player

[25:35] right 1973 yeah and so you know I know the pool thing on that it's kind of a thing I think it's

[25:44] Gordon Morris and artwork um and that one of my favorites and um I didn't really like the pool

[25:52] themed games I mean some of them are good but um that one I just thought I always see a lot of

[25:59] pinball machines where I thought you know the artwork has nothing whatsoever to do with the play

[26:06] and the action on the play field or on the machine like for example um um

[26:13] an example of a machine that does have good follow through on that end in other words uh

[26:18] form follows function it's like quantike you know the Williams I think what 73 right um

[26:27] it's the whole theme is striking it rich right now you're in that you're in the Yukon and you've

[26:33] struck gold well what do you got on the play field you got this little flop machine real and if

[26:37] you line them up right and then get the ball in the in the center pocket it gives you you know

[26:43] uh two extra balls in a game and 5,000 points or whatever you all of a sudden you know you don't

[26:49] even know what you did most of the time and you get the the ball in there and that saucer and it

[26:54] gives you all this you know it goes crazy and uh I always loved that you know because it was like

[27:01] see that's just what it says it's gonna do and also another one is like fireball a machine that

[27:06] a lot of people can't stand but really as far as the art and what the machine does it's perfect

[27:14] it it on the on the on the back glass it's hurling balls and on the play field it's it does the same

[27:19] thing right and I I think that's really important I think that's that's what's lacking in a lot of

[27:26] the machines um that are really fun to play but just you know the artwork doesn't match up

[27:33] now yeah that makes sense but tell me now tell me about though the weird Donnie in the helicopters game

[27:41] you have that in your museum right yeah actually we're gonna have an opening on June 6th

[27:46] um that's one that Wade Cross and Dirty Donnie did Dirty Donnie's um an artist uh he's actually from

[27:54] Canada he's been living in the Bay Area for quite a while um and he and Wade hooked up on some

[28:01] other project and Wade Kraus is one of the few people who actually can uh reproduce a play field

[28:09] and it's been licensed uh through Steve Young and Gottlieb to uh and he has permission to reproduce

[28:16] play fields um yeah I've got I've got a Gottlieb knockout play field right here on the wall

[28:22] looking at right now that that Wade did yeah Wade is just amazing I mean he uh do you like it um

[28:29] I do when I don't there's some things I like about it and some things I don't um I say overall

[28:36] the quality is excellent but some of the manufacturing techniques that he did in it I question

[28:43] well you should um you should write him because you're uh you're a mythrow yourself you know um

[28:51] but you haven't installed it yet no I have not installed it yeah um well like one of the things

[28:56] he does just real quickly is he didn't like the quality of the plywood so he actually you know um

[29:03] got plywood and then bought walnut veneer veneer I think it was walnut or some harder wood

[29:10] and laminated it on top of the of the high grade plywood just to get a hard surface

[29:16] which um you know so he actually started off with better um plywood than the then the the pinball

[29:24] companies we're using yeah this one has a birch top a birch top and back so okay um

[29:33] yeah uh so he and uh dirty donny got together for that project uh donny hand painted the play field

[29:42] uh weighed um he basically reproduced a king pin uh got lived king pin play field and um

[29:53] then donny uh went ahead and painted it and another another person raw did some of the metal flake on it

[30:00] and then weighed also does uh backlasses and so he uh took uh donny's backlasses on and screened that on glasses

[30:11] and that's kind of how they uh made them money to be able to produce it as they sold the backlasses

[30:19] they made about I think 30 to 40 backlasses installed them and I bought one of those

[30:26] yeah yeah when these guys you know I I mean I'm never going to install this knockout play field I

[30:31] bought it just because a wins anybody else ever going to make them and b you kind of want to

[30:37] support these guys when they do it and see it it was you know frankly it was priced pretty

[30:42] fairly I thought I'd be honest with you I don't know how he does um I he's um he's fortunately um

[30:52] um doesn't have much of an over because he does it all himself um and and he has a day job but um

[31:02] I'm really hoping like that he's going to be able to to get this going on on a bigger scale because

[31:09] he's able to do what you know I don't know anybody else that they can do this he takes a play field

[31:16] um like the visible pinball you know about that yeah I was going to I was going to ask about that

[31:22] yeah I know you know the only other guys doing play fields are the guys in Canada like when I needed

[31:26] a mermaid the mermaid project done um the guys in Canada did that you did because you did that one

[31:32] right and how did you do the play field when you reproduced it well I uh Tim Arnold had a new old

[31:38] stock mermaid play field which was kind of an interesting story where he bought back in Lansing

[31:43] Michigan when he was living here he bought a mermaid from a guy that I guess was just trashed

[31:48] you know in 1951 Gottlieb Woodrail mermaid and as he's pulling out and he bought it for like a

[31:53] hundred bucks and this is back in the probably the 70s and as he's pulling out of the guy's driveway

[31:59] the guy comes running out of the house with the box and his hand going wait wait wait stop stop stop

[32:03] and Tim's like whoa you know what's this all about and the guy hands on this box and it's got a

[32:08] brand new NOS mermaid play field in the box wow so so I went to I flew to Las Vegas and once summer

[32:18] and I brought a laptop with me in a HP 4600 scanner and I scanned the play field then and you know

[32:25] I had been sitting on the project for a long time because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the

[32:31] money to do this it's you know it's a lot of cake you got to put up to get it done and um and it

[32:37] was it was a by a man it was a boatload of money and I wasn't sure that anybody would buy him I mean

[32:43] I didn't know how many people needed him how many mermaids are out there for that matter you know

[32:48] yeah so I see you know so you know I basically threw another guy I contracted to have these made

[32:54] and you know gave him the artwork and you know they you know they awarded the inserts from

[33:00] Formos they got the I think they got the wood from like Russia or something when the playwoods

[33:06] is I would say of equal quality to what Wade's using um you know they they did overall they did

[33:13] pretty good job um you know there's I'm kind of a good you know have criticisms of both

[33:20] about both come about both Wade's and the Canadian guys but you know overall they're both

[33:26] doing great work and I mean that criticism are really small to be frank you know they're just

[33:31] little picky nitpicky things yeah yeah um because I believe Steve Young went ahead and and okay the

[33:39] um the knockout yep gave it his blessing um so he did get the he did get licensed um

[33:50] and I know he just did a limited run of those and you know part of the problem is

[33:58] getting a good original you know to base everything on um yeah and he didn't have um I know

[34:07] and in one part he was making the circle too perfect and and Steve had a point out he was no

[34:12] they're they're actually not that perfect uh you know and so you had to correct that so it did

[34:18] go through a couple revisions and um the thing is that Wade I believe what he does it's different

[34:25] from everybody else is he actually uh creates the um the files that that where the artwork and the

[34:34] cutting pattern are matched and um from what I understand the Canadian guys are working off of

[34:42] art files because they're doing they're basically doing the newer machines like fathom I believe and

[34:47] right yeah so they still have the actual uh film that was used for silk screening right and once

[34:56] you have that then all your whole placement is pretty much already done because it's got to match

[35:01] the artwork whereas if you've got to scan the artwork and then match it up to a CAD file you know

[35:09] that that takes them a little bit of doing you know and um he's he made this me the way he's

[35:16] done it because he did it for me with the with the visible pinball machine um what I did with I

[35:22] handed him a strip down surf champ play field and he pulled the artwork off of it and all the

[35:28] whole patterns front and back and then I got that and took it to somebody else to have the

[35:35] uh have it cut out of plastic well first we did a wood mock up to make sure everything was okay

[35:40] and then made some corrections and then did the first plastic uh cutting and then we ran off

[35:47] four of them and I took him back to Wade I put the inserts in and then he silk screened the black

[35:53] outline artwork on it and it all it all matched up you know perfectly and then when I put it all

[35:58] back together the damn thing plays faster and better than a rebuilt new one well then just to let

[36:06] people know what you're doing here is basically the visual pinball is a clear pinball machine and

[36:12] basically you constructed this thing out of a out of acrylic right uh you're out of um uh part of

[36:18] it the play field is one type of plastic and then the the cabinet is um it's acrylic yeah

[36:25] and what was the what was the thinking behind this and and and how long did it take you and how much

[36:29] did it cost yeah the numbers aren't you know that one yet uh I tell you it took about a year to do

[36:39] it I'd say it took about you know we didn't we weren't pan ourselves and in fact they got a lot

[36:47] of squaring up to do with Wade I mean that's the great thing about Wade he he just like the project

[36:52] that he and I just worked on it and you know the idea is we're gonna sell one of these well we

[36:57] haven't sold one yet but um the idea behind it was um and it's kind of the the idea behind the museum

[37:06] and it's how we differ from what Tim's doing um Tim is more collection minded which is great because

[37:14] that I don't have to do that I'm more science art and history minded behind pinball and a big part

[37:23] of that would be pinball mechanisms and showing uh people kids and adults how these things work uh

[37:33] and so the the the ultimate um exhibit would be in my mind to have a clear pinball so that's

[37:42] that was the first thing I concentrated on was you know what if you could have an electro-mechanical

[37:46] pinball that you could see everything working while you played it and at first I just did a clear

[37:52] play field and then I realized well that's great but you really can't see everything so then I

[37:56] thought well see how much harder would it be to build the whole thing out of clear plastic

[38:01] and it was hard but um I was amazed how well it's held up I mean I've I've been taken

[38:07] in the round um I had it at this uh big maker fair out in uh San Rafael I mean San Matale

[38:15] and and I've taken I was at the Pacific pinball expo last year um and now it's going to be living at the

[38:22] uh at the juju's new uh exhibit room but it's great because people kids look at that and they just go

[38:30] wow you know this is how they work well what what's that switch to and what is this transfer what

[38:35] to hexat and you know what it does is it gets them interested in how they work and gosh what do

[38:42] you what do you know we're gonna have more scientists and less lawyers what how much does this thing

[38:48] weigh hmm it's uh it's I I can move it and set it up by myself is it more than a regular pinball

[38:58] yeah it is it's uh I'd say it's about 300 pounds as opposed to 250 okay and in just a ballpark

[39:06] what do you think this cost you to make about 20 grand to 25 really that much huh well

[39:15] now actually probably more I mean that's not really including all the labor and all the programming

[39:21] um that basically all the programming you know it I'd say you know the first one

[39:28] is always going to cost you a heck of a lot because you got to put all this initial work on into it

[39:33] who wants the other program you can crank out a few like we did crank out for a play field

[39:38] um and I can go back and I can crank out more cabinets and it'll be cheaper because I've

[39:44] already got the program but that program that first program cost you a bundle are you talking

[39:49] about are you talking about a CNC router program or something correct okay okay and so basically

[39:57] Wade did manufacture this for you uh Wade did all the programming uh for the play field

[40:05] and for the cutouts for the head and the light baffle uh the mechanical board for the head

[40:11] and the light baffle for the head and then my brother Christian and I we built science exhibits

[40:17] for the exploratorium he and I and another friend uh did the cad work for the cabinet

[40:26] and uh and the mechanical board and all the other all the other stuff and so we um Wade

[40:35] did all the programming and artwork for the plastics and the play field and the glass

[40:42] of the back glass which is basically just plastic with the black outline artwork on it

[40:47] and um and then we assembled the whole thing

[40:50] huh in the shop and so like you're talking about the the light insert panel on the back glass

[40:57] where that's behind the back glass that's all clear everything basically everything is clear

[41:02] in the game yeah yeah everything's clear uh in fact it's um it's almost too clear uh

[41:12] it's uh i'm not gonna say it's hard to play because i play surfchat that's you know that's a

[41:17] really fun game um so i know how i know what everything's supposed to do but if somebody never

[41:23] played that before they'd probably kind of get well you know it's kind of a little overwhelming

[41:28] because even though the information is there so what scores you know how things score and stuff

[41:33] like that not having the artwork there it's really distracting you know with the um thing through

[41:41] and um and the ball moves quite a bit faster on that plastic play field now do you have um

[41:48] so the play field basically is the black key lines on it and i know what you mean i played white

[41:52] woods and key line play fields and and and and and they're weird to play they just it's not

[41:59] the same kind of pinball that you're used to right yeah yeah now do you imagine one that

[42:04] that didn't even have wood there that you could see right through it so it's even it's even stranger

[42:10] and the lights are a little more intense too oh yeah now do you how do you like to like the

[42:15] the bottom cabinet in the bottom board do you like anything um well it's got all the standard

[42:20] lights of course it's it's basically it's the whole machine exactly as it is only everything's

[42:25] reprodu everything wood is reproduced in the same thickness uh of plexiglass uh but we did add in my

[42:33] my brother christian is a neon artist so he meant he bent up a big long um you of white phosphorus

[42:45] coated neon which we put in the bottom of the underneath the mechanical board and uh it's

[42:52] not it's actually on a dimmer and everything so you can adjust the the brightness of it and it

[42:57] lights up the whole thing so that actually really helps for the uh exhibition part of it you

[43:05] know for showing people all the mechanisms because they're now they're all they're all lit up

[43:10] from below so you can clearly see everything okay now tell me about um the lucky you said

[43:19] something about a lucky juju exhibition room yeah we um the juju started off as one room and then

[43:26] we got a little storage room which became the shop then we added on another room it's I guess

[43:33] us playing pinball they're kind of drove the other people out um and so we got another room and

[43:38] in that room the first room was electro mechanical machines only the second room I decided well

[43:44] people want newer stuff so I put some eighties late seventies and eight early eighties solid state

[43:50] machines and then we got a third room um and mind you these rooms are small there's maybe six

[43:57] machines in the in the second room and then in the third room I said out what to help they're

[44:02] really screaming for twilight zone and these other machines which I swore I'd never have

[44:07] but um I have a couple really cheap so I got twilight zone and Adams family and then some other

[44:15] machines came in so I put some DMD machines in there because at all point you know hey you got

[44:20] to represent the whole era so that was uh the three three errors that I thought we could

[44:28] dealt deal with I'd like to deal with earlier machines but the truth of the matter is anything

[44:33] with a push up on it they don't get they don't understand you got to push the ball up and I we

[44:40] have a lot of kids come through here and you know I'd be burning out coils right and left if I put

[44:47] those in so the last room I decided okay if I'm going to do the history of pinball a little short

[44:53] version of the early stuff that's where to do it so I said okay I'm going to put the clear pinball

[44:58] in there I've got this other kinetic pinball art piece that I did and then I've got a lineup of

[45:06] I've also got Wade and dirty donnies helicopters machine and then I put in a ballet bumper

[45:16] and then a Humpty Dumpty I'm getting that on Friday somebody's going to loan it to us

[45:22] and in the middle of that I'm really honored that we got Russ Jensen's Metro

[45:30] and you know Russ Jensen was an incredible pinball historian okay if you look on the IPD

[45:37] geez sure I think more than three quarters of the pictures seem to come from him and

[45:44] when he passed away last year a lot of people donated money and they managed to buy his his

[45:51] favorite machine from the family which was Metro and this is mainly the work of Rob Hawkins

[45:56] and Don Muting who did the pinball collectors resource right and Tim Arnold had the Metro for a while

[46:05] and then it went to Pinagogo and it was there for a bit and then I just picked it up from

[46:11] Pinagogo and it's going to live at the the Lucky Juju's exhibit room for a while

[46:17] now these machines do you own all these machines generally speaking or do people loan you machines

[46:23] I own I own the lion's share of them and I have a few machines that are on loan

[46:30] Dan Miller's loaned a couple machines and Larry's Arterian is always extending the loan of

[46:39] machines to us he has a pretty incredible gotley Woodrail collection and a wedgehead collection

[46:49] and Dan Miller he led me a DMD the pinball magic and also the a real favorite that stern

[47:00] Orbiter one right right yeah so now but your original intention was to stay a lecture mechanical then

[47:09] yeah yeah that was the original intent and I tell you I've kind of held true to the one

[47:18] that I wanted to do which was I want to make it I wanted to separate the sounds I just the

[47:26] one thing that I was used to drive me nuts was when I'd be playing an electro mechanical and they're

[47:33] you know listening to those sweet chimes and bells and there's some electronic machine going

[47:40] you know crazy or talking or some such crap and I just that you know not that I not that

[47:46] they don't like that the electronic stuff I loved it I do electronic music in my spare time

[47:51] but I just didn't like to hear them to get it to me it was just like yeah you know so

[47:58] so I separated them so in one room it's nothing but chimes and then the other room you can get

[48:03] your electronic fix but I just I keep them separated and that's one thing that I'll I'll always do

[48:10] and we actually do that at the expo which can I talk about that for a second?

[48:17] well wait before we get to that yeah we'll come to that in just a second but you know one

[48:23] thing that we touched on we didn't really talk about was the dirty donny game um that you know we

[48:29] talked a little bit about that now is this machine that you have actually his or or they're

[48:35] multiple maids of this of this game it's one of it's one of a kind it's um yeah there's only one

[48:43] and it was based on the 73 Gottlieb kingpin which is a good drop target game and he

[48:50] and where did he come up with the what is the artwork theme on that?

[48:54] well uh do you know the band helicopters the Swedish rock band well that's that's what it's

[49:01] based on um I to be honest with you I don't know if they asked them him to do that or not but um

[49:12] oh I know what it was they asked him to do the album cover they asked dirty donny uh to do an album cover

[49:20] for the band so he did that and the artwork is is based on um I'm not sure if you remember Ed

[49:28] Big Daddy Roth from the um 60s and 70s yep he did um rat think yep yep okay that kind of art you

[49:38] know with the monster uh the monsters driving a Ford you know right that kind of stuff yeah

[49:43] with a big shifter in the air and all that stuff yeah that's kind of style it is and the

[49:48] helicopters band really wanted that so he had done their cover he basically took that cover and

[49:55] trans transfruted into a back glass with the help of Wade and then they went ahead and finished

[50:03] the whole thing with um with the play field and they didn't stop there though it's kind of neat

[50:12] Wade went ahead and modified the play field he put in I think four or five big holes in it with uh

[50:22] with covers and dirty donny's trademark is the shrunken head and he actually makes these little

[50:30] model shrunken heads that you can buy and he paints a lot of shrunken heads and they're they're

[50:34] classic they look really cool so Wade modified the circuitry so that you have to go do certain things

[50:43] and it lights up a shrunken head from underneath the play field and it's pretty cool effect

[50:50] because it's uh it's an actual little model or a little rubber shrunken head and it's underneath

[50:56] the play field and the the hole we cut out about an inch and a half in diameter and it's

[51:01] covered with clear plastic and you can't see anything until it lights up and once it lights up

[51:06] there's this shrunken head under there and you know it it almost looks like a hologram but it's

[51:11] actually the 3D you know shrunken head so you write up uh I think four or five shrunken heads and

[51:19] when you get to the last one then the um siren on the top the spinning flashing light siren

[51:27] goes off and you win an extra ball but it's really hard I mean it's incredibly hard to do it

[51:35] wow well now what's this other thing that you uh you also made like an aluminum trailer with

[51:42] pinball machines in it that you bring to some of the shows what's up with that

[51:45] oh that's that's the little juju and that was um uh spraying out of an idea that

[51:58] this one one person who's been helping me through this um

[52:04] help me work in the little the lucky juju since it's inception and his name's Jim Gruber

[52:11] and he's just one of the people just really like what I was doing and just started helping me run it

[52:15] and um he's always coming up with these ideas and this was another hair brain idea he said hey

[52:21] look why don't we put some pinball machines on a truck and take them around you know and try

[52:25] and you know get people to play pinball like that you know it's like we're always trying to get

[52:30] people to come to the juju so we were jamming on that and then all of a sudden this um this old

[52:36] Spartan manner um just kind of appeared you know the guy wanted uh about 1200 bucks for it

[52:43] and it was like a 1947 Spartan manner um it's like an air stream only better uh they're a little

[52:51] better built um but it's 1947 so it needed a lot of work but it was just what I wanted because I

[52:58] wanted to gut it you know so it took us about a year and a half and uh we actually popped the body

[53:07] off we we took everything out and we got it down to a shell on aluminum shell and it's built like an

[53:12] aircraft so it's got um it's got bulkhead aluminum bulkheads in there and we actually you know

[53:19] took the body off the frame and it's a metal frame because the floor was shot so if I should

[53:26] say I reinforced the whole metal frame with the help of of another person Dylan Kelly who did a

[53:32] lot of the welding then we put in a new axle uh so that so it would uh wouldn't jar the machines

[53:39] too much we put in a battery box so that we could put 12 batteries in there and an inverter so if

[53:46] we ever wanted to go camping and play pinball we could do that we wouldn't need electricity

[53:51] and then the last thing we did was we put in four hydraulic feet and that was really cool um

[54:01] so those welded into each corner of this whole thing all things about 25 feet long it's about

[54:07] um seven feet tall on the inside probably less than that actually it's about six and a half feet

[54:13] tall and it doesn't go it doesn't curve drastically like an air stream it goes up the walls go

[54:21] up straight and then they curve over it looks like a big silver loaf of bread that's that's kind

[54:27] of leaning forward like it's in a hurry so when I uh I've got all the machines and I have to

[54:33] strap them in the back so that I can tow it otherwise it's it's too heavy on the tongue as a

[54:38] tow vehicle so uh I push them all the back and it's and it holds six machines and then when I show

[54:46] up uh you know wherever I'm going to put it I I unhitch it and then I go inside and I push a button

[54:57] and all the hydraulic feet come down and it lifts the whole thing up and it levels itself

[55:02] and it does it pretty well I mean I rarely ever have to correct it and so it's up on all four feet

[55:10] so it's not on the wheels and there's no it's not sprung in any way and it's really solid

[55:14] and everything's level so then I push all the machines into place and uh and uh and uh

[55:20] there's electricity I plug into their juice and I'm good to go and what are the six machines that

[55:26] you're running in it well right now because I take it to a lot of schools and um you know I'm trying

[55:33] to try to get it on you know the educational thing through pinball trim outer space so I've got

[55:39] um let's see you walk in the door for if you see his uh sky lab and then a Apollo and then 2001

[55:47] and then I've got outer space and then I've got uh space Odyssey and then the last machine in the back

[55:55] is Mars Trek that was sky I was waiting for you to say Mars Trek it was really waiting for that one

[56:00] well I tell you the one I'm working on right now that we're restoring down at the at our storage

[56:06] is rocket three oh you're the ballet game yeah yeah that's a pretty rare game

[56:13] not a Tim Arnold said it and I just said man that's that's a cool game yeah it's really rare

[56:18] yeah I know and it's so weird because we're a 501 c3 we we run a little thing in Craigslist we say

[56:26] hey you know why don't you donate your machine to us and we'll give you a tax write off so we

[56:30] actually get we've gotten a few machines that way and it's great um and some of them get fixed up

[56:36] and they go right into the juju like um uh the guy I have a name Paul I think uh gave us a umbraeon

[56:44] you know and it was a great chip little little wear on the play field but you know didn't really

[56:48] have to do anything to it and went right in there and people love it uh rocket three

[56:53] that was like cat like one of your road trips that I've seen on the DVD where we had to go up

[57:00] in the northern California into some backwards territory that you wouldn't you wouldn't believe I

[57:06] mean I couldn't make this stuff up and me and Dan Fonds another uh juju regular helper and he and I

[57:14] you know took us a whole day to go up there but this guy you know called I wrote me an email I'm

[57:18] saying yeah I got this rocket three and you know you just kind of you go world can you send me a

[57:24] picture now I don't have a camera I'm gonna well uh you're gonna donate it and yeah I'll just give it

[57:28] to you guys so should we go up there you know well yeah we finally get there and we see it's out

[57:35] on the porch let me just go oh shit yeah the things probably you know a real turd and we just bet

[57:42] I don't know how much in gas and whole day going out to get this thing and and and it's just like

[57:48] all the paint is just totally flaked you know on the on the side of the cabin I'm gonna oh shit

[57:53] so we go okay you know we go up there and we look at it and the back glass is pert near perfect

[58:00] and the play field was was you know didn't have it the the wearer you know and and all the plastics were

[58:07] there and I was just kind of wow you know wow that's great so uh we thanked him profusely and loaded

[58:14] it up and so now we're in the process of painting and thanks to your DVDs by the way yeah yeah yeah

[58:21] well that's that's pretty cool I mean so you get you put a thing on Craigslist and how many machines

[58:26] do you think you've had donated that'll probably at least 20 wow that's pretty good now how many

[58:31] machines is the juju own well the juju doesn't really um what the juju is is me uh and I

[58:46] and actually the juju is not the nonprofit the nonprofit is an Neptune Beach amusement museum

[58:52] and it's actually we're changing the name to the Pacific pinball museum and the way it works is

[58:58] um I still own all my machines and I just lend them to the nonprofit and the nonprofit gets to

[59:12] generate money off of them for the for the museum effort that's that makes sense so basically

[59:21] um they any machines that are donated to the museum those belong to the museum but the juju is

[59:30] actually because I started it and I didn't start it as a corporation I just started it as a as a

[59:36] sole owner so all the machines that I buy um they still belong to me at some point I will donate

[59:46] them all to the museum but this point um machines donated to the museum belong to the museum

[59:53] and my machines I'm just loaning to the museum right that's pretty much how Tim Arnold's doing it too

[59:59] yeah yeah real similar in fact it's funny when Tim and I first met um uh he I was staying at his

[01:00:10] house there was through a friend of a friend and he came up to me and that told me he was jealous of

[01:00:15] me and I kind of went well well he kind of floored me I said what what are you talking about

[01:00:21] I go I I said I got like what 20 machines into my little little than the juju and you know

[01:00:28] what are you talking about you got a thousand machines and you're the god of pinball and uh

[01:00:32] because well yeah but you're doing it and I said what do you mean doing it because you're you're

[01:00:38] running it you're you're out there doing it and you're open every weekend and you've been doing

[01:00:42] it for three years now and we I don't understand how you do it and I just so I just said well

[01:00:49] Tim you know you you're really fixated on buying uh the building which I think is admirable but

[01:00:56] you kind of miss the boat so one he you know why don't you do what I did just rent a place

[01:01:01] and he that he didn't like that idea at first but that you know after he ran the numbers he could

[01:01:05] he saw that you know for the time being um he'd actually make more money and he'd be doing what he

[01:01:12] wanted to do which was to have machines out there for people to play and he could actually raise

[01:01:19] money uh doing that and it turned out that he's doing just that he's I think he's raised more money

[01:01:27] for the museum for his museum effort than in the past two years uh then he ever did doing the

[01:01:35] fun night right and it's more credible too because he actually has an establishment yeah I know that's

[01:01:41] and that's what he really wanted to do I said well you know you just like just how to do it just

[01:01:46] you know yeah who likes to rent I don't like to rent I'd love to buy a building I don't have the

[01:01:51] money you don't have the money so what you know just rent and then you know then you'll not only

[01:01:57] you know be making some money and saving more up but you'll also be establishing yourself

[01:02:03] you know and so and and he has I mean look at what he's done right right yeah and I should

[01:02:09] mention that when we mentioned Tim Arnold of course this is the pinball hall of fame which is pinball

[01:02:14] museum dot org and then the lucky juju why don't you give us well why don't we why don't you give

[01:02:20] us all your websites uh okay the change your website is www.uju.com kind of you juju

[01:02:33] dot com and the museum website is www.nbam.org it's Nancy Baker Adam Mary

[01:02:46] fan's word Neptune Beach amusement museum dot org and and what is that what is the whole I mean

[01:02:54] you're you're your purpose of this museum in that I mean it sounds like ultimately that's where

[01:03:00] you're heading with lucky juju is is like some sort of of real you know I don't know maybe not

[01:03:05] real but you know it's a bad word to use but you know like a you and a physical museum oh yeah

[01:03:13] yeah I'm looking at I mean it's very similar to Tim except for I don't think either of us have

[01:03:25] a museum at this point um I have one room that's kind of museum like or it's going to be one

[01:03:32] in opens but I don't really consider either of us to have a museum because a museum is is not just

[01:03:41] a collection I mean it is it is information it exhibits and it's interactive now he's got

[01:03:52] and it's a collection so he's certainly got the collection and it's certainly interactive I mean

[01:04:00] an interactive isn't a requirement actually for a museum but the thing that's lacking on both of

[01:04:06] ours is education you know this and and it's kind of funny when Tim and I talk about this he

[01:04:16] like we have a few differences one is he coins all his machines all mine are on free play he's

[01:04:23] always bugging me to like coin my machines and it's like and I'm always saying no no I think you

[01:04:28] got to put him on free play in charge of flat free you know and I can't you know this advantages

[01:04:34] going either way but the one thing that that we get into kuhuts about is or get it get into a

[01:04:41] tip about is you know I really think to call yourself a museum you got to you got to have some

[01:04:48] exhibits you got to have some educational content to all of this now he's got those little

[01:04:58] signs that he puts up but most of them were all faded and everything and that's a good start and

[01:05:02] I was trying to offer to help him clean that up a bit right you know it's overwhelming

[01:05:10] Tim does an incredible job I mean he's only got the hippie to help him and and Charlotte and

[01:05:16] you know I got my wife Melissa and I and a handful of other people but it's a huge task and

[01:05:21] and it's funny you think there'd be all sorts of people out there just dying to help you but

[01:05:27] it's when it comes down to it you know you got to open deal with the public and fix machines

[01:05:33] all the time it's pretty hard now how many machines are physically at the lucky juju how many

[01:05:40] how many games yeah I think 36 I think there's 34 pinball machines a bowler a pot bowler and a

[01:05:53] a sea wolf right okay I know that's a video game but all right we'll be back in a moment with

[01:06:00] Michael's sheet of the lucky juju after these messages deep in the forest of eastern Canada you

[01:06:07] will find something well groundbreaking and something that's very very pinball but something that's

[01:06:16] really really small presenting classic play field reproductions two guys in their basement

[01:06:26] we've got the passion we've got the gear and we've got the quality doing our very best to remake

[01:06:31] classic and more modern pinball replacement parts classic play field reproduction

[01:06:41] play fields back glasses plastic sets

[01:06:47] on the web at classic play fields calm this portion of top cast is brought to you by pin game

[01:06:56] journal covering the world of pinball is them online at www.pingamejournal.com all right we're

[01:07:03] back with Michael's sheet of the lucky juju with some more of his pinball museum stories tell me about

[01:07:11] your show you do it you do a show in in california too tell me about that um yeah last year

[01:07:20] you know our goal trying to get a bigger space for the museum so we needed to raise awareness

[01:07:31] and also there's two shows here already there's the pinnacle go and there's a california extreme

[01:07:38] and both of them are different from each other and i got approached by another pinball enthusiast

[01:07:46] out here Jim detrick from pinball revival and he operates a shop in the vapeau and he's probably the

[01:07:56] best restoration pinball restoration for electro mechanical out here on the west coast and

[01:08:08] he said you know i want to do my own i want to do a show let's do you know you should you and

[01:08:13] i should get together to do a show and um i said yeah you know that sounds like a great idea what do

[01:08:19] you have in mind said well i want to do it at the merin civics center and i thought oh crap you

[01:08:26] know that's the frank Lloyd Wright is the famous architect design that's the main building and

[01:08:32] it's in merin county where you know kind of infamous i think we're alive for being very

[01:08:37] expensive you know and this man i thought holy crap you know that's that's going to be expensive

[01:08:42] but then i thought you know i've been to a few pinball shows all in town and and you know pinnacle go

[01:08:48] cal extreme and for the most part um you know they're not always held in the in the nicest place

[01:08:57] and and the whole thing behind that was like when i went out to look at the place and went wow

[01:09:02] this is over the top you know this is a really nice place that's a big a lake behind it you know

[01:09:08] and it's just in a really nice area and it's beautiful so we looked at dates in

[01:09:14] October the first weekend in October came up so we started talking to him we had to wait

[01:09:20] and wait and wait to find out if these people were going to cancel because once somebody does a show

[01:09:24] there they they get it every year and let's say opt out well finally they opted out so we said

[01:09:30] okay let's go for it so we put down the deposit and then Jim and i started talking and we just

[01:09:34] said look uh you know we got a bunch of people interested in our concept was to do a pinball show

[01:09:42] that had uh the the whole range of pinball machines and we're real fortunate to have a collector

[01:09:51] out here uh Richard Konger who has silver silver ball ranch this guy's been collecting pinballs since

[01:09:58] 1952 uh he's got a he's a shop teacher up in subastipal california or he or he was he's retired at

[01:10:06] this point um he taught taught auto shop and he's been collecting pinballs his cards as you know

[01:10:12] Richard Konger silver ball ranch pinball a master and i don't know exactly how many machines he has

[01:10:19] it probably isn't as quite as many as him but pretty close and the thing is is that he's concentrated

[01:10:27] on really uh well he's actually collected the whole gamut but his earlier years he was collecting

[01:10:36] the really early early pinball machines and um then he would restore them and fix them up and then

[01:10:44] anybody who wants to go see him can call him up and go up there and he's more than happy to show him to

[01:10:50] you know um but it's not um it's like a museum at his at his ranch and he's got these barns where

[01:10:57] he hasn't set up in well so we said okay we got to hook up with him and we got to get Larry's

[01:11:03] archerians got this incredible collection of wedge heads and wood rails and then another collector

[01:11:09] Joe Sweeney just in beautiful machines that he's been collecting and restoring then Don Hiley who

[01:11:17] was from pinnigogo also has a bunch of newer machines so we managed to put together and then I

[01:11:23] have all the machines I've been collecting which mainly 70s machines so I brought about 100

[01:11:29] machines into the into the pot um Richard his machines weren't for play but he covered the

[01:11:37] earlier machines we're talking from 1930 up to 1940 everything pre-flipper and then uh

[01:11:48] Joe Sweeney and Larry's archerians brought their collections so we ended up with um on the floor

[01:11:56] for play over 300 machines and then for just looking at historical machines Richard had about 50

[01:12:04] machines and then I wanted to really set up a special area where you had machines uh that were

[01:12:11] either pre-flipper or pretty rare uh that you could play and so I brought a ballet bumper and a

[01:12:17] moonshot and the Kings and Dan Miller brought his rockola collection which is um you know the

[01:12:28] World's Fair World Series and um you know I'll show you I forget a Yalta brought a baffle ball

[01:12:36] and then Cliff uh from Cliffey's protectors brought a blue ribbon you know so we had a little area

[01:12:44] which uh you could you could play machines supervised there's you know maybe six or seven machines

[01:12:50] and then I had a little section of the science part of pinball so we had the history and then the

[01:12:56] science and I borrowed a bunch of uh exhibits from the exploratorium uh feeling with the

[01:13:02] electromagnetism and circuits and then I had the clear pinball and some other stuff and

[01:13:09] um it was it was pretty incredible I I don't know if you've seen the pictures of it

[01:13:16] yeah I didn't it looked amazing yeah I mean it was jaw dropping people

[01:13:23] they had no idea I mean we worked so hard on it and they came in the door and I literally we

[01:13:30] would sit there and watch them and their jaws would drop you know we're going wow we're actually

[01:13:34] making bets you know as to how far they would open their mouth and you know because nobody had

[01:13:39] really done you know the whole the whole package and I thought that that you know Jim really believed

[01:13:46] in the whole thing and everybody really believed in it and the thing that brought it all together

[01:13:50] with Dan Font did this poster uh of this uh like Alphonse Muka um what uh woman playing pinball

[01:14:01] and it just summed the whole thing up because she's playing this old you know it was a fantasy pinball

[01:14:06] machine that he made up out of some a picture of some art deco furniture and he just put some legs on it

[01:14:12] and she's she's playing it and she looks like she's out of the thirties you know and uh the image

[01:14:19] just like caught everybody's attention because it was like really different it looked like an old

[01:14:24] uh you know rock poster from the San Francisco film or days or something right and um and so that

[01:14:30] kind of like just got the enthusiasm going and um we are doing it again this year only we're going

[01:14:39] to add in a whole section of of art and um we uh we've got a bunch of custom made machines uh and

[01:14:49] I'll tell you about another one um but these custom art machines plus uh Dan and Ed castle

[01:14:58] have been painting these back glass murals they've been taken back glasses like uh fireball 2001

[01:15:07] and mermaids actually and you supplied the pictures for that one and they've been they've blown

[01:15:12] them up and and they're painting them and they're just we had one up at the at the expo last year

[01:15:18] that's the first one and Dan Font did it and it was uh majorettes and that was one of Larry's games

[01:15:25] and it it was there it was it was like uh 10 feet by 10 feet it was huge and it was hanging up on the

[01:15:30] wall and uh some people you know you know we're just blown away by that we're you know we didn't

[01:15:37] you know cause any big attention to it we just we're just hung up on the wall in the back you know

[01:15:42] and it was huge I'd never seen anything like that you know so um those are now all hanging up

[01:15:49] at the juju and the nbam uh museum room for our opening now do you think you'll be able to

[01:15:56] you know you had 300 playable machines set up in 2007 for 2008 show do you think you'll be able to

[01:16:04] get the same number of machines or or more or whatever yeah we're gonna have more you are for sure

[01:16:11] yeah because um see a lot of people didn't bring too didn't bring machines um

[01:16:17] um because it you know it's our first show they they don't know it's from uh you know

[01:16:23] from jack so uh so they didn't know and um so basically all those machines were supplied by me

[01:16:30] and and and Larry and and uh Joe Richard Konger and Don Hailey um and you know a lot of group like

[01:16:39] uh Helmet and Deanna Brought machines and you know small groups but this year you know people

[01:16:45] are gonna um bring in they're gonna bring a lot more machines and hopefully there's going to be

[01:16:51] a lot more machines for sale um and Mac Mac's gonna show up and I know he's gonna bring a boat

[01:16:58] load of machines because I'm gonna make him uh because a lot of this is his fault

[01:17:05] and I hope we're gonna get I don't know if you knew Jim Tober he was uh he used to run for

[01:17:11] amusement only out here in Berkeley is it he live in Mexico now or something he's in Mexico but he

[01:17:17] was at the pinnigogo and I got to hang out with him but I'm trying to convince him to come up for

[01:17:22] this because he really liked the pinnigogo this year he's he's been in you know Mexico for eight

[01:17:27] eight years or so and um I think I think he liked like uh getting you know he's pretty he's

[01:17:36] pretty famous in the whole pinball scene you wrote that book till and um he's pretty very interesting guy

[01:17:45] but I we have a separate uh website for that actually can I give that yeah yeah sure it's um

[01:17:54] www.pacificpinball.org

[01:18:00] and for 2008 what are the dates uh this is unfortunate it is the um it's the first weekend in

[01:18:08] October again because that's that's what we have to stick to from now on and it is October um

[01:18:16] she was it October 3rd 4th and 5th but that's those are the it's essentially the same date as

[01:18:24] pinball expo in Chicago yeah yeah it's a Friday Saturday and Sunday um and the expo in Chicago

[01:18:32] goes from Wednesday right that which is the first right exactly yeah I'm not sure yeah yeah

[01:18:39] yeah Wednesdays it's the same date it's unfortunate um we uh we were gonna wait till we had the

[01:18:46] poster I mean we already our date was already set so yeah it's unfortunate um but um that's

[01:18:53] that's the way it happens sometimes and um now but we'd love to have you come out and be a

[01:18:58] guest speaker on Saturday if you'd like to do that I don't want to put you on the spot so I won't do

[01:19:03] that no I'm I got to clear with some things here but you know I'm I'm pretty much I'm pretty

[01:19:11] much in okay you know well that would be excellent great speakers like bear Comeroff who lives up

[01:19:20] up north uh and he's he's done that book um you know air maintenance of pinball which a lot of

[01:19:26] people buy it's it's really good um I learned myself I learned off of your DVDs so you're my hero

[01:19:37] yeah boy I'm just everybody's hero yeah it'd be great to have to have you out there um and it is

[01:19:42] pretty mind-boggling and it's all because of the fact that he's back in 1952 when you know some of it

[01:19:48] was what you know 10 years old so it's been pretty good shape so I've never been in this show when

[01:19:56] it sounds really really interesting um I mean in 300 machines and mostly electro mechanical are you

[01:20:03] saying yeah the maturity of electro mechanical um that is actually um we're we're we're going to be

[01:20:16] upping the amount of newer machines because I hate to face the bitter reality but the people people

[01:20:22] like to play the newer machines I personally like the electro mechanical machines I like them both

[01:20:30] but um uh yeah our emphasis is on is on the electro mechanical because um you can still play a

[01:20:39] lot of the newer machines in a lot of places so it's it's the older ones and that's why the

[01:20:46] judy was started there was no place to play electro mechanical pinball machines uh nowhere at all

[01:20:52] um you know there like two or three bars in the whole Bay Area had electro mechanical machines and

[01:20:58] so uh I like to see that kind of a show just because it's a you know it's a rare opportunity to be

[01:21:05] able to go in there and and just see all those machines 30 40 years ago or more and be and set up

[01:21:14] and you get to play them you know now as far as like the um you talked about at the judy you couldn't

[01:21:24] have any manual ball load or push up games as you call them what what is the deal with that you're

[01:21:29] saying that people just don't get that uh this is it's basically two issues um the mac does it

[01:21:38] that we're at max place you know on Friday night he's he's got most of his machines are manual

[01:21:44] you know spoon fed I don't like to do it because I'm dealing with the public and um I get

[01:21:51] enough of the little kids coming up going hey Mr. Maul Stank you know and you got to go over

[01:21:56] there and shake it for him and the last thing I want is hey this machine's broken because the ball

[01:22:03] didn't come up right and you got to explain to him how it works so then what they do and I

[01:22:07] I'll tell you I know this from experience because when I first started the little judy I put a

[01:22:11] bali bumper in there and then I put it and then after they beat the crap out of that and if

[01:22:17] uh I put a bali rocket in there uh you know which was a push up and they beat the crap out of

[01:22:23] that and and the one thing they do is they they would love to you know get all the balls racked up

[01:22:30] and then just pound the uh the shooter to get them all playing you know yeah you mean they load

[01:22:37] multiple balls into the shooter lane and and yeah and you know and you know hey that ain't the way

[01:22:43] you play it and be it's really hard on the machine and the the last thing is that a lot of

[01:22:49] machines are set up you know and I know it's it's an easy fix but I just you know I don't like doing

[01:22:56] is that when you punch off a game uh that's a spoon fed um if you don't push up that first ball

[01:23:05] and launch it and engage the first ball relay then that coil that you know releases the ball

[01:23:12] down to to for loading just stays on right yeah it's a it's a hold coil it stays in until the first

[01:23:20] point is scored you know yeah unless you you got to modify it and there's a few ways you can do it but

[01:23:27] I just you know I to me it's just not worth it um the other thing is that I can't afford

[01:23:36] those kind of machines I have very few of them um the ones I tend to get that are like that are

[01:23:42] really all pre-flipper and believe me people they just don't get it um so I'm kind of at the

[01:23:49] whim of the public on that one and uh if I ever get a huge building and uh have enough staff to

[01:23:59] maintain it then yeah I would put push-up then but in the kind of situation I have now you know

[01:24:04] I can't do that it's just it's just too much um too much labor and I think I would lose a big

[01:24:10] audience I mean if I had to put in some modern machines I'd probably lose you know I probably

[01:24:16] wouldn't have as big a crowd as I do but once I started putting the solid state in you know I got

[01:24:22] I got a whole other generation of people that remember those machines and and so on and then

[01:24:28] when I put the newer machines in then I get another crowd you know that that likes to play those so

[01:24:33] you got to kind of you know spread it out like that um and um the advantage of that is that

[01:24:43] you do get some spillover you get people that came in there for the new games that like that

[01:24:48] discover hey the old games are pretty cool too and they start playing those you know yeah yeah

[01:24:56] I kind of find that uh you know like I've got in in my basement I've got a hundred games

[01:25:02] set up and restored and and I've got stuff ranging from you know 1950 up to you know 2007 and

[01:25:13] it's like most people just don't really get the wood rails um some people get the wedge heads

[01:25:22] um but air you know but really the most people congregate towards the newer solid state stuff and

[01:25:29] it really kind of breaks my heart to be frank I mean I've got the solid state stuff but I mean to

[01:25:35] me it's all the I didn't know you had that many machines set up that's incredible yeah I've got a

[01:25:41] pretty huge basement thing going in and it to me it just breaks my heart to have this many

[01:25:46] restored wood rails and wedge heads that you can't find anywhere and people just aren't all

[01:25:54] that interested in it it just breaks my heart yeah no I hear you because it is painful yeah but um

[01:26:03] I guess I kind of learned a bit from um from Steve Hopper and uh from Tim Arnold um

[01:26:12] they can't be too advised and I I think I I uh managed to realize the wisdom of it and that was

[01:26:20] um you know a couple of things you kind of got to give people you know what they want it's not

[01:26:27] what you want it's what they want because um it's basically you got to depend upon them um but the

[01:26:33] other thing I was of course you know I was only going to have electro mechanicals and then and

[01:26:39] I always thought everyone was precious and then I think uh they they tell me they go Mike you're

[01:26:44] still in the romantic phase of of pinball you know and pretty soon you'll recognize them for the

[01:26:53] quarter hordes that they are which uh you know it's that's that's that's kind of the truth of it you

[01:27:06] know and uh yeah it is too bad that's why yeah um you know what you know what though uh Clay

[01:27:15] something's happened that really make it all worthwhile I mean sometimes you just go god if I

[01:27:21] see another kid you know with flipper riders you know where they sit there and just go get

[01:27:26] get it in there you know there's slapping the flippers and you and you realize god you know that's

[01:27:30] why they break it all the time but then you get an old timer comes in and just like you know

[01:27:39] sees what you have and it just and just comes up to him just gives you night this is man

[01:27:45] this is really great I'm really glad you're doing this and I you really hope you stay open for a

[01:27:50] long time because this is you know I haven't seen this for for so long and I used to play these games

[01:27:56] and they tell you a few stories you know and you just got to go wow and at the expo the most

[01:28:02] beautiful thing happened was when I mean I I literally had to go off somewhere and shed a tear

[01:28:08] because it really hit me this I saw this this old man and he had a little boy next to him who's

[01:28:16] on I like a milk crate or something I think has been brought milk crates in and you know he's

[01:28:22] watching him play and he they were both playing these electro mechanicals from from the juju and

[01:28:29] and he a little kid looks up and goes hey day I grandpa I just scored you know hundred points

[01:28:35] the grandpa is like he goes yeah I just lit my ABC you know and it was just like wow you know

[01:28:41] they they just shared this experience that's going to be a memory for that little kid forever you know

[01:28:48] and it was it was just this transgenerational bonding that happened and I'm not you I mean

[01:28:55] you ever going to see that with video games or with you know with anything else I mean it's it

[01:29:00] was such a special moment and they had it together right there and it just that was really cool

[01:29:05] you know it made me feel really proud that we'd done something that was capable of achieving that

[01:29:12] you know yeah I I know what you mean it's like I I it's a little different because I've got these

[01:29:18] games all set up in my basement and I've spent just oodles of time restoring you know in my in my

[01:29:24] basement environment I've got all these EMS you know I mean I probably got 30 solid states but

[01:29:30] everything else is a lecture mechanical and and I got it just a ton of stuff that you just I mean

[01:29:36] games are talking about that you can't find anywhere much less playable you know I mean you could go

[01:29:44] Tim Arnold and yeah Tim Arnold's got tons of wood rails but he only has a couple at the pinball

[01:29:51] hall of fame you know I mean they're not you know he doesn't concentrate on wood rails he

[01:29:56] concentrates on like 70's EMS and newer stuff so I mean just to find this stuff much less find it

[01:30:03] where it's like playable in like really playable and really restored to me and and and people just

[01:30:09] kind of walked past it and just kind of like they just don't get it it just it just kills me because

[01:30:15] they're they're missing something that that I just I don't understand it's something that that

[01:30:21] they're never going to see somewhere else and they're never going to be able to experience

[01:30:25] anywhere else and I'm like you know you're missing an opportunity you can go and play Simpsons

[01:30:30] pinball party or or Lord of the Rings or or or get away or Twilight Zone I mean crap I

[01:30:37] mean there's got to be you know 250 people in Michigan that got those games in their basement

[01:30:41] but where are you going to go play a you know a marble queen or or a Niagara or you know a spot

[01:30:48] bowl or or you know or queen of hearts or any of that stuff and the and people just they just

[01:30:53] it just doesn't hit them you know yeah yeah I know I know and you also have some of these

[01:30:58] amusement games that I just like gruel after I mean I I never seen this stuff I know Mac had

[01:31:06] this one called Sky Raiders yeah it's got the real the hot looking babes and I think it was

[01:31:12] done in the 50s and they all got little jet packs and guns yeah yeah it's just incredible artwork

[01:31:18] I think Dan's actually gonna be starting the mural for that one yeah yeah that's united

[01:31:24] Sky Raiders 1958 and another gun game that had very similar artwork same artist is the 1959

[01:31:32] Valley moon raider which I um which I own or I should say I used to own and now a good friend of mine

[01:31:40] has taken control of that one but yeah yeah yeah that's a unbelievable babes in space outfits with

[01:31:47] moon helmets on and large tatas as it may be great game you know and um also that little um

[01:31:56] I don't count what is that one with the little cars that go around and you play pinball and yeah

[01:32:00] raceway yeah raceway or flying turns flying turns yeah like Jim Dietrich has that one right what a gas

[01:32:07] um and it's funny okay the only yet I'm I'm teaching uh kid from high school he's I'm teaching him

[01:32:15] how to work on these machines he's gonna start helping me so he goes well what how many machines have

[01:32:20] you got at home and I go pinball machines because yeah how many you got I go well actually I don't

[01:32:25] have any you know what because but I thought you said you have over three other machines I go I do

[01:32:32] but you know they're at the warehouse you know and then they're at the juju because we'll don't

[01:32:37] you have anything at home I go yeah I have one game it's a it's a bollette right him yeah and it

[01:32:43] the the bollette you know the puck bollard yeah yeah by yeah by god leave yeah and it's it's great

[01:32:50] it's like yeah that's about all I need right right then you can have flippers you know but um so

[01:32:57] you've got 300 games in your collection yeah and and how where do you storm oh I like the secret

[01:33:05] undisclosed location and when in how much does the secret undisclosed location cost you a month

[01:33:11] 500 bucks now that seems cheap how did you find that well that takes them doing I mean

[01:33:19] and and these are also I'm housing other people's games you know um like Larry's uh Larry's games

[01:33:26] and um and all the n-band collection too um we uh it's at the naval air station that what you

[01:33:36] know then the alamine naval air station um and I just kept bugging them and bugging them and finally

[01:33:43] um I managed to get a uh a warehouse space there and I I think I'm gonna have it for another year

[01:33:49] that's why I'm really kind of under the gun and I really got to start raising some serious money

[01:33:54] because I I don't want to have to move these again I mean I I had my garages and everything and I

[01:34:01] had rented a garage and it was just filled to the brim I mean and at the two due every possible

[01:34:08] space we had these machine stuff so finally get this storage space and it just cleared everything up

[01:34:13] it really made it great but um yeah I mean it just can't last forever so because they're going to

[01:34:19] start tearing stuff down at the base it been it closed about 11 years ago and my old dream is to get

[01:34:27] one of the buildings on the base for the museum um I'm trying to convince the city that this is a good

[01:34:34] thing and it's a little bit of a cut um I tell you what one cool thing I've been doing Clay this

[01:34:42] this is pretty neat I was really proud of this one I decided well the only way I'm gonna get the

[01:34:47] city to realize the how great it would be to have a pinball museum is like if I started doing

[01:34:55] really good stuff you know community stuff and so I started having like uh the girls and um it's

[01:35:02] called girls incorporated and they empower young women so I have them come by for field trips

[01:35:09] I have schools come by for field trips and I've been doing a lot of fun raising for other

[01:35:14] beyond profits by letting them use the juju to have parties and raise money and then what I started

[01:35:21] doing was um I thought you know the kids get all the attention you know it's always about the kids

[01:35:27] and I don't have any kids myself um but I was that you know nobody ever thinks about the old

[01:35:33] people you know and there's a lot of old people in this town because they you know they just never

[01:35:37] left and there's quite a few care facilities and you know elder care and there's um so I fixed

[01:35:44] up the first machine I got with a um not a pioneer a spirit of 76 I wanted to get something that

[01:35:50] didn't have uh women on it and I fixed it up and I put it in the senior care center and uh they

[01:35:58] love it you know I put it in there put it on free play and uh I just let them I told them they

[01:36:03] could have it for six months and then I'll swap it out with another machine and you know I got

[01:36:10] I got a little newspaper article out of it and then um then I found this other place but these

[01:36:16] people are so uh they're in such bad shape that they're mainly in wheelchairs so I thought well

[01:36:22] crap what can I do and I realized yeah I got these little cocktail pinball machines I got a couple

[01:36:27] of those so I took a star trip over to this other place and they love it you know they I mean

[01:36:34] they don't have anything to do right so they left to go over there and they played pinball so

[01:36:39] got another little newspaper article about it on it and um I hope to do so much you know like

[01:36:45] good community work that the politicians will actually be ashamed to say no

[01:36:52] now no do you have like a real job that you do

[01:36:58] well yeah what I did was I fixed up my house I have an old Victorian and uh and it's had a little

[01:37:05] little place next door so I ran out the bottom and I went to place next door and so that covers my

[01:37:12] mortgage and buys me food don't have any kids um I do freelance work for science museums

[01:37:19] build exhibits and stuff huh that that buys me pinballs and and the other thing I do is I you

[01:37:26] know I ran out the little juju and since that's mine um then I I get to derive income off of that

[01:37:35] um when we when I ran out the juju that that all goes to the to the Neptune Beach amusement

[01:37:42] museum the nonprofit but if I ran out the little juju um since I built that and did it all with my

[01:37:49] own money um that's that's how I'm making a living and it's not a real good one to be honest with

[01:37:56] you but you know shit when I get when I get a company that rents it they pay pretty good and

[01:38:01] I go over there wow um yeah it's kind of tough I mean uh especially with the economy turning

[01:38:12] crappy but what I'm finding out is that you know when the economy goes bad hell that's when pinball

[01:38:18] made it made it uh with the heyday for pinball right right yeah yeah it's traditionally when the

[01:38:25] economy was bad pinball did well yeah yeah so I'm hoping for that um have you noticed an increase

[01:38:34] in the value of pinball machines no at least here in Detroit um things have really taken a dump

[01:38:42] but you know we're the you know like the 50th economy in the United States 50th worse you know

[01:38:49] it's hard to sell games in Detroit for more than three four five hundred dollars uh

[01:38:56] electric mechanical machines actually are really hard to get more than three or four hundred

[01:39:00] dollars for here in this town now the rest of the country that may not be the case but here in

[01:39:05] Detroit things are uh people are are fairly conservative about about buying things at least

[01:39:11] at this point in time uh-huh well that's good I mean for a collector yeah but you know the on

[01:39:18] the other side is people think that when they have machines that generally that you know they're

[01:39:23] worth more than that but the reality is is that they're they're difficult to sell in this town for

[01:39:28] for a lot of money you know uh I'm not saying that that some things don't sell for money but

[01:39:34] you know a lot of things just you know a lot of you know your typical average or electric

[01:39:37] mechanical you know it's it's 300 bucks here yeah yeah that's fixed and restored you know yeah

[01:39:46] so with your hundred machines all those all those are you know restored and up and running

[01:39:52] yeah yeah actually have a little more than a hundred um it's it's um it's it's it's a

[01:40:00] an interesting space thing but you know we we have parties once or twice a year here and um

[01:40:07] people don't complain that they maybe have to turn sideways to go between things every now and then

[01:40:11] you know it's it works out okay yeah and these are all your machines yeah yeah no they're all mine

[01:40:18] yeah and I probably have another 50 waiting to be restored yeah that I have no place to put but

[01:40:24] they're waiting yeah waiting for what I'm not sure but they're waiting yeah and these are all

[01:40:30] pinball machines are these um no I I run the gamut uh I mean I've they're probably mostly pinball

[01:40:37] but I've got a lot of electro mechanical arcade games um no no no video games when you're looking

[01:40:44] for and yeah I'll send them so you sold a few I yeah well we had this clubhouse you know six

[01:40:51] months ago and I had at one point I had 80 machines in there and it was unbelievable it was like

[01:40:58] you know once a month we would have a meeting and everybody would come in and we would we would

[01:41:03] have like a clinic on fixing machines and you know we we'd we'd we'd play we'd spend the whole

[01:41:09] day there and it was great and you know and it had all this endless room it had like 5500 square feet

[01:41:16] and um you know it just uh around Christmas the you know the people that owned the building just

[01:41:22] said not you can't do this anymore you gotta go and I had to you know and I had all these machines

[01:41:28] there I had I had nowhere to put them I couldn't squeeze them in anywhere so unfortunately I had

[01:41:33] to I had to sell a lot of this stuff yeah and some of it was like unbelievable EM stuff that would

[01:41:41] be impossible to replace that was just so large that I couldn't fit in my basement like I had a

[01:41:49] you know a united uh fifth inning which is like this baseball shuffle alley thing and I had a

[01:41:54] you know a bowl of ramma which is a 20 foot ball bowl and I mean I had all kinds of huge stuff

[01:42:01] that I couldn't fit in the house yeah it was it's just a huge game but I mean it was awesome and

[01:42:09] I just I had to sell I had to basically sell it all because there was no place to put it you know

[01:42:14] yeah so you know that's why we're all always asking people you know how they come up with you know

[01:42:20] you know storage facilities or clubhouses and that and I've just not been able to find

[01:42:24] you know something here in Detroit for our you know for our Detroit EM pinball club you know to do

[01:42:31] something they could enough neighborhood or yeah and that's close that's close by you know yeah so

[01:42:37] well so what do you have now at your house and your basement or how do you yeah yeah I have the

[01:42:42] garage is pretty fall and the basement's fall and I've got a storage unit that's fall and

[01:42:48] everything's pretty fall yeah you know what thing yeah yeah it's um it's tough but you know

[01:42:56] the I thought about this and like like what's the best way to to go about doing this if I really

[01:43:03] want to try and and keep pinball alive out here and you know in general what's the best plan

[01:43:12] and I realized you know you got to combine it's the storage with the shop along with the area

[01:43:20] that you're going to play and display and then if you can roll all that into a place where you can

[01:43:25] bring the public in to help cover all the costs then you know then it'll probably work and

[01:43:35] that's kind of what now I've set this up but the only problem with my place is it's kind of too

[01:43:43] small really needs to be a lot bigger and and Tim got that got that great place but um yeah he's

[01:43:52] got his problems unfortunately with the with the landlord and just I guess location so

[01:44:05] yeah it's a big hassle because everything is so big you know yeah we're not collecting stamps

[01:44:14] rather when he first started helping me move him move these machines he just said why didn't you

[01:44:19] take up stamp collecting yeah but how you get good exercise out of it yeah that's for sure

[01:44:29] well what are your plans for I know you help you help Tim and off a lot with the DVD sales and

[01:44:38] and I guess he helped him with the website too and we have any interest in coming on board with his

[01:44:46] museum effort as far as what what do you mean well I guess what do I mean well I know you're

[01:44:56] you're good friends with Marvin uh Marvin yeah Marvin you go to yeah yeah do you work with him at all

[01:45:07] or do you have any interest in doing a museum to sustain you know this livelihood or you know I

[01:45:15] looked at that you know we talked about maybe doing a pinball show in Detroit and you know we

[01:45:20] talked about maybe you know doing a museum thing because Marvin's getting up there in the years

[01:45:26] and and I don't know his son manages the place I don't know if after Marvin's gone if how much

[01:45:34] interest his son would have and and keeping it going and you know and and we've our club has

[01:45:41] talked about that but I guess nobody's been forced into a corner so we haven't really made any

[01:45:47] decisions or or or or any kind of you know decision of any sort in that regard it's an incredible

[01:45:55] amount of work to do something like that and there really is no money in it as far as like you know

[01:46:01] Tim is you know made all his money operating games back in the 70s and 80s so he's financially

[01:46:07] okay you know it sounds like you're kind of in a similar situation you know I'm not in that

[01:46:13] financial position where I could just give up life and do this full time you know I I have to

[01:46:19] maintain some sort of a job at least at this point yeah and you've got kids yeah so you know so

[01:46:26] it's a little different my situation is a little different than than than these other people

[01:46:30] unfortunately so I can't just give up everything to do pinball yeah yeah and it's um well you

[01:46:40] certainly have done more than your share to like you know keep it going because um like I said

[01:46:47] I wasn't kidding I am I I did pick up your DVD um so you have forget how I found out about that

[01:46:55] I guess through Tim and um that's that's when I realized I could start you know doing it myself

[01:47:03] and then I I don't know if I ever mentioned but Tim calls me professor juju because I was actually

[01:47:09] teaching courses and I'm going to start doing that again in like we had to repair them but

[01:47:17] a lot of it a lot of it was well if anybody seen this DVD you know it basically it was like

[01:47:25] here go watch this DVD and then come back and then we'll go over everything else that you know

[01:47:30] that that you need to know about but yeah I've had there I've had a couple local colleges

[01:47:37] contact me about the stuff on the on the pin repair dot com website you know that they

[01:47:46] they ask permission to take the material and and do develop basically develop of course of course

[01:47:52] about pinball repair from the material yeah you know um there was a there's a lady out here who was

[01:47:59] teaching at a private school and she offered a summer class about pinball and she brought him by the

[01:48:05] juju and I gave a lecture and let him play you know and mainly talk about the art on the on the

[01:48:13] machines there's one thing that I wanted to tell you about that they briefly touched on uh what

[01:48:18] the thing that got me in the pinball was the art I always loved the art and I always thought it

[01:48:22] was such an insane thing that uh that mankind had developed this amusement machine you know with all

[01:48:29] the blinking lights and everything I was always fascinated by that and by the artwork on the

[01:48:33] machines uh and I always thought you know how come how come people don't appreciate this there's

[01:48:39] a few books out but nobody really seems to appreciate this for the fine art that it is you know

[01:48:45] and they realize well it's got this tacky kind of gotty quality to it you know because it's

[01:48:50] commercial it was designed to attract you know to lure the the quarters out of young men's pockets

[01:48:56] you know but uh but beyond that there's some really cool creative you know artwork on a lot of

[01:49:05] this a lot of these pinball machines um and one of the things I was always striving to do was like

[01:49:11] try to elevate the awareness of this art well Jim Dietrich and Wade Kraft got together on a project

[01:49:18] that was commissioned by Joe Sweeney which was to get a well-known artist to create a pinball machine

[01:49:27] and they did it and this just happened about two weeks ago right before pinnacle go go um it took

[01:49:36] him about I think six or more months to put this all together but basically there's an artist

[01:49:43] American artist named William Wiley and he was commissioned to do the art and create a concept for a

[01:49:50] pinball machine and and then Wade uh it was based on a um um north star gotley wedgehead yep yep

[01:50:03] and Wade went ahead and and re-did the play field and took the artwork that the artist generated

[01:50:12] and made a back glass and screened the play field and then Jim Dietrich put it all together

[01:50:19] using parts off of north star and re-done and Wade also did the plastics um they put together this

[01:50:26] machine they brought in another artist to do the stenciling on the sign um that the artist had done

[01:50:34] and they came up with this machine well what and it was called um it was called a only one earth

[01:50:41] and it was a kind of politically correct uh theme about you know the ice caps melting and uh

[01:50:50] you know green you know green technology but it's basically done by by this artist in his style

[01:51:02] okay after it was done we took the first one Jim called me up and he said you want to go down

[01:51:05] to Santa's A I got I got to show this thing to the Santa's A Museum of Art and it was the only one

[01:51:10] produced we took it down there they looked at it and it these are for sale they were going to make

[01:51:16] a series of five of them um and we didn't know what happened the collection people looked at it

[01:51:23] and then we took it apart and blow it back up in the van and had it back up to uh uh to our party

[01:51:28] town and on the way the um the people that put it all together called it up and said hey well good

[01:51:36] news they bought it let me go oh you know how much well they paid $65,000 for it this art pinball

[01:51:43] machine you go wow great wow so it got a blur of mine so then they had an opening this basically a

[01:51:50] couple weeks ago where they have the um they haven't even been built yet but they put the other four

[01:51:56] machines up for sale and the first one was priced at $90,000 that one sold and then the the last

[01:52:05] three were put up for sale at $125,000 I think it was either 120 or 125,000 and all three of them sold

[01:52:14] so it's elevated uh the pinballs to a whole other level as far as as far as I concerned in terms

[01:52:24] of looking at them as art um now you have yet you heard about this not at all I mean this is uh

[01:52:33] this is a new story for me yeah it's pretty incredible I mean it's kind of like imagine

[01:52:39] if Picasso did a pinball machine right you know I'm not a real Picasso fan but still even I would have

[01:52:48] to go hey that pinball machine is going to be worth money you know right and uh so in this case

[01:52:56] they did five of them and with a couple artists proof and um and they're they were I mean that's

[01:53:02] how much they went for and one of them was a museum but I think the other three were either private

[01:53:07] collectors or other four were private collectors there was rumor that one was going to go to New York

[01:53:13] but I I don't think I don't even think they got the chance to buy it to bid on it I think they

[01:53:18] got sold right there that that opening night so pretty incredible and really does do a lot to help

[01:53:28] I think pinball so that's incredible well cool is there anything else that I forgot to ask you?

[01:53:37] no gee I hope I haven't bloated too much no it's pretty good really and all is well that's great I

[01:53:43] I do hope we get to get together at the at the Pacific pinball expo out here and are you going

[01:53:51] to Vegas anytime soon? I'm going to go out with Hoppy and and help him and Charlotte out for

[01:53:59] bid I think is hippies going on vacation in June so you know Tim runs this thing seven days a week

[01:54:08] 365 days a year and I mean he rarely gets a break so we're we did it last year we went out and

[01:54:18] ran it for a week form and so they can take a break so do that again how'd that go?

[01:54:25] so if you want come on out well how did that go when you ran it by yourself?

[01:54:30] you know yeah it was kind of fun I tell you the great part about it is it a key right?

[01:54:35] because I'm right here of course I made a b-line for pinball circus right I really wanted to

[01:54:41] play that and so I was pumping dollars into that thing and then Tim finally came over and

[01:54:47] and goes well here you know my you know that key works on that one

[01:54:53] what you're getting I'm pumping dollars into this thing and I could be playing for free so then

[01:54:58] that so then I started playing it for free but that's what's great you know I I get to go around

[01:55:04] and play any machine I want and you know what it's funny I end up playing the two ballet circuses

[01:55:13] I don't know if you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah I know there's the ballet circus in the

[01:55:18] front and then there's the ballet circus in the back you know balls of popping right?

[01:55:23] right yeah yeah and circuses a version of balls of popping called circus right it's a derivative of it

[01:55:30] right yeah so it's funny but I end up playing those two machines the most because I love balls of

[01:55:36] popping and I love circus and then and then the new circus you know that's that's a lot of fun too

[01:55:43] and you're talking about the pinball circus versus the ballet circus right right right right yeah

[01:55:50] those are yeah the multi the the early 56 circus and then the new what was that 90

[01:55:56] 95 and it's and it's really called pinball circus you know I pinball circus that's right the one that

[01:56:05] Python developed yes yeah and the ballet circus is cool because when you get the ball in that hole

[01:56:11] it kicks it up and it hits the glass yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a great game man that

[01:56:19] I was always blown away I mean that thing was so far ahead of its time having all that

[01:56:23] multi ball had an automatic kick out you know yeah a lot of people don't think about that and yeah

[01:56:30] what a great game yeah no it's it's a really cool game two player I'm not a big fan of two

[01:56:35] player games but you know ball popping is two player too so there you go yeah yeah yeah yeah

[01:56:41] that's kind of weird too that it was a two player I didn't even thought about that yeah that's

[01:56:45] pretty strange for back then yeah and that was like one of the few games that ballet made in the 50s

[01:56:51] right yeah because making bingo yeah they were all about gambling then yeah yeah which

[01:56:58] just one last thing I picked up that at pinnigoga this year had some great deals some really

[01:57:04] cool machines and the neatest thing I picked up well hoppy picked up that really cool stern

[01:57:13] hot hand I think it's called and a really strange game and I saw it and I really you got it

[01:57:19] from Rob Hawkins and Don meeting for 300 bucks but the one I found it was this old ballet gambling

[01:57:26] game called hot rod right yeah yeah yeah Todd McCulloch has one yeah yeah yeah well I got to get

[01:57:34] a schematic for it but it was in really pretty clean shape and just the race cars on it and then

[01:57:41] I just went holy crap and Richard Cogger came up and said well if you don't have that one now

[01:57:45] because I already have one but you know if you don't have one you better get that I mean for $250

[01:57:50] again right now I've never played it I never talked about Todd about his and how it plays what

[01:57:59] is the premise behind that game I guess racing you know and he launched a ball and they end up in

[01:58:06] these different slots you know and I don't know I it really intrigues me though it's somebody said

[01:58:13] it's purely gambling you know yeah Todd Todd said he bought it just because kind of like your

[01:58:19] reaction that it just looked really cool and he had to have it yeah it does look cool yeah but yeah

[01:58:26] the place I don't know I got to go up and look at Richard's now and see if he if he has his set up

[01:58:32] because I'm real curious to see what the actual play on it is well if you're ever in Philly Todd's

[01:58:37] got his set up I know that okay so you know and where he yeah he's right he's right outside of

[01:58:44] Philly Delfia I forget the name of the town that he's in but he's got a he's got a pretty nice

[01:58:49] question actually has two homes he's got one in Seattle and one in Philly and he's got you know

[01:58:56] probably well over a hundred machines restored in Seattle and probably at least 50 in his

[01:59:04] Philly Delfia home wow yeah now have you been over to to Paris to see the pinball museum over there

[01:59:12] no I have not I've I've heard about it and seen pictures of it but I've not been over there no

[01:59:17] okay why have you no no I I actually was working over there for the exploratory I'm at one

[01:59:24] point but I did not know about the museum I don't know if it was even open back then but

[01:59:29] uh it's it's great and the the way they're always story looks beautiful it's just that I'm kind

[01:59:36] of ashamed that you know we've got lots of other machines I know they're in Philly Delfia and France

[01:59:42] and I think that's ironic justice but I find it just incredible that we don't have a pinball museum

[01:59:51] you know in the United States per se I mean I I know Tim Tim's got his but

[01:59:59] I mean a real uh you know you know what I'm talking about don't beat yourself up about that I mean

[02:00:06] in in Tim's defense uh Raphael's place is not open to the public so you know you just can't walk in

[02:00:16] you know yeah so yeah that's true you know he's a filthy rich guy he's got a lot of games frankly I

[02:00:24] think he kind of overestores on my you know I've seen a lot of pictures and I think he goes a

[02:00:29] little at least to my liking of course this is just personal opinion I think he's gone maybe a

[02:00:35] step too far in the restoration um problem like herb silver is there no but he every one he

[02:00:42] repaints the cabinet and and and to me it's just like I don't know you know if you had a Picasso

[02:00:49] and it had some flaws and some you know nicks and gouges in it and that you know would you touch

[02:00:54] it up and and my opinion on the 50 stuff is that you got to be really really careful about what

[02:01:00] you do um you know I agree I I I don't really like to you know repaint something unless it's totally

[02:01:07] shot right right right um so you know you got to be careful important to get it you know uh

[02:01:15] repaired and working properly yep um and you know if you need to do a paint catch up on the playfield

[02:01:23] you know so be it but yeah um the back glass touch ups that that people do I think do more damage

[02:01:30] things like yeah you know because that's that's really hard to do you need to the right

[02:01:36] inks and stuff to get the translucency right yeah just um and cabinets unless you really know what

[02:01:43] you're doing hell you can you can yeah spot those from a mile away yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[02:01:50] yeah that's the way I feel too yeah well cool okay thanks Michael um well heck yeah thank you Clay
