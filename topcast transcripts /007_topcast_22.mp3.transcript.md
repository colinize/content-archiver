[00:00] In this episode we'll learn Norman Shaggy's hottest sex secrets for attracting wild willing babes!

[00:08] Yeah, right. Like that was going to work.

[00:12] You're listening to Topcast. This old pinballs online radio. For more information, visit them anytime.

[00:19] www.marvin3m.com. Flash Topcast.

[00:30] Today on Topcast we're doing a very special interview. I could not do this over the phone. This gentleman did not want to do a phone interview, which is fine.

[00:38] So I drove out to Chicago to interview him at his office, worked at Valley Williams during the 1990s and developed the software for Twilight Zone, a very classic Williams pinball game.

[00:53] He was a demo man and the Red and Ted Roadshow. He also became the head of the programming department for both pinball and gaming.

[01:04] And has some interesting insights into that whole 1990s era of pinball.

[01:11] Special guest. Special guest. Special guest.

[01:17] So we're taking Topcast on the road to Chicago to talk to Ted Estes in his office at Cisco Systems about his days in the 1990s at Williams in Valley pinball.

[01:29] So I'd like to welcome Ted Estes.

[01:31] Give me an insight. How did you get started on a whole pinball thing? Where it works the road here.

[01:37] It's a long story and it's little bits and pieces over the years. A friend of mine in high school had a really old game.

[01:46] And I can't remember the name of it in his basement.

[01:50] Any old game in the paint was all worn off. And I would go over in the afternoon and play sometimes with him.

[01:58] And I wasn't very good at it. But they had played it to the point where they could get the skillshot at the top to get the rollovers.

[02:06] They had little pencil marks on the shooter gauge.

[02:11] So this is where you pull it out and get it into that spot.

[02:15] And I always thought it was pretty interesting. My dad was an electrical engineer.

[02:20] I did a lot of electrical circuit type stuff and things. I had some interest in that.

[02:26] And I thought it'd be fun to have something like a pinball machine just to work on.

[02:31] Not necessarily to play, but to work on.

[02:37] And then it was years later in college when I first discovered the solid state games like Firepower and Black Knight, which just blew me away in terms of how much fun they were with the game.

[02:52] So really you had no experience playing at the gym in the college Firepower.

[02:56] And you went to Purdue of course.

[02:58] Right. Where I went.

[03:01] And so I spent all my lunch money and all my lunch time, one semester playing Black Knight at the union.

[03:12] Way I wasn't at the union actually.

[03:14] So a couple of years right around that time, I was working for the W.D. Department doing preventive maintenance on the printers in order to make money.

[03:26] And another person who worked for the W.D. Department was way into video games and pinball games.

[03:34] And he bought a Black Knight brand new in the box.

[03:37] And at around the same time, or maybe a couple years later, another friend of mine who I worked with at Purdue and actually got me that job.

[03:46] You mean at the W.D. Department?

[03:48] At the W.D. Department who eventually came to work with me at Williams, his name is Tom Uban.

[03:55] Tom went to Purdue and he and I know each other from Purdue.

[04:01] He bought a tempest game which was like the one video game that I've ever liked.

[04:06] I'm not big on video games except for that one.

[04:09] And I kept thinking wow it's really neat to have an actual arcade game of your own.

[04:15] And it always had that sort of little bug.

[04:18] So somebody else bought that Black Knight from that person, not heard about it.

[04:23] And then that person had it for a couple years and Tom said hey, Kurt selling that old Black Knight, you're interested in it.

[04:30] And I bought it.

[04:31] Why didn't Tom want it?

[04:34] He probably living in an apartment and didn't have room.

[04:38] And so I drove down and met Kurt halfway bought the Black Knight for 300 bucks.

[04:47] This was 1988.

[04:50] It was still a nice shape.

[04:53] It was still a nice shape.

[04:56] It was still pretty good shape.

[04:59] I mean, Cabin was beautiful, play field had somewhere.

[05:04] But it needed some rebuilding.

[05:07] The flipper max were held together with duct tape and cable ties and stuff.

[05:15] My long track for, oh can you still get parts for something like this?

[05:22] And I end up rebuilding that game and getting the bug.

[05:26] I started buying, you know, once you start one game, you have to have more.

[05:30] So when did the divided by 10 scoring thing come in?

[05:35] Was this in this era?

[05:37] Or is this much later?

[05:39] Try to think when did I do that?

[05:42] And some people don't know is that you've modified the roundcode for nearly all the system 6 games to do the scoring divided by 10.

[05:49] So when they roll over, they don't roll over.

[05:52] Yeah, after I got the Black Knight, I went searching for a firepower and it's only a 6 digit game.

[05:57] And I probably had it set up too easy, but it was frustrating that I would roll over.

[06:01] Oh, you're right, I'm sorry, it was system 6 games.

[06:04] Not system 7.

[06:05] System 7 games have 7 to do scoring.

[06:09] So I had this idea, you know, the least significant digits, always a zero.

[06:14] Right.

[06:15] It's not used for anything.

[06:16] So why not just divide all the scores by 10?

[06:19] And so I started trying to disassemble the code on there and just didn't have very much luck.

[06:27] I guess nowadays people have better tools for doing that kind of thing.

[06:31] Is there doing all kinds of fancy rewriting of rules on the game?

[06:35] Well there's only a couple guys doing that.

[06:37] And they also have pin main so you can do all the tests without burning e-proms.

[06:41] Right, you can run it on your machine.

[06:44] So yeah, you're right, they do the better tool set.

[06:46] So this was after 88, when you did well after?

[06:50] Yeah, it was probably about 1990.

[06:54] It was probably about 1990.

[06:55] Oh, so it wasn't that far off?

[06:56] It wasn't that far off.

[06:57] I was doing it in my spare time at work using a 386 computer.

[07:03] Not everybody had PCs back then to work on.

[07:08] And where were you working?

[07:09] I was working at AT&T.

[07:12] So I couldn't rather than try to figure out how to disassemble all the code,

[07:19] instead I built a simulator that ran the code on the PC.

[07:24] It simulated the instruction set and put the lamp matrix up on the screen and put the score,

[07:31] did it score as opposed to...

[07:33] You made your own pin main.

[07:34] So I did a pin main sort of thing, right?

[07:36] Although it's very low tech, it was only text.

[07:40] Oh really?

[07:41] Yeah.

[07:42] So I had a little file where you put in the names of the solenoids and the lamps and stuff.

[07:47] And it would fit it on an 80 column by 24 line display on the PC.

[07:52] And you could watch the lights, blank and stuff.

[07:55] And you'd hit keys on the keyboard to simulate key switches.

[07:58] And then I could set breakpoints and things in the code.

[08:02] And so I discovered where were the scores kept.

[08:06] Set a breakpoint on when they got modified.

[08:09] Took a look at the code that modified it and then found a way to do the divide by 10.

[08:15] And luckily the way that the score numbers are internally kept were a number and a...

[08:26] Well the mantis is on an exponent.

[08:29] So it's a number and a power of 10.

[08:31] So all I had to do was...

[08:33] Change the power of 10.

[08:34] Change the power of 10 and I got my 10 scoring.

[08:37] And I keyed off of the setting for the match display.

[08:42] You turn off match and it turns on the divide by 10.

[08:46] Because the match isn't going to long anymore.

[08:48] Right, right, it'd be one out of 100 instead of one out of 10.

[08:51] At that point in order to do it.

[08:53] So you're all good.

[08:55] So I mean were you good at the disassembly thing?

[08:58] Oh yeah.

[08:59] My background was in microprocessors and programming.

[09:05] And in fact I had been programming that same microprocessor in high school.

[09:11] That's used in the early ballet and Williams games.

[09:15] My dad used to work for motor roller.

[09:20] And when I was a junior in high school he brought home an evaluation board for the 1600.

[09:29] Had little hex keypad on it.

[09:31] And a display.

[09:32] And I made a little external port with a bunch of LEDs on it that I could blink and stuff.

[09:40] And I had little programs.

[09:42] How was your inner coding?

[09:44] Well you'd do it by hand in hex.

[09:47] And you'd have to hand assemble it.

[09:50] Because there was no assembler.

[09:52] So I'd write the program out and then hand assemble it.

[09:55] And then type it in and test it.

[09:57] And then once you got it done it had a serial port for dumping to cassette tape.

[10:01] So you could load your program back in.

[10:04] Instead of having to type it all back in again.

[10:06] How I started too.

[10:07] I bought an Apple 2 in 79.

[10:12] And the one thing that really intrigued me the most was all the software available for Apple 2.

[10:18] But it wasn't supposed to software but the fact that it was all copy protected.

[10:22] The copy protection intrigued me.

[10:25] Not the actual software but the copy protection.

[10:27] So I made it like my mission.

[10:30] Anything that I bought to remove the copy protection and would bootcof trades.

[10:35] And then a buddy of mine who was in the double leading department said,

[10:40] I know I have to make your job a lot easier.

[10:42] And I said, why?

[10:43] Or how?

[10:44] He says, I'll make your box.

[10:46] It'll show you the current address that's being executed on the Apple 2.

[10:50] And I said, yeah, it's going to go so fast.

[10:52] Who cares?

[10:53] You can see it.

[10:54] He goes, I'll pull the ready line.

[10:56] And I'll put a pot on it.

[10:58] You'll be able to step through the code.

[11:00] You'll be able to slow it down as well.

[11:02] Execute one address at a time.

[11:05] You could step through it manually.

[11:07] You could make it go as fast or as slow as you want it.

[11:10] And it was like, oh my god.

[11:12] That's me.

[11:13] At all.

[11:14] Was that ever neat?

[11:15] You knew exactly where the program was going.

[11:17] You know, what it was executing.

[11:18] You could watch the loop.

[11:19] He showed the address and the data.

[11:21] And then, oh, it was great.

[11:22] But all of the, all of the, I refused to use the assembler.

[11:25] I had it entered everything in hacks.

[11:27] I know.

[11:28] You know what I mean?

[11:29] For any kind of modifications or programs or anything.

[11:31] And then a buddy of mine, Felly said, you know, they have macro assemblers.

[11:35] 65.02.

[11:36] Why aren't you using them?

[11:37] I'm like, ah, it's a plusy to use that stuff.

[11:39] Yeah.

[11:40] You know, but then, you know, you eventually sober up.

[11:43] You know, so sorry, my subversion.

[11:46] Well, yeah, well, I didn't have that available, you know, on the, when I was on this little evaluation board.

[11:53] Right.

[11:54] And so I was real, real familiar with the instruction set.

[11:58] It was just a matter of refreshing my memory on that stuff.

[12:00] I pulled out the old manuals that I had for my dad's basement on the 1600 instruction set.

[12:06] And, you know, what flags are set by which instruction in order to set up my simulator.

[12:11] So it really wasn't that big of a deal once I found the routines.

[12:15] Now, you know, in 77 or 78 when Williams started with the system three, how were they entering this stuff?

[12:23] I mean, how were they writing programs and stuff?

[12:26] Were they using the assembler?

[12:27] Were they entering it in hacks?

[12:28] Were they using, you know, your evaluation box and right now to get sat?

[12:32] What were they doing?

[12:33] No, it was all, they were using all assembler and they were originally using the Motorola Exerciser development stations.

[12:40] Now, back then when the manufacturers would, would sell you their micro processors, they also had,

[12:49] here's the development system that goes along with it, which includes, you know, keyboard and big 8-inch floppy disk drive and, you know, in a display and, you know, an assembler and that sort of thing.

[13:02] And I've seen the program listings from back then.

[13:06] So they still have the big 8-inch disks and all that stuff there?

[13:08] Well, it's probably not at Williams anymore.

[13:11] It's a Duncan Brown's basement.

[13:14] Interestingly, I haven't seen them, I didn't see them at Williams, but at some point somebody dug up all the stuff from Balli.

[13:22] And Balli had a better archiving system from the very early days than Williams did.

[13:26] They had a file cabinet, had a file for every single game.

[13:30] And in there was the 8-inch floppy, which I presume had all the stuff on it, had no way of reading it, plus a hard copy and printout of the game code.

[13:39] So, you know, there was 1% tar, 1 for 8-ball blocks and one, you know.

[13:43] Were the printouts, the assembler printouts, or just the final, you know, the final hex codes?

[13:49] Oh, it had all the comments in it.

[13:51] Oh, it did. It was so, it was fully okay. It was the assembled version then.

[13:55] Or the unassembled version.

[13:57] And along in there was, you know, the, you know, the lamp matrix and the mappings for all that stuff.

[14:04] And the switch matrix and whatever other notes that you had.

[14:07] Oh, pretty cool. Now who has all that stuff?

[14:09] I don't know. It disappeared after I left.

[14:11] And you didn't make copies of any of that stuff?

[14:13] Uh, no, really.

[14:15] No? No.

[14:17] Yeah, it certainly was really interesting to look at.

[14:19] Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

[14:21] Did it say who wrote the stuff?

[14:23] That's a good question. I don't remember.

[14:25] As I only remember checking a few of them out in the drawer, you know, to pull it out.

[14:30] Wow, this is really neat. Look at this.

[14:32] All right.

[14:34] I don't remember if it had the, you know, at the top, you know, or, you know,

[14:38] whether it was just initials or whatever.

[14:40] We don't really know who programmed that stuff, huh?

[14:43] Yeah.

[14:45] Okay. All right.

[14:47] So that's early 90s. So that's, yeah.

[14:49] So that's early 90s. I had, I modified the firepower ROM.

[14:54] And then a friend of mine who I hooked up with who was way into ballet games

[14:59] convinced me that I should only collect Williams games.

[15:02] So, so he could go over your house and you could go over to his and.

[15:05] Right. Right.

[15:06] And so we're not in competition with each other.

[15:08] All right.

[15:09] But he also had the idea of making free play ROMs for all the ballet games.

[15:14] So I changed my simulator to work with the ballet system as well.

[15:18] And then I went through and made a series of free play ROMs.

[15:23] You did that for the ballet?

[15:24] Yeah.

[15:25] Okay.

[15:26] Because the guy over in Switzerland is on that too.

[15:29] Okay.

[15:30] Yeah.

[15:31] I think my version of the ROMs have ended up in one of these all in one aftermarket CPU boards.

[15:39] All really?

[15:40] Yeah.

[15:41] So maybe the Callahan one or something or all tech one or.

[15:44] I think the all tech one.

[15:45] I think.

[15:46] Did I ask you or just do it?

[15:48] Well, I did it for somebody else.

[15:51] So somebody else who gave it to them.

[15:53] Gotcha.

[15:54] Do you care?

[15:55] No, I don't care.

[15:56] Okay. Just care.

[15:57] Doesn't matter to me.

[15:58] So I also made friends around that time with Jack Simonton who had the

[16:06] Pimbal Trader for a while.

[16:09] Okay.

[16:10] And he came in town in the Chicago for some training seminar.

[16:14] He worked at Apple at the time.

[16:16] And he got Larry DeMar to give him a tour of the factory.

[16:21] And you tagged along?

[16:22] And I tagged along because I had done a couple articles from Pimbal Trader.

[16:26] And he said, oh, he worked for the magazine book.

[16:30] Come along.

[16:31] And so I brought along my disc with my Pimbal simulator.

[16:37] And of course getting a tour of the factory after I finished.

[16:41] Well, you mean on like three and a half inch flop or something?

[16:43] I have an informant.

[16:44] Yeah.

[16:45] Yeah.

[16:46] So I brought along in a brought along.

[16:48] And the high part of the day, I thought was going to be getting a tour of the factory,

[16:52] which is pretty darn exciting after our sort of thing.

[16:55] But also I wanted to show Larry the simulator work that I've been doing.

[17:00] And he couldn't take me upstairs at the time because he was working on a new Pimbal game.

[17:08] And they're very secretive at Williams.

[17:11] So instead, at the time, the Williams video department was still in that same building downstairs.

[17:18] So he took me into Eugene Jarvis' office.

[17:21] Did you know who Eugene was at the time?

[17:24] I knew that Eugene programmed a firepower.

[17:27] I thought that was a temp program.

[17:29] I thought Larry programmed a firepower.

[17:32] No, that's a Eugene game.

[17:34] Really?

[17:35] Okay.

[17:36] And so I put my simulator into Eugene's game.

[17:40] And I popped the thing up.

[17:42] And of course they have to use their imagination because it's just showing you the lights and that sort of thing.

[17:47] But I'm now playing the game.

[17:49] I said, okay, let's put three balls in the trough.

[17:51] Let's put some credits on the game.

[17:53] What do you have to hold keys down for the trough?

[17:56] You put right.

[17:57] Well, I was a talk.

[17:59] You press once for down and you press again for a touch.

[18:02] So I put the balls in, started putting some credits.

[18:05] And you could see the credit counter go on the display.

[18:08] And I said, let's start a game.

[18:10] And then you could see it go out of a track mode and do something else.

[18:16] And so then I was hitting some roll over targets and showing the late-change thing.

[18:23] And everybody was gathering around because they're all working late over there.

[18:28] What's everybody looking at?

[18:30] All looking on my shoulder.

[18:32] I'm like, now this is really cool.

[18:34] Here are all these people who work on...

[18:36] To develop the game.

[18:37] Yeah, to develop the game.

[18:38] Here I have a Eugene Darviss' computer showing him something 10 years after the fact.

[18:44] 11 years after the fact.

[18:46] But it was pretty neat.

[18:49] Do they have a similar development tools system?

[18:52] I would imagine that will marry or those guys would have written something similar

[18:57] so that they could test stuff on their machine without dumping it into the game.

[19:01] No, it's all done.

[19:02] Yeah, because they have a separate module that plugs into the RAM spasor some.

[19:06] Or the ROM space on the CPU board.

[19:08] Right.

[19:09] But then goes through a serial port on your computer or a parallel port or something.

[19:12] That's the key for doing that kind of development.

[19:14] Instead of burning a ROM, maybe time you make a change.

[19:17] And then you have basically what's a ROM simulator.

[19:20] It gets a big RAM chip that you can download rapidly in some way.

[19:25] In the older days, those of the Williams AA double-lead apartment would make them custom.

[19:32] And it would talk over the serial port or the parallel port off of a PC.

[19:37] But nowadays you can buy them off the shelf.

[19:40] Oh, really?

[19:41] Because they have ROM emulators.

[19:42] They're still kind of pricey.

[19:44] But sometimes you can pick them up cheap on eBay if you're really into that sort of thing.

[19:48] Right. You mean, so you can emulate a 27, 4 mag or whatever?

[19:52] Right. Right.

[19:53] Huh.

[19:54] Okay. Interesting. I didn't know that.

[19:56] So that night, they were invited us back to his apartment and bought us pizza.

[20:05] And he told me, why? You should be working with me.

[20:08] And I thought about it for a while.

[20:10] You know, well, you program one pinball game, but then you've done it.

[20:15] Right. How much is there to put actually doing a pinball game?

[20:19] There's, you know, can't be that much more work to do the same thing.

[20:22] Was he insulted when you said that?

[20:23] I would not.

[20:24] You can say it to him.

[20:25] I was just thinking it to myself.

[20:26] You know.

[20:27] It took me a while.

[20:30] I kept thinking about it.

[20:31] And things weren't going so well with my job at AT&T.

[20:35] My division got sold to Memorax Telex.

[20:39] And then eventually Memorax Telex decided to move down to Raleigh.

[20:46] Well, they're based in Raleigh and they were going to shut down our division.

[20:49] And the interesting thing was I was getting more and more, getting sort of a weird vibe at work

[20:54] and getting a little more dissatisfied with the work I was doing there.

[20:57] And the day I decided to go into work and fire up Microsoft Word

[21:01] and put my resume together and send it to Larry just on a whim to see.

[21:06] Was the day they announced that we were going to move to Raleigh, North Carolina.

[21:10] And one-third of you are, you know, we're going to walk you out today.

[21:14] And one-third of you, we're going to pay you for four months to wrap things up.

[21:19] And one-third of you, you can move to Raleigh if you want.

[21:23] What started with you?

[21:24] I was actually one of the ones that offered the relocation down to Raleigh.

[21:28] But I did a bunch of interviewing around here and I looked at the things

[21:34] and the job at Williams was the one that was the most interesting.

[21:38] Did they, Williams paid real money or was it all like, you know, we can get anybody in here

[21:43] to build pimble on machines. We don't need to pay these people.

[21:46] It's interesting because they did take a cutting pad, took a pretty big cut of pay.

[21:50] You did, okay.

[21:51] To go down there.

[21:52] Because I talked to Cameron, I interviewed Cameron.

[21:54] And I kind of, you know, he moved from Australia and it just sounds like they weren't paying him anything

[21:59] to come do this. That he just wanted to do it.

[22:02] They could, you know, he was almost sounded like he was almost paying them, you know?

[22:06] Well, yeah. When Cameron approached me at the time, I was afraid of moving somebody halfway across the world.

[22:13] And then it's pretty sad that they're not working out.

[22:16] Right.

[22:17] And part of the issue there was to sponsor somebody to get the green party.

[22:23] Yeah. Well, it's not even the green card. It's the visa.

[22:26] Yeah, the visa for working.

[22:28] It's a lot of work and a lot of money and just to get him all set up and then to not, you know,

[22:36] not have a file through or whatever.

[22:38] Well, it's not like that.

[22:39] Or walk out.

[22:40] And he basically said, look, this is my dream job.

[22:43] What if I show up on your doorstep?

[22:45] Right.

[22:46] And I said, well, if you were here, yes.

[22:48] If you were already here, I would, I would do.

[22:51] Yes.

[22:52] Exactly what he said.

[22:53] Yeah.

[22:54] I would give you a job.

[22:55] And so I, you know, I did our part of the job, but he paid the attorney to get the visa thing.

[23:05] And it worked out really well as it turns out.

[23:08] Right.

[23:09] It just goes to show sometimes when you look when you look at people's school records and stuff,

[23:17] and they'll always tell you how they're going to do at work.

[23:20] Right.

[23:21] And, and, and, and Williams went on to sponsor his, his green card, too.

[23:26] Right.

[23:27] So then, okay, so then he told Larry to take it.

[23:30] That's why, well, I went interviewed and he was, so you mean it wasn't a for sure then?

[23:35] It wasn't over sure at the time.

[23:36] He really wanted to get me in.

[23:38] Larry was just an engineer back then.

[23:42] In fact, I think he was a contract engineer and we're directly for Williams.

[23:46] And he was in the middle of getting Adam's family out the door.

[23:51] So he was very busy.

[23:52] Right.

[23:53] So it took a, it took a few go rounds to get some of the management who actually was involved in the hiring decision to actually get to hire me.

[24:02] You know, they're looking at me and like, well, hey, we're used to hiring somebody fresh out of school for, for real cheap.

[24:09] Right.

[24:10] You know, opposed to just regular cheap.

[24:12] Right.

[24:13] And, you know, you don't have any experience with coin op.

[24:16] But even though my experience was in embedded real time systems, and I eventually did bring a lot of more order to the development process in terms of,

[24:29] let's document our changes and make sure that we can back up what we've, Larry wasn't doing all that stuff.

[24:35] He was doing it on his own games.

[24:37] It was not done as a role in the whole department.

[24:39] Oh, okay.

[24:41] You know, Larry was a firm believer of source code control and backing things up.

[24:45] Right.

[24:46] A lot of the other stuff was just really nearly.

[24:48] Right.

[24:49] So Larry at the time was not head of anything.

[24:53] He wasn't even a Williams employee.

[24:55] No, he was a contractor.

[24:56] Huh. For all through the 80s, he was too?

[24:59] Well, I don't, you don't have to ask Larry about the history there because I can't really remember.

[25:03] I mean, I don't want to speak out.

[25:05] Right.

[25:07] Interesting.

[25:08] Because he eventually became head of pinball division, right?

[25:11] Right. He became the director.

[25:12] Yeah, the director of engineering.

[25:14] Right.

[25:15] And you became director of the software.

[25:17] I was software manager.

[25:19] Right.

[25:20] Yeah, I was software.

[25:21] After I was there within about a year and a half, I became manager of the software department.

[25:26] Was that because once again, your experience in more structured policies and that, or you know, it just kind of ended up.

[25:34] Yeah, sort of fell out of that.

[25:36] Yeah.

[25:37] Yeah. And, well, and unfortunately, that meant that I didn't have time for doing many games either.

[25:42] Yeah, because you did Twilight's own Red and Ted in demo.

[25:46] And that was about it, right?

[25:48] Right.

[25:49] But I also did Adam's family values, Coindrop game.

[25:53] Wow.

[25:54] That's the novelty.

[25:55] Right.

[25:56] Right. The redemption is in a...

[25:57] It's a redemption game.

[25:58] Yeah, it's a redemption game.

[25:59] Right.

[26:00] It gets better.

[26:01] And the road show, I wasn't the main programmer.

[26:04] Do I...

[26:05] Why?

[26:06] Yeah, I was just back up.

[26:07] Right.

[26:08] I was displaying ground.

[26:09] Display ground?

[26:10] Yeah.

[26:11] Okay.

[26:12] Now, what about on Twilight's own was Larry, the lead programmer.

[26:15] And you were, you know, you were again, you know, or were you the lead programmer?

[26:20] Larry was the lead programmer on that.

[26:21] Larry's all asleep programmer, right?

[26:23] Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

[26:26] Yeah.

[26:27] And it's interesting, too, on that game, which was my first, I was working so hard because I wanted to prove myself.

[26:35] Because, you know, these are all these other people who had a bunch of other games under their belts.

[26:41] And I was just working long hours and through weekends.

[26:47] And when it was all over, Larry said, I was working so hard to keep up with you.

[26:53] And I said, I still wait a minute.

[26:55] I was working so hard to keep up with you.

[26:59] Oh, man, you guys should talk more.

[27:05] Well, you know, that, I mean, the Twilight's own.

[27:08] I mean, did you get to pick that project or was it just a sign to you?

[27:12] It was pretty much a sign to me.

[27:14] Did you see it as a winner right from the get go?

[27:17] When I first got there, I don't think Pat had anything.

[27:22] He was still, you know, he didn't know what his next game was going to be at that point.

[27:27] And it wasn't clear that I was going to be assigned to that project at first.

[27:32] You know, I sort of had an end because, you know, I'd convinced Larry, you know, that I knew what I was doing.

[27:43] And the fun thing was when I first got there, they didn't even have an office for me.

[27:49] I showed up to work and there wasn't a place for me to sit.

[27:53] And I spent the first week there sitting in Pat's office and learning some of the pinball operating system on the Twilight's own in his office, you know, doing the equivalent of Hello World type stuff.

[28:06] Right. So that gave me the opportunity to at least meet Pat and talk to him some more.

[28:11] So the game was well into white war or not Twilight's own Adams family.

[28:15] I'm sorry.

[28:16] Adam's family.

[28:17] No, no. His Adams family that was sitting there.

[28:20] Right.

[28:21] Do you know any neat mods on Adams?

[28:24] The homerom has the bigger font on it.

[28:27] Bigger font.

[28:28] Yeah, the bigger score font.

[28:30] Oh, yeah, yeah.

[28:31] I noticed the score is kind of meager in size and you may have any.

[28:35] Yeah. So the homerom has that was one of the things I did as part of my learning experience ended up as a homerom.

[28:41] Is that entirely your baby?

[28:43] No, I don't know.

[28:45] No, no.

[28:46] Now who did the gold?

[28:48] Mike Booan did that.

[28:50] Okay.

[28:51] Okay.

[28:52] So any of you corporate any of your home features into the home?

[28:56] I think so because I was working on the same code base and then he just split off from wherever that was sitting.

[29:03] So there were a couple of options I added in there too.

[29:07] Like, there's a rule change on one of the adjustments for spotting the thing letters.

[29:13] It's still the fault the way it was in the production game but you can change the rule.

[29:17] I added that in there as a thing.

[29:20] All right.

[29:21] I forget what the rule is now.

[29:22] I think it's.

[29:23] Ball comes in the right return lane and then you flip it into the.

[29:28] That that center ramp to spot the thing letter.

[29:32] Now were there when you were doing this was there anything that you were like looked at and were surprised about?

[29:39] Oh, wow.

[29:40] I would have never thought they did it like that or you know, you know anything in the in the in the code or in the whole process.

[29:47] You know in the you know in the development process that you know.

[29:51] I mean anything that surprised you or you know any interest in well the big surprise for me I guess was that there was so much that goes into a game.

[30:01] And part of that has to do with the stuff that's on the display to the display is a lot of a lot of the work on on the more modern games.

[30:12] Now did you do that where I mean you weren't actually doing the art for the display right?

[30:16] No, I'm no artist.

[30:17] It would look like stick figures if you had me doing the art.

[30:20] All right.

[30:21] So did you ever try that?

[30:23] The best I ever did was late at night where I needed something slightly changed you know because the animation artists go home.

[30:32] You know regular hours it's the programmers that oh really that do the long weird hours you know and I might need you know a few dots.

[30:41] Move around or something like that and you could do that.

[30:44] That's about it.

[30:45] That and I had some background in font design from my work at AT&T.

[30:51] I worked on computer terminals for well what it used to be the teletype division.

[30:58] All right.

[30:59] And so I dabbled in a little bit of like big blocky fonts so that all you're playing you can play it up at the start.

[31:06] Right instead of yeah.

[31:07] And read the instructions and that sort of thing.

[31:10] But no any kind of art worked out not no good at any of that.

[31:13] Well like for instance if you want to font on there how was a how was a font actually done.

[31:19] I mean how is it implemented in that system.

[31:22] I mean I assume that you know you create a character set or something right I mean how does this work?

[31:28] It's just a bit map and there are a bunch of routines that so each letter is bit mapped.

[31:33] Right.

[31:34] Doesn't that take up like I'm guiding my space.

[31:36] It's not that much now because it's not that big of a display.

[31:39] So think about it and the character is not all that big.

[31:42] And what about the intensity levels of the dot so I don't know how many intensity levels were there.

[31:47] Well there's three intensity levels plus off so it only takes two bits per pixel.

[31:53] Gotcha.

[31:54] So.

[31:55] Okay.

[31:56] Now what takes up all the room is all the animations when you're playing on little movies and things.

[32:00] But you never had to do that because the animation guys do.

[32:03] Right.

[32:04] Right.

[32:06] Okay. And then okay so now it's finally so you get on a twilight zone and you and Larry are grinding each other's teeth on the stone.

[32:12] Yeah.

[32:13] You know and I mean when you got all done with that what version number was actually the release version that went out on the street when the game first went in production.

[32:22] Well what we always tried to do at Williams was L1 was the first release.

[32:27] Okay.

[32:28] And P1 is prototype or what is Pme?

[32:34] P means probably the first one that you put on test.

[32:37] Okay.

[32:38] You know when we first started we used to call it bottom of the stairs.

[32:43] We put a game at the bottom of the stairs outside engineering and that would probably be like a PA or a PB version.

[32:51] It barely had any rules in it not much artwork and you know.

[32:57] And then when you first went on test you would jump up to P1 and start keeping it.

[33:03] Test being the restaurant or bar or arcade or whatever you're putting this stuff.

[33:09] Right. Right.

[33:10] And you could probably burn through P versions pretty quickly because you know you're visiting those games every night and you're going home and you're going

[33:22] Oh wow we found a bug or you know or you're dumping a whole lot of artwork in and you're trying to make the game as interesting as possible too.

[33:31] So you can get some earning numbers out of it and so you know if you can get the get more artwork or more rules in it or whatever.

[33:37] And how did Twilight Zone earn on test?

[33:40] I really don't remember that was a long time ago.

[33:42] But I mean were they happy with it?

[33:44] Yeah. They were.

[33:45] Okay.

[33:46] Twilight Zone was still in the good days of good earnings.

[33:49] Right.

[33:50] And the little straw.

[33:51] Yeah Pimole was still strong.

[33:52] Right.

[33:53] So L1 was the revert and was the release.

[33:55] Right.

[33:56] And they eventually ended up at 9X or whatever.

[33:58] Yeah well we changed the numbering system at some point in there.

[34:04] L stands for level because on the original, Larry told me this so I hope I get it right.

[34:12] On the original alpha numeric displays only the top line was the many segment one.

[34:19] The bottom line of the thing was only sub-in segment.

[34:22] Right. Right.

[34:23] The top was alpha numeric and the bottom was numeric.

[34:26] It's system 11.

[34:27] Right. So you couldn't do an R on the board.

[34:29] Or you're going to say you couldn't do an R for Rev.

[34:31] So instead they did an L.

[34:33] Gotcha.

[34:34] And that was left over from those days.

[34:36] Right. It was left over from those days.

[34:38] Okay.

[34:40] So we would do L1 as the first release, you know, as it hit the line.

[34:46] And you tried not to do too many changes after that.

[34:49] Usually when you go to like L2 and L3, it's either for bug fixes or putting the coin in-gen or you're finishing up translations.

[34:58] Right.

[34:59] Not for German or French or whatever that sort of thing.

[35:02] Did you have to do that too, the German and French stuff?

[35:05] The way that we did those was we let the distributors give us the text back.

[35:10] Oh really?

[35:11] Yeah.

[35:12] So you give them the game in English, let them figure it out, then they write everything down, they want to translate it and how they want to translate it.

[35:17] Well, it's where it's more involvement on our part.

[35:20] We would give them a list of the text strings and even describe why this message comes up so that they would know a little bit about the context of this message.

[35:30] And then they would write back, okay, here put this there, put this there.

[35:34] Some of them, we got to know, we could remember what Shoot Left Ramp was in French, for example.

[35:41] So we didn't need to ask them that over and over again.

[35:44] But when you're trying to describe the dead end feature in Twilight Zone, I can remember having a conversation with our French distributor about that.

[35:54] He couldn't understand what a dead end was, what a dead end street was.

[35:58] And finally he goes, oh I came up with the good name for it, Kudusak.

[36:05] And I'm like, oh well, yeah, that's exactly what it is.

[36:09] Yeah, kind of.

[36:10] Yeah.

[36:11] But apparently Kudusak means bottom of the bank.

[36:15] So it was even a joke in French, so it was very proud of that whole thing.

[36:20] So was that what you ended up using?

[36:21] Yeah, well it's called a sack.

[36:23] Even though here that means a completely different thing.

[36:26] Right, right.

[36:27] Interesting.

[36:28] So you had that sort of thing and then you got to fit it back in there.

[36:30] Because sometimes there's a lot more letters in it than it was in English.

[36:34] And then you got to ask him again, well I can't fit this on the screen.

[36:38] You can fit it in 26 letters instead of 32.

[36:41] They tell you how to abbreviate it.

[36:43] So some of those things are iterative.

[36:45] Right.

[36:46] And there was all the space in the rocks for this stuff?

[36:48] Yeah, that kind of thing.

[36:51] Especially with a Doc Matrix game.

[36:54] You know, if you run it out of space you get to take some pictures out.

[36:58] Well, pictures.

[36:59] So the animations instead of having 10 frames it feels down to 8 frames.

[37:03] Yeah, right.

[37:04] Okay, so you could do that stuff.

[37:06] Yeah.

[37:07] Yeah, text and bitmaps for fonts and stuff just don't take up that much room.

[37:13] It was mostly the animations.

[37:15] The animations, yeah.

[37:16] So now, so you do the Twilight Zone.

[37:19] But you still, you've got this Revision.

[37:22] You said L1 was the release, but then you get the 9, whatever.

[37:26] Something changed in the middle as always said.

[37:29] Yeah, well the other thing that happens is that there's a core operating system that's used on the Apple system.

[37:39] Yeah.

[37:40] So you got the actual software operating system that used to compile the whole thing.

[37:46] Right.

[37:47] And that changed, is that what you're saying?

[37:48] Right.

[37:49] And Larry over the years would add features to it.

[37:52] Right.

[37:53] Like hidden both flipper buttons, kills, and a ball sequence that was part of the operating system.

[37:57] No, that's actually game specific.

[37:59] That is.

[38:00] Yeah.

[38:01] But you know, like a coinage mode would be in the operating system or adding support for printers.

[38:06] And I noticed the Tetsides improvement is the progression line that boot up.

[38:12] That was you, wasn't it?

[38:13] No, I don't think so.

[38:14] Really?

[38:15] I think Camer did that one.

[38:16] Oh, really the progression bar?

[38:17] Yeah.

[38:18] Oh, okay.

[38:19] I think that's Camer.

[38:20] I think that one.

[38:21] All right.

[38:22] Yeah.

[38:23] I thought that was you.

[38:24] No, I did logic for broken flipper switches.

[38:28] Also, use the other app though?

[38:30] Yeah.

[38:31] I did that logic.

[38:32] I added that in there.

[38:33] Right.

[38:34] But there were some other things.

[38:35] There were some parts in the real time where I tweaked and optimized a few things to take

[38:39] out a few instruction cycles here and there in order to gain some of the real time processing

[38:45] time back.

[38:46] I don't know.

[38:47] There's all kinds of little changes over time.

[38:50] But the goal was always to make that operating system backwards compatible.

[38:54] All right.

[38:55] And in order to test that, Larry would always crank out versions of like fun house and

[39:03] Twilight Zone and World Cup and take them all home and put them in his game.

[39:12] And I tried demolition man and that's right.

[39:14] You're games.

[39:15] Right.

[39:16] I tried my games and we tried them all out and go, okay, seems like we've got it backwards,

[39:20] compatible, do it pretty well.

[39:21] It's our regression test.

[39:23] So that's part of the reason why some of those games kept incrementing in Rev number.

[39:29] So even though there was no game specific fix, they might have picked up new features on

[39:33] it.

[39:34] From this, yeah.

[39:35] The operating system.

[39:36] Right.

[39:37] Like I know one feature Larry added was when he changes setting, remember the older version

[39:42] and since then goes, Bong, Bong, Bong, and you've got to parts to start by.

[39:45] You can do those starts button and then just speed up the saving of it.

[39:50] The idea of the Bong, Bong, Bong is to give you a chance to cancel the save.

[39:54] Right.

[39:55] And he's like, well, what if I don't want to cancel?

[39:56] I know I want to save it.

[39:58] Okay.

[39:59] So there were some other things like that that were added in.

[40:02] So that was part of the reason why Twilight Zone had so many...

[40:07] Had a jump in numbers.

[40:09] Had so many jumps in numbers.

[40:10] It went, you know, one, two, three.

[40:14] Sometimes there were revs that were internal and we never released them.

[40:18] Because we were bumping the revision number just to test the operating system, you know,

[40:24] changes that we got.

[40:26] And in some cases, there might have been game specific fixes in there.

[40:30] Just, you know, oh, I noticed this display glitch and I fixed it.

[40:34] You know, these sorts of things.

[40:36] Now what about the magnet throw thing in Twilight Zone?

[40:41] You know, was that your idea?

[40:43] Was that a pass idea?

[40:44] No, that was actually Larry's idea and he implemented the code.

[40:48] But you're saying that it never really worked right or something, right?

[40:52] It didn't work in Twilight Zone because the optos and the magnets were too close together.

[41:00] Well, it's not even that.

[41:01] It's not even that problem.

[41:03] Problem was that they were not in alignment.

[41:06] It's because the magnets were screwed to the bottom of the playfield and the optos were

[41:10] screwed to the top and based on manufacturing differences, they would move around.

[41:15] Really?

[41:16] Yeah.

[41:17] By how much?

[41:18] Well, it doesn't take very much because all you're doing in order to fling the ball is turning

[41:24] the magnet off for a few milliseconds.

[41:27] The ball fall back.

[41:28] Fall back and then you pulse it for a few milliseconds.

[41:31] And then slide it back up.

[41:32] Right.

[41:33] And then you don't move the momentum and then let it go.

[41:36] And it goes around.

[41:37] So like on Shadow, you're saying that that was all one assembly.

[41:39] The magnet and the optos were in one metal mechanical assembly from the bottom of the playfield

[41:44] so it was easier to compensate for any.

[41:48] Right.

[41:49] So if you look at Shadow, that mechanism bolts right through the playfield and it's all

[41:53] one piece.

[41:54] So if the optos shift, so does the magnet, vice versa.

[41:58] So there are always an alignment and you've got the alignment just right.

[42:01] Larry got the toss in working on one game in his office.

[42:07] But then it wouldn't work on the game in my office.

[42:10] And then we try to tweak it some more to get it working on my game and then it wouldn't

[42:13] work on the one in his office.

[42:16] So we just disabled the code.

[42:21] But you have that version of here at home, right?

[42:23] Yes.

[42:24] And be like it.

[42:25] It's okay.

[42:26] It's interesting to watch.

[42:30] I turned it on in a few places, probably more than it needs to be just so that people can

[42:38] see it happen.

[42:39] Right.

[42:40] It's enough that it actually gets in the way.

[42:42] Like why did the ball do that?

[42:44] I forget which rules I added on there, but shooting spirals on a spiral award, it actually

[42:51] throws the ball back at you after it catches ball.

[42:55] Instead of dropping it down, it throws it back the way it came from.

[42:59] The nifty part about it is when it does the beginning of multiple, it loads all three

[43:06] balls on the three magnets if you've got the three magnets in place.

[43:11] And depending on where the balls come from, if it's kicking them out of the lockup,

[43:14] it has to use the ball tossing code in order to get them up and around onto all three

[43:18] magnets.

[43:19] No, not on nine four.

[43:21] You use the three, you can use if your three magnets are installed, it'll do that similarly,

[43:28] lock each one.

[43:29] Right.

[43:30] But it doesn't, in order for that to actually work, doesn't the power ball have to cycle

[43:35] through the gum ball machine or something before that I'll actually turn on.

[43:39] Right, I have to know where the where the where the power ball is before.

[43:44] And so that's the way you so it's so if you know, yeah, okay.

[43:48] So once you turn the game off, you have to turn it, you turn the game back on, the power

[43:53] ball has to cycle through the gum ball machine before that option will turn on.

[43:56] Yeah, okay.

[43:57] Yeah, and the nine dot four code that's regularly released, it will only do the ball catching

[44:03] code if it if it most one ball is in the lockup because it can't one ball in the lockup

[44:10] or in the for the beginning of multiple.

[44:14] Okay, right.

[44:15] And I'm hoping I'm remembering right again, that was many years ago because I can't get

[44:19] if there's too many balls in the lockup, I can't get them on all the magnets.

[44:23] I need to be able to use them off the auto fire plunger.

[44:26] Right, right.

[44:27] But I also want to know where the power ball is because I can't catch that ball.

[44:31] Right.

[44:32] And I didn't want it flinging around.

[44:34] Well, well, yeah, hit on the other stop and knock it off the magnet.

[44:38] Right.

[44:39] Well, all this other choreography is going on and I didn't add any new logic.

[44:42] I just used an existing routine that tracked the white ball that it actually had seen

[44:48] it once and now it knew that it was in right in the in the gum ball machine, but it doesn't

[44:54] save it to stay across power cycle.

[44:56] Gotcha.

[44:57] Well, so that's why it's not like that.

[44:58] Okay.

[44:59] So, you were brought on like when you did nine four and then you did the home, you were

[45:05] originally going to do something past that too, weren't you?

[45:08] And then that fiasco with the preplay thing came kind of set everything on hand, right?

[45:16] Well, the nine dot four, which is a strict home version, strict free play version.

[45:26] Right.

[45:27] And four H, right, which is strictly free play and strictly home version.

[45:32] And I was going to put out a non free play version of that, but it wouldn't have had, I don't

[45:37] think that's it.

[45:38] Well, you wouldn't have the thing where you press the button and answer the phone.

[45:41] Right.

[45:42] That holds the ball in the upflip position.

[45:45] Right.

[45:46] Right.

[45:47] There were a couple other things that it wouldn't have had.

[45:48] I don't remember what.

[45:49] But that was, it had a few minor bug fixes and that sort of thing, but it was going to

[45:52] be the last release.

[45:54] And I just never got around to releasing it because I was just, you know, somebody

[45:57] disabled the free play code on there and it just bothered me that people were messing

[46:06] around with it like that.

[46:07] Games under development, we turn free play on by default just so that a released version

[46:15] of, an unreleased version of code wouldn't get out in the field.

[46:18] Right.

[46:19] But at some point, while I was manager of the software department, I instituted the

[46:24] policy that all the homeroms had to be free play only also.

[46:29] Right.

[46:30] Because you don't want those out there collecting money.

[46:31] Well, it wasn't the collecting money that was really the problem in the public eye.

[46:36] And the biggest problem was the service issue.

[46:43] Somebody calls up to the service department says, I'm having problems with this game and

[46:48] it's acting funny.

[46:50] Right.

[46:51] And they go, well, what version of ROM are you using?

[46:55] And they go, oh, I'm using, you know, version five.

[46:58] And the service person is looking down at them.

[47:01] The last one I see is us officially releasing this form.

[47:04] Where did you get this five from?

[47:07] Right.

[47:08] You know, it meant that we weren't making very many friends in the service department when

[47:14] that sort of thing was happening.

[47:17] So we wanted to keep anything like that, anything that wasn't officially released, is

[47:22] free play only, just so that it wasn't a service problem.

[47:26] And our service guys have enough problems with real issues.

[47:30] Right.

[47:31] Yeah, much less, you know, something like that.

[47:34] Right.

[47:35] In 93 after you did what Red and Ted, then you went to department head of software, right?

[47:42] Now I was department head probably by about the end of Twilight Zone, I think.

[47:48] Man, you move fast.

[47:50] Yeah.

[47:51] So see, we'll buy all the other software guys.

[47:54] Left them in the dark.

[47:56] Yeah, well, now you're never going to get any interviews with them.

[48:02] And I, no, because by the time I was working on Demolition Man, which was my next game,

[48:08] I was a manager of the department.

[48:11] And I squeezed Adam Stanley values in there in between Twilight Zone and Demolition Man.

[48:18] So was Demolition Man, was that a fun game?

[48:21] It was an interesting game to work on.

[48:23] I've only really worked with two head designers, Pat and Dennis.

[48:27] And it's interesting to work with the different designers because they have different styles

[48:32] of game design.

[48:35] And some have more of an overall vision and very specific things that they want the

[48:40] game to do.

[48:42] And others are more of a, okay, I'm going to paint this canvas for a game.

[48:48] And then I'm looking for input from a lot of people to actually fill in all the pieces

[48:53] on the canvas.

[48:55] And I, Pat's more in the first camp and Dennis's more in the second camp on that.

[49:03] So you've got to flexure artistic muscles and game rules and whatever.

[49:08] And I would say that I'm not very good at it either.

[49:13] Oh really?

[49:14] Yeah.

[49:15] I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm looking like I'm going to have better.

[49:18] It has its pluses of minds in both ways.

[49:22] Well, if somebody gives me a completely blank canvas, you know, it's, it's, it's a, a

[49:27] little tough.

[49:29] And it, it's an interesting experience too because on, on Demolition Man, I got input,

[49:34] a lot of them put from Doug Watson, who was the, the artist on that game.

[49:40] And he's a, he's a pretty good pinball player too.

[49:43] And he and I went through lots and lots of rules that really sucked.

[49:46] Or I would, where I would mock them up and we'd get them on there and we would play

[49:51] them and we'd be like, well, this is terrible, you know, and that's one of the things that,

[49:58] I never realized about working on a pinball game until I was at Williams that, yeah, if

[50:05] you know the answer, like if you look at a game, it might not take you all that long to,

[50:10] to exactly copy this, this game that already exists.

[50:14] But to create a new one, you throw away two thirds of, of what you're, what you've worked

[50:20] on in terms of rules and stuff.

[50:22] Right.

[50:23] You know, oh, this, this was no fun and that was no fun.

[50:26] You know, Twilight Zone had a bunch of early rules, like the multi-ball and jackpot rules

[50:33] were really wacky and, and almost impossible to do.

[50:41] And there were something like that on demolition, man, as well.

[50:44] Now the demolition and the fabled demolition home, who's brainchild was that?

[50:50] Well we wanted to do that from the beginning because there were, you know, there were quotes

[50:56] from the movie that were, you know, as an arm-rated movie.

[50:59] Yeah, classic quotes that you couldn't use otherwise.

[51:01] Right.

[51:02] And so when Lyman Sheets started at Williams, I gave him the assignment of doing the home

[51:12] rom for demolition, man, as his way of getting up to speed.

[51:15] Now he had background from, well, Dany East Sega by the time.

[51:20] Right.

[51:21] So, but just to get him familiar with whatever our operating system looked like, the development.

[51:25] Yeah, it was good.

[51:26] Exercise for two birds, one stump.

[51:28] Right.

[51:29] So he went through and he familiarized himself with the rules and who digitized all the

[51:36] voice calls.

[51:37] I mean, you know, obviously that you, you had custom speech for that game from the actors.

[51:42] Right.

[51:43] So obviously you didn't, that you had to steal these from the movie.

[51:46] Right.

[51:47] So you were lifted from the movie and I think in general we get that stuff from the studios.

[51:53] You did all really?

[51:54] Yeah.

[51:55] Or if you, you know, if the movie is already out, you know, you can lift it off of there.

[51:59] So did somebody have to do that or did he just use, you know, whatever the package contained?

[52:05] I don't really recall.

[52:06] John Hay was the sound engineer on that.

[52:09] He gave me a set of roms.

[52:10] Oh, okay.

[52:11] And while he was doing it, he pushed it from six roms into seven.

[52:17] And he said, well, it's on, it's going to go to seven.

[52:20] And it's only for home roms.

[52:22] Why don't I go to eight?

[52:24] And he turned down the compression on all the music.

[52:27] Hmm.

[52:28] To, you know, because, you know, when it's at home and maybe it's the only game that's on, you might actually notice a difference.

[52:33] I can't hear the difference.

[52:35] You can't.

[52:36] Okay.

[52:37] I don't know.

[52:38] I've never really done an A, B.

[52:39] I have.

[52:40] I couldn't notice.

[52:41] Okay.

[52:42] You know.

[52:43] So that's why I take roms.

[52:44] There's probably more in those roms than what was actually used.

[52:48] John just went through and dumped a whole bunch of stuff in.

[52:51] Lyman did a critical assessment in terms of, you know, where would these speech calls actually go?

[52:59] Instead of just dumping them all over the place.

[53:01] Right.

[53:02] And then, and then he went ahead and did the, you know, we,

[53:08] you know, we made copies for everybody on the design team.

[53:12] Did, what about the actors?

[53:14] Did they get that version too?

[53:15] No.

[53:16] No.

[53:17] No.

[53:18] In fact, I don't, no, we didn't make a special, we didn't make a special version for the actors.

[53:21] Because you've done that before, right?

[53:23] That was done for, um, Star Trek.

[53:27] But I don't, I don't believe we did that for any other game in terms of special software.

[53:33] Right.

[53:34] Is that what the Star Trek home thing is all about?

[53:37] Is it, that's for actually the people on the, because that one's sneaked out too.

[53:41] Well, yeah, well, there's sooner than the demo, man.

[53:44] Yeah.

[53:45] There's something like seven or eight versions of home round for Star Trek.

[53:50] Really?

[53:51] Yeah.

[53:52] One for each of the actors because each one got a different one.

[53:55] I've got a different one.

[53:56] So what's the one that's sneaked out?

[53:57] Well, that one has everything in it.

[53:59] Oh, okay.

[54:00] Okay.

[54:01] All right.

[54:02] Okay.

[54:03] So you would give, you know, okay, yeah, that makes sense.

[54:05] That's interesting.

[54:06] So the demo man swear thing.

[54:08] I mean, what was the theory behind keeping that under wraps for kind of, it was just this year when that finally snuck out

[54:16] and thanks to really Mike Wiley was the impetus behind that whole thing, whether we liked it or not.

[54:22] You know, he had a copy and put it for sale on eBay and then that kind of sky, your wheels turned in, right?

[54:31] No?

[54:32] No comment.

[54:33] No comment?

[54:34] Okay.

[54:35] Man.

[54:36] Home.

[54:37] Unfortunately, no matter what I say, no one will be happy with my explanation and somebody will pick it apart.

[54:45] All right.

[54:46] So, yeah, you know, that's smart?

[54:48] No.

[54:49] So, let's just suffice it to say that, you know, whatever the reason was back then, it doesn't apply now.

[54:57] Right.

[54:58] So, you're okay that they're out now?

[55:00] Oh, yeah.

[55:01] No, it's not a problem.

[55:02] Yeah, and in fact, I had intended to let it go a while ago and I just got busy and lazy.

[55:07] So, you're not pissed at Wiley then?

[55:09] No.

[55:10] No.

[55:11] No, my only thing is I feel bad for anybody who might have paid a premium for it.

[55:15] Yeah, I think what he did, he was trying to sell a game, just a regular demo man, which usually sells for $1500 and he got $20000 for it with the home run.

[55:24] So, somebody paid $500 for that privilege.

[55:27] And then somebody else started selling the ROMs separately on eBay and I think that was what finally, that was the straw that just broke the camel's back.

[55:39] Well, I actually tried to get the ROMs posted on the Pimbo database while that option was still.

[55:46] Yeah, they take forever to react to stuff.

[55:48] Yeah, they're slow.

[55:50] I should have done it long before then.

[55:52] I kept meaning to and then I would forget.

[55:54] Right.

[55:55] So, no.

[55:56] It's not on the priority list.

[55:57] It's pretty low.

[55:58] Yeah.

[55:59] So, now, what about flipper codes?

[56:01] What about them?

[56:02] There's a tad flipper code.

[56:07] And is anybody else, I mean, and then I heard the game assumes a different personality.

[56:12] As far as I know, that's never been.

[56:16] Or which game?

[56:18] Demo man.

[56:19] Oh, the home demo.

[56:22] The home demo.

[56:23] Okay.

[56:24] Now, there aren't any specific flipper codes for demolition, man.

[56:28] That make it change speech or hello tad or, you know, it's alone yelling at tad or, you know, or center of bullets, grabbing tad's butt.

[56:39] None of that.

[56:40] None of that.

[56:42] If you do your due diligence and take a look at the difference between the home five ROM and the home six ROM that's posted on the Pimbal database, you'll see the adjustment in there.

[56:53] See the adjustment.

[56:54] There's an adjustment for which team member the game is.

[56:58] Oh, so you mean five was for one team and six was for six.

[57:01] Six removes the adjustment.

[57:03] Oh.

[57:04] So, it's five better than half?

[57:06] Well, some people might think so.

[57:08] I think it's really stupid personally.

[57:10] Okay.

[57:11] I didn't want, in fact, that's why I made six because I took the adjustment out.

[57:18] So really, the version you want to release to the public was six now.

[57:22] Yeah, five.

[57:23] Right.

[57:24] But five got out somehow.

[57:27] Well, somebody bought some team members game.

[57:31] Oh.

[57:33] And then that kind of let the cat out of the bag.

[57:35] Yeah.

[57:36] Because I've only ever seen six.

[57:38] Yeah.

[57:39] I never, I didn't even know five existed home.

[57:43] Now, were you mad about that one?

[57:45] No.

[57:46] No, it doesn't matter.

[57:47] It's all a little point.

[57:48] Okay.

[57:49] Okay, we're going to take a break talking with Ted Estes of all the Pimbal programming department at Williams Valley.

[57:54] The Pimgame Journal is a proud sponsor of Topcast.

[57:57] It covers Pimbal like no other publication can.

[58:00] The Pimgame Journal is America's only Pimbal publication.

[58:03] Whether you're looking for new games or the classics, reports on industry shows or collector expos, insights on a game you want or features to help you fix the game you've got, Pimgame Journals for you.

[58:14] Their website is at PimgameJournal.com.

[58:17] Okay, we're back with Ted Estes of the Williams Valley programming department.

[58:23] Okay.

[58:24] So now in 93, you're basically not doing game software anymore, but you're headed the department.

[58:29] So from 93 to 99, what's going on?

[58:34] What do you...

[58:35] Well, I still did...

[58:38] See, Twilight Zone came out in spring of 93.

[58:43] Right.

[58:45] And Demolishaman was spring of 94.

[58:49] And Roadshow was that spring of 95?

[58:54] No, it was early in that.

[58:56] It must have been fall of 94 then.

[58:59] Yeah.

[59:00] Fall of 94.

[59:01] So that was the last game I've worked on.

[59:03] Was Red and Ted.

[59:04] Did you like that one?

[59:05] It was okay.

[59:06] There's some stuff that I wish we could have done better.

[59:09] There was a...

[59:10] Well...

[59:11] Now, why didn't you go nuts with, you know...

[59:14] You know, you went nuts with Twilight Zone.

[59:17] You went nuts with Demolishaman.

[59:19] But then you kind of backed off on the Red and Ted?

[59:22] It's very difficult to manage the software department and be in development.

[59:29] It's possible.

[59:30] You know, when you're doing game development, there really is a crutch mode of about four months where you're working 70-hour weeks.

[59:40] And, you know, you can't get anything else done.

[59:44] Right.

[59:45] And I even had a futon in my office during Roadshow.

[59:49] And spent many nights, you know, sleeping in my office.

[59:55] That must be good for the panel.

[59:57] Yeah.

[59:58] Well, I didn't have kids then.

[01:00:00] But even that doesn't work very well because Williams...

[01:00:03] They had this PA system that was the whole building.

[01:00:07] And even though you could select, you know, I only want to page somebody in one area.

[01:00:13] Nobody knew those numbers.

[01:00:14] They only knew the one in the page, the whole building.

[01:00:16] So the factory would start up at 5.36 o'clock in the morning.

[01:00:21] Talking about what?

[01:00:22] Keegan, right?

[01:00:23] Well, now this was still down here on the California Avenue.

[01:00:26] And so, you know, you'd be working until 12 o'clock at night and then try to catch a few hours of sleep and then all of a sudden, 5.36 o'clock in the morning, they start paging people over, you know, over the intercom waking up.

[01:00:42] And it was a rough time.

[01:00:44] Now, what did the move from Chicago have to Wachiegan?

[01:00:49] I heard that that was kind of a union-busting move that, you know, that the factory of Chicago Avenue was all unionized.

[01:00:56] And Wachiegan turns out that it wasn't in that that was really the only reason they actually moved production up to Wachiegan.

[01:01:05] I mean, I know that's outside your realm, but I mean, do you know anything about that?

[01:01:08] It's sort of ringing a bell now and I, again, the details are real hazy.

[01:01:15] That's many years ago since then.

[01:01:19] There was some talk of that, but I think we ended up with a different union up there.

[01:01:24] So there probably was some of that.

[01:01:27] On the other hand, they were doing a slot machine assembly down in California Avenue after they built the Wachiegan plant.

[01:01:38] So I'm not sure if that's the whole thing.

[01:01:42] I don't know what the whole grand plan was.

[01:01:46] Well, speaking of grand plan, so now you're heading the department.

[01:01:51] And what's your, you know, from 94, 95 to 99, is your job better or worse?

[01:01:59] Well, after Roadshow Timeframe, somewhere in there, the head of the company had the bright idea of combining the spinning rail slot department, software department, with the pinball department,

[01:02:15] in order to spur creativity in the spinning rail slot designs.

[01:02:22] So I was managing the software for both at that point.

[01:02:27] Oh, and so now all of a sudden, you know, I had twice as many people reporting to me.

[01:02:34] And I got involved a lot more in the slot machine than the pinball stuff at that point.

[01:02:43] There's a lot more going on in terms of dealing with regulators.

[01:02:48] Yeah, because it's fully regulated environment.

[01:02:51] You know, you know, like Casino can't change ROM code without gaming commission personnel being there to supervise it and so on and so forth.

[01:02:59] So I got to imagine that revision levels in the slot department for software have to view.

[01:03:07] Right. Every, every room.

[01:03:08] That would be control.

[01:03:09] Right. Every rev has to be, has to go through the labs for approval.

[01:03:13] And there's seven or eight different jurisdictions and each one has slightly different rules.

[01:03:19] And I did a, you know, some traveling to talk with various labs and the different jurisdictions about, you know, we've got this idea for a game, you know, a bonus game or whatever.

[01:03:35] Right. You know, is this allowable? Is that, you know, that sort of thing.

[01:03:38] So I spent a lot of time doing that.

[01:03:41] We were also involved in a lawsuit at the time.

[01:03:45] You're a GT, right?

[01:03:46] Yeah. And I, I was involved with that, trying to help out with some prior art investigation and ended up testifying in the court case.

[01:03:57] Essentially, you guys prevailed for it.

[01:03:59] No, we don't know.

[01:04:01] You lost your weight loss.

[01:04:04] No, well, but I was, but I was trying to sue you every which way, right?

[01:04:10] I, yeah, I, I think so.

[01:04:14] They basically, and that forced you guys into video slots, right?

[01:04:19] Right. Right. That forced us to go into video slots where the patent that they were suing us over didn't, um, that didn't apply.

[01:04:26] And then, um, and then that's what, but, uh, I've done this gaming actually take off.

[01:04:31] Right. So we actually, I GT you thank those guys.

[01:04:35] Yeah. Yeah. At the time.

[01:04:36] I mean, you know, they, so they were the biggest idiots in the world.

[01:04:39] Yeah.

[01:04:40] Yeah. They, they forced us to do something else and, um, and you did it well.

[01:04:45] Yeah. Although I wasn't involved with that part.

[01:04:47] We had two separate departments. We had the one for the video slots and the one for this mechanical spinning.

[01:04:52] Oh, and you were in charge of this to get the spinning guys.

[01:04:54] Yeah. Now, what was the fiasco where guy puts a dollar into the Williams slot, hit some combination of buttons and gets 20 credits, 20 dollars worth of credits.

[01:05:06] Now that was on the, that was on the, um, on the video, on the videos with the touch screen.

[01:05:11] And, um, it was some sort of a flaw in the operating system where it, it, it got overwhelmed with messages from the touch screen and the, and the, and the buttons and that sort of thing.

[01:05:22] Um, I don't remember. I think that happened right at, well, was I still working there or not?

[01:05:30] The last two years that I was at Williams, I was working on a separate project, which was a next generation operating system for a new slot machine and video slot,

[01:05:42] uh, product line.

[01:05:44] So you were shielded from this?

[01:05:46] Yeah. I wasn't really involved in the day to day.

[01:05:48] Right. Right.

[01:05:50] Now, what about pinball 2000? Were you involved? How involved were you with that?

[01:05:54] Not very much. Um, we, while we were working, while my team was working on its, um, next casino platform, we were right alongside the pinball 2000 folks.

[01:06:06] We, we stayed the same building and exchanged some ideas and, was just a walkie in now?

[01:06:12] No, this is still on California.

[01:06:14] Okay.

[01:06:16] So, um, and, uh, and I watched pinball 2000 go on, um, but I decided to, um, move over to the gaming side, um, in the hopes that, you know, these really bright people for pinball 2000, um, would, would, uh,

[01:06:36] the market again, and I would get a chance to get back over there and actually do one more game.

[01:06:40] That was, well, it was my hope I wanted to do one more pinball game.

[01:06:44] Huh. And that never happened.

[01:06:46] No. No, so, but the intertwinement of pinball in, in, in slots was like pretty intense because in the early days when I GT was trying to keep you out of the marketplace,

[01:07:02] pinball was basically financing slot machines.

[01:07:05] Right, but it was really a separate department. Yes, there was money from the pinball department that got the, you know, that was able to get them, uh, get, uh, Williams into the gaming market.

[01:07:17] Um, but there were really no exchange of ideas there.

[01:07:20] Um, it was only that short period of time where we combined the software department, um,

[01:07:26] uh, for pinball and for the mechanical slots that, that was really that much exchange of ideas.

[01:07:34] During that time was when, um, some of the spinning real slots with the bonus games were designed like, um, leading streak and, um,

[01:07:44] um, um, X factor.

[01:07:47] Um, let's see what else was there.

[01:07:52] Pirates treasure pirates gold, uh, magic lamp.

[01:08:00] Um, we worked on the, uh, the monopoly games. Right.

[01:08:06] Those, those first, but you did well with. Yeah.

[01:08:08] Yeah. We did well on the spinning real versions of the monopoly stuff.

[01:08:12] Right. Um, so the head of the whole kit and communal though is the Castro on. He's that on both sides, right?

[01:08:20] Pinball in the slots. Yeah. Well, at some point he, he will left to go with, with Midway.

[01:08:28] Right. If you're gonna ask me a history of that, I, I, I can't remember the dates on that.

[01:08:35] That's fine. Yeah. That's fine. But so where I was going with this is that, at some point,

[01:08:40] pinball was kind of financing slots and financing the Atari Midway thing to its detriment in that it's making pinball look less profitable than it could be.

[01:08:56] And the point I'm getting across is there seem to be this kind of grand plan to kind of keep.

[01:09:04] It's equivalent of having an airplane. You're fine, an airplane, and you got a parachute and you jump out of a perfectly good airplane.

[01:09:13] Is kind of the equivalent to what Williams did to pinball? Well, I, I don't know whether that's necessarily true.

[01:09:19] Um, pinball certainly kept the company going during the slump in the mid 80s, for example, when video games were, right word, not doing well.

[01:09:30] And then, um, then when video games came back, along with, you know, the moral combat, the NBA, jam and all that stuff that enabled the company to spin off Midway as a separate company.

[01:09:44] There was something in terms of SEC regulatory rules where the pinball part had to stay behind with WMS gaming instead of going with Midway in order to make two separate companies because you had to have businesses that were in business for certain number of years in order to be able to split them apart.

[01:10:06] And the gaming company had not been in business who long enough. That was an SEC rule. You know, if you want to do, you want to split off and, you know, have a separate company with separate stock and that sort of thing.

[01:10:20] And I'm not that familiar with all that sort of thing. So that's part of the reason why the pinball went over there. Now there may be other savings or funny accounting things going on. I have no idea I'm not going to make any kind of a, you know, judgment on that strike.

[01:10:35] Now along with the pinball side of things, the whole what he can plant went to WMS gaming and then that plant was making games for Midway under contract.

[01:10:51] So, you know, there were some burdens there. For example, Midway was making games. The big chunk of the factory was idle. I'll tell you all that overhead.

[01:11:06] And that cost pinball. And that one on pinball's balance sheet. And that would charge against pinball. And again, I'm not an accountant. I don't know what anybody is.

[01:11:15] But it's making the pinball picture. It's look kind of artificially look worse than it is. It's looking a little bit bad. But on the other hand, you have to look at the facts too. And look at the numbers in terms of where sales of games were going.

[01:11:28] When I started at Williams in 92, they were cranking games out as fast as they could, you know, they couldn't make them any faster.

[01:11:39] And that was part of the reaction for making that bigger plant up in in Wakingen. We don't want to be in the position where our competitors can actually fill in the gap for us.

[01:11:52] Right. Part of the reason that some of those other games from Premier and Dede East Sega were able to sell as well as they were was because people couldn't get, you know, the Adams family or get away or whatever they were.

[01:12:08] They just weren't available. You couldn't buy them. And now you take a look at from that point to where all of a sudden the spiral started going down.

[01:12:21] Yeah, 95. It's got bad. Right. And some of it was self-inflicted where we were discounting games. Right. And operators were getting into that habit of, oh, why should I buy this game new?

[01:12:33] If I wait three months, they're going to discount it. I could buy it for $1,000 off. Right. You know, and then that means they're going to buy the discounted game and not the next game.

[01:12:45] So how was speaking of chemical and Dede East? How pissed were you guys at them? I mean, because let's face it, a lot of their games were direct copies, features.

[01:13:02] And play field design and whatever of Williams products.

[01:13:07] Personally, personally, I didn't care all that much. I mean, there were some annoyances like I remember when we showed the lost in the zone feature at the show in Las Vegas.

[01:13:23] And Jurassic Park was the game there. And all of a sudden, you know, a week later Jurassic Park has system shut down and it looks an awful lot like a lost in the zone.

[01:13:35] You know, it's like, okay, well, you know, everybody who really knows what's going on can tell that it's, you know, can tell that it's, you know, it's, at least but it's fired by what you were saying.

[01:13:49] I thought somebody that worked there. We won't mention his name, but he said that chemical would come in with, you know, a paper napkin and say, I want this fee. I saw this on a Williams game. I want this feature in our game.

[01:14:04] Yeah. And they'd be like, well, we got our own ideas. You know, when we think they're better than that. No, no, no, no, Williams did it. We're doing it.

[01:14:14] You know, that was, you know, his, his opinion and his approach. You know, so I got to imagine that that had to piss you guys off.

[01:14:21] There were some people at Williams that were pretty annoyed about the whole thing. But I'm sure it happens in a lot of other industries.

[01:14:29] You know, it's just that, you know, we're pinball coin ups, a pretty small pond.

[01:14:35] You know, and, you know, what can you do about it? Well, there was a lot of lawsuits going back and forth between you guys and them, right?

[01:14:43] Were you guys trying to sue them a lot? No, you don't think a lot. There were some threats back and forth on some things.

[01:14:50] But, you know, some of that stuff, you can't really, you can't make that sort of thing stick.

[01:14:56] Well, it was something that did stick. Well, the whole board system, the, did it?

[01:15:02] I told you before your time, right? Before my time, right? I didn't think about that. So, you know, the copying part, you know,

[01:15:10] Nothing comes to mind, huh? Like I said, there were some people who were very annoyed. You know, maybe Joe strength is that he knows a good feature when he sees it.

[01:15:20] Yeah. You know, keep some lawyers busy. Right. You know, you know, if you take a look at movies in Hollywood, you know, how many ideas are recycled?

[01:15:30] Right. Right. You know, toy industry, how many ideas get, you know, back and forth. I mean, it's the same sort of thing happens in a lot of places.

[01:15:40] But you guys didn't, you know, no lawsuits that you can think of that. There's no, nothing that I was involved in that.

[01:15:46] Okay. Okay. So now, when they shut down pinball 2000, you know, what, what part were you playing in that as far as like, you know, did you have to, you know, on Black Money?

[01:15:57] Were you the one that would tell everybody to go home or? Well, since I wasn't working in the pinball division, you know, I was getting my paycheck from WMS Gaming, not William's electronics. It didn't really affect me.

[01:16:08] What I did do was try to talk to some people on the gaming side in terms of here, you know, here are these skilled engineers.

[01:16:19] You know, let's go interview them. You know, let's, let's take, you know, let's take advantage of it.

[01:16:26] So you're trying to give as many pinball guys as possible over on to your side. Right. Come over to the dark side.

[01:16:32] Yeah. And they have your black helmet on and they're really safe. So it didn't really work out all that well.

[01:16:38] There were a few people who made the transition from pinball over to gaming. And I hired a couple of software developers as contractors for,

[01:16:48] for what? What those guys basically didn't want to do gaming, right? Not really, no.

[01:16:53] Yeah. Right. Was it hard to hire gaming programmers? I mean, no, I don't think so. No.

[01:17:00] I mean, were the slides done in this something language, or were they done in C?

[01:17:04] No, that's a done in C++. It was. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's not that hard to find. No, not really. No.

[01:17:14] Okay. No, no. If you, yeah. Well, how did you feel about the whole pinball 2000? I mean, to you, was that a justified move on Williams Park?

[01:17:23] I think so. The problem that I couldn't figure out in my mind was how it would ever pay off.

[01:17:29] What do you mean? You mean how, what did you mean, the pinball 2000 would pay? Right. Right.

[01:17:33] Because the development time was just too long. You know, the system itself is expensive as everybody notes.

[01:17:40] And the big monitor on there, you got expensive electronics. The development time was longer.

[01:17:51] The development teams were bigger. You know, it was bad enough when we made the jump to dot matrix, where the first couple of dot matrix games,

[01:18:03] there was still just one programmer on a game team that person would do the animations because of the games weren't so animation heavy.

[01:18:12] Right. But toward toward the heyday there, we would have two people per game.

[01:18:18] So all of a sudden, now your program and costs have double in two people programming again.

[01:18:24] As Williams started getting a little bit leaner in the leaner years, this thing started trailing off.

[01:18:31] They started trying to cut back and not put two people per game, like maybe one and a half to do the programming.

[01:18:39] And there were a few games, probably, that was one program and did all of the stuff.

[01:18:43] Including the animations? Yeah, including all the...

[01:18:46] So the animation programmers also could do regular game programming too.

[01:18:53] Right. Okay. So now you go to pinball 2000 and...

[01:18:58] Yeah, you're doing a video game and a pinball game. Right. And it's not necessarily a video game, but it's pretty video intensive.

[01:19:05] Right. You know, you want to make it look nice and you get backgrounds, you get stuff moving around on the screen.

[01:19:10] You know, you want stuff blowing up or reacting to the ball or however.

[01:19:16] And you get this team full of artists now.

[01:19:20] We used to have one or two dot matrix artists and now all of a sudden there's this whole art department full of animation artists with their 3D rendering tools and all this stuff.

[01:19:31] Right.

[01:19:33] And so, you know, just in terms of the development costs, it was going way up.

[01:19:37] So, were you privy at all to the pinball 2000 development thing when like, you know, Loller and Gomez came in with their hallow pin and all that stuff?

[01:19:49] Yeah, I saw the first... I saw one of the first demos on that and it just blew me away.

[01:19:54] What about the pop-it-oop version? How did you feel about the pop-it-oop version of pinball 2000?

[01:20:00] Well, the one I saw was simply a baby backmanish type thing.

[01:20:06] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was just a big video screen instead of a back box.

[01:20:10] Right. And I couldn't see that it was anything beyond, you know, okay, I'm going to watch TV instead of play pinball.

[01:20:19] Play pinball. Right. Right. Right.

[01:20:21] So, you... So, when those guys showed you were in on that first meeting, huh?

[01:20:26] Well, not the first meeting. The very first meeting when they were showing it was only for the high mucky mark type people.

[01:20:34] What did they mean the nicasso type guy? Yeah, right. Right.

[01:20:37] But in one of the very early meetings, I saw the little hallow pin mock-up thing.

[01:20:42] Well, what was management's reaction to pinball 2000, you know, the nicasso guys?

[01:20:48] Well, I don't know. I wasn't... I wasn't... I don't know specifically.

[01:20:55] I can remember meetings before then, and sitting in on some meetings that I was invited to where Neil the Castor would say,

[01:21:04] it's up to you guys to save pinball. What are you going to do to save it? Right.

[01:21:08] That was prior to Pat George coming up with this idea that they were working on.

[01:21:16] Because you know, there's this vicious rumor that when the castor saw pinball 2000 that he was pissed,

[01:21:24] that he saw the potential of it, and that they were already moving down this path to basically shelter pinball and kick it out the door.

[01:21:32] And here, you know, he gives these guys a challenge, and they meet the challenge.

[01:21:37] Oh. They beat the challenge. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I have a dents of that.

[01:21:43] I don't know. It's just a rumor. You know, so I was just curious if you know, because you know, there was all set of circumstances that seemed like pinball was for whatever reason,

[01:21:56] they were really... they wanted to do the gaming thing, and pinball was just, you know, they couldn't get rid of it fast enough.

[01:22:03] And they raised the price of the Star Wars 500 bucks, got all the European orders cancelled, through the exchange rate, you know, that, you know, all luck, you know, we can't sell those.

[01:22:13] You know, it's another reason, another nail in the coffin type thing.

[01:22:16] Well, you can look at it that way. On the other hand, there are realities of making any kind of a product.

[01:22:21] I don't want to be an apologist for what they did.

[01:22:24] What they did or anything. But there are certain economic realities. You know, whether you're making toasters or pinball games,

[01:22:31] you want to make a certain profit margin. And if you're not making that profit margin, why are you in the business?

[01:22:37] Unless, you know, you really get excited about pinball was making money right then.

[01:22:42] A little bit.

[01:22:43] Yeah, but that was better than the last two years, part of that thing.

[01:22:47] Right. They're losing.

[01:22:48] They're spending $10 million dollars a year on pinball, okay, to make how much? $11 million, $12 million.

[01:22:57] They could put that same $10 million dollars into the gaming side and probably make $50 million out of it.

[01:23:04] All right. Okay. What would you do if it was your $10 million dollars?

[01:23:07] Well, but the resources are all there. I mean, you're still going to have the same resources in the Slime Machine Division.

[01:23:15] It's not like when they close pinwall, you know, all of a sudden, you know, the part when WMS Gaming Department budgets all went up, right?

[01:23:24] I don't know. They hired more people here. They did.

[01:23:26] Yeah.

[01:23:27] Okay. So you're saying that that was a cost that they couldn't realize it.

[01:23:31] You know, to me, I don't see why those two things couldn't live peacefully and next to each other. You know what I mean?

[01:23:38] Well, it's possible. But again, I would challenge you if you take a look, use your 2020 hindsight guard right now.

[01:23:45] All right. Did the pinwall market come back if Williams had stayed, you know, for the last eight years, now seven and a half.

[01:23:54] All right. Since they shut it down, they'd stay in business.

[01:23:57] Same with they still, you know.

[01:23:58] What would they, would it, all of a sudden have bounced back?

[01:24:01] You know, I don't see that that Stern is is cranking out.

[01:24:06] That starts, seems to be doing okay.

[01:24:09] Well, they're doing okay for a very small market.

[01:24:12] Right. But not the kind of market that Williams was doing.

[01:24:15] You know, this Williams had to make whatever 50,000 games a year to break even or whatever it was.

[01:24:21] Yeah, whatever the number was. Whatever the number was.

[01:24:23] In order to be able to do it.

[01:24:24] Williams is a publicly held company, Stern is private.

[01:24:27] Right. They don't have to, so Stern doesn't have to answer to their stockholders.

[01:24:30] Now, Stern does a lot of things a lot better than Williams did.

[01:24:33] They have a smaller factory. They know how to do small runs.

[01:24:37] Williams, the only way they ever got things done was,

[01:24:40] oh, we have to do a minimum run of 3,000 games.

[01:24:43] Right.

[01:24:44] You know, and they would jam those 3,000 games down their distributive strokes.

[01:24:48] Got to take these. Right.

[01:24:49] They bought the parts for them.

[01:24:51] You know, they couldn't do it, you know.

[01:24:54] Like what they did, Adam's family gold.

[01:24:56] They probably lost money on those.

[01:24:58] Why did they do Adam's family gold?

[01:25:00] They needed, there was a hole in the line. They didn't have a game ready.

[01:25:03] Oh, really? That was the only reason?

[01:25:05] Yeah.

[01:25:06] Huh, was it more expensive than regular Adam's family?

[01:25:08] Only because it was a smaller run.

[01:25:11] Right.

[01:25:12] So, you don't have economy of scale.

[01:25:15] Right.

[01:25:16] And their factory was just not set up for,

[01:25:19] how do we get it ramped up real fast, get these things going, you know.

[01:25:24] And then turn off.

[01:25:27] Hmm.

[01:25:28] Okay.

[01:25:29] Well, you know, the reason why I said that is because you know,

[01:25:32] in a lot of ways, you know, I mean, especially looking at the parts thing,

[01:25:36] you know, like, why did they sell the parts to Gene, Gene Cunningham?

[01:25:41] It beats me.

[01:25:43] Okay, because to me, it's almost like, okay, we've got Novice, Germany,

[01:25:49] interested.

[01:25:50] We've got Betsy's interested.

[01:25:52] We've got Ice and Buffalo interested.

[01:25:55] And then we've got Gene Cunningham, a guy that lives a little bit south,

[01:26:01] both physically and otherwise, maybe.

[01:26:05] You know, he's basically a collector with the pockets.

[01:26:09] Let's sell the him.

[01:26:11] I'll post a sell into one of these other, you know, partners in crime, as it may be,

[01:26:16] you know, the distributors are competing companies or whatever.

[01:26:19] It's almost like they wanted to sell it to somebody they knew couldn't make a lot of money in it,

[01:26:25] so that they could show their stockholders.

[01:26:29] Look, we got rid of pinball.

[01:26:31] It was a good thing.

[01:26:32] Well, I don't know.

[01:26:33] I don't know what the thing is.

[01:26:34] No, I'll turn it in on that.

[01:26:35] No, I don't.

[01:26:36] If there were any other people interested in buying any of that stuff,

[01:26:40] I'm not aware of it.

[01:26:41] So that's information I don't have.

[01:26:43] Well, you know, we talked about Trudeau, and Trudeau actually got hired by Ice,

[01:26:49] because Ice was buying pinball from Williams.

[01:26:53] And, you know, then that's what why Trudeau got hired there.

[01:26:57] And he was working on pinball at Ice, and they were basically taking over everything.

[01:27:02] And then, you know, Ice got fed up with dealing with Williams,

[01:27:05] because it became obvious, at least to Trudeau, that what they were getting in their purchase

[01:27:12] from Williams wasn't really what they needed to make games.

[01:27:16] You know, it wasn't valuable enough, and Ice pulled the plug after a couple of months.

[01:27:21] So I don't know.

[01:27:22] I wasn't involved in any of those decisions, those were not at my level.

[01:27:26] Gotcha.

[01:27:27] It puzzled me why when Williams shut the place down,

[01:27:32] was shut down pinball, that they actually didn't keep somebody on staff,

[01:27:36] actually understood where everything was kept, you know,

[01:27:42] CAD files, inventory, understood what was valuable in terms of any kind of intellectual property.

[01:27:51] I mean, nobody was, once they said, divide it, those people they were gone.

[01:27:55] And all the deals were done by the legal team at Williams,

[01:28:00] who, as far as I could tell, didn't really understand the value of, let's say, you know, software.

[01:28:07] Yeah, Jean pulls up with a pickup truck, they throw all that stuff in the back,

[01:28:12] and away he goes with a flopper out in the back, that's kind of like a, you know,

[01:28:16] I mean, it still is in me sound, it's probably not all that far from it, right?

[01:28:19] So I have no idea.

[01:28:20] I don't know whether there was any sort of planned, you know, intentional villain on Williams Park,

[01:28:28] or it was an aptitude, okay, but, you know, it's puzzling to me, but I'm not, I get no idea.

[01:28:35] All right, and then you're not, it don't sound like you're a conspiracy theory type kind of guy.

[01:28:39] No, no.

[01:28:40] Well, the thing is, you know, most conspiracy, conspiracies, you know,

[01:28:46] as soon as two people know the cat gets out of the bag somehow.

[01:28:50] So who killed Kennedy?

[01:28:51] Just so we know.

[01:28:52] Well, you know, it's just like, it's just like, homeroms, you know,

[01:28:57] as soon as you give it to one person, eventually the cat's out of the bag.

[01:29:02] All right, so, you know, I,

[01:29:03] Well, you have the double man thing under control for a while.

[01:29:06] Yeah.

[01:29:07] You know, you did pretty good job on that, you know, threatening, you know, whatever,

[01:29:12] dismemberment.

[01:29:13] I made no threat.

[01:29:16] I know, just kidding, just kidding.

[01:29:18] Well, okay, so now we're, how long should say again?

[01:29:22] I left in August of 2000.

[01:29:25] August of 2000, okay.

[01:29:27] So I stayed for almost another year after, after people have to push up down.

[01:29:32] And you went to Cisco?

[01:29:33] Yeah.

[01:29:34] And now why, why did you make that jump?

[01:29:36] Well, I need another job.

[01:29:39] Oh, you mean, you mean, yeah.

[01:29:43] The project that I was working on, which was this new platform,

[01:29:47] a new operating system platform for a new gaming product line,

[01:29:51] it was pretty evident that upper management wasn't really behind it in terms of

[01:29:57] getting all the teams together with the hardware and the electronics.

[01:30:02] You can see some of the results of it, probably none of the work that I was working on,

[01:30:08] at least the physical design and some of the very latest slots that they had on the floor now.

[01:30:13] But at the time, it was, I don't know where their heads were,

[01:30:18] but sort of harkens back to my comment about ineptitude.

[01:30:23] It's possible that they just weren't concentrating on what's the next important thing.

[01:30:29] They were counting their money on, look at this, we're selling this current platform

[01:30:35] versus, oh, we need to be able to grow into this, you know, to the next generation.

[01:30:40] So, we weren't getting the support from it.

[01:30:44] We were getting a little burnt out.

[01:30:46] And so we decided to, we decided to move on.

[01:30:49] My team said we're going to open up.

[01:30:52] Oh, so your whole team left?

[01:30:53] Yeah, our whole team left.

[01:30:54] So your whole team went from WMS to Cisco?

[01:30:57] Pretty much, yeah.

[01:30:59] Yeah, who'd you bring with you?

[01:31:00] Bill Grop.

[01:31:02] Okay.

[01:31:03] And Cameron Silver.

[01:31:04] Okay.

[01:31:05] And Tom, you been?

[01:31:06] Well, Tom, is Tom still here?

[01:31:08] No.

[01:31:09] No.

[01:31:10] No.

[01:31:12] And to a, well, one other person who was working on that project with me,

[01:31:18] who was with gaming, he hasn't done any football stuff, came over.

[01:31:25] And it just so happens that Tom, you been, used to work with some of the people

[01:31:31] who we work with now at Cisco.

[01:31:35] And through a long convoluted relationship, we were able to start up a development

[01:31:41] office here in Chicago.

[01:31:43] Interesting.

[01:31:44] Yeah, I actually hired Tom a couple of years ago to do something.

[01:31:49] I was, I had a peppy, Williams peppy the clown.

[01:31:52] And he uses this old tape system for the music, because the games were like 56.

[01:31:58] And I wanted to replace it with something digital.

[01:32:02] And so I asked Duncan and Duncan, it's like, you should talk to Tom.

[01:32:06] I said, why?

[01:32:07] He goes, I hear he's really bored at Cisco.

[01:32:10] We'll do this for you.

[01:32:13] And he did eat.

[01:32:14] I mean, it was amazing what he did.

[01:32:16] You know, he made, you know, basically an MP3 player, you know, just for this coin operator

[01:32:22] game.

[01:32:23] You know, and it's great.

[01:32:24] I mean, what he did was just actually pretty cool.

[01:32:27] You know, he, he liked designing it.

[01:32:30] He didn't like making them though.

[01:32:31] That was the whole thing.

[01:32:32] Yeah.

[01:32:33] Because he did it all surface mountain.

[01:32:34] And he was actually doing the surface mounting himself.

[01:32:37] Yeah.

[01:32:38] You know, and, yeah, he just, he wasn't so much into that part of it.

[01:32:42] But you could tell that he enjoyed, you know, the whole design aspect of it.

[01:32:45] Right.

[01:32:46] But the actual, you know, soldering and stuffy.

[01:32:49] Yeah.

[01:32:50] And it wasn't so intense.

[01:32:51] So similarly, nice guy though.

[01:32:53] I mean, incredibly smart, almost intimidatingly smart, you know, I found it sometimes hard to

[01:33:01] talk to him, you know, that I always felt stupid after every conversation with him.

[01:33:06] Oh, it's a really bright guy.

[01:33:08] Yeah.

[01:33:09] Yeah, really smart.

[01:33:10] Really smart guy.

[01:33:11] And he was basically the guy that wrote all the big, small, 2000 stuff too, right?

[01:33:16] You know, the operating system stuff.

[01:33:18] Okay.

[01:33:19] He was the chief architect for the operating system.

[01:33:22] Right.

[01:33:23] And Pimble 2000.

[01:33:24] Right.

[01:33:25] So, you know, you were saying that they poured their heart and souls into Pimble 2000.

[01:33:29] Right.

[01:33:30] The people who were working on that really wanted to make Pimble work again.

[01:33:34] You know, that was the fun part about working at Williams.

[01:33:37] It wasn't just a job over there.

[01:33:39] It was really, everybody was so passionate about everything that they did.

[01:33:43] When I first got there, I couldn't believe how much fun it was.

[01:33:47] I couldn't believe they were paying me to work there.

[01:33:49] So, even though I took a cut and pay, you know, it was like, I couldn't wait to get there.

[01:33:55] So, the 70-hour weeks didn't bother you?

[01:33:58] No.

[01:33:59] No.

[01:34:00] You know, when I was working at AT&T and then Memorax Telex, there were days where I'd get up in the morning

[01:34:05] and I'd go, well, let's see, how many personal days do I have left?

[01:34:08] I take the day off.

[01:34:10] And here, when I was working at Williams, even when I was filled a little under the weather,

[01:34:15] it's like, no, I better go in. I might miss something.

[01:34:18] Because when I got there, we had, I think, six design teams, all in different stages

[01:34:24] and they're all working on something.

[01:34:26] So, there was always something new to see every day.

[01:34:28] We were playing, you know, Dr. Who at the bottom of the stairs and then at lunch

[01:34:33] and then running back up the stairs and telling Bill Fudsen-Rooter, you know,

[01:34:39] hey, we have this idea or, you know, this one scoring seems out of balance

[01:34:43] and, you know, or whatever.

[01:34:45] And at the end of the day, it would be like, well, I could get one more thing done on my game.

[01:34:51] I don't really have to go home yet. Maybe if I just popped some popcorn, you know,

[01:34:55] or had a soda out of the pop machine, you know, I could stay another hour before I had to go home

[01:35:00] and get dinner or kind of thing.

[01:35:02] So, you know, I wasn't surprising that when, you know, the Pimbal 2000 part rolled around,

[01:35:08] everybody took it really, really seriously in terms of how can we,

[01:35:12] how can we take the cost out of this thing?

[01:35:14] Yeah, I noticed like flipper links or flipper paws, you know,

[01:35:20] there used to be an WPC or right and a left.

[01:35:23] Well, in Pimbal 2000, there was just one.

[01:35:25] The right and left is interchangeable.

[01:35:28] So, there's one left part, you know what I mean?

[01:35:31] And it's also easier for operators because they have to buy one part and it services both the right and the left side.

[01:35:36] You know, which I thought was great.

[01:35:38] And if you look on how it's implemented, you know, in the hardware, you know,

[01:35:43] it was obviously well thought out.

[01:35:45] Yeah.

[01:35:46] You know, whole interchangeable play field thing, you know, cool idea.

[01:35:48] I don't know about from a money making standpoint how that would work, but...

[01:35:52] Yeah, that part of the problem, that part of the equation was more of an experiment since it really didn't cost us anything to do.

[01:36:00] And I shouldn't say us, it was them because I was working in gaming.

[01:36:05] Part of the economic model that works for Pimbal is the trade-in value.

[01:36:10] And without a cabinet, you can't trade in a Pimbal very well.

[01:36:13] Right.

[01:36:14] For like for the whole market.

[01:36:15] But on the other hand, one of the advantages of being able to do the swapping play field is

[01:36:20] if you go to an operator who's got six or seven games on location,

[01:36:25] if you can get them to buy an eighth play field or her and the operator has to be female,

[01:36:32] that's one for the shop that you can take back to the shop, get all serviced.

[01:36:37] James Light bulbs, new rubbers, get it all nice and clean.

[01:36:41] And then take it out to flip it in.

[01:36:44] Flip it in, now you've rotated your game.

[01:36:46] It's a lot easier than moving the whole game.

[01:36:48] But it's all serviced.

[01:36:49] You flip it right in, it takes just a few minutes to swamp it.

[01:36:52] You take the dirty play field back to the shop and do it again and take it to the next level.

[01:36:57] All right, you just keep rotating.

[01:36:59] Or you got the spare play field there for when a game does go out of service.

[01:37:04] I'll crud this one piece that's very specific.

[01:37:08] It's going to take two weeks for my distributor to get in.

[01:37:12] I'm going to keep my revenge from Mars down.

[01:37:15] I'll flip this other play field.

[01:37:18] So that's sort of thought to put in.

[01:37:21] As long as it doesn't cost you a lot of extra money, it makes a lot of sense.

[01:37:26] We interviewed operators, I shouldn't say we again.

[01:37:30] They interviewed operators, they talked to the distributors, what are kinds of problems.

[01:37:33] One of the big service calls is stuck balls.

[01:37:37] That's a lot of money to waste just to go out and stick a ball.

[01:37:41] That's why there's the extra key so you can take the glass off without being able to get to the money.

[01:37:46] So you can leave that key with the location owner to be able to get the ball on the stock.

[01:37:52] It's all that kind of thought that went into it that I thought was really interesting.

[01:37:59] Not only the whole concept of Pimble 2000, there's all this stuff that you can do with it.

[01:38:06] Believe me, the two games that got done on it are all the... they scratched the surface.

[01:38:14] Thinking terms of some of the very first solid state games.

[01:38:18] The first game that came out a year or two later.

[01:38:21] Compare a hot tip to a firepower.

[01:38:24] You see that there's a huge difference in potential using the same types of electronics and whatever system.

[01:38:31] You have the same thing on Pimble 2000. It's not just a game with video.

[01:38:36] Think of being able to light up different parts of the play field and reveal them and not reveal them.

[01:38:42] Because of the partially tinted glass.

[01:38:48] Think about what if you still had a Rudy head on the play field.

[01:38:55] But now when you hit him in the head, little stars go flying around his head.

[01:39:00] So you kind of blend both the mechanical and the video aspect.

[01:39:05] You can get Rudy about Black Eye.

[01:39:07] Literally.

[01:39:08] I mean, well, whatever.

[01:39:11] Right.

[01:39:13] And then there were lots of other thought.

[01:39:16] You were talking about reducing the cost.

[01:39:19] One of the things to reduce the cost on the game.

[01:39:22] They were going to tool the bottom arch.

[01:39:25] It was going to be injection molding the bottom arch.

[01:39:28] So that it would cost pennies by the time they were done.

[01:39:32] Pete Petrovsky, who was a designer at Williams,

[01:39:37] came up with a nifty idea to drastically reduce the cost of that glass.

[01:39:42] It's partially mirrored.

[01:39:44] And instead he was talking about some glass company where it actually doesn't need to be mirrored.

[01:39:51] It only really needs to be tinted.

[01:39:53] And they came up with a way.

[01:39:55] I think he had prototypes of this where it was tinted from clear to dark.

[01:40:01] And it was a lot of different things.

[01:40:04] You know, across the stretch of the thing.

[01:40:07] So not only is it a lot cheaper to manufacture because you're not putting that metalized layer on there.

[01:40:15] But you don't have as much problem with scratching.

[01:40:18] So there was a lot of other thought that was going into all of that.

[01:40:24] So a lot of people look at it and their armchair quarterbacks.

[01:40:28] And they don't understand a lot of the stuff that just hadn't gotten done yet.

[01:40:32] Right.

[01:40:33] And it had about 2000.

[01:40:34] On the other hand, the reality of the system is it, like I mentioned before,

[01:40:39] a lot of money to develop a game on that.

[01:40:42] Just for the number of people you have to hire to push all the pixels around on the display.

[01:40:48] Did you ever play Wizard Box?

[01:40:50] Yes, I did.

[01:40:51] Did you like it?

[01:40:52] It was very...

[01:40:55] The concept of it was very good.

[01:40:57] But what was actually implemented, I mean, was very embryonic at the time.

[01:41:03] So, you know, yeah, nice play field layout.

[01:41:08] As Pat waves his hands and points at things and this is going to do that.

[01:41:12] That's going to do that.

[01:41:13] You fill it in with your imagination.

[01:41:15] That's nice.

[01:41:16] But in terms of it being any kind of a game,

[01:41:19] you can't make it a judgment on it or not.

[01:41:23] Too early in the process.

[01:41:25] Right, too early.

[01:41:26] But that's one of the ones where Pat was experimenting with ideas of like lighting up different parts of the play field

[01:41:31] and using baffles to shield off different areas.

[01:41:34] Right.

[01:41:35] You know, to reveal and hide different parts.

[01:41:40] But that thing just is not, didn't get too far.

[01:41:43] I mean, because there's some people talking about, you know, Gene or Australian guy or that,

[01:41:48] talking about, you know, they want to sell Wizard Box.

[01:41:51] Yeah, that's not a game yet.

[01:41:53] Yeah, it's not a game.

[01:41:55] Yeah.

[01:41:56] Yeah, yeah.

[01:41:57] Gene seems to think it is.

[01:41:59] You know, and I don't know the guy in Australia has been in, but you know, he allegedly bought 25,

[01:42:05] whatever, you know, pinball 2000s and he's going to, you know, turn him into Wizard Box or something.

[01:42:11] Oh, yeah.

[01:42:12] You know, but, you know, whatever that means.

[01:42:15] Yeah, well good for him.

[01:42:16] Yeah.

[01:42:17] Yeah.

[01:42:18] And then you know, back to that whole wide and Williamseller, the gene, that same equation could be applied.

[01:42:26] Also not to kind of go back on the conspiracy theory thing again, but why did they sell to Mr. Australia?

[01:42:32] Kind of the same self-fulfilling, you know, we don't want pinball to look like it's doing well.

[01:42:39] You know what I mean?

[01:42:40] It could be.

[01:42:41] And it, you know,

[01:42:43] it could also be that Williamse just didn't care.

[01:42:47] Right.

[01:42:48] Either.

[01:42:49] I don't really know.

[01:42:50] I don't have a good answer for that.

[01:42:51] Yeah, and they just may not.

[01:42:53] You know, I guess it's money.

[01:42:55] And Gene's money is as green as anybody else is, right?

[01:42:58] Yeah.

[01:42:59] Sure.

[01:43:00] Okay.

[01:43:01] All right, well thank you, Ted.

[01:43:02] All right.

[01:43:03] Again, I want to thank Ted Estes for coming on our show and talking to us.

[01:43:07] We really greatly appreciate his time.

[01:43:09] And we had a lot of fun with it.

[01:43:11] Until next time, hope to see you again on TopCast.
