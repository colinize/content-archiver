[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:23] Welcome to another edition of Topcast, the Internet Pinball Radio Show.

[00:29] Tonight on Topcast we've got a game designer.

[00:31] Somebody that worked for D.D. Slash, Sega, Slash, Stern,

[00:36] and designed such games like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Guns and Roses, Apollo 13,

[00:42] Harley Davidson, Austin Powers, and the latest games from Stern, including Indiana Jones.

[00:51] Special guest. Special guest. Special guest. Special guest.

[00:56] So on Topcast tonight I'd like to welcome John Borg. John Borg, again, was a designer,

[01:02] did some work for D.D. East, Sega, and Stern, including Star Wars, Jurassic Park,

[01:09] last action hero, Tails from the Crypt, Guns and Roses, Frankenstein, Apollo 13,

[01:15] Twister, Mini Viper, the Lost World Jurassic Park, Harley Davidson, Striker Extreme,

[01:21] Sharky's Shootout, High Roller Casino, and Austin Powers, not to mention Indiana Jones 4.

[01:28] He's also currently working on some other projects for Stern right now for some games

[01:33] to be released in the future.

[01:35] So we're going to get to hear from John Borg tonight on Topcast, and we're going to

[01:40] give him a call right now on the phone.

[01:45] Hello. John, can you hear me?

[01:56] Yes, I have.

[01:57] Okay, how you doing tonight?

[01:59] Pretty good, not too bad.

[02:01] Well, let's go back way in time. I mean, when you were a kid, did you play pinball,

[02:07] or what steered you down this pinball path?

[02:12] Well, actually, as far as being in the pinball business, that was just by luck.

[02:19] I did play pinball quite a bit before I was in the industry.

[02:24] I was hooked on an old Stern game, Flight 2000, which was quite a while ago, and I'm not

[02:31] even exactly sure of the manufacturer data that came.

[02:34] Yeah, it was like 1980, it's a great game.

[02:36] I was hooked on it.

[02:40] And then I saw a lot of pinball in the very early 80s.

[02:44] When I was a teenager in high school, going to the arcades to play things like Pac-Man

[02:51] and Space Invaders.

[02:54] And that was where when I started to play probably a lot of pinball.

[02:59] I saw a lot of old premier games like Genesis and a lot of early Williams games like Funhouse

[03:06] and Big House and Big Guns and Cyclone and a lot of games like that from the early to

[03:18] mid 80s.

[03:20] Then in 87, I was in college and I was looking for a job as a dressman.

[03:30] I found an ad that was in the Chicago Tribune where a company was looking for a mechanical

[03:38] engineer.

[03:39] The ad was very, very brief.

[03:41] I went to Bensonville, Illinois and I walked into the lobby of this business and there

[03:49] were pinball backlasses all over the walls in their front lobby.

[03:53] I discovered that I was at premier technology and I ended up taking the job there when I

[03:59] was offered another job that offered more money in the hydraulics business.

[04:05] I just figured that pinball would be a lot more fun to work on than a hydraulic cylinder.

[04:11] I'm sure anybody would have made that choice.

[04:16] So you mean the whole thing was just basically lucked the way you got into it?

[04:20] Absolutely.

[04:21] Good luck or bad luck, who knows?

[04:25] Well, I actually good luck.

[04:27] It's been a lot of fun.

[04:29] So now what was your first job at Kotlid?

[04:33] I was a draftsman at Kotlid and let's see.

[04:39] Ray Tanzer's game, Arena, had just gone offline and we were bringing up a game on the line

[04:45] that John Trudeau had designed called Victory.

[04:49] And I think the first game that I actually got to really sick my teeth into was John Norris'

[04:54] Diamond Lady, which was a really interesting game and John was coming up with some pretty

[05:01] interesting new innovative game rules at the time and I took a real big interest in it

[05:07] at that point.

[05:08] And what, this was 1987?

[05:11] 1987.

[05:12] Okay.

[05:13] Yeah, System 80B, yeah.

[05:15] Uh-huh.

[05:16] And so now what involvement did you have in Norris' game?

[05:21] I was laying out ramps, roll under gates, making assembly drawings, working on the bill

[05:28] materials, doing a little bit of building of the game and assemblies for the game.

[05:36] Now did you have any college that gave you this experience or this educate?

[05:44] Actually I was going to college for manufacturing, engineering, drafting and plastics engineering

[05:51] and I originally wanted to design injection molds for injection molded piece parts.

[05:58] And when I ended up in pinball, I got to use all of that actually.

[06:02] Well, like when you make a plastic ramp for pinball, when you're doing this, you know,

[06:07] like on a pre-production game, how do you actually go through and make the ramps?

[06:12] Well, the designer at that time would generally lay out the path and say, I want to take the

[06:19] ball from point A to point B and maybe even produce a rough sketch.

[06:23] And then the mechanical engineer would turn around and take that drawing and make a nice

[06:27] top view.

[06:29] And this, at this time, we were still drawing on a drafting board.

[06:34] So I would take that sketch, I would do a really nice clean top view and actually dimension

[06:41] the whole thing.

[06:42] So we knew what the elevations of the ramp were and then I would develop like a three-view

[06:47] or a two-view drawing of that, you know, a top and a side view so that a mold maker could

[06:53] start a tool on it.

[06:55] And then we would actually go out and make a rough wood prototype tool for it, mold the

[07:01] part, bring it in and then, you know, tweak it, change it, you know, move it, eliminate

[07:06] it altogether and, you know, start from scratch or, you know, you know,

[07:11] go into production.

[07:12] Yeah, I kind of envisioned the way you made ramps is that, you know, you got to take

[07:17] a big flat sheet of pet G and kind of cut out the bottom of the ramp.

[07:22] Make the walls ourselves.

[07:23] Yeah.

[07:24] Yeah, we've done that too, you know, even before, sometimes we would do that before going

[07:29] into tooling.

[07:31] You know, sometimes we would make the ramps out of metal and then, you know, and then

[07:35] go into a vacuum form from there.

[07:38] I've seen ramps made numerous ways.

[07:42] Right.

[07:43] Right.

[07:44] So that's what was basically the type of thing that the type of work that you were doing.

[07:48] Yes.

[07:49] And now how did you break into actual game design?

[07:53] Um, actually I worked at Gottlieb for three years.

[07:56] I patented a device.

[07:59] I don't want to John Norris' games.

[08:01] It was called Light's Camera Action.

[08:04] It was a section of the play field that actually flipped over and revealed the different side

[08:09] and took the ball to a different area.

[08:12] And probably a couple years after that, it was probably about 1990 when Data East was running

[08:20] in Simpsons.

[08:21] I went over to talk to Joe Canaco and I was hired there as a mechanical engineer and in

[08:28] a couple years following that, he promoted me to game design.

[08:32] Now why did you leave Gottlieb?

[08:35] Well I was, you know, I really, I was interested in Williams and I saw some of the Data East games

[08:41] that were coming up and, you know, I wanted to work at Williams.

[08:45] I actually applied at Williams and I actually, you know, applied at Data East and Williams

[08:53] never called me and never did talk to them.

[08:55] But I did get to talk to Joe and I just fed to make the move to Data East.

[09:00] Now, at the time, I mean, you were, it sounds like you liked the Williams games better

[09:07] than the Gottlieb games.

[09:09] Yes.

[09:10] Okay.

[09:11] And now, did you play the Data East games?

[09:13] How did you feel about those?

[09:15] I liked them.

[09:16] Actually, I liked all of them.

[09:18] Laser War was really interesting.

[09:22] Secret Service, I liked that game.

[09:24] I even liked Torquillo Alley, which a lot of people thought was, you know, not one of

[09:28] their stronger games.

[09:30] And then the camera, what came after that time machine was unbelievable.

[09:35] Yeah, great game.

[09:37] You know, to this day, one of my, one of my favorite games.

[09:41] Now when Williams came out with that Bride of Pinbot, with the face that rotated, was

[09:46] that kind of reminiscent of what you did for Light's Camera Action?

[09:51] The face on Bride of Pinbot.

[09:54] Bride of Pinbot, yes.

[09:55] And actually, Gil Pollock, who was the president of Gottlieb at the time, actually, you know,

[10:04] when we saw it, we knew that the patent was infringed upon.

[10:09] And Pollock was able to use Williams' replay boost or automatic percentages, which was

[10:17] a Williams patent at the time that was their trade-off.

[10:21] Oh, you mean they actually like traded?

[10:24] Okay, you can use that if I can use this.

[10:26] You can print down our patent.

[10:28] We want this.

[10:30] So you're going to let us have it or you're going to pay us money.

[10:33] So that's pretty much what it came down to.

[10:36] And were they pretty open to that?

[10:38] Yes, I believe so.

[10:40] I don't know all the legalities.

[10:43] I didn't, you know, I was just drawing lines and circles and involved and, you know,

[10:48] can vault the time so I didn't get too involved in that, but that was the result of it.

[10:55] Now how was the company philosophy at Gottlieb compared to the DADEs when you went over?

[11:01] I mean, was there a big social change in thinking on how games were designed?

[11:08] Yeah, Gottlieb was a little more conservative.

[11:13] You know, they had their ideas of what a good game was.

[11:17] And I think, you know, Camel and the guys, they were a little more loose and a little

[11:24] more daring, if you will.

[11:26] Yeah, I can see that.

[11:29] I can see the daring.

[11:30] Uh-huh, sure.

[11:31] Okay.

[11:32] And now, was there anything at Gottlieb that you really didn't like?

[11:35] I mean, that was really like, oh, you know, like dreaded?

[11:41] The flippers.

[11:45] You know, Williams and DADEs pretty much had the, you know, the same type of a flipper

[11:49] unit.

[11:50] And, you know, Gottlieb had those old bats when I first started there.

[11:55] And they're, they're flipper units where I think at the time they were running on 24

[11:59] vaults instead of 50, you know, they were never as strong.

[12:03] We could never put his tall of a ramp on a game.

[12:06] And then I actually designed the newer Gottlieb flipper unit and that that had the word

[12:12] Gottlieb printed across it and it had a screw in the middle that actually held it to the

[12:17] shaft.

[12:18] It wasn't molded to a shaft.

[12:19] Wait, wait.

[12:20] So, you did not like what I call the fat boy flippers and you're the one that designed

[12:25] the skinny boy flippers.

[12:26] Yes.

[12:27] Uh-huh.

[12:28] And I remember, um, I can't remember his name.

[12:31] He was a designer from Valley.

[12:35] He has recently passed away.

[12:37] His name escapes me at the moment, but I remember he teased me about that newer, skinnier bat

[12:42] that I designed for Gottlieb.

[12:44] He called him, he says, why'd you put the name of a company on him?

[12:47] He goes, you know, and that was what I was told to do.

[12:50] But, um, he called him, he didn't call him flippers, he called him, the Gottlieb's.

[12:54] Huh.

[12:55] Now, what, what was the advantage to these new skinny boy flippers?

[13:01] They were styled a little closer to what the data east and Williams flipper was.

[13:07] Uh, they eventually went to 50 volts with the, you know, with the system.

[13:11] Right.

[13:12] Um, they wanted to make them look a little more like a data east slash Williams flipper,

[13:16] but they didn't want to carry them.

[13:18] Right.

[13:19] So, you mean it was mostly an aesthetic change?

[13:21] Yes.

[13:22] Uh-huh.

[13:23] But the mechanics changed, too, right?

[13:25] Yeah, the mechanics changed, too.

[13:27] And you redesigned the mechanics, too?

[13:29] Yes.

[13:30] Okay, now what typo, I mean, because those Gottlieb flippers, they do have a different

[13:35] feel than the Williams and the data east ones.

[13:38] I mean, was that on purpose?

[13:41] Uh, no, that's just the way it came out.

[13:43] And, uh, you know, Gottlieb approved the unit and they liked it, you know, better than

[13:47] the old one and just decided to go into production with it.

[13:50] And they were happy with it at that point.

[13:53] Okay.

[13:53] So now you're over at data east and you're basically doing the similar type of work there?

[13:59] Yes.

[14:00] Same thing.

[14:01] Mechanical engineer slash draftsman.

[14:03] When I first started the work there, Joe Camichot, I worked in Joe Camichot's office

[14:09] with him because they didn't have any room for me at the time.

[14:12] We're in a pretty small facility.

[14:14] So I sat in Joe Camichot's office and worked with him.

[14:19] So that was pretty interesting.

[14:20] Uh, the first thing that I worked on with, uh, with Joe, he was going to license a game,

[14:28] uh, a theme called Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, which later became Jurassic Park.

[14:33] So what I did was I was designing a, he just kind of let me run free.

[14:38] He wanted me to design a dinosaur that, uh, that ate a pinball.

[14:44] So I designed a dinosaur that moved back and forth and I put a magnet in the back of

[14:51] its mouth.

[14:51] I actually used a Godzilla model.

[14:54] It was probably about a foot tall at the time, uh, cut it down and I made a little

[14:59] sound. We actually still have it.

[15:01] Um, I put a magnet in the back of its mouth so it could pick a ball up in its mouth.

[15:05] Uh, it rotated back and forth and it bent over, picked up a ball with a magnet and

[15:12] then it moved over and deposited into a different area.

[15:14] And then another feature was I made the arms throw pinballs, which later came,

[15:20] um, came out on the Frankenstein pinball.

[15:24] It was like a feature that was, uh, from the Jurassic Park dinosaur originally.

[15:29] And I used it in a later game.

[15:32] Now, did Joe know at the time that he was getting Jurassic Park or is it just how it worked out?

[15:36] He didn't, um, he didn't, but probably, maybe about a year after I started there,

[15:45] he had been talking to Spielberg and he took the hook license to get the Jurassic Park

[15:51] license.

[15:52] Oh, you mean he didn't really want hook?

[15:56] Uh, no, not necessarily.

[15:58] Hmm.

[15:59] I never really liked that game much.

[16:02] He took hook to get, uh, to get to, uh, Jurassic Park and hook actually turned out to be a really good game.

[16:10] I don't, I never really liked it, you know, no, uh, the hook, hook, hook thing irritates me.

[16:17] Uh, you know, it's mostly the voice calls more than, than,

[16:21] than any other, than, you know, than the gameplay or anything else, but the voice just gets to me after a little while.

[16:27] Yeah, we didn't get license, we didn't get, uh, uh, likenesses of Robin Williams.

[16:32] Um, you know, so it was kind of a, you know, a generic Peter Pan game, if you will, but, you know, had a, you know,

[16:40] a nice big, squirrely ramp with the chaser lights on it and then had the ramp on the right side with the clock, the crack clock.

[16:47] And, um, I was actually kind of surprised it turned out as well as it did and sold as well as it did.

[16:54] Were you responsible for the chaser lights?

[16:57] No, uh, Tim Seckle.

[16:59] That was, that was his baby.

[17:01] Yeah, because they use that in the Star Trek next gen or earn not next gen.

[17:04] Star Trek, uh, 25 Star Trek, uh, huh?

[17:07] Right, right, right.

[17:08] Yes.

[17:09] Now, why couldn't they get Robin Williams to do voiceovers for that?

[17:13] Um, I don't know if they didn't get his light, his likeness either.

[17:17] Um, I do not remember the story, the exact story behind that.

[17:21] Um, and the name of those, the girl, which I should know what that escapes me to.

[17:26] She was Tinkerbell and hook, uh, Julia Roberts.

[17:30] Right.

[17:30] They didn't have her likeness either.

[17:32] Right.

[17:34] Right.

[17:34] So Paul pretty much painted a generic, uh, looking, you know, Peter Panish backlash.

[17:43] Right.

[17:44] Right.

[17:45] Well, so now what was all of these games that you did in the mechanical, you know,

[17:49] engineering and the dry, you know, the designs and the drawings on, what's the one that you're most proud of?

[17:55] Um, I would have to say, uh, Star Wars.

[17:58] Um, but you're the game designer for Star Wars, too, aren't you?

[18:02] Yes.

[18:02] Yes.

[18:03] Uh, huh?

[18:03] No, uh, that was probably my favorite game, um, you know, back in the day.

[18:11] Well, you know, I got to say this that as far as game designers go, you have to be either the nicest guy in the world or the luckiest guy in the world because man, did, did you get all the good ones?

[18:24] I mean, you got Star Wars, you got Jurassic Park, you got Tales from the Crip, you got Guns and Roses, you got a pile of 13.

[18:32] I mean, I mean, you got Harley Davidson and Austin Powers and now you have your, your latest game.

[18:39] Um, I mean, you're like, you got to have like Pat Lawler hitting his head against the desk.

[18:47] You know, um, yeah, probably, probably.

[18:53] Um, yeah, I really kind of lucked out, um, getting the Indie license and it's kind of ironic because my first game, which was Star Wars, you know, was a, you know, a Harrison Ford,

[19:04] you know, Harrison Ford was in Star Wars, Harrison Ford's in Indiana Jones.

[19:08] Um, so and then this is my first game in seven years.

[19:12] So, you know, it's kind of ironic that I start out again with a, you know, with a Harrison Ford quote unquote license.

[19:19] So, uh, pretty interesting.

[19:23] I'm really, really happy about it.

[19:24] I was really glad to get the title.

[19:26] Well, now how did you get Star Wars?

[19:28] I mean, how did you get that that?

[19:30] I mean, that is very interesting.

[19:32] When I started on my first game, which was Star Wars, it was actually Jurassic Park.

[19:39] And in the place of where the death star is in the game was where I had my ball eating and ball tossing dinosaur.

[19:49] So I had that laid out in the game.

[19:51] Um, then I had a ramp laid out and, uh, some ball scoops and upkickers and whatnot.

[19:58] And then I would think I had worked on it for probably three, three, four months.

[20:03] And then Joe told me that I was going to trade off and the Jurassic Park license wasn't going to happen.

[20:11] And I was going to do Star Wars instead.

[20:13] So I turned my Jurassic Park layout into Star Wars.

[20:20] Now, did you design on the apps that side of the play field?

[20:23] And that's where I decided to put the R2D to model.

[20:26] Yeah. And that's what I was going to say.

[20:27] Did you, did you design it?

[20:29] Are that bobbing turning RT?

[20:33] Yeah, originally it tilted back and forth.

[20:35] There were two coils that pulled the left side down and the right side down.

[20:40] Okay.

[20:40] We ended up cost cutting it and just pulled it down from the center.

[20:44] Now, how, how perfect display effect of R2D to moving?

[20:47] You know, he tilted left and right.

[20:49] Mm-hmm.

[20:49] Right.

[20:50] And we ended up not changing that for production.

[20:53] And we ended up changing the unit to just operate off of one coil.

[20:58] Right.

[20:58] So that would just, you know, bounce up and down from the center point.

[21:01] Now, how much cost cutting was there and like, say, got leap compared to data ease when you, when you design something?

[21:08] Um, the got leap games, they seem to, uh, they seem to, you know, design, uh, you know, allow their bill material.

[21:20] Um, and they seem to always, you know, pretty much hit.

[21:24] We didn't do a whole lot of cost cutting at Gallaudet.

[21:26] They were, they were pretty much designed and built and a few things taken out here and there.

[21:32] But, um, not quite as drastic as data east.

[21:37] Um, you know, data east, we used to just go crazy and then we'd find out what the game cost.

[21:43] And if it was just way over budget, we had to, you know, we were always scrambling at the last minute to try to, you know,

[21:49] pull money out or do something here or there to, you know, get the game to our cost.

[21:55] Well, when you say pull money out, the bill material was a little smaller at Gallaudet.

[21:59] It was a data east.

[22:00] Well, when you say pull money out, I mean, typically like if you were over budget on something, are we talking like $5, $10?

[22:06] Are we talking like $50?

[22:08] Oh, probably more like $50.

[22:11] Yeah.

[22:12] So you really did shoot high then.

[22:13] 13 is a good example.

[22:15] Um, I designed a unit.

[22:17] When you look at the middle of a pile, 13 play field, there is a picture of the moon and the earth.

[22:23] Right.

[22:24] And those were counter rotating plate spinning platters.

[22:28] So we ended up yanking that out of a pile, 13 to get the game at cost.

[22:34] So there were actually, uh, and I have one of them.

[22:37] There were actually five or six play fields where we had those openings cut out there.

[22:42] We had those counter rotating units in place.

[22:47] And we cost cut that at the last minute before production.

[22:50] We sent those original five or six boards back had the holes plugged up and then had them re screened.

[22:57] Huh.

[22:59] And did you end up using them put the play field up and you look at the bottom.

[23:03] You can see where they patched in the earth and the moon.

[23:09] What would now that was like a fireball or what?

[23:12] A whirlwind type thing, right?

[23:14] Yes.

[23:15] Right.

[23:16] Right.

[23:16] And how did that affect the gameplay?

[23:19] Um, not too much really.

[23:22] Not too much.

[23:24] You know, the ball with the counter rotating moon, the moon was rather small.

[23:29] So you got a lot of ball spin off of the earth, which was larger, but the moon really didn't do much because it was such a small diameter.

[23:37] Right.

[23:39] But really not too much.

[23:43] Okay.

[23:43] So now you after Star Wars, you ended up, or by the way, did you meet any of the the cast or characters of Star Wars?

[23:51] Um, I get to meet George Lucas.

[23:54] I passed up.

[23:55] I'm going to my 10 year reunion for high school to go out to Skywalker Ranch and tour the ranch and meet George Lucas.

[24:05] So that was a pretty, that was a pretty easy trade off.

[24:07] So why did you go out even after meet anybody?

[24:11] We went out to present the game to him.

[24:16] So we, uh, we had the opportunity.

[24:18] I think it was learning, uh, Neil Falconer, uh, who programmed Star Wars, Joel, myself and a couple other people.

[24:29] Uh, Marcus Rothgren, the artist.

[24:32] We all got to go out there and we got to actually present the game to George Lucas.

[24:37] What was his reaction?

[24:39] Oh, he really liked it.

[24:40] And he's, uh, he was pretty nonchalant about it.

[24:43] He walked in and we talked with him for a little while.

[24:46] You know, we demonstrated the game and he walked off and I thought, well, you know, he wasn't jumping up and down or anything.

[24:52] But when after he left, his people told us that that was a great reaction from George, that he was very pleased.

[25:00] So,

[25:01] I'm sure George Lucas has, uh, you know, every day he probably has, uh, you know, quite a few things to look at.

[25:09] Um, but, you know, the Star Wars package was so good.

[25:14] You know, there wasn't much to not like about it.

[25:18] You know, the display effects were great, but, you know, the play field played nice.

[25:22] Um, and it was a good looking game.

[25:25] Yeah, it sold really well.

[25:26] It sold over 10,000 units in ball with us.

[25:29] Pardon me?

[25:30] That was Marcus Rothkran's first art package with the data east.

[25:35] Oh, okay.

[25:37] And he did quite a few with us after that.

[25:40] Now, after that, you did get Jurassic Park.

[25:43] How did that come about?

[25:45] Um, yeah, we did eventually get Jurassic Park.

[25:50] And, uh, Ed Sibula.

[25:54] Ed Sibula did the, you know, the main portion of a layout on that game.

[25:58] And then, uh, Joe Balls are in myself, uh, helped him with mechanics on it.

[26:03] Hmm.

[26:04] Now, your dinosaur morphed.

[26:06] You didn't weren't using the magnet or the throwing arms.

[26:08] Oh, how, tell me about that.

[26:10] Right.

[26:10] Yeah, that would be unit then at that time.

[26:13] Um, we were a little bit behind the gun at time.

[26:17] And, uh, we were working with a company called Partech.

[26:20] And they did most of the design for the dinosaur unit.

[26:24] Hmm.

[26:25] That came out pretty good, though.

[26:26] Our mechanical assemblies at the time.

[26:28] Right.

[26:28] And, uh, and they actually did the mechanics for the dinosaur unit itself with, uh, you know, with Ed Sibula.

[26:36] But that dinosaur came out really well.

[26:39] Yeah, I did.

[26:40] And, you know, the only problem that we had with it early on was, uh, the center switch that aligned it with the hole that it picked the ball about of.

[26:49] Um, sometimes the unit would, uh, would tear off the actuator.

[26:56] And there was a simple solution to that.

[26:58] And, uh, I wish we would have, uh, discovered it a little sooner.

[27:02] Hmm.

[27:04] Now, what was the next game that you really got pulled people still talk about it a lot this day?

[27:10] Yeah, great, great game.

[27:11] Similar to it, you know, in the future.

[27:14] Yeah, I mean, the whole Jurassic Park, I mean, you really nailed that theme great.

[27:18] Oh, yeah.

[27:18] And the multi ball was great in the chaos mode was great.

[27:23] Uh, had a nice cast gun on the machine and the smart missile was, uh, that was, uh, uh, Joe Canico idea.

[27:32] The smart missile would help you knock out one of the chaos letters while you were trying to get to your super jackpot.

[27:38] And, uh, it was a all around great game.

[27:42] Yeah, I agree.

[27:42] Nice package.

[27:44] So what was the next game that you got, you know, full control over?

[27:49] Let's see.

[27:50] Um, last action.

[27:52] Star Wars tails from the crypt.

[27:54] But what did you do on last action hero?

[27:57] Um, I designed the crane unit.

[28:00] Uh, and that was about it on that game.

[28:05] So you were still doing a lot of mechanics, even though in not necessarily a lot of game design.

[28:10] Everybody with their games in between my games.

[28:14] Gotcha.

[28:14] So, you know, I did all the mechanics with Timmy, uh, Tim Sekel on hook.

[28:21] Um, I worked on Batman and I worked on Star Trek and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[28:27] Um, Batman forever.

[28:30] Uh, quite a few of them.

[28:34] So I got my hand when I wasn't working on my own game.

[28:36] I was helping somebody else with a ramp or a mechanical device or something on their game.

[28:41] So I was, I was very busy.

[28:44] Right.

[28:45] Now what did tell me about tails from the crypt?

[28:48] Um, tails from the crypt, uh, let's see.

[28:52] Started out, um, with the 180 ramp on the right side was actually a lot longer.

[29:00] Uh, didn't have such a small opening.

[29:01] We ended up adding another shot to start multi-ball next to it, which shrunk it up a little bit.

[29:07] And I just actually read something recently on the internet.

[29:11] Some guy had come in and I shot the, uh, the 180 vertical ramp ten times in a row without it dropping into the little, uh,

[29:21] what do they call it?

[29:23] They called it the cow catcher or something like that.

[29:25] If the, if the ball went around the 180 ramp it didn't quite make it.

[29:28] It would drop down and feed into the other wire ramp.

[29:30] Right.

[29:31] And return it to the right flipper.

[29:32] But I got ten shots in a row.

[29:34] And the 180 ramp brought the ball to the right flipper.

[29:38] And then I would pass it over to the left flipper and then shoot the right ramp, the 180 ramp again.

[29:43] And I got ten shots in a row and somebody had sent me this email that somebody had written.

[29:47] It was quite a few years ago.

[29:49] They were, uh, digging on the internet and they found this, this article and they sent it to me.

[29:55] And I actually remembered it.

[29:57] So, and that was, uh, 1993, 1994 I think when, when, when Crypt came off.

[30:03] Right.

[30:04] Uh, John Casseur.

[30:07] Uh, I had lived a lot of the speech for the game.

[30:10] You know, the no-pay, no-game.

[30:12] And, uh, the hack pot and he, uh, you know, he took our speech list and he took it to New Heights.

[30:19] So that was a lot of fun.

[30:21] And then I remember, uh, the door handle on the game, which was how you shot the ball into play.

[30:26] Right.

[30:27] I, uh, just had this idea.

[30:30] I wanted to, I wanted to do a, a mystery door feature where you would, uh, see,

[30:36] three doors come into the display and you, you pick a door with your flipper and then you would actually

[30:43] activate it and open a door with a door handle and that ended up being the shooter for the game.

[30:49] And so they have a plunger or a fire button.

[30:51] It was a door handle and then we molded the crypt keepers head to go over it.

[30:55] So, uh, the, uh, the lever where you pushed the door handle down was actually his tongue.

[31:00] Started mucking it up, Camaco.

[31:02] So, you are out of your mind.

[31:04] What, what is the cost on that to get stuff like that done?

[31:08] Um, you know, the door handle was actually purchased from a company called QuickSet,

[31:14] which if you look at your own door handle on your own house, uh, the 50% chance of the QuickSet.

[31:20] Right.

[31:21] So that was actually purchased item.

[31:23] Uh, I think the first one we got from, uh, you know, on the Nards or Home Depot.

[31:28] And then we just molded the, uh, the head for it.

[31:32] We casted the first bunch and then we did an injection mold for it.

[31:37] It's the purpose of production.

[31:38] So, for production, it isn't actually a QuickSet, is it?

[31:42] Yes.

[31:43] Really?

[31:44] Yes.

[31:45] If your door handle broke, you could go to a hardware store and you could replace it with another one.

[31:49] Ha, ha.

[31:50] Isn't that sound?

[31:52] Yeah.

[31:53] Now, how often does that happen in game design?

[31:55] At game.

[31:56] We were bringing in door handles from QuickSet and we were throwing up a knob that went on the opposite set.

[32:04] And I'm sure our dumpster at the end of the day was full of them.

[32:08] So, it was an actual, you know, genuine QuickSet door handle.

[32:13] You know, we didn't manufacture it.

[32:15] We didn't make it.

[32:16] Uh, they did it for us.

[32:18] How often did things like that happen?

[32:21] Uh, once in a blue moon.

[32:24] Not very often.

[32:25] Generally, you know, if we do a custom part like that, it's, you know, like a gun, for instance.

[32:31] You know, we worked with Hap controls on a lot of those assemblies and they were casted.

[32:37] And some of them were, you know, made in China.

[32:42] The die castings.

[32:46] So, you know, generally, it was a custom part.

[32:49] We went through, we worked with Hap to produce it.

[32:53] But generally, you know, we didn't buy many parts from QuickSet.

[32:59] Well, how many, like, yeah, how many parts would actually come from like, you know, little toy trinkets and stuff like that?

[33:08] Back then, hardly any.

[33:10] We didn't really put, you know, like, you know, in today's world, we're, you know, we're purchasing a lot of toys from companies.

[33:21] And then in the, probably the mid-90s, I think it was like after Twister, we met Dave Link from Evolution Studios.

[33:30] And he's here in the Chicago area.

[33:32] And he did some really nice sculpting work for us.

[33:35] And, and actually still does.

[33:37] And he actually did the sculpture for the arc of the covenant that's on Indygame today.

[33:45] So, we still work with Dave.

[33:47] But we met Dave and, you know, we saw some of his work and, you know, we had to have him work with us.

[33:55] So, like the RT...

[33:57] We would have met him before we did Twister because we did that big canister on the Twister game that held the balls, that locked the balls from all to ball.

[34:05] And it was just a really rough cast of things with some decals on it.

[34:09] And if we would have had Dave do that part, it would have looked a lot more realistic.

[34:13] Now, what about the RT-D2? Was that custom made for you guys?

[34:18] That was injection molded.

[34:20] And we just put a decal on it to make it look like RT-D2.

[34:25] The original one that I did for that, Kurt Anderson, which was one of the artists, he made the...

[34:33] He just gave me a flat of what RT-D2 looked like, you know, from the head down.

[34:40] And I just took a piece of buteret and added some holes and heated it up with a heat gun into a half circle.

[34:47] And that's where that came from.

[34:50] And then we decided that we were doing pretty good numbers back then.

[34:54] So we made up an injection molded part for the body itself.

[34:59] And the head.

[35:01] And the head was a two-piece mold.

[35:04] The blue insert on the inside was one.

[35:06] And then the chrome outer piece was a little separate tool.

[35:11] Is that stuff pretty expensive?

[35:14] Yes.

[35:16] So you've got to have the numbers in production to do that.

[35:20] Pardon me?

[35:21] Especially if you do it in the States, it's more expensive.

[35:24] Right.

[35:25] But a lot of our injection molded pieces are coming out of China today.

[35:29] And they're a little more economical.

[35:32] So that's better for us right now.

[35:34] Because the more we can put in the game, the merrier.

[35:38] Right.

[35:39] Now what was your involvement with guns and roses?

[35:43] Slash actually contacted us for the guns and roses license.

[35:50] Slash was really into pinball.

[35:52] He has probably about 20, 25 games throughout his house.

[35:56] And he actually contacted us about the license for guns.

[36:01] And while we were working on the game, he came out to a date east

[36:06] and spent a couple of evenings with us.

[36:08] And we were sketching things together and talking

[36:11] and trying to get a feel for what he wanted to see on the game.

[36:17] I remember the second time Joe and I went out to his house in L.A.

[36:22] and we got to see his house and his pinball machine collection.

[36:26] And then there's an interesting story there, too.

[36:30] It was right after the earthquake in 93 in L.A.

[36:34] And Joe and I were at his house.

[36:36] And the slash had a pet cougar named Curtis.

[36:40] It was about, maybe about six, seven months old,

[36:44] about the size of a German shepherd.

[36:46] And he was just walking around the house, like a house cat.

[36:50] And he walked alongside of me and rushed up against me like a house cat.

[36:55] So I started to pet him.

[36:57] And so I squat down next to him, that was pet him.

[37:00] He laid down on the side and rolled over and was back like a dog.

[37:04] So I started to pet his stomach.

[37:07] Don't ever pet a cougar on his stomach.

[37:10] Before I knew it, his paw came up around the back of my neck.

[37:15] And that cat flipped me upside down and was on top of me with his jaw on my neck within seconds.

[37:23] I just froze.

[37:25] I didn't try to fight it or pull away or push him off or anything.

[37:28] I just laid there because I knew that if I did anything, I'd probably have been over.

[37:33] So if you ever get a chance to pet a cougar, don't pet him on the belly.

[37:38] Okay, so the slash has a pet cougar and is the thing full grown now?

[37:43] I don't think he has it anymore.

[37:45] I would be pretty certain that he probably had given it to a zoo

[37:50] or something like that.

[37:53] Because I'm sure that as he got to be about a year old, you know,

[37:56] instincts take over and I'm sure that by that time he had gotten pretty big.

[38:01] So my best guess would be that he probably doesn't have him anymore.

[38:06] And what was Joe Camaco's reaction and Slash's reaction when the cougar did this to you?

[38:12] I think Joe just about had a heart attack

[38:18] and Slash just yelled at Curtis and said, get off.

[38:22] Like he was a dog or something.

[38:24] And he did.

[38:26] He just told me to go get off Curtis.

[38:29] And then that was the end of it.

[38:31] I got up and I caught my breath and I was like, okay, that just happened.

[38:36] So that'll be something that I will never forget for the rest of my life.

[38:40] That was an interesting deal.

[38:45] Did he say after the fact that's a bad idea?

[38:49] Don't pet their stomach.

[38:51] He really didn't say anything after that.

[38:55] And even if he did, I probably wouldn't have remembered it

[38:58] because that was kind of a little bit of a shock at the time.

[39:04] But definitely a memorable experience.

[39:08] And I'll never pet a cougar on this belly again.

[39:11] Yeah, I would think maybe you should never pet a cougar again.

[39:15] What involvement did you have on the Guns and Roses design?

[39:21] What involvement did you have in Guns and Roses?

[39:25] Pretty much everything.

[39:28] I laid out the G&E R ramps and the whole play field.

[39:36] I left out a little sketch of different things that he wanted on the game.

[39:42] And one of them, which ended up in the game, was one of the snake pit.

[39:46] And then Guns and Roses, actually the first layout was a narrow game.

[39:51] Standard play field.

[39:53] And we ended up turning it into a wide body.

[39:56] And when I did that, instead of stretching out the whole game,

[40:01] I just added the snake pit ramp, the green ramp to the left side with a little bowl up at the top.

[40:08] And then I added the rose plunger to the left side of a cabinet.

[40:13] So I actually lucked out.

[40:15] There were a couple of games that one of them went from a wide to a narrow.

[40:19] And then mine was one of the games that went from a narrow starting out on paper to a wide body game.

[40:26] So I lucked out.

[40:28] I just added the extra lane to the one side and the little bowl ramp and made it feed into the orbit shot.

[40:35] Now what was the thinking behind Guns and Ramp?

[40:38] What was the thinking to go from a narrow to a wide body game?

[40:43] At the time, Williams had come out with, I think it was Twilight Zone.

[40:50] I believe.

[40:53] And so we wanted to try a wide body game as well.

[40:56] So I guess, more or less, you could say we followed our competition.

[41:02] You know, Zenith makes a 36-inch tube or a 50-inch wide screen.

[41:09] You know, Sony's got to go that way or what not.

[41:15] So we were just kind of, I guess we were following our competition.

[41:19] And so I was in the middle of the layout with Guns and Roses and they said,

[41:24] we're going to make a wide body game out of it.

[41:26] And I was like, all right, you know, the more room the merrier, you know, as far as I'm concerned.

[41:31] How much did a wide body cost for billi-materials compared to a standard?

[41:37] Our bond really didn't increase.

[41:40] We just had to kind of spread out our money a little better.

[41:44] You know, the cabinet was probably just a little bit more expensive.

[41:47] The back box was the same, you know, the same size as a standard.

[41:53] And then I guess, you know, we more or less had to spread the parts over a larger area.

[41:59] But I don't think our cost was any different.

[42:02] I think it stayed the same.

[42:05] Now, on the shooter lane ramp, what was the reasoning for not putting a switch at the very top end of that ramp?

[42:12] You know, sometimes where you get that problem, where you get multiple balls stacking up,

[42:17] and they can't get the balls all the way up the ramp?

[42:20] Yes, we actually made a different ramp that delivered the ball and stood into the top lanes,

[42:26] just went up and over and fed it into the orbit lane.

[42:30] Because we had problems getting balls out of that ramp.

[42:35] Originally, there was a lock ball unit all the way up into the area where the ball fed into the top lanes.

[42:42] And I was actually locking six balls up there.

[42:46] The up kicker that was over on the right, it was another shot where you collected your band members.

[42:54] That area was going to be...

[42:58] You were going to make that same shot to collect your band members,

[43:01] but the ball was shooting up and feeding into the other wire ramp.

[43:05] And they were actually locking up there in a mechanism.

[43:09] But we ended up pulling that out at the end.

[43:12] That was a cost cut.

[43:15] So that unit ended up coming out.

[43:17] Why would they just put a switch at the top of that lane, though,

[43:20] so it didn't have like two balls in the shooter lane trying to get them up?

[43:26] That would have been a good idea.

[43:29] But it was like Guns and Roses.

[43:32] I think I did Guns and Roses in four months,

[43:36] where generally a designer would have six, eight, and months, a year to do a game.

[43:43] Guns and Roses came up and it was in production pretty quick.

[43:49] But yes, the second switch in the shooter lane would have been a great idea.

[43:54] Or maybe even a software change, where if a ball got into the shooter lane

[43:58] and kicked up the ramp and didn't make it, you'd wait a little while

[44:02] and initialize multiple a little slower.

[44:05] But if you got a ball in the ramp and it didn't make it,

[44:09] don't send a second ball into the shooter lane.

[44:13] Or a third or a fourth.

[44:16] That could have been controlled with software, too.

[44:19] Yeah, because they stack up in there and then the game's hopelessly.

[44:23] Yeah, and that's a really strong coil kicking those balls through that ramp.

[44:26] What would have been even better is that that wire ramp was a vacuum form ramp.

[44:30] So there wasn't so much drag on the ball itself.

[44:34] And we were kicking that ball up pretty high all the way to the back of the game.

[44:38] So that was kind of risky.

[44:41] Now why did you go with a wire form versus a vacuum form?

[44:46] You know what? I can't even answer that question.

[44:49] I don't know.

[44:51] But it started out as a wire and by the time we had a problem with it,

[44:59] we were at production.

[45:02] So instead of going and redesigning and making a big tool for a vacuum form ramp there,

[45:08] we just ended up making a shorter ramp.

[45:11] So the ball didn't have to travel as far.

[45:13] Change the plating, too, right?

[45:16] Yeah, it was powder coated.

[45:18] So you changed it to chrome to make it smoother.

[45:21] And then we ended up going, we changed it to chrome because it seemed like the ball,

[45:26] instead of the ball seemed to be able to skid and slide better on the chrome plated ramp

[45:33] than the powder coated ramp.

[45:36] Right. So that actually helped, too.

[45:39] Cool game, though. I mean, I think that was a really well done.

[45:43] Yeah, it is a good game.

[45:45] And actually their resale value is really good right now.

[45:48] Yeah.

[45:49] And I wish I would have had a little more time to play with all my games.

[45:54] They all seemed to star wars.

[45:56] I had a lot of time on in the very beginning.

[45:59] And it seemed like after that, it was four months, five months.

[46:04] Twister came up really fast, too.

[46:07] And I got lucky that Twister came out as well as it did.

[46:11] But that game came up really fast, too.

[46:13] I think I spent four months on that game.

[46:15] Well, now the next one you did after this looks like was Frankenstein, right?

[46:19] Yeah.

[46:20] Okay, tell me about that game a little.

[46:23] Frankenstein, I got a script for Frankenstein and read it.

[46:28] And I was having a little bit of a problem,

[46:31] picturing Robert De Niro as the monster, as the creature.

[46:35] Yeah.

[46:36] And I liked the story.

[46:38] I thought it was really good.

[46:40] And I was looking for, you know, I was trying to think of a really good mechanism to put in the game.

[46:47] And then the creature itself.

[46:50] And then I brought back that old ball tossing feature from Jurassic Park,

[46:58] the Jurassic Park dinosaur that I originally designed when I started there.

[47:04] And that worked out pretty well.

[47:06] And actually that was another unit that had a little cost going,

[47:09] because it originally, I made the head rotate back and forth with a servo motor,

[47:15] like on a remote control car.

[47:18] And the unit had a DC motor that actually turned the whole unit.

[47:23] So the whole creature, you know, arms body had an all with turn to the left,

[47:28] and then you could turn the head all over the right.

[47:30] And it was, you know, a little bit more animated.

[47:32] But we ended up removing that prior to production as a cost savings.

[47:36] And then it was kind of like a safety too,

[47:40] because we were worried about registering the arms with the little shoots that fed the ball into the hands.

[47:45] So it was probably a, you know, a little safer thing to do.

[47:50] And, you know, we had to find a little money in the game too.

[47:54] And then, you know, following that,

[47:57] the dot matrix was costing us probably about $60 a game more than the standard size one that we used today.

[48:06] So, you know, head, we had the small dot matrix at that time.

[48:11] We might have had that part of the mechanical unit in for the creature.

[48:15] Now, how did you feel about the large dot matrix?

[48:18] I love it.

[48:20] The, you know, the display, you know, when you digitize, especially now,

[48:24] if we, you know, digitize a scene from a movie,

[48:28] you just get to see so much more of it.

[48:33] You know, really large images will show up better.

[48:36] You know, you don't have to worry about, remember the really early dot matrix?

[48:41] The really small one.

[48:42] Right.

[48:43] The size of the standard one.

[48:44] Yeah, like, look, we would show a face and we would have to, you know, scroll the image down.

[48:49] So you could see exactly what you were looking at.

[48:51] Right.

[48:52] You could see like the eyes and the top of the head and then you'd scroll it up and you, you know,

[48:57] oh, that was a face, you know.

[48:59] So, but I really like the large dot matrix.

[49:01] I, you know, I wish we could get it back, but it's expensive.

[49:05] Yeah.

[49:06] Yeah.

[49:07] Yeah, a lot of money.

[49:09] Yeah.

[49:10] And I probably drove the probe.

[49:11] The D screen would be nice and, you know, who knows, maybe in the future, you know,

[49:15] if they start to come down a little bit, you know, that may be the next generation.

[49:19] Yeah, but then you got a lot more programming, right?

[49:22] A lot more programming, yes.

[49:24] Right.

[49:25] Right.

[49:26] Which means more time, which means more money.

[49:28] Yep.

[49:29] More employees.

[49:30] Yeah.

[49:31] So, you never know.

[49:32] All right, we're going to take a little break from talking with John Borg, the game designer,

[49:36] and we'll be right back after this message.

[49:38] Deep in the forest of Eastern Canada, you will find something, well, ground breaking.

[49:45] And something that's very, very pinball, but something that's really, really small.

[49:52] Presenting classic Playfield reproductions.

[49:56] Two guys in their basement.

[49:59] We've got the passion.

[50:01] We've got the gear, and we've got the quality.

[50:04] Doing our very best to remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts.

[50:09] Classic Playfield reproductions.

[50:13] Playfields.

[50:16] Backlasses.

[50:18] Plastic sets.

[50:22] On the web at classicplayfields.com.

[50:26] This portion of Topcast is brought to you by Pin Game Journal.

[50:30] Covering the world of pinball.

[50:32] Is them online at www.pingamejournal.com.

[50:36] All right, we're back with John Borg and more of his design stories.

[50:41] Were you pretty happy with the Frankenstein and how he turned out?

[50:44] Yeah, yeah.

[50:46] Now, the next part was Apollo 13.

[50:49] Now, that is a killer game.

[50:51] Yes, yes, and I still have mine.

[50:55] And I really love that game.

[50:57] I actually got to meet Jim Levol.

[50:59] And we actually presented him.

[51:01] We took his game to his house set up in his basement and demonstrated it for him.

[51:06] He signed backlasses and rockets for a few of us.

[51:11] So I did, Joe Pauls were handled the main layout for the game.

[51:18] Robert Toddle assisted him with it.

[51:21] And then I did all the toys.

[51:23] I designed the rocket and the moon unit.

[51:28] And then the double spinning disc that I talked about earlier.

[51:32] The counter rotating earth and moon, which ended up getting me inked out at the end.

[51:37] In the ball load for the 13 ball, multi ball, it's in the upper left hand corner that's your design too.

[51:43] No, that ball is your design.

[51:45] Okay.

[51:46] Yeah, I was going to ask you why they used those membrane switches for that.

[51:50] You know, I think it was a real estate problem.

[51:53] And it would have been nice if we would have had aptos up there.

[51:57] But we weren't really using them very much if at all, at that point.

[52:01] Right.

[52:02] I think the only place at that time we used an apto was maybe in the...

[52:07] the trough, the out-hole trough.

[52:11] Yeah, the first state of East Game with aptos was that western game, I...

[52:16] with all the drop targets, forget the name.

[52:18] Maverick.

[52:19] Yeah, Maverick.

[52:20] Yes, uh-huh.

[52:21] Yeah.

[52:22] Which was probably only a couple games before Apollo 13.

[52:25] Yeah, you know, the membrane switches, they're actually in twist or two.

[52:29] And, you know, like in my home games, I've never had any problems with them.

[52:34] But I hear that they do wear out and eventually have to be replaced.

[52:37] And when you have to replace them, you know, they're, they have an adhesive on the bottom.

[52:42] Right.

[52:43] You have to, you know, it's probably quite a job to get them off.

[52:46] You know, you probably have to tear them off.

[52:48] And then we've got to take mineral spirits and clean all the, you know, all the adhesive off.

[52:53] Yeah.

[52:54] And then we place them.

[52:55] Yeah, I had to replace them on my game.

[52:58] Yeah.

[52:59] Yeah, you can replace them, uh-huh.

[53:00] Yeah, because a couple of the switches, um, couple of switches didn't work.

[53:04] And it kind of, it confuses the game if a couple of, you know, you'll have, you know, whatever it's ball, you know, uh-7 through 13.

[53:12] And if ball number 9 and 10 don't work, the game kind of gets whacked out.

[53:16] Uh-huh.

[53:17] Yeah, sure.

[53:18] So.

[53:19] Yeah, I worked on somebody else's game recently that they had a similar problem.

[53:22] I mean, the game will still work, but it just, it gets, um,

[53:26] takes longer for it to load that mechanism and understand that all the balls are there.

[53:31] Uh-huh.

[53:32] Uh-huh.

[53:33] It figures it out eventually because, you know, if, if seven isn't working in, in six and eight are, you know, it kind of guesstimate.

[53:39] Yeah.

[53:40] Yeah, it figures that if, you know, two are there and then two are missing and then the next one's there that, you know, that the two switches that aren't working, there has to be a ball there.

[53:48] Right.

[53:49] Yeah.

[53:50] Yeah.

[53:51] So how was it to replace that?

[53:53] Did you have to, you know, was it easy to tear off or, it was, paint scraper to it or, yeah, I think I actually used a razor blade to be honest with you.

[54:03] Um, yeah, and you're right, you gotta get it off and you gotta get all the heats of off and then you gotta stick the new one down and make sure you stick it in the right place.

[54:10] And, uh, yeah, it's a, it's a little stressful.

[54:13] Really good for getting that glue off.

[54:15] Right, right.

[54:16] Yeah.

[54:17] Yeah, but I mean it worked out on the end, but those switches are expensive now.

[54:21] Yeah.

[54:22] I don't know what the replacement cost is on those, but, um, I know that they, you know, like if we go back and have to make them for, you know, part sales, you know, we buy in a small quantity, they are pretty expensive.

[54:35] Right.

[54:36] So, yeah.

[54:39] All right, so then you did the twister.

[54:41] What, what was your involvement in the twister?

[54:43] Um, twister, um, that was another game that came up quick.

[54:48] I didn't have any time to change it, um, but it came out pretty well, shot pretty well.

[54:55] And then I received a pen on the, uh, the magnetic spinning disc.

[55:00] Um, I wanted to do something different with, uh, you know, with a spinning platter.

[55:06] And I came up with the, you know, the idea of, you know, putting a magnet as a, as a center core.

[55:14] Right.

[55:15] Um, but of course, you know, I remember the, uh, the old days, the old got-lived days when they did Monte Carlo and they had the, uh, the roulette wheel and they had the little wiper board.

[55:26] Right.

[55:27] They had problems with, so I couldn't do anything like that with the magnet.

[55:31] Um, so I ended up keeping the magnet stationary and just running the core up through the center.

[55:36] So the magnet didn't have to spin with the unit.

[55:39] Right.

[55:40] And, uh, we actually got a patent on that.

[55:42] Huh.

[55:43] And that, that unit, uh, you know, worked pretty well.

[55:45] It was, it was pretty, pretty cool to watch.

[55:47] Especially when you got five balls on the platter.

[55:50] Now, how long would it take to get a patent?

[55:54] Um, now it takes probably a year and a half, two years before you actually receive it.

[56:00] After you send it out, um, I think back then it was probably about a year.

[56:05] Huh.

[56:06] Before it was actually, uh, before you actually receive word, you know, and, uh, you don't got to see how many claims, uh, you know, that you filed that were accepted.

[56:18] Right.

[56:19] Right.

[56:20] Now, you, you also had some involvement with Mini Viper, right?

[56:24] Yes.

[56:25] So what was, uh, what made out Mini Viper?

[56:28] They, uh, we built the game, uh, or in day program, we took it to a show and a couple of customers says,

[56:34] why didn't you guys make it, uh, a normal size game?

[56:38] We were just trying to, uh, make a smaller footprint for, uh, you know, a tavern owner.

[56:44] And, uh, they, you know, our customers, distributors, you know, were like, how can you didn't make it a normal size game?

[56:52] So, uh, it, you know, it ended up, you know, it ended up, uh, you know, being canned and, uh, a couple years later, uh, Robert Tato designed a full size Liper game.

[57:05] Now, was this, how much, uh, one that, uh, we made is, I think, the only one that we ever built.

[57:10] And, uh, I don't know who, I can, I can't think of the name of the person who bought it.

[57:16] But, cool, uh, but he did a few modifications to it and, uh, uh, and still has it.

[57:24] It's gonna, uh, in a stainless collection, I believe.

[57:27] Now, what, what was the, did Safe Cracker have a big influence on this?

[57:31] Uh, no, actually not.

[57:34] No? Did you guys even, you know, I mean, this came out of, I remember, I remember Safe Cracker.

[57:40] Uh, that was, that was, that was pretty interesting little project.

[57:44] Uh, that, that pet designed.

[57:46] Right.

[57:47] But it was about the same size as Mini Viper.

[57:50] Um, you know what? I, I actually, I don't remember.

[57:56] I don't remember what the dimensions of that play field where I thought that was a, I know it was smaller, but I thought Mini Viper was quite a bit smaller than it.

[58:04] Hm. Got it.

[58:06] And that was the only one that they ever made of that style, I believe.

[58:09] Right.

[58:10] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[58:13] Yeah, I didn't, you know, for whatever reason though it is really a cool game like you said, but yeah, they didn't take that any further.

[58:19] They were going to that was gonna be like a platform, but they just never progressed with it.

[58:23] Uh-huh.

[58:24] You know, but, all right, so then it looks like you did the, the lost world, you know, the second Jurassic Park game, right?

[58:31] Yes.

[58:32] Yeah.

[58:33] Tell me a little bit about that one.

[58:35] Back for a second to, uh, to Twister.

[58:38] Oh, sure.

[58:39] I was lucky enough to be able to go down and I got to go on a couple of the Twister sets.

[58:45] Um, I was able to meet Bill Paxon and they, uh, they, they, someone we got there, they sent us to a, they sent us to, um,

[58:56] a cafeteria that was, I could, they had purchased a, uh, a school or they were renting an old abandoned school or something like that.

[59:06] And, uh, they said, go to this building and, you know, Bill will meet you there at such and such a time.

[59:11] And Bill came walking into the cafeteria while Joe and I and Brian Schmidt were there singing pinball wizard.

[59:19] And then he grabbed us and took us out and we were walking around on a couple of the sets and we went over to Helen Hunt's trailer and they'll walked up to the trailer and he pounded on the door and she goes, who is it?

[59:31] And he goes, it's me Bill.

[59:32] He goes, the pinball guys are here and she opened up the door and she was in curlers getting ready for a set, getting ready for a take.

[59:40] So, uh, that was pretty, pretty exciting.

[59:43] So, I was able to, you know, I was able to meet Bill and, uh, and Helen.

[59:47] Were they, were they pretty, uh, pretty friendly?

[59:50] Oh, very. Yeah, both of them were.

[59:52] And were they into the pinball thing?

[59:54] It's your average run of them. They'll, you know, happy go lucky guy. He was, he was really nice.

[59:58] And were they into the pinball?

[01:00:00] We got to chat with Helen. You think that, you know, Helen being in curlers, she wouldn't want to sit and talk for a very long time but, uh, you know, we got to talk to her for a few minutes anyway.

[01:00:08] So, but yeah, they were both really nice people.

[01:00:11] And they like the pinball concept.

[01:00:13] Mm-hmm. Oh yeah.

[01:00:15] Okay. Interesting.

[01:00:17] Huh. Yeah, I, I was going to ask if you met Helen. She would be the one I'd want to meet compared to Bill.

[01:00:23] Yeah. Yeah. She was great.

[01:00:25] So, um, let's see, uh, where are we going next here?

[01:00:29] Oh, the Lost World.

[01:00:31] Oh, Lost World, yes.

[01:00:33] So, now, how did you feel about two of the second Jurassic Park game?

[01:00:36] Um, I was pretty excited about it.

[01:00:40] I wasn't as excited about the movie after I saw it.

[01:00:44] Um, but, uh, you know, I was glad to, you know, I was glad to get the title, you know, and go back and, you know, work with, uh, work with dinosaurs again.

[01:00:54] Right.

[01:00:55] So, and then, um, the, uh, the mechanical feature, the little truck that unfolded and picked up the ball and dumped it in the back.

[01:01:03] Right.

[01:01:04] That was, uh, that was built up a little bit more in the script than it was in the movie.

[01:01:09] I guess they had problems filming that or, you know, the special effects weren't really there yet.

[01:01:16] Um, so it ended up not being as big a part of the movie as it was, you know, an early script that I had read, you know, otherwise I probably would have had a different mechanical unit there.

[01:01:26] Huh.

[01:01:27] And, uh, we wanted to do something a little different than the original Jurassic Park.

[01:01:32] So, you know, hence there was no giant ball eating dinosaur.

[01:01:36] Right.

[01:01:37] Um, wasn't one of my favorite games.

[01:01:41] Now, when they, when you get a movie like this, do you get to see like an early version of it or do you just get a script?

[01:01:51] Um, sometimes I get a script, um, you know, sometimes I might go out and meet with licensing and, you know, be read like a, uh, a synapsis of the, you know, of the story.

[01:02:03] You know, maybe even sometimes like a slide presentation, you know, with a few clips of, you know, if you clip of the movie, you know, sets actors on the sets and whatnot.

[01:02:16] Um, but generally, you know, like back in the day, it was generally a script.

[01:02:21] It was a pretty hard to visualize.

[01:02:23] Imagination from there.

[01:02:24] Yeah, so was it hard to visualize this stuff from the script?

[01:02:28] Um, not too much.

[01:02:31] It wasn't too bad. It was, it was pretty well spelled out in the script, you know, as to what was going on in the movie and the film.

[01:02:38] So, your, your guesstimation of what things, how things were going to turn out?

[01:02:42] We're pretty accurate then.

[01:02:44] Um, yeah, you know, everything except for the, uh, the snagger or the, you know, the truck that, uh, the way they described it in the early script that I read when I started to lay out the game was, you know,

[01:02:57] this truck was chasing through the, you know, through the weeds after this dinosaur and this great big thing came out in front and, and shocked the dinosaur and then they picked it up with this clamp and they, you know, lifted it up and put it in the back of the truck.

[01:03:11] It was like a three, four second flash in the movie, you know, when we actually saw the film.

[01:03:17] Right.

[01:03:18] And I was pretty, uh, I was pretty upset about it.

[01:03:21] But, you know, at that point, we were finished with the game and we were building samples already, so it wasn't like we could go back and change it.

[01:03:27] But, um, but it was a neat little mechanism, you know, it was definitely different.

[01:03:32] Yeah.

[01:03:33] So, and, uh, uh, Robert Tato ended up laying out that little egg in the middle, it was above the ball scoop.

[01:03:41] Right.

[01:03:42] It opened and closed and there was a little dinosaur inside of it.

[01:03:46] Yep.

[01:03:47] Yep.

[01:03:48] So, but that wasn't one of my most favorite games all the time.

[01:03:51] Right.

[01:03:52] Like a couple of years break and then it didn't really do any design until Harley Davidson.

[01:03:56] Is that right?

[01:03:57] Let's see.

[01:03:58] Um, let's see, and I have to refresh my memory here.

[01:04:03] There was lost world.

[01:04:05] Um, off the top of your head, can you think of the, the, the, the Sega Flash Data East game that came after lost world?

[01:04:16] No, to be honest with you after lost world.

[01:04:20] Why did you, um, hear a whole lot of second?

[01:04:23] Mm-hmm.

[01:04:24] I will try and find out.

[01:04:28] You know, the lost and space was in there somewhere.

[01:04:32] That was, uh, that was another one that was, uh, uh, sounded like, you know, when we got the script and the license for that,

[01:04:44] that that would have been really a great movie, which really wasn't.

[01:04:50] How much work did you do on that one?

[01:04:53] Uh, quite a bit.

[01:04:55] Um, and then I think we just all kind of gave up on it when the, when the movie came out when we after we saw it.

[01:05:02] I think everybody was just kind of frowning when they walked out of the movie theater after that.

[01:05:07] Ex files, Starship Troopers, Viper, Lost in Space, Golden Cube, Godzilla, South Park, then hardly.

[01:05:15] Yes.

[01:05:17] Yes, yes, yes.

[01:05:19] Let's see.

[01:05:21] I did a lot of work with Norris on, uh, Golden Cube, um, which ended up in my last later, they didn't make Golden Cube.

[01:05:31] Um, but one day, they came into my office and they handed me a ramp, uh, the target bank, and all the wire ramps.

[01:05:40] And that was where Sharky Shootout came out of.

[01:05:45] You know, they handed me all these parts. I guess they had purchased parts for 500 Golden Cube and never made them.

[01:05:52] But they wanted to use the parts. So they handed me the ramps, all the wire ramps, the, uh, the little eight ball assembly, um, which eventually, which originally just had a little paddle in it.

[01:06:06] They diverted the ball back and forth to the left of the right wire ramp.

[01:06:10] And then I ended up revising that and making it, uh, like a magic eight ball.

[01:06:16] Um, so Golden Cube parts ended up becoming a game, uh, that was later Sharky Shootout.

[01:06:24] And, uh, Dwight Sullivan, uh, did the game rules for that game and, uh, worked with John Yalce on the art.

[01:06:34] And were you, I mean, did you have to do much more thing to turn John's design into yours?

[01:06:41] Um, not too much. Um, I just took out the, uh, the coil assembly that diverted the ball back and forth.

[01:06:47] Um, I added a motor with a little, uh, uh, a flag and, uh, and a small octoboard and, and put all the, you know, put the motor assembly and everything underneath that platform and tried to hide it as good as possible.

[01:07:05] And, uh, then I made, I did another vacuum form that fit inside of the original eight ball.

[01:07:11] Um, that we attached decals to and we put a small clear area on the, the eight ball that John had designed.

[01:07:21] So you could see through to make it, we tried to make it look as much like a, like a magic eight ball as we could.

[01:07:27] Right. Huh, interesting.

[01:07:29] And then John Yalce did a really nice, art pack of John that game.

[01:07:33] Did you do much on the Harley Davidson game?

[01:07:36] Everything.

[01:07:38] Oh, that, that was your entire design.

[01:07:40] Yes. Uh-huh.

[01:07:41] And because that's actually kind of a pretty cool game.

[01:07:44] Yeah, I like Harley. Um, not, not a ton of shots on it, but the motorcycle was kind of cool.

[01:07:52] The ramp was nice and the, the red light mulberry ball round was kind of fun.

[01:07:56] Um, but that was an overall pretty fun game.

[01:08:00] And that was really the game that was really like the first real stern game, you know, opposed to Sega.

[01:08:07] Yes. Yes. Uh-huh.

[01:08:09] So, you know, I got to imagine that Gary Stern was, was probably pretty proud of that game at the time.

[01:08:15] Yeah, and they made the game quite a few times. Um, you know, even after I hit the left.

[01:08:20] Uh, it was, it was, yeah, rerun.

[01:08:23] They ran that game quite, quite a bit.

[01:08:25] Right. So, uh, no.

[01:08:26] I did quite a few copies.

[01:08:28] Now, what about the, what a great title too though.

[01:08:30] Yeah. You know, even the old Valley, probably Davidson's, you know, still have a good resale value and, you know, are, are very collectible.

[01:08:39] No, you can't go wrong with a license like that.

[01:08:42] No, yeah, that's another one of those.

[01:08:45] John Borg, man, man of the hour, Mr. Lucky, getting the good license.

[01:08:49] Yes. Yes, indeed.

[01:08:51] Yeah. Yeah.

[01:08:52] Yeah. Now, who's idea was it to use the bike where it was doing a wheelie and all that?

[01:08:56] That was my idea.

[01:08:58] And were you pretty happy with how that came out?

[01:09:00] Yeah, you know, the, I actually laid that game out twice.

[01:09:04] And the original version of it had six pop-up on it. It had two of those units, but the motorcycles were smaller.

[01:09:11] Um, smaller scale like the ones that are on the return lanes near the, uh, there's a link shop.

[01:09:17] Right.

[01:09:18] Yeah. And, uh, yeah, there were six pop-up on that game.

[01:09:23] And then I remember there was a, there was a criss-cross ramp that was on an even earlier layout that we never even actually built.

[01:09:32] Um, but then we found the model for the, for the larger bike.

[01:09:37] And it was, uh, all I can't remember the name of that bike.

[01:09:41] It was the large touring bike with the saddlebags.

[01:09:44] And then later on in the second version, we went back to remake it.

[01:09:49] Um, they had designed, uh, Mastel was the company that made the motorcycle and they had designed a, uh, a fat boy.

[01:09:56] Which actually looked a lot nicer. I wish we would have had the fat boy on the first version of Harley.

[01:10:01] I wasn't crazy about the second art package, but that was, that was, uh, the second art package was designed after I had, was gone already from, from Stern.

[01:10:12] Now, what was the thinking on changing the, the Austin powers?

[01:10:16] What was the thinking on changing the art package?

[01:10:19] Um, I think they just wanted to reintroduce it again.

[01:10:22] Um, you know, with a different art package, just, you know, just make more sales.

[01:10:27] And it was really collectible. So, you know, maybe at some point, you may have, you know, a total Harley Davidson nut that would, that would want both games.

[01:10:37] Um, but the first art package was great and, and there's a, there's a, the first art package, the backlash, uh, market, Marcus Rothkrenz, uh, pain of that, that backlash.

[01:10:50] And if you look very closely, there's a, there's the rider on the bike with the, the black face shield.

[01:10:56] Mm-hmm.

[01:10:57] Um, if you look very closely, there's a girl behind that face shield.

[01:11:01] Hmm. A blind.

[01:11:03] Really?

[01:11:04] I don't know how many people know about that.

[01:11:06] But if you look very closely, you can see it.

[01:11:09] Huh.

[01:11:10] Probably not a brochure, you know, because it wouldn't be large enough to see.

[01:11:15] But if you're actually looking at a game, you, you can tell.

[01:11:18] Now, the model's the bike, he's in there.

[01:11:21] The, the bike model's used on that.

[01:11:23] How did you go about getting those and finding those?

[01:11:26] Um, you know, actually I found one at a, uh, a target, uh, department store.

[01:11:33] And I brought it back to work and started to tinker with it.

[01:11:38] And then the, uh, that unit, um, the motor assembly, you know, it's pretty simple.

[01:11:45] It's just a plate with a hinge at the back.

[01:11:47] And, uh, and a motor drive with a little crank arm assembly.

[01:11:50] Pretty much, pretty similar to how, uh, we lifted up the, uh, the rocket for a Paule 13.

[01:11:56] Right.

[01:11:57] So, just a different layout.

[01:11:59] You know, so I took the big bike and I laid it on the plate and, you know, started tinkering with the, uh, you know, the, the pitch of the angle that it was going to go off that and whatnot.

[01:12:11] And then I put a trough underneath it with some of those piezo switches in it.

[01:12:15] Right.

[01:12:16] Um, those membrane switches.

[01:12:18] Yep.

[01:12:19] And, uh, you know, I went and it shot the four balls out at one time.

[01:12:22] You know, I thought that was, that was pretty interesting.

[01:12:24] It's pretty cool.

[01:12:25] You know, and that was a good place to, that was a good place to lock the balls.

[01:12:29] Right.

[01:12:30] So, and it ended up working out pretty well.

[01:12:33] And I think they'd gone back to, I know they did the second version, they did a gold version.

[01:12:38] Um, and I'm sure that they've probably done about, you know, total since the very beginning.

[01:12:44] They've probably made about maybe six or seven thousand of those games.

[01:12:48] Really?

[01:12:49] Huh.

[01:12:50] Yeah, you know, it was a good, it was a good seller, obviously.

[01:12:53] Uh-huh, you know.

[01:12:54] Now, did you have any involvement with Stryker Extreme?

[01:12:59] Um, not too much.

[01:13:02] I worked on the Goli Mac a little bit with Joe Balser, but I was pretty much just helping him with that game.

[01:13:11] I wish I would have directed the art, because the, uh, the art package on that game was just the play field.

[01:13:18] I've actually, I saw one the other day, and I was like, I looked at it next to it.

[01:13:23] I think it was a play field sitting against the wall, and it was next to a Lord of the Rings.

[01:13:27] And I compared the two, and I was just like, oh, what were we thinking?

[01:13:32] Huh.

[01:13:33] So, uh, yeah.

[01:13:35] So, I had very little, very little, uh, input on Stryker Extreme.

[01:13:39] What about a high roller casino?

[01:13:42] Uh, a little bit there too.

[01:13:44] Um, just layout work, and helping, uh, John Norris and, uh, and Joe Balser on that one, a little bit.

[01:13:52] I probably laid out, I probably did the mechanical engineering for like the ramps and a couple of the mechanisms.

[01:13:58] The, uh, the roulette wheel and whatnot.

[01:14:01] Now, what about Austin Powers?

[01:14:03] Uh, that was my baby.

[01:14:05] Okay.

[01:14:06] Tell me about Austin.

[01:14:08] Austin Powers actually was a, that was the layout, the production unit, was the, uh, was the second layout.

[01:14:15] Um, the original layout, I had a, it was a three flipper gain, and I had an upper flipper on the upper right similar to like Jurassic Park.

[01:14:26] And I was shooting the ball across the play field at an angle to where the time machine was, the big spinning platform with the hole in the center.

[01:14:35] Right.

[01:14:36] That would stop the ball in the center.

[01:14:38] Um, and in the middle of the game, I had something that was similar to the, uh, the spinning magnetic platter on Twister, but I had a, a head molded, uh, that was mini-me.

[01:14:54] And you shot the ball and it went toward the head.

[01:14:57] And there was an octave across in front of the head.

[01:15:01] And when it saw the ball, the magnet would turn on and the ball kind of jumped up off the play field and went on to many lips like his mouth.

[01:15:10] He actually didn't catch the ball in his mouth, but it just went up and stuck to like his lips in his mouth area.

[01:15:16] And then it spun around really fast while he went.

[01:15:20] You know, from like you did in the movie, and then it would release the ball and shoot the ball back at the flipper.

[01:15:26] And then the, you know, the whole time machine unit was over on the left side of the game, and then we had that big spinning head in the middle.

[01:15:32] And, uh, so we ended up laying out a second version of it to see if we liked it, and we ended up liking the second version better.

[01:15:42] So it wasn't a money thing.

[01:15:44] I both worked a lot on the second version.

[01:15:48] So it wasn't a money thing that stood in the game, you know, and so why is it ideal is the toilet, and we ended up moving the time machine to the center of the game.

[01:16:02] Right.

[01:16:04] And that actually ended up on another, ended up on Lord of the Rings later.

[01:16:09] Yep.

[01:16:10] Yep. That same unit.

[01:16:13] Now, Lord of the Rings, it didn't spin, it just caught the ball and fired it back out the hole.

[01:16:18] Right. Right.

[01:16:20] Now, what about the Mini-Me spinner? What was it thinking on that?

[01:16:25] Well, I just really liked Mini-Me a lot, and you know, that in the movie, you know, when he was in trouble, he never said anything, but when he was in trouble, he was like, you know, making that that he found, and I just thought that was just so entertaining.

[01:16:42] But you just never, you know, we just didn't go in that direction.

[01:16:47] Did you meet any of the...

[01:16:50] Could have been a cost issue, but we never really got far enough into it to really decide.

[01:16:56] So...

[01:16:59] Did you ever meet any of the personalities for the movie?

[01:17:04] No, I never did.

[01:17:06] It just got a script ahead of...

[01:17:08] Yeah, yeah.

[01:17:10] What if it would have been great.

[01:17:12] Did you just get a script? Is that it?

[01:17:14] We've had problems getting my ears to do things for us.

[01:17:18] You know, like custom speech and whatnot, because we just started to produce Shrek, and he didn't do...

[01:17:25] You know, we had to do Lifted Speech from the Shrek movie.

[01:17:30] We didn't get him to do any custom for us.

[01:17:33] And the same thing with awesome powers.

[01:17:35] You know, it was all Lifted Speech.

[01:17:37] And the only person we got to do custom speech for us for that game was Frao Farbisima.

[01:17:44] Dr. Evil's love interest.

[01:17:48] And, you know, it turned out pretty well.

[01:17:51] You know, she did a really nice job, and, you know, like for the laser beam, you know, at the bottom of the game, you know, she was doing a finer laser.

[01:18:00] And, you know, and she's very, very animated.

[01:18:04] So, you know, we got a lot of custom speech out of, you know, from her.

[01:18:09] So, you know, that worked out pretty well.

[01:18:12] You know, Mike Myers is a busy guy.

[01:18:15] You know, he's probably got a lot of other things to do besides, you know, help us with our pinball machine, so...

[01:18:21] Now, so you tried to get him. You just couldn't never pull it off.

[01:18:26] Yeah.

[01:18:27] He was unobtainable.

[01:18:31] Right. So, and, you know, who knows what he had going at the time.

[01:18:34] You know, I'm the side, or, you know, just in his life.

[01:18:38] When you did this machine, where you going from...

[01:18:42] Yeah, I forget which movie it came out after.

[01:18:45] But, did you have scripts to go by or anything in advance?

[01:18:50] You know, I...

[01:18:53] The first movie had already been out.

[01:18:56] You know, so we, you know, that was out on video already.

[01:18:59] So, you know, we pretty much knew what we were working with with the first movie, which is always really nice, you know, similar to, you know, like Indiana Jones right now.

[01:19:08] You know, I'm not seeing it, you know, or reading about a new movie for the first time and having to create a game for it.

[01:19:14] You know, I'm actually working off of all three movies and the fourth one.

[01:19:19] But, for Austin Powers, I'm sure we had a script for the second movie.

[01:19:26] And, you know, we'd already had the first movie out on video.

[01:19:30] So, you know, so we knew pretty much what we were working with and what, and had an idea of what to expect for the sequel.

[01:19:39] Right. Right.

[01:19:41] Now, what happened that you stopped doing pinball after Austin Powers?

[01:19:47] Just a layoff. I was laid off in 2000, and then I went off and started my own business.

[01:19:54] Pinball related?

[01:19:55] And did that for seven years.

[01:19:57] And, you know, probably for the last couple of years.

[01:20:01] Well, I guess I'd have to admit that, you know, I always like to, but in the last couple of years I was actually, you know, starting to work out a layout.

[01:20:11] And I wanted to take, you know, a layout to Gary, you know, to see if he would be interested in it.

[01:20:17] And, sometimes last spring, I think it was in, like, May or June.

[01:20:24] Ray Tanser called me up and asked me if I wanted to, if I wanted to layout a game, and told me I had six or seven months.

[01:20:33] And I was like, well, that's plenty of time for me, you know.

[01:20:37] And, you know, I know that, you know, some of the other designers like to, you know, like to have a good salad year, you know, to work kind of game.

[01:20:46] So they were, you know, I guess maybe kind of even in a pinch.

[01:20:51] And they needed something, you know, to, they needed somebody to fill a slot.

[01:20:55] And Ray Tanser called me up and asked me if I was interested.

[01:20:58] And, you know, I just, you know, just jumped at the idea.

[01:21:03] And, you know, for the past few years, I definitely had an itch to, you know, to work on another convoy machine.

[01:21:10] So, you know, so I jumped at it and, you know, here I am now.

[01:21:14] Now, are you, I can home.

[01:21:17] Now, are you under contract kind of like Pat Lawler's Steve Richie, or are you more an employee like Dennis Nortonman?

[01:21:24] I am a permanent, just like Dennis Nortonman.

[01:21:27] Okay. Okay.

[01:21:29] And what was the business that you were doing for the seven years lapse?

[01:21:34] I did some work in the slot machine industry.

[01:21:37] I did a few slot machines.

[01:21:39] Really?

[01:21:40] I did some, I did some redemption games with Brian Hansen from the old Capcom Thinball.

[01:21:49] And then I went to the total opposite side of the world.

[01:21:53] And I was doing some kitchen equipment designs for McPennel's Corporation

[01:21:57] through a company called H&K Dallas in Dallas, Texas.

[01:22:02] And H&K primarily designs, well they design hospital and kitchen equipment.

[01:22:10] And their biggest account is McDonald's.

[01:22:14] And they provide probably about 50 or more percent of all McDonald's kitchen equipment.

[01:22:21] So I did some pretty new interesting kitchen equipment designs for McDownts.

[01:22:26] Now on Indiana Jones when you came into the company, you know, when you rehired as it may be,

[01:22:34] I mean do they say it's Indiana Jones?

[01:22:36] I mean, you can't just start on Indiana Jones.

[01:22:38] Yeah, that was, yeah, that's where it's going, yeah.

[01:22:40] Yes, I actually started on another layout.

[01:22:43] I think I was, I can't remember if I started in June or July.

[01:22:48] But for the first month, I started to lay out a different game,

[01:22:53] which I can't tell you what it is. I'd really, really like to though.

[01:22:56] But I can't. It may come up again.

[01:23:00] It's like maybe I'd like to say on the back burner.

[01:23:04] Right.

[01:23:05] I have definitely not given up on it yet, but they were looking at a license.

[01:23:10] And then they decided, I guess they were unable to finish the license in time for the,

[01:23:18] for the slot that we needed the new game in.

[01:23:22] So they decided to change my theme.

[01:23:25] And it was between a mystery title, which I can't tell you about yet.

[01:23:31] And I J, Indiana Jones.

[01:23:34] And I ended up getting lucky and getting the Indiana Jones title.

[01:23:40] Now, this one, have you seen any sort of movie clips or just working from scripts?

[01:23:47] I actually went out to San Francisco and met with Lucas.

[01:23:51] And I saw a slide presentation, the PowerPoint presentation.

[01:23:55] And they read me an overview of the movie while the slide presentation was going on.

[01:24:01] So, and at the beginning of this slide presentation,

[01:24:07] they had the notes that they were going to read to me.

[01:24:11] And I asked them if I could have copies of those notes.

[01:24:13] And they said, absolutely not, that I had to take notes.

[01:24:17] So, as they were reading the story very quickly and showing me stills,

[01:24:22] I was trying to look at the screen to see the visuals.

[01:24:26] And I was scribbling notes as fast as I possibly could.

[01:24:30] And between myself and Kevin O'Connor,

[01:24:33] we put our notes together after we were finished.

[01:24:36] And we got a pretty good overview of the kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

[01:24:42] And how does this movie look like it's going to be compared to the other ones?

[01:24:46] Fantastic.

[01:24:48] And now, I think it's going to be right up there with,

[01:24:53] I think it's going to be right up there with Raiders.

[01:24:56] I love all the movies. Raiders was definitely my favorite.

[01:25:01] Most people seem to think that, you know, last crusade was really good.

[01:25:05] And Raiders was, you know, fantastic.

[01:25:08] And a lot of people didn't like Temple of Doom as much.

[01:25:11] Right. I really liked them all.

[01:25:13] Right. Yeah, I did too.

[01:25:15] I was a total Indiana Jones fan.

[01:25:17] So, they were pretty, holding this pretty close to their chest.

[01:25:21] They didn't really weren't showing you too much.

[01:25:23] Yes. And they still, at that point, when I saw that presentation,

[01:25:28] they had not yet completed the special effects.

[01:25:34] I didn't get to see any of the special effects.

[01:25:38] And so, I'm really, really curious to see how that's going to come off.

[01:25:43] I have seen a few of the trailers.

[01:25:46] And it looks like it's going to be fantastic and very action-packed.

[01:25:52] And so, like, did this make the designing of the game that much more difficult for you?

[01:25:58] Not really, because I pretty much spread it out between, you know, all four movies.

[01:26:07] And they did release a character likeness from the fourth movie

[01:26:14] and the image of the Crystal Skull itself.

[01:26:18] So, those were things I was able to use in the event that we were to produce the game prior to the fourth movie.

[01:26:26] By the time that we had got to a point where we were going to be making production games,

[01:26:31] they would have already been showing the trailer in the movie theaters.

[01:26:35] So, we wouldn't be unveiling anything that they would want to have kept secret.

[01:26:42] Now, everybody knows Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is coming.

[01:26:46] So, there's going to be a Crystal Skull and the movie posters are out now.

[01:26:52] So, they did give us a little something that we could put in the game prior to the movie, you know, the movie premiere dates.

[01:27:03] And when is your game going to be released prior to the movie?

[01:27:08] We're going to be shipping. We're hopefully going to be shipping prior to the movie.

[01:27:15] You know, if everything goes well, we will be shipping, you know, we will be shipping prior to the movie.

[01:27:23] But right now, we're running Shrek and they were thinking originally that it was going to be kind of a short run because of it being a remake of an older game.

[01:27:36] But it's doing really well and it looks great.

[01:27:42] So, it may actually push Indiana Jones forward a couple of weeks.

[01:27:47] So, we might be shipping right as the movie comes out.

[01:27:52] So, we're hoping to get some games out early so that some of them can hit the movie theaters before the movie hits.

[01:28:00] Right. Now, that would be the best case scenario.

[01:28:03] How is Indy Jones doing on test?

[01:28:07] Great. And it did really well at the Vegas show at the Akmi show this last week. Distributors really like it a lot.

[01:28:17] You know, people were taking pictures of it and it's, you know, we're getting good orders already for it.

[01:28:23] And, you know, it's really going to be a good game.

[01:28:28] The geometry is great. The effects are great. The display is great. It's everything you want in a new pinball.

[01:28:37] And how many is this some, you know, I heard something like it's going to have an eight ball, multi ball?

[01:28:43] Yes.

[01:28:44] So, the game actually has an eight ball trough?

[01:28:47] No.

[01:28:49] So, how is that accomplished?

[01:28:51] That I can't tell you. I'm going to let you see the game and figure that out for yourself.

[01:29:00] But, yeah, it's a surprise and as opposed to telling you and ruining it for you, I would really like you to just experience it when you play the game for the first time for yourself.

[01:29:12] Is this, I mean, is this like the game that you're most proud of that you've designed?

[01:29:20] You know what? It's definitely, I would have to say it's definitely right up there with the DDE Star Wars.

[01:29:27] And I would be even happier if it did the numbers that DDE Star Wars did in today's market.

[01:29:34] Right.

[01:29:35] Well, you know, I guess you could. I mean, right now I think the guy that's got the title is Dennis with Pirates of the Caribbean, right?

[01:29:45] Yeah, Pirates did really, really well. And I think, you know, out of the last 10 years, I think that's the, he's the record holder for right now.

[01:29:55] Right. Right.

[01:29:56] So, hopefully you can beat him.

[01:29:59] I would love to.

[01:30:01] You know?

[01:30:02] I would love to see that happen.

[01:30:04] Right.

[01:30:05] So, what can you tell me about the Indiana Jones game ahead of its release?

[01:30:14] Who's the programmer, for example?

[01:30:17] It has a couple of quite a few toys in it.

[01:30:20] It has an arc of the covenant that's, you know, player interactive toy.

[01:30:28] It has the Kyro Swordsman.

[01:30:32] If you remember from Raiders of Lost Arc, the Kyro Swordsman comes out and swings and sort around.

[01:30:38] And Indiana Jones is tired and reaches into, into his holster and pulls it out and shoots him.

[01:30:44] Right.

[01:30:45] The Kyro Swordsman comes out in the game and then disappears again.

[01:30:51] Is that a mechanical assembly?

[01:30:53] It's a synchristone in the game that's somewhat interactive.

[01:30:57] And then there's a holy grail in the game.

[01:31:01] And then the ramps in the geometry, the game shoots great.

[01:31:04] I would have to say that, I would have to say it's probably the best geometry that I've ever put up in a pinball machine.

[01:31:16] Now, better than Star Wars was.

[01:31:19] Now, when you went to design this, whose idea, I mean, did the movie, did the movie people want you to just concentrate on Indiana Jones 4?

[01:31:29] Or did they say, now it's okay, you can do, you know, a little bit of all the movies.

[01:31:33] Yeah, they did say we could do a little bit of everything.

[01:31:36] And were they resistant to that?

[01:31:40] Oh no.

[01:31:43] You know, we purchased the whole trilogy, you know, plus the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

[01:31:51] And I pretty much spread it out.

[01:31:54] I would have to say it's a little bit raiders heavy, but it's all spread out pretty well.

[01:32:01] So there's a little bit of every movie throughout the game.

[01:32:07] There's not one thing, there's not one thing that's lacking.

[01:32:10] You know, there's nothing hidden that's not like that's all raiders and no temple of doom or no last crusade.

[01:32:18] It's all spread out pretty evenly.

[01:32:21] But a little bit raiders heavy, I would say.

[01:32:24] Now, how did you feel about the Williams Valley, you know, Indiana Jones pinball?

[01:32:31] Oh, night and day, two totally different layouts.

[01:32:36] So no influence.

[01:32:38] I haven't played the old Indiana Jones game.

[01:32:40] I saw it at Expo, but I haven't played it in years.

[01:32:45] They don't look similar.

[01:32:48] There's absolutely, I mean, play field wise, there's really nothing similar to, you know, the Marks game.

[01:32:57] It's a whole new animal.

[01:33:01] Right.

[01:33:02] The mute eyes and play field wise and layout wise and, you know, back glass wise, but, you know, totally, totally different animal.

[01:33:11] So about the only thing they haven't common is the theme music, right?

[01:33:15] That's it.

[01:33:18] Right.

[01:33:19] And who did the artwork on your game?

[01:33:22] Kevin O'Connor.

[01:33:24] And who's doing the software?

[01:33:26] Lonnie Rock.

[01:33:28] And is it, it's not a big team effort?

[01:33:30] It's done a fantastic job.

[01:33:32] Say again.

[01:33:33] Everybody has done a fantastic job.

[01:33:38] Well, is there anything else that I...

[01:33:40] Who's doing all the dot matrix?

[01:33:43] Rob Blakeman and John Rothmell.

[01:33:47] Mike Redoble.

[01:33:50] And those guys are doing most of the mechanics.

[01:33:53] I laid out all the mechanical devices.

[01:33:57] And then what I'm doing now is we've got these guys and they're working on solid works.

[01:34:01] So I would rough something out on AutoCAD and hand it over to them.

[01:34:06] And then they refine it and, you know, go over it with a fine tooth comb.

[01:34:10] And the mechanical group is great.

[01:34:12] You know, back in the day, all the way up until, you know, 2000, I did Austin Powers.

[01:34:18] I did all my own mechanical engineering and layout.

[01:34:22] And, you know, so now I've got a lot of mechanical support.

[01:34:26] And it is just wonderful.

[01:34:29] So...

[01:34:31] So you don't miss that, then, huh?

[01:34:34] Actually, I do a little bit and I'm still doing it.

[01:34:38] But, you know, it's nice to lay something out and then have somebody going over it with a fine tooth comb.

[01:34:45] And just to have more eyes on it, you know, than just my own.

[01:34:50] And it's really nice to have, you know, into the lane out of three, you know, a 2D drawing.

[01:34:56] You know, and looking at three views of it.

[01:34:59] You know, it's nice to be able to, you know, have it on solid works and be able to spin it around.

[01:35:04] And you find the interferences and mistakes and things like that a little easier.

[01:35:10] And they're a great group.

[01:35:13] Has anything got costed out of this design?

[01:35:18] No, actually, I actually, the chiro swordsman was actually something that we added.

[01:35:28] Instead of cost-cutting something out of this game, we actually added something to it towards the end.

[01:35:36] Huh.

[01:35:37] And, well, yeah, I mean, did somebody just say we got to have this, or they said you got more money?

[01:35:43] Well, actually, Gary is raising the price $100 on the game.

[01:35:49] So they opened up the bill of material a little bit.

[01:35:52] So I was able to shoe-horn in another mechanical device.

[01:35:57] And is that just for this game, or just he's just going with the price increase?

[01:36:01] I believe so. I think so.

[01:36:03] I think it's going to be just forgot for Indiana.

[01:36:06] Right. Well, the market will probably bear it. I mean, they'll probably be okay with it.

[01:36:09] Yeah, the title so good and the game is so good.

[01:36:12] I think it's, you know, it's going to make that money back in no time.

[01:36:18] Well, cool. Is there anything I left out that I need to ask you?

[01:36:24] You know, I don't know, but if I think of it, I can definitely get back to you.

[01:36:29] Yeah, give me a call. Give me a call.

[01:36:31] Sure.

[01:36:32] Okay, John, I really appreciate your time.

[01:36:34] Oh, you bet Clay. It was a pleasure.

[01:36:36] And I'm sorry, it took so long for us to get together.

[01:36:38] But I have been just up to my ears lately, and it's been really hard to do much of anything.

[01:36:44] So, but, you know, I've been just plugging away and plugging away.

[01:36:50] And I'm kind of starting to get to the end where I have a little breathing room.

[01:36:54] And, you know, so now we're, you know, we're on test.

[01:36:59] And, you know, it's my workload is starting to lighten up a little bit.

[01:37:04] So, but before a while, I'll be, you know, I'll be on the next one.

[01:37:09] Right.

[01:37:10] So, it'll all start over again.

[01:37:12] So, what cool, cool.

[01:37:15] It's to the lot.

[01:37:16] And I'm really glad to be back.

[01:37:18] It's a great industry.

[01:37:20] And, you know, as opposed to designing redemption games and whatnot.

[01:37:25] You know, this is definitely the place where I like to be.

[01:37:30] Does redemption games, does redemption games design pay better than pinball?

[01:37:37] Well, it depends.

[01:37:44] You know, it depends upon, you know, how many are, you know, what I was working on.

[01:37:48] If I was working on a couple of the time or something like that, you know, depending upon, you know, what kind of a deal I had worked out.

[01:37:58] You know, I would say sometimes yes.

[01:38:00] Maybe sometimes no.

[01:38:02] You know, because I wasn't working for a redemption company.

[01:38:05] I was just doing projects for, you know, a couple of different companies.

[01:38:09] And, you know, if I had two projects going at one time, then I would say yes.

[01:38:13] And, you know, if I had one or a half a project or, you know, nothing happening at the time, then I would say no.

[01:38:20] So, now, as a stern employee, say you do sell 10,000 Indiana Jones.

[01:38:26] Do you get, like, a commission, you know, a bonus, like, you know, maybe like the old days?

[01:38:34] No, it's different.

[01:38:35] It's a little different now than the old days.

[01:38:38] But, that I don't know if I should go into it.

[01:38:43] But, it's the bonus structure is a little different now than it used to be.

[01:38:48] Right.

[01:38:49] Yeah, because back in the old days, you know, everything, a lot of the pay was based on sales numbers, right?

[01:38:54] Yes.

[01:38:55] Yeah.

[01:38:56] Not so much now, though, right?

[01:38:57] Not so much now, yes.

[01:38:58] Right.

[01:38:59] Right.

[01:39:00] Well, it's a different world, I guess.

[01:39:02] Yep.

[01:39:03] You know, if, you know, the company does fantastic this year, you know, then it'll, you know, then it'll pay off.

[01:39:09] And there'll, you know, there'll be a bonus at the end of the year, whereas, you know, back in the day it was, you know, a small fee per game.

[01:39:20] And then, you know, back in the day, I would get, you know, a small royalty if I did, like, mechanical engineering on one game.

[01:39:27] And then there'd be, you know, another small fee if I did, you know, a certain amount of numbers on a design for a game.

[01:39:35] So, it's all a little different now.

[01:39:37] Right.

[01:39:38] Right.

[01:39:39] Well, cool.

[01:39:40] All right, man.

[01:39:41] Well, thanks, John.

[01:39:42] And you take care, and I appreciate your time.

[01:39:44] Yep. And I'll be talking to you.

[01:39:45] And please give me a call when you get to see an IJ game and let me know what you think.

[01:39:51] All right.

[01:39:52] Okay. Well, if you could tell me where it isn't Chicago, I'm going to be there this weekend.

[01:39:56] Oh, aren't you?

[01:39:57] Yeah.

[01:39:58] You know what?

[01:39:59] I'm going to have to get back here on that tomorrow.

[01:40:02] I'm going to have to see if it's all right.

[01:40:05] I just, I could tell you, but I don't know if they want everybody on the planet to know where it's at, and be flocking this place.

[01:40:13] Do they move like the test locations all around the city?

[01:40:18] You know, I don't know how many places they're testing in right now.

[01:40:24] You know, I know Blackwell sets that all up, and he's got quite a few test locations.

[01:40:29] But I only know of this one right now, and they've all changed from back when I was there back in the late 90s, and I've told about 2000.

[01:40:45] How many games do they put out on test?

[01:40:48] Right now, there's just one.

[01:40:50] Is that typical?

[01:40:53] Is that typical?

[01:40:54] Is it just usually one?

[01:40:56] Oh, no.

[01:40:57] Usually they'll do a few.

[01:40:59] But right now it's one, just because we've only, you know, we built a couple of games through the Vegas show.

[01:41:05] We built one for the show in Italy.

[01:41:07] We built one for FCC.

[01:41:10] So probably we'll probably build another half a dozen of them and get them on test and start sending a few of them out to our major distributors over the next few weeks.

[01:41:21] But we'll just be building a few here and there.

[01:41:24] Now when you said one for the...

[01:41:26] I have a couple more.

[01:41:27] We'll probably have maybe three or four of them on test locally, you know, eventually over the next few weeks.

[01:41:34] I would imagine.

[01:41:35] Now when you said you built one for the FCC, what does that mean?

[01:41:40] Like a CEO or UL, they just... they test the game electrically to make sure that it's not going to start a fire in your home.

[01:41:53] Make sure that it's Rose compliant and whatnot.

[01:41:57] Do you have to do that for every game?

[01:42:00] Pardon me?

[01:42:01] Do you do that for every game?

[01:42:03] Yes.

[01:42:04] I'm pretty sure we do.

[01:42:07] You know, I remember a while ago, if I'm not mistaken, I thought we did it like maybe for every two or three models we'd send them again.

[01:42:20] But I think they did... I think they sent a Spider-Man around the time that I started and we sent an Indie to him.

[01:42:29] But that I... you know, don't quote me on that.

[01:42:32] But I think they do for every game.

[01:42:36] Interesting.

[01:42:37] Okay, well great.

[01:42:38] You know, if you can, let me know where the game is.

[01:42:42] I'd love to play it when I'm in Chicago this weekend.

[01:42:45] Okay, yeah, I'll definitely get back to you and I'll either talk to you directly or I'll leave you in the next one.

[01:42:50] Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.

[01:42:52] Take care. Good night.

[01:42:53] Good one.

[01:42:54] Thanks a lot.

[01:42:55] All right.

[01:42:56] Okay. Back to you.

[01:42:57] I'd like to thank John Borg for joining us on Topcast tonight.

[01:43:00] Really do appreciate his time.

[01:43:02] And appreciate hearing all his stories about game design and how he's gone from a mechanical engineer up to a game designer.

[01:43:10] And I hope you can all come back soon and listen to us again on Topcast, the Internet Pinball Radio Show.
