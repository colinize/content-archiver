[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:17] Tonight in Topcast I'd like to welcome a gentleman that started out working in pinball for Atari

[00:22] and then moved over to Williams, designing games from the Sorcerer, Road Kings,

[00:27] Big Guns, Taxi, Police Force, Diner, Slugfest, Fish Tales, and of course Indiana Jones.

[00:34] And then after Williams he moved over to Capcom and was head of the engineering department

[00:39] and also design Kingpin.

[00:47] I'd like to welcome Mark Richie to Topcast tonight.

[00:50] You've probably heard of that last name before Richie.

[00:54] He does have a brother that's involved in the gaming industry also.

[00:57] But Mark has done some great designs for Williams and also did some pinball design in Capcom.

[01:04] And we're going to give him a call right now and talk to him tonight,

[01:08] Mark talked to Mark Richie about his pinball work for Atari, Williams, and Capcom.

[01:24] Hello.

[01:25] Mark?

[01:26] Yes.

[01:27] It's Clay. How you doing?

[01:29] Hey Clay, how are you? I'm doing good.

[01:31] Am I on time?

[01:32] You're right on time.

[01:33] So you ready?

[01:34] I'm ready when you are.

[01:36] Okay, so tell me about your first memory of pinball and what you remember when you

[01:43] first started playing if it was when you were a kid or in college or whatever.

[01:46] Well, my earliest memory that when I was really small

[01:53] kid, maybe four or five years old, you used to have a summer home up near the

[01:58] Russian River in California.

[02:00] And when I actually came, my uncle had one and we would go up there and spend,

[02:04] you know, a week, two weeks up there to crack and we'd go to the

[02:06] little miniature golf course that had like a bunch of old wood rail pinballs and

[02:11] I couldn't tell you which one but I can remember being just telling

[02:14] up to see over the hand protector and flipping the flippers and pushing the

[02:20] game around. So that was my first memory.

[02:22] That's not real exciting but that's what it is.

[02:27] Is now, was this a family adventure?

[02:30] Yeah, absolutely.

[02:31] And how many brothers do you have?

[02:32] One brother and one sister.

[02:34] And obviously your brothers into pinball is your sister into pinball?

[02:38] No, she's not. Couldn't be further away.

[02:43] Okay, so now how did you, how did you translate this into getting involved in the pinball industry?

[02:49] Well, actually the birth of ants are completely disconnected.

[02:53] Unconnected, I should say.

[02:55] You know, came a lot later in life and I was just getting out of high school and I was

[03:00] I think flipping burgers at a restaurant or something and my brother got this really

[03:04] cool job at Atari and you know, I had been playing games and stuff all along but

[03:09] you know, mostly novelty games didn't have a lot of pinball where I grew up.

[03:12] We had video games and stuff like that and spent a lot of time doing that and I thought wow,

[03:17] this would be really cool.

[03:18] So I started bothering them and basically asked them if they were going to have any openings.

[03:22] I was about to be out of high school and he said, well, it's possible but Atari has a policy.

[03:28] They don't hire family.

[03:30] The immediate family is not allowed and can't work in the same department, whatever.

[03:34] So I thought, nah, that's not going to bother me.

[03:36] So I wasn't applied as soon as I finished high school and lo and behold, they hired me and I started

[03:42] working in Santa Clara facility assembling video games.

[03:46] So I started there and about that time maybe a year or two after that,

[03:53] my brother had moved up and do pinball.

[03:56] So he was working an engineering into that time and I wanted to get a real bet of course.

[04:00] I thought that was really interesting.

[04:01] It would be something I could really do pretty well.

[04:05] So I started hammering people around there for that and of course I got the same story.

[04:08] No, they can't have direct family working in the same department.

[04:12] Why I don't know.

[04:14] But so what I did was I was able to land a job in building maintenance with Atari at that time.

[04:21] They had a little empire going in Sunnyvale.

[04:23] They had probably between 10 and 12 buildings and settled around between the buildings and do various tasks.

[04:31] And selling airlines, electrical work, whatever needed to be done.

[04:35] Mostly you can keep me assembling planes holding.

[04:37] They were somewhat automated in those days so there was a lot of maintenance work to do.

[04:42] But got one job in particular in the pinball engineering building where they wanted me to put some air jobs in there.

[04:49] One in 15 airlines for their technicians and stuff so they could do sort of mock

[04:55] prototype assembly in there.

[04:57] So I got the job I went over there and I laid out the pipe and got everything in.

[05:03] The boss of the department gave me the name of Charlie Barnett at that time.

[05:07] He says to me, is this what you want to do?

[05:10] He says, I know your brother.

[05:13] Let me see what I can do.

[05:14] I'll see if I can get you in here.

[05:15] I'm like when?

[05:20] So about that time, that was maybe a year and a half into it.

[05:24] Steve had made the switch over to Williams.

[05:27] So one was out of cleared out of the Atari.

[05:30] Once he left Atari, they hired me to work on prototype,

[05:37] doing engineering, working for the engineers and game designer as assembly playfields.

[05:40] And that sort of thing.

[05:43] Now what's the age difference between you and Steve?

[05:48] I hear.

[05:50] He's older than you, right?

[05:53] Oh yeah, he's much older than me.

[05:56] He was much older.

[05:58] And not as wise though, right?

[06:01] I don't know about that.

[06:03] I can't say that.

[06:06] I can't say that and get away with it.

[06:08] Now how long did you stay at Atari?

[06:11] It was there a total of three and a half years.

[06:15] And then how did you get from Atari to Williams?

[06:19] I met a gentleman by the name of Mike Straul,

[06:21] who my brother obviously knew very well.

[06:24] He hired my brother.

[06:26] And he was out here on some sort of,

[06:28] I think it was a distributor show or something.

[06:30] He was out here on business.

[06:32] And my brother called me up one afternoon and says,

[06:34] what are you doing tonight?

[06:35] And I said, I don't know.

[06:36] And he says, once you meet us over at this hotel in my status.

[06:40] And you know, put a decent shirt on,

[06:42] make yourself look decent.

[06:43] You're going to meet the president of Williams.

[06:45] I said, you're kidding me.

[06:46] And he says, no.

[06:47] So, okay, so later on that night, I get over there and I meet him.

[06:51] Before I knew it, I had a job that,

[06:53] if I wanted, I could double my salary.

[06:55] And I was to start within about a month of that day at Williams.

[07:02] This is 1979.

[07:04] So, how did you make this transition in 79

[07:07] to working at Williams dad,

[07:08] and then it seemed like around 82 you actually started designing games, right?

[07:12] Right. Well, when I hired on at Williams, I came in.

[07:15] That's time I was a lab tax.

[07:17] So, I was working with the designer.

[07:18] So, I pretty much had the same job.

[07:21] I just kind of transferred everything I knew out there.

[07:24] And I was working on Steve's games on everybody's games.

[07:28] I was building white woods and doing, you know,

[07:30] making parts and whatever had to be done,

[07:32] basically to build a prototype.

[07:35] So, I got really good hands on training on what the right path was,

[07:39] or what I thought the right path was.

[07:42] You know, for things like shot layout, ball guides.

[07:46] I mean, Steve really knew that stuff really well.

[07:48] His shots are really smooth.

[07:50] Some of the smoothest in the industry, no question.

[07:52] Right.

[07:53] And so, I consider myself to have been really lucky,

[07:55] because I think I learned from the best.

[07:58] And I kind of started there.

[08:00] And, you know, basically whatever they told me to do, I did, you know.

[08:04] Now, are you and Steve, are you guys pretty close?

[08:08] Absolutely.

[08:09] Very close.

[08:11] And the transition from California, you know,

[08:15] the Cittari kind of, the Atari work.

[08:19] I don't know if you want to call it work ethic or whatever,

[08:21] to the William Chicago style.

[08:23] Was that a big transition?

[08:25] Oh, God, yeah.

[08:26] I mean, I was a, I was pretty much along here,

[08:30] hippie and, you know, like the,

[08:32] well, I won't say what I like to do in those days,

[08:34] but I like to have a lot of fun.

[08:38] And coming out here was a big culture shock.

[08:40] As this is, you know, this was a,

[08:42] like, just struck me as a really old place when I got here.

[08:45] I'm in Paris, California.

[08:46] And I would just freak out on how old everything was, you know.

[08:51] And just, you know, torn up roads and snow was a new thing for me.

[08:54] I'd never been in a snowstorm in my life.

[08:57] So, you know, that year, 79, we got probably record snowfall.

[09:03] Up to that point, I think, you know, I haven't heard exactly, but

[09:08] absolutely.

[09:09] Many changes had to be made.

[09:11] Now, how did you get from, you know, basically being a,

[09:15] I don't know, a whitewood assembler to actually designing your first game?

[09:20] I call it, I had a really strong desire to design Timbalm machines.

[09:26] I thought it was something I could do.

[09:27] I mean, I wanted to do it.

[09:29] Obviously, it was exciting.

[09:31] Those, you know, Williams was, I mean, they were in those days,

[09:34] they were kicking at, taking names.

[09:36] You had games like Flash, you had Firepower, you had Black Knight.

[09:40] This is when I was doing my sort of prototype assembler apprenticeship.

[09:44] And so, right after that happened, you know, Mike Stroll gave me an opportunity to design my first game.

[09:50] So, I took him up on it and Thunderball was born not the best thing in the world.

[09:55] Certainly not my best effort, but that was my first, you know, I got a shot.

[10:00] Here's a company who gives me a shot at doing pretty much whatever I want.

[10:04] Without, without putting a lot of weight on me or leaning over my shoulder or telling me what

[10:09] to do, I basically was pretty much free to do what I wanted.

[10:13] Sometimes that's not a good thing.

[10:16] But Thunderball, the long story, but what do you mean?

[10:21] They only made 10 of them.

[10:22] No, more out of desire than anything.

[10:24] Well, they only made 10 Thunderballs.

[10:27] Why didn't the game actually get produced?

[10:30] Well, the game had some, I don't know if you played the game or are familiar with it,

[10:33] but we were trying to do some pretty far fetched royal sets.

[10:38] In those days, you pretty much had your standard 3 ball play game.

[10:43] You had the extra ball over here.

[10:45] You had this over there.

[10:46] You had these basic things that were pretty much in every pen ball.

[10:49] I thought it'd really be cool to do something different.

[10:51] Maybe implement sort of a wave structure to the game where it was you against the targets.

[10:58] You would basically stay in the saddle until you lost your lives.

[11:02] Much like a video game.

[11:04] So that was the premise of how we laid it out.

[11:07] Of course, as we all know, it didn't work out well.

[11:09] But it was an interesting concept at the time.

[11:12] Now, how did they not work well on tasks?

[11:15] Does that what happened?

[11:16] Yeah, it just didn't.

[11:17] It didn't run.

[11:18] It wasn't the cast box.

[11:21] It was not friendly to us.

[11:23] We tested about six weeks if I recall correctly.

[11:25] So we really gave it a good shot.

[11:28] The body was not coming to life.

[11:30] Right.

[11:32] As they say.

[11:34] Well, then you went to Firepower 2.

[11:37] Tell me about that one.

[11:39] Firepower 2 was what that was.

[11:42] Obviously, it's equal to Firepower.

[11:46] I wanted to do something a little bit more conventional at that point.

[11:49] I'd sort of, after doing that, I kind of felt,

[11:51] that's probably not the right way to go.

[11:53] I probably had to trace something a little bit more conventional.

[11:58] I like the idea of a ramp and getting the ball up.

[12:00] I've seen some old Erie Williams.

[12:03] He did a parachute game.

[12:04] You'd probably know this better than I,

[12:06] but he did this.

[12:06] It was one of his earlier parachute games.

[12:09] I want to say in 1940s, 50s, where there was an elevated wire form.

[12:13] There was a hole kicker that would shoot the ball.

[12:17] Yeah, they shoot the ball into the hole kicker.

[12:18] Then it would kick it up, kind of like free fall.

[12:21] Where it would shoot the ball up and over on top of a wire form.

[12:24] And then it would, you know, bring the ball back to the flipper.

[12:27] I thought, well, wouldn't it be cool if we could have a ramp view that

[12:30] would shoot a ball into a ramp, fly up over the play field and come back.

[12:34] Now, Zee-Non had already done it, but not with a wire form.

[12:37] They did it with a plastic tube.

[12:39] So I thought, you know, that's a good place to start.

[12:42] And I like, at the time,

[12:45] fire power was my all-time favorite game to play.

[12:48] And I love the rules.

[12:49] And I just love three ball-malfi ball.

[12:51] And, you know, the ease of that game was great to me,

[12:55] because it had really easy to understand rules yet that game would.

[12:59] You would like that game to win.

[13:00] And, you know, I think that's the magic.

[13:03] I think that's the magic in every game.

[13:05] You know, that had a lot to do with why fire power too happened.

[13:11] Well, you did pretty well.

[13:12] I mean, you saw 3400 units in 1983.

[13:16] That's actually a pretty good sales number.

[13:19] Yeah, those were tough times.

[13:22] Games were not selling big in those days.

[13:23] As, you know, we were getting hit from all sides with, you know, video game on slides.

[13:29] But the industry wasn't bad shape back then.

[13:32] So, yeah, that was kind of a goal spot for us, you know.

[13:37] Now, how do you think that the fire power name helped your game sales at all?

[13:42] Or do you think that had nothing to do with it?

[13:44] I think it had very little to do with it, to be honest.

[13:47] Okay.

[13:48] I think, you know, I think that, on a level,

[13:52] but I think beyond that, I can't really say that anybody really, you know,

[13:57] I've never had that said to me where,

[13:59] God, what a great sequel, you know, typically people don't talk about much at all.

[14:03] Right. Right.

[14:05] Now, you then you went and did pen and fever, which was a Williams pitch and bat.

[14:11] Now, how did you get involved with doing baseball games for Williams?

[14:16] Again, this is something that I seeked out and went after.

[14:21] I asked Steve Gordak if he would have a problem.

[14:24] If I laid out a baseball game, I was excited about him.

[14:27] I played baseball as a kid and I always loved those games.

[14:31] And I kind of had a nostalgic bug while I was doing that.

[14:37] You know, when I was designing games, I did that a couple of times.

[14:40] But I just, I loved them and I just wanted to make something that would be,

[14:44] you know, I thought it'd be fun again.

[14:45] I've been a while since people had seen one.

[14:48] And, you know, we saw quite a few of them.

[14:50] Gains that okay, we had the consecutive home run feature in there,

[14:54] which was really fun for people.

[14:57] You know, it was something that I just wanted to do, you know.

[15:01] Okay, no, I mean, did that, you know, not to jump too far ahead,

[15:05] but then in round 1992-ish, 91, as I should say,

[15:12] a slugfest came out and you were the designer of that game too.

[15:16] Was that, did you get this reputation at Williams as kind of being the baseball guy?

[15:21] I did after I did the second one.

[15:24] But again, that was inspired by the desire to, I wanted to build a game around,

[15:32] winning baseball cards.

[15:33] You know, that's where that happened.

[15:35] baseball cards were extremely popular then.

[15:37] My kids were collecting, I mean, was a huge thing again.

[15:40] I remember that when I was a kid and I thought, wow, wow.

[15:42] You know, what if the game spits these things out and you got a home run,

[15:45] you got a couple of cards, all cool, that'd be.

[15:47] So, you know, that kind of inspired that.

[15:49] And again, I went and said, hey, I'd like to do another baseball game.

[15:53] What do you think?

[15:54] So, you know, they went for it.

[15:57] And that was, of course, under WPC, I believe that was a whole right system.

[16:01] All we said are rules.

[16:02] We could do all kinds of stuff with it.

[16:05] You know, and did.

[16:06] We had talked about putting a man run, you know, in there early on.

[16:10] And kind of said, you know what?

[16:12] There's a dot matrix thing happening.

[16:15] That's coming up because we were prototyping it on a couple other games.

[16:18] I think Steve's Terminator was around the same time.

[16:21] Right.

[16:21] And actually, the success came out before Terminator, I believe.

[16:24] Yes, it did.

[16:25] Right before.

[16:26] And we ain't, Steve was pioneering and working with that display.

[16:30] But we kind of, and it was kind of, we just kind of hopped in and grabbed it.

[16:34] It was like a timing thing.

[16:35] They were putting the engine errors.

[16:36] We're pretty much done with it.

[16:37] We had to work in and I thought, hey, you know,

[16:40] this needs to go in the baseball game.

[16:42] We can have, we can have another game in here.

[16:45] We can do a lot with the video mode dying.

[16:47] I mean, you know, so that was really an issue of timing.

[16:50] But I think Terminator was slated to be the first game to have that.

[16:53] Right.

[16:54] So now, now the, the whole.

[16:56] If your customers are anything nasty out of that,

[16:59] I think everybody was pretty much agreeable because it wasn't a pinball.

[17:02] It was a novelty game.

[17:04] Right.

[17:05] Now that a whole car dispenser thing,

[17:08] you know, then they came out with that hot shots game,

[17:11] which was the basketball game that had the car dispenser,

[17:14] too. Were you involved with that at all?

[17:16] No, I was not.

[17:17] But they took your car dispenser idea and recycled it into that game.

[17:22] Yes, companies making brass months in the mechanical engineering.

[17:26] And a lot of that stuff gets kind of tossed onto the next game that can use it, you know.

[17:31] Just as a way because I'll tell you,

[17:33] novelty games you're looking at,

[17:35] looking at much lower sales across the board, they would, you know,

[17:38] they were seasonal for one thing.

[17:39] A baseball game is a very seasonal thing.

[17:42] Just to clear, you know, 1500 or so maybe in the first season,

[17:47] and you might come back and build it again the next season,

[17:50] you might do it again.

[17:51] You know, the following season, but it was always only during the baseball season

[17:54] and toward the middle of summer.

[17:56] And, you know, so when you had the opportunity,

[17:58] you would try to burn up inventory on the next game.

[18:01] So it seemed like a good thing to do with the basketball game.

[18:05] Now, Slugfest did really well.

[18:07] It seemed that Williams actually made that in two entirely different runs,

[18:11] maybe based on your seasonal thing.

[18:14] That's correct.

[18:15] Yeah, we did.

[18:17] Actually, I think there were, I thought there were three runs.

[18:20] I thought it was.

[18:23] Obviously, the first year we built it was, what did you say, 92?

[18:26] 91, actually came out in 91.

[18:29] Okay, so up until I would say 90.

[18:35] Part of, I think in the spring in 93, they both sound too.

[18:37] I could be mistaken, but, you know, not big runs, you know, maybe 500 here,

[18:42] and I kind of kept this going.

[18:43] We had the thing build and design, so it was not a big deal to

[18:48] fire a backup on the line, you know.

[18:50] That must have kind of made you feel good, especially since

[18:53] Williams did not like to go back and re-en- and change the line again for something

[19:00] in such a short order.

[19:02] And here they did that on your game.

[19:04] Well, the only reason they did that was if there was ample demand for it.

[19:10] Right.

[19:11] Otherwise, no, they wouldn't have.

[19:13] I can guarantee you.

[19:16] Well, the skip back, go back and back where we were at right after pen and fever,

[19:22] you did like Sorcerer and Road Kings.

[19:24] Tell me about those two games.

[19:27] Sorcerer was, that was kind of a transition point for me.

[19:34] I think at the time, what's working with, I think the program on that game was

[19:38] Ed Sahaki if I'm not mistaken.

[19:41] Ed and I kind of carried off and wanted to do something kind of on a magic,

[19:46] kind of a magic kind of theme, but not, you know, we couldn't spend a lot of money in those days.

[19:51] There were budgetary, a lot of budgetary constraints.

[19:54] At one point the game wasn't going to have speech.

[19:56] I had to fight for that with the president, you know, basically get all my needs and big for speech.

[20:02] They weren't going to do it.

[20:04] Too much money, you know, what not.

[20:06] So that was a tough time actually.

[20:08] That's why there was a whole lot of crazy stuff on the games, you know, at that point in time.

[20:14] So we were under a budget and under a pretty strict schedule.

[20:18] The recall we were, I forget who else was there.

[20:21] What other game was in front of us and what was behind us, but there was a little bit of a constraint

[20:25] and kind of hurrying it up and getting it out there and it really didn't get a,

[20:29] I didn't ever felt like it got a really fair shake, you know, sales wise because it kind of got bumped by the next game.

[20:35] Which we did a lot, we had to do it in those days because we had to move the product, you know, keep the factory going.

[20:39] So that was one of the deals, you know, at that time you made money when you could make it, you know.

[20:47] But Sorcerer was, you know, I thought it was a fun game.

[20:50] I enjoyed the top half of that play field a lot.

[20:53] That three bank shot with the kind of weird place flipper.

[20:56] I mean, I have memories of Cordack.

[21:01] That's when I had some good Cordack arguments.

[21:04] And I kind of locked horns on the rules.

[21:06] There were some things I was doing that he didn't particularly care for.

[21:10] I don't remember exactly what, but he made a suggestion to me about doing something to

[21:18] clarify the three bank drops I get rule.

[21:21] I don't remember what the heck it was.

[21:22] He says, what the hell is, what is this?

[21:26] Yeah, but I had little of a lamp with something on the white one.

[21:28] He didn't know what it was or how we were, how it was going to play into the rules.

[21:34] And I kind of explained it.

[21:36] I was getting nowhere with the explanation.

[21:38] And finally, I just, okay Steve, you win.

[21:40] I'm changing it.

[21:43] So, you know, I think it was the other, I think we swapped the thing out for an extra ball or something

[21:47] up at the right hand side of the game.

[21:48] But I had some other feature there.

[21:49] Been a while.

[21:51] What was Cordack kind of a micro manager type guy?

[21:55] Not really on that game for some reason.

[21:58] He felt kind of attached to it.

[21:59] He kind of, I saw a lot more of him at that point.

[22:04] On the other two, I saw very little of him.

[22:08] I hardly ever, you know, you heard the over talk.

[22:11] I kind of felt like a, I don't like an orphan in a way.

[22:15] I guess, although I really didn't think I needed a parent, you know.

[22:21] I think there were just some weird things going on between management, upper management,

[22:26] my brother and things that were going on there that kind of made that uncomfortable for him.

[22:30] I was totally comfortable with it, but, you know, there was kind of weird.

[22:36] You know, most of why people do the things they do.

[22:37] How was it, was it strange that your brother was working in the, in the same department,

[22:44] basically doing the same thing as you and, you know, obviously he was pretty successful at this.

[22:49] Did this put a lot of pressure on you?

[22:53] Absolutely. It'd be a lie to say different.

[22:55] If it, I was very pressured by it, but I thought of it as good pressure.

[23:00] I never thought of it as negative orable.

[23:02] I went out in here.

[23:03] I hate this.

[23:04] It was productive for me.

[23:05] I think it made me a much better game designer in the end because, you know,

[23:11] when you're in a, when you're kind of like that, you're, you want to do a good job of what you're doing,

[23:17] but more importantly, here you're working in a creative field.

[23:19] You're in a very creative area where, you know, you're the boss.

[23:23] I mean, basically what you decide ends up on that game, you know.

[23:27] And so there's a great deal of responsibility that you feel toward coming up with just a great product

[23:34] every time.

[23:35] Well, I didn't let that stuff really bother me.

[23:37] I concentrated more on, I'm trying to do the best I could.

[23:40] You know, and but there are times when absolutely you felt like, you know, I got a top this guy.

[23:47] I was a little brother.

[23:48] I can't say here and not, you know, have a number one game or have a hit game,

[23:51] but you can't hit games all the time.

[23:53] You know, it just doesn't work that way.

[23:57] Unless you're Steve.

[24:00] Steve is very, very good.

[24:02] And, you know, there's no doubt about that.

[24:06] Now, did you two ever collaborate on games together?

[24:09] You know, did you give advice to Steve and Steve?

[24:12] Give advice to you?

[24:14] Okay, you know, yes.

[24:16] It was more Steve giving the advice, but you know, it was good advice.

[24:18] It was stuff that he felt.

[24:20] It was not anything either.

[24:22] It was never anything, you know, evil or overpowering.

[24:26] It was always what Steve is a really honest person.

[24:29] I'll tell you that about my brother.

[24:30] He never holds back.

[24:31] He says what he thinks, which I have a lot of respect for him for that.

[24:35] And he will always tell you the truth and never lie.

[24:38] And that is exactly what he will tell you.

[24:41] But sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's tough to take.

[24:44] The delivery isn't, you know, the way you want to hear it.

[24:47] Right.

[24:48] Now, there's back going on.

[24:49] And at the end of the day, it, most of the time,

[24:53] it was the best idea.

[24:54] It was the right thing to do.

[24:55] It made the game better.

[24:56] That's all that matters.

[24:57] Hmm.

[24:58] Now, was there ever a time that you gave him some advice that, you know,

[25:01] you could always go back and say, hey, I told you so.

[25:08] You know, not back then, but I would say recently,

[25:11] you know, we collaborate on the stuff he doesn't start.

[25:15] Yeah.

[25:16] You know, we'll say what do you think about that?

[25:18] I'll tell him what I think.

[25:19] And I'll go, I didn't think of that.

[25:20] It's a cool idea.

[25:22] So it's happening now.

[25:24] Once in a while, you know.

[25:26] All right.

[25:27] Now, road kings came out right after Steve's high speed.

[25:32] What, what was the thinking with road kings?

[25:34] And how did that game go?

[25:36] Road kings.

[25:37] Let's see.

[25:37] That started off.

[25:39] That's an interesting story.

[25:40] That road king started off as a game called Samurai,

[25:43] originally.

[25:45] And I had been struggling with the theme.

[25:48] I had a couple of themes in that game.

[25:50] I had another one like a sort of a futuristic city at one point.

[25:54] And then went to a samurai theme.

[25:57] And then finally settled on road kings.

[26:00] Just out of the popularity of the Mad Max movies that were out at the time.

[26:05] I thought that was really cool.

[26:06] And I thought that was something we could we could profit into this, you know,

[26:09] sort of post-apocalyptic Chicago with a, you know,

[26:13] biker gang cruising up like short drive.

[26:15] I mean, we had all the inspiration and ideas started just flowing, you know.

[26:21] Also, this is also a side line side note.

[26:24] The guy that broke that gang is now my boss at Play Mechanics.

[26:29] Really?

[26:30] Yeah.

[26:30] George Petro.

[26:32] Yeah.

[26:33] So he actually was going to school while he was programming the game.

[26:39] At one point, we wanted to start working on it.

[26:42] I wanted to start working with my own opinions.

[26:43] And at least, you know, put some stuff together and start moving on the Playfield.

[26:46] So George says, well, why don't you make the miniature,

[26:50] make the miniature like quarter scale, you know,

[26:53] piece of wood with some belly bees.

[26:55] And then all I heard out and make them work.

[26:56] So what we did is we shrunk down the Playfield drawing.

[27:00] And then attached it to a piece of a quarter inch plywood.

[27:02] And throughout a bunch of holes in it, wherever the light positions were.

[27:06] And so he basically had all his lamp routines done while he was down in Indiana.

[27:11] So on the school.

[27:12] So then he brought it up and then he'd work in the summer.

[27:14] And, you know, he just, he cracked on the game.

[27:18] Whenever he could, George was, you know, there's another,

[27:20] there's another success story about desire.

[27:22] When you want to do something bad enough, you can do anything.

[27:25] You know what I mean?

[27:26] Now, did you, did you try and use the same programmer for every one of your games?

[27:30] Or did you just, no?

[27:32] No, never.

[27:33] It doesn't work that way.

[27:34] Basically, you got, you got who was ever available, you know?

[27:38] I mean, you could try to get, you could try to get guys if things were,

[27:42] you know, kind of working out that way, lobby around, talk to guys and

[27:45] catch your idea, whoever, you know.

[27:47] And sometimes you could get, you know, somebody to go, hey, I really want to do that.

[27:51] And, you know, they'd work, they would do everything.

[27:54] They could get to that point and get that game.

[27:56] But usually it didn't work that way.

[27:58] It was more, you know, whoever was available.

[28:01] So you got, at least for me, I didn't, I didn't really have the option to pick

[28:07] my team.

[28:08] Now, there are people that could do that.

[28:09] But, I wasn't one of them.

[28:11] Now, at that point.

[28:12] Now, with, with road kings, you said that, you know, you had these multiple themes.

[28:16] Were, were you the one that was picking the themes or was this dictated to you?

[28:20] Oh, no, I was picking the themes.

[28:22] Okay.

[28:23] And, you, and the, yeah, the Mad Max thing that was a, that was a pretty strong,

[28:28] a pretty strong theme back then.

[28:31] Yeah. Oh, yeah.

[28:32] That was the, that was the shit for us, you know.

[28:35] We thought so.

[28:36] We thought that was going to do really well.

[28:38] And, in fact, it did do very well.

[28:39] And, in Germany, Germany was, they loved it.

[28:44] I think we sold 3,000 of those games in Germany alone at that time,

[28:47] which was pretty tough to do, you know.

[28:50] But the Germans get off on anything with a motorcycle.

[28:53] Anything western, anything, you know, they just love the action adventure, whatever it is.

[28:59] That stuff works really well over there.

[29:02] So then you did big guns.

[29:05] And, you know, the back box on big guns is, is so tall.

[29:09] Now, what was the inspiration behind that?

[29:12] Because we wanted to, I believe, we had a couple, there was a couple of things going on.

[29:16] We, we had a, we had a feature up in the game.

[29:22] It had a, it was like a little chinko game.

[29:25] Right.

[29:25] So there was some pretty heavy duty mechanics.

[29:28] It had to go into that up there and sit on the inside of the insert panel.

[29:32] So we were a little bit concerned about the room behind it.

[29:34] We also moved the speakers up on top.

[29:37] So I come from the bottom and put them up on top just to get, I guess, some of it was just to be different, you know.

[29:44] Did we do that in that game or not?

[29:46] You know what? I don't remember.

[29:46] I don't know if that's true.

[29:47] I can't say that.

[29:49] I think I did that on police force.

[29:51] Now, when you made a major design change of the, of the cabinet, you know, hardware like that,

[29:57] would it, would it, management give you a hard time about stuff like that?

[30:00] Um, not at that time.

[30:04] You know, I didn't really get, I didn't have too, I don't recall any, I didn't, like that really going on.

[30:10] Um, big guns were more designed around.

[30:13] This doesn't happen often, but it was designed around a component or a feature in the game,

[30:18] was designed around the catapult.

[30:19] It came off with the catapult and I was looking for a good spot to throw that.

[30:24] How would that work?

[30:25] How would that work?

[30:26] And, you know, what kind of a theme do I need to make that work?

[30:29] The whole castle thing kind of came to mind.

[30:32] And, um, so we started with the castle and we were looking at more of a medieval theme on Python and I.

[30:38] And it was sort of a lot of Python, maybe absolutely the observation that,

[30:44] um, those catapults looked ridiculous.

[30:47] We had to cover them up because the ball would hop into them and inadvertently.

[30:50] So we had to put these covered clear covers on the top of them.

[30:54] So rather than just arbitrary, it's not ever on Python and it is, it is awesome.

[31:00] Skyl, um, you know, the cannons.

[31:04] So the castle became a science fiction castle.

[31:08] And there were troops attacking the castle because of the, you know, it's the old story of good versus evil.

[31:13] There was the, uh, evil king and the tower and the princess and yet to rescue the princess.

[31:18] And so it all kind of came around.

[31:20] It was built around the catapults, in the honest.

[31:24] Which actually morphed into guns.

[31:27] Yes.

[31:28] Right.

[31:29] Right. Because you just, you just didn't like how and how would the, the overall look of the catapults?

[31:35] Well, the problem was, again, we couldn't, we couldn't protect them from

[31:40] balls hopping in over the top because it was a, the type of mechanism that,

[31:46] you had two problems.

[31:47] One was you had, you had to worry about balls hopping in there and getting caught when they weren't

[31:51] supposed to be in there.

[31:53] And you also had to worry about balls getting behind it when it fired because of the enormous

[31:58] power of the flippers and things going around the, around the game, you know.

[32:02] You had to worry about ball hangups always.

[32:05] That was a nightmare and it would creep only any, you know, basically you think,

[32:10] any, whatever you think about, you know, this is going to be fine and we'll need to worry about it.

[32:16] Nine times out of ten, you are always wrong.

[32:19] The ball will find a way to get hung up.

[32:21] Yeah, I mean.

[32:22] Right.

[32:23] So that was kind of a double-edged sword.

[32:25] We really didn't have much of a choice.

[32:26] We had to cover him with something.

[32:28] So, now sort of a plastic dom and then we thought, okay, well, let's make him look nice.

[32:33] That's sort of in the guns, you know, makes sense.

[32:35] So these catapults weren't anything like, say, the catapult on medieval madness then?

[32:40] No.

[32:41] No, not at all.

[32:42] This is a really good catapult.

[32:44] I mean, absolutely.

[32:46] I've used it on several games.

[32:48] I mean, it will fling the ball through the air, three inches above the play field surface.

[32:53] And make the ball fall ass.

[32:55] Not even.

[32:55] Yeah.

[32:58] It's just a cool thing, but you had to be really good.

[33:00] Well, you used it.

[33:01] It made it really, you know, you were really limited or you could put the thing.

[33:06] I kind of learned my catapult lesson on big guns.

[33:09] Don't put them in the middle of a play field.

[33:12] All right.

[33:12] Then you worked on taxi too next, right?

[33:18] Correct.

[33:19] And now, was taxi collaborative effort with a bunch of guys?

[33:22] It's just kind of seemed that way.

[33:24] It was pretty, I found myself.

[33:28] Okay.

[33:28] The pretty much drove the cab on that one.

[33:32] A lot of Python.

[33:33] Python was, you know, it was not.

[33:37] It was just nuts and it was great.

[33:38] I mean, we were making good stuff.

[33:41] The game went together really smooth.

[33:43] The shots worked.

[33:45] You know, the characters.

[33:46] That was a really goofy thing.

[33:48] It was just goofy, you know.

[33:49] It's just about being goofy or just having fun.

[33:52] There was no serious, you know, let's make a taxi game, you know.

[33:56] It didn't start off as, you know, as it wound up.

[34:00] It was, it did start as taxi.

[34:03] And, you know, was built into this just goofy ass playground of crazy shit going on.

[34:09] Now, did you have any, did you pick, help pick any of the characters that were, you know,

[34:14] in the taxi theme?

[34:16] I think the only character I picked was Dracula.

[34:19] And maybe the Maryland character.

[34:21] Now, you guys had the whole Maryland thing when you got in a sort of issue with the Maryland.

[34:31] Yeah.

[34:31] I mean, Roger Richmond agency who owns Maryland, Monroe's estate.

[34:37] Sort of caught one that we were doing.

[34:40] I don't remember exactly whether or not we, I think what we did was we called that.

[34:44] Somebody, somebody I forget who said, you know, if you guys check this out,

[34:47] if you guys like done any research, you know, and I go, well, it's not really Maryland,

[34:51] but they're calling it Maryland.

[34:53] You could have a problem.

[34:55] So we found out who owned the estate and sent down the information and they go,

[34:59] you owe us some money if you're going to keep doing that.

[35:02] And we went, okay, well, we're going to change it to Lola.

[35:08] So that's how that occurred.

[35:09] We actually, we fired the first shot across the ballot.

[35:12] Now, why Lola as a substitute name?

[35:18] Very sprucely on her legs.

[35:21] If you look at the care, turn the back glass,

[35:24] that's cracking me up to this guy.

[35:26] It's a little bit, she looks a little manly.

[35:30] So Lola was an old kinksong that I knew was about a,

[35:34] right guy who hangs out in the bar and he meets this beautiful look and that best.

[35:38] Yeah, it's a song about a transvestite, right?

[35:41] No.

[35:42] That kind of came to mind.

[35:43] Now, did Python do the art for the taxi back glass?

[35:50] Yes.

[35:50] Now, did Python do this on purpose kind of this manly figure?

[35:55] I don't think so.

[35:57] No, I think he intended it to be, he liked big women.

[36:01] Python was a fan of Amazon women.

[36:04] You know, I thought what he would call them, Amazonia.

[36:07] You know, that was his thing.

[36:08] You love big women.

[36:09] So he made her look really big and I think in the process of that,

[36:12] she just kind of grew some mighty big legs, you know.

[36:16] She's, I mean, if you all you got to do is add some hair and,

[36:20] pretty close.

[36:22] Pretty close to a man's legs.

[36:23] I always thought, oh, I don't know.

[36:25] And I don't mean that in a nasty or kind of sending way.

[36:28] It's just the way that I saw it, you know.

[36:31] Right.

[36:31] I don't know if other people saw that, but that's what I saw.

[36:35] Huh.

[36:36] Oh.

[36:37] Now, you went, the next game you did, it looks like it was police force.

[36:40] Now, the police force, did that start out as police force?

[36:43] Or was there another theme?

[36:45] No, that's sort of a, we were not as bad men.

[36:48] We, we were going to go after bad men.

[36:51] And we had a complete, the game was pretty much, I would say, at the,

[36:56] I don't know, the concept was 100% done for it.

[36:59] We had pretty much everything figured out where,

[37:02] where, what was going to be where, without having your working knowledge of the script.

[37:08] We hadn't seen a script.

[37:09] We hadn't had a deal.

[37:10] I knew the movie was coming up, but we didn't know who was going to get it.

[37:13] So we made a play for it.

[37:14] And we were not successful in getting the theme.

[37:20] Did he?

[37:20] He's got the theme.

[37:21] So we didn't, I didn't get to do that.

[37:24] So we had to kind of change things around a little bit.

[37:26] And, and I came up with the police force deal.

[37:30] And, you know, very, very asked for it.

[37:32] And I came with me.

[37:33] That was kind of a collaborative effort.

[37:36] Now, when you did a collaborative effort, was it, was that an easier thing to do,

[37:41] or a harder thing, or was it one of those things where there's, you know,

[37:45] too many cooks ruling the stew, or how does that work?

[37:49] Well, given the, the personalities at the time,

[37:54] there he was, you know, he was, he was wanting, he was, he had some time on his hands,

[37:58] and we needed to get the thing done fairly quickly.

[38:02] We had another damn behind it coming again, you know.

[38:05] The push came to shove, so we kind of teamed up just to,

[38:08] he was a much faster gun than I was with a pencil.

[38:11] He could, in those days, we were drawing games by hand.

[38:13] And I would come in and, you know, we would talk about the features.

[38:17] And I kind of, I guess I could sort of manage that, you know, way.

[38:21] And I'll very withdraw up everything and make it happen.

[38:25] So, kind of Python as the, as the guy with the inspiration,

[38:29] and me as the, I would say producer.

[38:32] And Barry, you know, would basically make everything happen and make the shots work.

[38:37] And all that stuff.

[38:38] So, it was kind of a different, that was a different role for me, you know.

[38:42] No question.

[38:45] But I did exactly why the Hurley came, but there was, I think,

[38:50] some other damn easy to happen.

[38:52] And we needed to crack the thing out fairly quickly.

[38:56] Now, another one that you did that was actually really,

[39:01] I mean, it's game I really, really like is, is diner.

[39:05] Now, who came up with that theme?

[39:08] Actually, that was myself.

[39:10] And guy by the name of Mark Springer.

[39:14] Guy who did the fire and did some other stuff, did some great stuff.

[39:18] Mark and I worked on that.

[39:21] We both kind of liked the idea of doing a, you know, a 40-50s era,

[39:26] sort of Pullman card diner.

[39:28] That's kind of where that started.

[39:30] And I was pretty much, I was in the doing this nostalgic thing at that time.

[39:33] You know, that was really a cool thing for me.

[39:34] I just thought, I was a collector or enjoyed, history, I enjoyed,

[39:39] you know, that era a lot.

[39:40] And I thought, you know, this would look great in people's basements.

[39:43] Anybody that wants to do a game room or just would fit into a restaurant,

[39:47] an environment or atmosphere.

[39:48] This would, it's a fit, you know.

[39:50] I just thought it would be a fit.

[39:52] And so, that's where we started with that.

[39:54] And the character thing came in there also.

[39:58] That kind of came off taxi at that point, I believe.

[40:03] And we sort of integrated a lot of that same interaction with the characters that taxi had.

[40:08] It worked so well on taxi.

[40:10] And I thought, you know, let's do this again.

[40:11] Well, we want to use some more controversial characters this time.

[40:14] Let's use Manuel Noriega.

[40:15] Let's use Margaret Datcher.

[40:17] Let's use, you know, okay, the Mexican guy, the little Pepe guy.

[40:23] That's actually Manuel Noriega.

[40:28] And how was management's reaction to this?

[40:30] Was there any of this political and correctness thing going on?

[40:34] I'll tell you at that time, there was none of that.

[40:36] I mean, we were a little bit worried about Ronald Reagan.

[40:39] We put a roller coaster.

[40:40] That was a little bit.

[40:41] I remember that was a little bit, oh, I don't know about that, you know.

[40:45] But aside from that, no, no one, you know, I mean, everybody was, we were,

[40:50] we didn't have life and thing, you know.

[40:52] So we needed to like, we all felt like we needed to put a little extra punch in the game somehow,

[40:56] you know, maybe this would help pull that off, you know, certainly make it amusing.

[41:01] I mean, you know, there really wasn't a lot of argument from upstairs.

[41:08] Not much at all.

[41:10] And the kind of three-dimensional backlash with the characters kind of like on spring.

[41:16] So when the game moves, they bounce back and forth.

[41:19] Was that your idea?

[41:20] Yes. Originally, well,

[41:23] budgetary constraints, originally those were going to be on, they were going to be

[41:27] soul-knowing operated so that when you serve the customer or the customer will pop up in the window.

[41:32] And you know, vibrate around or shake around and the world was doing the little speech call.

[41:38] You know, that was going to be, that was planned, that was going to be an interactive feature of the game.

[41:41] But the budget came and got us again, you know.

[41:45] We couldn't do it.

[41:46] So we spring-mounted them and just had them kind of flopping around.

[41:50] That would have been cool.

[41:52] I think that would have been really cool.

[41:54] Yeah, no, I think that would have been a really cool idea too.

[41:58] You kind of ruined it for me now because now I got a different...

[42:01] Sorry about that.

[42:03] You asked.

[42:07] No, it's still like, I really like Diner.

[42:09] I think it's a really, I think it's a great game.

[42:13] Certainly one of the better games of that whole system 11 era.

[42:16] I think it's a great effort.

[42:18] So I mean, and the, you know, I like the political incorrectness as sick as that may sound.

[42:25] Right, you know.

[42:27] But...

[42:34] Now, what involvement did you have with Riverbolt Gambler?

[42:39] Not much at all.

[42:40] Other than the, I did some Dan Fordon who was doing the sound on that game.

[42:46] He wanted me to sing this little ditty.

[42:49] I was like, I can't.

[42:50] What are you talking about?

[42:51] You want me to sing?

[42:52] Yeah, we want you to sing the song.

[42:54] Here it is.

[42:54] And you like sang it for me.

[42:56] Because I want you to picture like Gal Johnson, you know, like a, like a menstrual.

[43:01] And you're doing this Riverbolt, the little tune about the Riverbolt Gambler.

[43:05] And I'm like, I don't know.

[43:08] So I did it.

[43:08] I don't know what the hell I drank or, or smoke before I did it, but I did it.

[43:12] And how did you feel that came out?

[43:15] I thought it was great.

[43:17] It played out great in the game, you know.

[43:20] I thought it was cool.

[43:21] Yeah, I mean, had you ever done any singing before this?

[43:25] I sang back around in a band.

[43:27] Actually, I noticed I heard Eugene and Steve on your previous podcast.

[43:32] None of them talked about the band that we had.

[43:34] We had a band we were called Brain Damage.

[43:37] And we would play it like parties, you know.

[43:40] Mostly people that worked in the industry a lot of people remember us.

[43:43] We were around in those days, Larry DeMarne, several people that were around.

[43:48] But yeah, we did that for fun.

[43:49] No.

[43:50] So yeah, I did some background singing in those days.

[43:52] So Steve played guitar and you did some singing.

[43:57] And what did Eugene do?

[43:59] The keyboards and sang.

[44:02] Eugene is a fantastic keyboard player and a very good composer.

[44:07] He wrote some really wild songs.

[44:09] You know, some great stuff that we still laugh about today.

[44:12] Sound called Love Doll, which was, you know, I'll send you the lyrics of that.

[44:19] Why are they that easy?

[44:21] Oh, they're easy.

[44:23] Not too bad.

[44:25] And when did the band break up?

[44:28] God, I want to say, right before I got married, which was 1983.

[44:34] So 82 in there, 82, 83.

[44:38] And who was drumming?

[44:41] He was not in the industry.

[44:42] He was a friend of ours.

[44:44] We had two drummers.

[44:47] We had to get by the name of Mike.

[44:49] I don't remember his last name, but these guys were unrelated to the industry.

[44:53] They were not involved.

[44:56] Even I and Eugene were the only three left.

[44:58] We used to practice at Williams at one point.

[45:01] And how did that go?

[45:04] It was great.

[45:04] We'd do it upstairs in engineering.

[45:06] You know, after we would leave, we would like set up our job in

[45:09] and like play in the engineering room, you know.

[45:13] Those are fun days.

[45:17] All right, we're going to take a little break of talking with Mark Richie

[45:20] and we'll be right back after this message.

[45:23] Deep in the forest of eastern Canada, you will find something

[45:27] well ground breaking and something that's very, very pinball.

[45:34] But something that's really, really small.

[45:38] Presenting classic play field reproductions.

[45:41] Two guys in their basement.

[45:44] We've got the passion.

[45:46] We've got the gear.

[45:47] And we've got the quality.

[45:48] Doing our very best to remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts.

[45:55] Classic play field reproductions.

[45:59] Play fields.

[46:00] Backlaces.

[46:03] Plastic sets.

[46:07] On the web at classicplayfields.com.

[46:11] This portion of Topcast is brought to you by Pin Game Journal.

[46:15] Covering the world of pinball is them online at www.pingamejournal.com.

[46:21] All right, we're back with Mark Richie of Williams and Capcom pinball.

[46:25] Okay, well, we talked about slugfest.

[46:28] Now, just a couple of little questions about that that we didn't really talk about much.

[46:35] Now, you talked about the running man unit.

[46:37] You felt that the dot matrix display kind of superseded the ability to actually have a running man unit.

[46:44] So, you mean the running man unit wasn't having really nothing based with money.

[46:48] It was just that we can do the same thing with the dot matrix and we just don't need it.

[46:53] No, I think that what's more about kind of bringing things to you a little bit.

[46:58] You know, there was a lot of talk about the man running unit and the need to put it in the game.

[47:02] I guess at some point we just thought, you know what?

[47:05] It's been done.

[47:06] It's nice.

[47:07] It's cool.

[47:08] But what if we could do something?

[47:09] You know, I mean, this was cutting edge technology at the time and then we were all about that.

[47:13] We wanted to, you know, what if we put a base runner in there where you can steal bases

[47:18] and have an actual interactive part of the game rather than something you watch, you know,

[47:23] after the fact.

[47:24] So, I think that was really the thing that pushed it forward.

[47:30] Now, in the whole development of the dot matrix, you know, the software and the graphics to do all that,

[47:37] did that hamper, you know, your production timelines or anything to make all that stuff happen?

[47:44] No, actually it didn't.

[47:47] We were pretty far ahead with most of that stuff at the time.

[47:50] A lot of it, like I said, I think Terminator was being developed around the same time.

[47:56] Had got no out of that stuff out of the way, the interface, the way that we were going to talk to

[48:02] it with our work and that sort of thing.

[48:04] We figured out what we needed to use on the development level to generate, you know,

[48:08] the animations and what not.

[48:09] So, a lot of it had been figured out already.

[48:11] So, it was pretty much a step in the saddle thing for me, you know.

[48:16] Now, did you guys, you know, like, data ease came out with the whole dot matrix thing before you guys?

[48:21] Did you guys have to feel pressure because of that to develop the dot matrix?

[48:30] That's an interesting question and, you know, I don't exactly recall if I can't imagine data

[48:37] eases doing anything before we did those days.

[48:42] I really don't remember what the situation was, how we felt about that.

[48:48] I'm going to have to take the fifth on that one.

[48:49] Okay. Now, I mean, when speaking of which, I mean, did you guys,

[48:55] you know, what was your outlook on data ease at the time?

[48:58] I mean, did you really feel like they were always like, you know, copying you guys

[49:02] or nipping at your heels or what?

[49:05] Oh, yeah, well, we knew there were copying us.

[49:07] We knew that they were, that was going on.

[49:10] You know, I knew it was still.

[49:13] I mean, you look at games like Secret Service.

[49:17] You know, I don't need to tell you this stuff because everybody knows, you know,

[49:21] that was not, that was basically a flip of a game that we were working on.

[49:26] High speed.

[49:28] And, you know, I think that,

[49:32] I think what makes you mad when you're in that position is you feel like you're doing all this work

[49:36] to innovate and really try to do something cool and different, you know,

[49:40] capture people's imaginations and get them to play in like your games.

[49:44] And then you see other people just kind of step in and grab stuff and just not, you know,

[49:48] really work at doing anything original kind of pisses you off, you know.

[49:54] So I think, I think there was a, we all felt like there were, yeah, there were.

[49:58] Somebody was getting too much information at Data East, you know, we don't know how that happened,

[50:04] but yeah, definitely it was, it was a drag.

[50:07] So you feel that there was some sort of internal mold almost going on?

[50:12] I don't know. I can't speak to that. I don't know. It was just very interesting set of,

[50:18] you know, the way things happen, the timeframes that they happen then.

[50:22] You know, it's unfair to know how or why, but it's what I noticed about the,

[50:29] you know, at that time.

[50:33] Yeah, because I mean, Joe worked at, you know, Joe Camico worked at William, so, you know,

[50:42] I'm sure maybe he had some friends there still.

[50:45] So deep. So very well being.

[50:47] Right.

[50:48] Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Maybe this should be off the record, but I've even heard

[50:54] that Larry DeMar was on like Joe's bowling team and that there was always kind of like this rumor

[51:01] in the background that Larry was feeding Joe stuff kind of under the table. You know, while he was,

[51:07] you know, while Larry was obviously at Williams.

[51:10] I heard that rumor. I remember that. I can't, again, I can't. There's no verification of any of that, you know.

[51:16] Oh, absolutely none.

[51:19] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's just one of those industry rumors, but nobody, you know, obviously nobody

[51:23] ever could prove something like that. You know, but that just curious.

[51:29] But anyways, then after Slugfest, you did fishtails, which was, you know, frankly, you hit the ball

[51:35] out of the park on fishtails. I mean, that game, you know, like I'm in Michigan and, you know,

[51:40] we've got, you know, we're one of those states that's got, we got lakes everywhere. And I swear to

[51:44] God, everybody that's got a house on the lake once fishtails. You know, that game is so popular.

[51:52] Yeah, it's one of the toughest games to play too, you know. What do you mean?

[51:57] Well, it's really fast. It's just really, there's a lot of mean shots in that game. There's some

[52:02] nasty roll downs. There's some mean kick-pulse. I frankly, I was really surprised at it, but it did

[52:08] as well as it did because it was so tough to stand and sell with people like, you know, there was

[52:14] the rules where relatively simple. I mean, if you could make, not you could do really well, but

[52:18] sometimes you would just, I myself, to this day, I struggled to make shots on that game. I'm like,

[52:24] Martin, you widened. Why didn't you do that, you know? Just one of those things you could look

[52:30] through, I guess. But, you know, that game had probably the smoothest development cycle of any I

[52:37] ever worked on. It just went really, really smooth. We had a really good team. Tavik Manon,

[52:43] Art, I had Scott Sloan-Miani doing the dots at that time. That was one of his first games,

[52:48] I believe. So, a lot of guys were really, you know, confident to do great stuff trying to make

[52:56] their mark and video on guys like Eugene Gere. He was another guy that was doing dots on that game,

[53:02] Mark Pinocchio programmed it. It's just a great team. I mean, one thing's going to really well,

[53:07] you know, you don't forget it. And it's just one, they're getting one together smoothly. I didn't

[53:12] have a lot of problems with, you know, everything seemed to melt nicely right out of the day.

[53:18] It was a project to work on. We just had a blast, you know. Now, was the fish on top of the

[53:25] the back box? Was he ever designed to actually, you know, speak like, you know, like a Billy Bass?

[53:31] No, no. There was talk about that. We considered it, but, you know, the big thing there was,

[53:37] you know, in an arcade setting, you can't really, you can't rely on speeds or anything audio to

[53:44] do anything more than just a sort of a sideline, you know, special effect. You can't really do

[53:50] anything with the rules. And I think one of the ideas was that fish was going to tell you what to

[53:54] shoot at, you know, and I mean, the important information from the open, the left ramp or whatever.

[53:59] That was the idea I had for it. But we never, we just thought, you know, we're going to waste the audio

[54:05] on that. Let's just make it shake the whole damn game. That would be, that would be exciting.

[54:10] So we had this whole like vibration thing going on whenever the solenoid would go off. When it was

[54:16] cantered up on top of the back box, it created this like huge springboard, you know, which nobody knew

[54:21] at the time that was going to happen. But when we thought that we went, hey, forgive the speech,

[54:25] this is great. You know what I mean? This is a much cooler effect and we're going to get

[54:30] much more bounce for the back on that. Now why did that game, if that game was such a, you know,

[54:36] a tough shot game? Why did it go with the slightly shorter lightning flippers opposed to the

[54:43] standard ones? You were an educated man. I'll tell you why. That was a game was enjoying extreme

[54:51] popularity in France of all places. And France wanted lower game times. They wanted us to,

[54:58] they wanted us to make a tougher. And you know, they were pretty much calling the shots on what we

[55:03] were doing at that point. And a gentleman by the name, I'll have a second. Remember this,

[55:08] Demetri Kikules, who was our representative. He was a, he worked for distributor in France,

[55:15] our biggest one. And I think it was DDA, Salmone, Miranda. I don't remember the name of the PSD.

[55:22] What was the name of the company? So he would come out during, as we were like working on the game

[55:27] in the last, you know, usually in the final three, four weeks of the game before prototype,

[55:31] he'd come out and tell you what he wanted for, because we already been prototyping the game out there.

[55:36] So he had one and he would come back with all these ideas. And he says, we want to hit short

[55:41] in the flippers. We want you to put shorter flippers on it for our market. And we thought,

[55:46] you know, we're going to do not listen to this guy. He's going to take 3,000 games out of the game.

[55:52] Sure, we'll put shorter flippers on it for you. No problem. So we did that. And he actually helped us

[55:59] determine what the length was going to be. And you know, I was going to move the flippers back and

[56:03] do some other things, but it was going to screw up the shot line to do my style. That was out of the

[56:07] question. So we ended up, we ended up, I think, I want to say those, those were about three,

[56:13] 16th to 3 eighths of an inch shorter than the standard flipper. I don't remember exactly,

[56:21] but that was a big deal. And we kind of, we had to listen to this guy. Obviously he was big money,

[56:29] you know, because in the end, it is a business. No matter what, it's a business. You can't

[56:34] move side of that. It's really hard for me to fathom, though, anybody in France telling us what to do.

[56:39] I'm going to start striking Mark. I forget it. I got filled with he does very well over there still.

[56:46] So now, why did the US game ship with the shorter flippers too, though?

[56:52] That was, I think that was just an inventory decision. We just kind of thought how bad it's

[56:58] going to be. You know, we didn't. It's hard to know how big of a problem that can cause unless

[57:05] you see it on a couple hundred games. And at the time, you know, I played the game and played it

[57:10] and played it and played it with those short flippers. And I thought things would be fine. You know,

[57:14] I had no idea that it was going to come out the way it did. And, you know, it made things a lot

[57:19] more difficult. Probably just a question of myself getting used to something that I probably

[57:27] shouldn't have gotten used to, you know, because you're looking at it every day or staring at it,

[57:30] and you think, okay, this is all right. It's not so bad. I can stand the saddle. I can hit shots.

[57:34] What's the problem? I mean, but what I think is not what everybody else thinks. So,

[57:40] I think clearly that was, if I had the, if I had the sense that it was going to be that big of a

[57:45] problem, I would have never let it happen. Not for the stakes. I would have, we would have found a

[57:50] way to make sure that all United States games got standard flippers, you know. It is a regret because

[57:56] I'll tell you what my game here in the basement has standard flippers on it. Yeah, my, my fish tails

[58:02] has standard flippers too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now, do you have a, do you have a lot of games in your

[58:08] basement? No, I don't actually. I have Indiana Jones and I have fish tails. That's about it.

[58:15] And speaking of which, Indiana Jones, now that was another one that you just totally hit out of

[58:19] the park. And now, Indiana Jones being a wide body game and being a big, big theme. I mean,

[58:25] a big license. Now, how did you get that license? I mean, that's a killer opportunity that you got

[58:31] to work on that game, right? Totally. Totally. It was the best opportunity I ever had.

[58:37] Thanks to Roger Schabb and some other people who really, who really went out there and made it

[58:42] happen, Doug Watson. I had a lot of help with that game. There was no question. Let me get it, you know,

[58:49] I just had some really sharp ties that were doing a lot of the, a lot of the implementation and

[58:54] rules work in the background. Doug Watson, who sort of just took on, you know, not only the art,

[59:00] but came up with a lot of the rules and the packaging of the game and the concept of sort of

[59:05] blending all three movies that was, that was all of us, but Doug really made it happen. He came

[59:10] up with the titles and did just did a lot of outstanding work on that game. Brian Eddie was

[59:16] another guy who, you know, that was the first game known from that, the new ball trough.

[59:21] Right. That was Brian's baby. Brian kind of took that. He said to me at one point, the

[59:25] development says, this is I really think that we need to redesign this ball trough system. It's

[59:30] a pile of shit and I'm not going to make another game with it. I went, we're okay. You know, how

[59:36] we're going to fit that into the budget? He goes, well, we should, what we should do is find a way

[59:39] to fit it into all budgets. It shouldn't cost us. It should, it should be part of every game made

[59:45] from henceforth. And that was a brilliant idea and at that time we weren't making that way. And,

[59:51] you know, I certainly wasn't. And so Brian did a lot to make that happen, did a lot of the

[59:56] engineering work on that and kind of did it as a sideline project along with the programming of

[01:00:02] Indiana Jones in tandem, you know. And so a lot of people did a lot of excellent work on that game.

[01:00:08] So I can't sit here and take credit for it completely. I was the guy running the show certainly.

[01:00:14] You know, I was the guy who kind of put everything together, but these guys were just doing,

[01:00:20] they were doing fantastic things with the rules, you know. No, they would say to me, can you move

[01:00:25] this shot? Can you add this? Yeah, that, and I can go absolutely not a problem. That's a great idea.

[01:00:29] Done. So, you know, that's kind of how it went. Now it is, where there are a lot of toys that got

[01:00:35] deleted from the, from the final game. Actually, the only thing that wasn't there in the end,

[01:00:44] who was added in the end was the token play field on the left. The automatic field, that

[01:00:51] happened way later in the game. I had a, I had an upper level there, but it was, you know, kind of

[01:00:58] just a flat plan. Wasn't a whole light up there. It was like a ball runway and a ball with bounce

[01:01:02] around and come down the track. If you hit it hard enough, it would hit the outside track and come

[01:01:06] back to the wire form. So we had some of what you see now, but we came up with the whole stop

[01:01:14] the ball, drop it on the play field and then do the whole, you know, avoid the whole thing.

[01:01:20] The flipping play field, I thought was really a cool feature, but that, what did we take out?

[01:01:24] Not, at one point I remember we had a, we had a four engine panion clipper that we were going

[01:01:32] to put in there and we were going to run the motors on the airplane as the ball passed underneath

[01:01:37] on the wire forms. That was something that we were looking at doing, but that would not just,

[01:01:43] there was a lot of money and it wasn't that much paying for the block. So now it can. And then

[01:01:50] we set up the, the idle, right, or under the play field, bossy block, blocksy, and that was just,

[01:01:58] that just worked out fantastic. That was another thing that was just, what a cool idea.

[01:02:03] Yeah, the thing that kills me on that game is like just the amount of money it seems like it was

[01:02:08] spent between the idle and the mini play field and just, you know, and the, and the, all the,

[01:02:14] the gold and all the ball, all the, you know, the ball rails and everything. It's,

[01:02:18] God, it just seemed like that, that game was so expensive to make.

[01:02:24] It was, I got, and I got in a few more than one argument with, you know, we cast her over that.

[01:02:31] Which I think subsequently led me to kind of want to get out of there, you know, that was my last

[01:02:36] game for them. It was, it was kind of, it could, ugly a couple times. I just, things were going on

[01:02:41] there that I just didn't like, you know, but, you know, the game happened, the game happened great.

[01:02:46] And I think it's one of my best efforts ever, you know. I'm real proud of that game.

[01:02:51] Now how did you feel about the wide body format? Was that something you got to pick or was that

[01:02:55] dictated to you? No, I picked that. I, I went that route. I wanted to squeeze two more shots,

[01:03:01] you know, I wanted two more shots on the out, and those were the outside lines.

[01:03:06] Because I wanted to keep the ramps wide enough, although, with their position, they're not

[01:03:11] the easiest ramp shots in the, I think, I think things all balanced out in the end at some point, you know.

[01:03:19] We ended up getting exactly enough room to pull off the low shots on the outside and still have

[01:03:26] the ball popper. I'm sorry, the saucer between the ramp and the, and the, and the three bank and the

[01:03:33] center shot. So we really squeeze a lot of stuff in there and that's why that shot's maybe a little

[01:03:39] bit, a little tight, I've heard about it. It's about the tightness of that saucer shot on the left.

[01:03:45] We're the extra ballers. Yeah, it likes to bounce out of that saucer.

[01:03:50] What's that? Yeah, you're talking about the mode saucer, right?

[01:03:54] Correct. Yeah, and the ball doesn't, it just doesn't like to stick in there. It's kind of got a,

[01:03:59] doesn't like to see. Yeah, you know, was that designed on purpose that way or just kind of how it

[01:04:03] worked out? No, not at all. No, you, you had never done anything like that. I'm not exactly,

[01:04:10] by that happen, I think, I think our flippers were a little bit, a little bit overpowered for some

[01:04:15] of the closer shots, you know, with just why you got those string, air balls and bounce backs off

[01:04:21] the targets. Right. We ended up putting these big shields behind the wire for us so the ball would

[01:04:26] find out every time. Right. Right. They actually worked pretty well.

[01:04:33] It happens. I mean, I've got, I've gotten out with, still got it, you know. Now, was there ever

[01:04:40] any special like home version ROMs for Indiana Jones that you guys created for your own basements,

[01:04:46] you know, just for your games? No, but I wish we had. I wish we had.

[01:04:52] There was, I remember when we did the, when we were doing the, working on the speech for that game,

[01:05:00] we had John Rice Davies in the studio, Chris Tran or night. And he's going through and he's

[01:05:06] doing the jackpot sequences. Hit the jackpot. At one point he says, I mean, he was just totally playing

[01:05:12] along with us. I mean, it was, it was a natural thing in the world. He says, hit the fucking jackpot.

[01:05:18] And I wanted that, I wanted those ROMs so bad. I, I, I, Helen Chris Tran or to this day for those ROMs,

[01:05:24] for him to make me a set of ROMs that would play that back for me, you know. It was just, it was just one

[01:05:30] of those moments that happened, you know, once every 20 years. Right. And of course, I don't have those

[01:05:38] ROMs today. And of course, it's listening. Chris, can you, can you hook me up, man?

[01:05:43] And how was it working with that license? Was that an easy license to work with or did they

[01:05:48] require, were they pretty heavy handed? Not at all. Actually, they were, at first they were,

[01:05:54] they were really reluctant to think what they wanted was gun Indiana Jones series. They were

[01:05:59] pushing that. That was about to come out and unvideo tape and be, you know, it was a TV series,

[01:06:03] I think at one point. Not, not long before that. And of course, that flop. I kind of knew that

[01:06:09] was no flop. And I said, the other thing I thought was Indiana Jones is Indiana Jones. And he's

[01:06:15] about his three movies. He's not about young Indiana Jones. Nobody is going to know who that is.

[01:06:19] Or, you know, what impact is that going to have. And so we actually argued with them for the three

[01:06:25] movies against that. And we had, you know, we had maybe 20 minutes worth of opposition. And they

[01:06:32] kind of said, you know, that does make more sense. Let us see the layouts. So, you know, a couple days,

[01:06:37] we got into conversation and Doug was out there with us. And we just kind of gave my rough draft

[01:06:43] to the play field, showed them what we wanted to do and how we were going to involve each, you know,

[01:06:48] all these cool sequences from each of the movies. We had pretty much mapped out at that point.

[01:06:53] And then they went for it, you know, if I, this is cool. So, yeah, I don't think, I don't think

[01:07:00] young Indiana Jones really flapped. That wasn't the problem. The problem was that their star died.

[01:07:07] That was the problem. Okay. Yeah, I mean, that shut that whole series down when that guy died.

[01:07:15] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:07:18] No. I was glad that we got the opportunity to do, you know, the three movies and be able to

[01:07:23] package all that up together. And I thought that was a really cool thing. You know, because it's

[01:07:28] just that everything just sort of crosses lines with everything else, you know.

[01:07:33] Right. It's a, it's a very natural course of events for a game.

[01:07:37] Now, as part of the internal testing, you know, you guys would, would, like, test a machine

[01:07:46] inside the building, you know, like in your, in your, your cafeteria or at court at the

[01:07:51] bottom of the stairs and you'd also have them, you know, outside. Tell me a little bit about this

[01:07:55] and, you know, your product testing and how you guys did that. Now, we had a thing, we had a,

[01:08:02] I think called the Mel lab where we would build 12 prototypes. Once the game was approved,

[01:08:08] once we got passed, you know, got the program together in the whitewood phase out of the way,

[01:08:13] got everything working. We had these, and I had like, you know, they would have the

[01:08:17] printed art work on them. It would be like pretty much complete. You would be your last,

[01:08:22] sort of go at making any changes you wanted to make. And at the same time, we would, you know,

[01:08:28] pop one of them out into the cafeteria as soon as we got one bill, we would put it out there,

[01:08:33] primarily so people could kick it around and play it, but also see what was going to go wrong,

[01:08:36] immediately. Because you're still at a phase where you can make corrections and make changes

[01:08:40] relatively easily. So we did a lot of that early on, we'd build a game up and then, you know,

[01:08:46] first one done would go out, as you say, got by the stairs or in the cafeteria, and people would

[01:08:52] just beat it on the place. And you get comments from other designers, you know, people would,

[01:08:58] you know, everybody wants to check out your game, so you got more information, you know,

[01:09:02] you want it sometimes, but you know, it was awful. So that would last maybe, we would do that maybe,

[01:09:10] one of those would stay there anywhere from three weeks to three months, depending on what

[01:09:16] the demand for the game was. But we would try to keep one or two around, just so we could, you know,

[01:09:22] you would have manufacturing problems, you'd have things pop up the absolutely no idea

[01:09:28] about until you make, like I said before, you're around 100, 150 of them, you don't know where your

[01:09:32] problems are going to be, specifically with every game. So it takes that line sometimes to know,

[01:09:39] you know, what you need, what you need to take care of. And so we would keep these games around,

[01:09:43] so that we could go back and refer to them and, you know, find the problem and then fix the problem

[01:09:48] on that game. And then we would implement a change to the line and correct everything on the line.

[01:09:55] So I have a couple of uses, you know. Right. Now what, I mean, what was the, you know, you left

[01:10:03] Williams and you went to Capcom. How did that whole transition occur? And I mean, you know,

[01:10:10] where the guys at Williams, were they pretty mad at you or were they supportive or, you know,

[01:10:14] how did that whole thing, you know, transpire? Well, it started a guy by the name of René and

[01:10:23] Lopez, who was working for a company called Ramstar at the time, which was, I had no idea about

[01:10:29] this at the time, but Ramstar was actually funded by a Capcom. And René says, you know,

[01:10:36] I was like, you can go over here and help us, you know, we want to make fun of. I said,

[01:10:39] you're kidding me. And this, you know, this, we had talked about this a couple of times.

[01:10:43] And he came back in 93 and said, I'm dead serious. We have the capital. We're going to get started.

[01:10:48] We want you to help us with it. You know, is this something you'd want to do? And I thought,

[01:10:55] absolutely, this is something I want to do. It was a tremendous opportunity for me to grow

[01:11:01] in areas that probably, you know, I would probably never be able to, I would never have those

[01:11:08] opportunities at Williams at that time. So this was a different opportunity with something that I

[01:11:13] was really familiar with, you know. So I hired on there as a director of engineering and actually

[01:11:19] came in and, you know, sort of helped them set up, getting all the things they would need to

[01:11:25] produce and manufacture pinball machines to develop a development standpoint first, obviously.

[01:11:30] And then, you know, it was involved with pretty much every piece of it all the way through.

[01:11:36] Why do I leave Williams? You know, it comes a point in time in your life when you just,

[01:11:43] you just think about yourself maybe a little more than other people do and you just want

[01:11:47] better for yourself just that, you know, maybe it's time I do this, you know, just make a change.

[01:11:54] You know, it wasn't that I wasn't getting anywhere and not having success on the contrary.

[01:11:58] I just built two of the best games of my career, you know. So it wasn't about that. The

[01:12:05] management at Williams was a little heavy-handed. I didn't get along really well with me on the

[01:12:10] Castro. I didn't like his style. So I kind of took that personally. I wanted out of there, you know,

[01:12:16] mainly to get away from that. But so there was a little bit of, a little bit of angst in just wanting to,

[01:12:22] you know, jump over to another company and kick their ass because that's exciting, you know. No

[01:12:28] question about it. How did they, when you left, how did Williams take that? They were mad.

[01:12:34] They were terribly mad. They, you know, we had all signed these one year, non-disclosure,

[01:12:40] non-compete clauses. So I signed one too. And what that said basically was that you could not design

[01:12:47] or be involved with on the level you were involved at Williams as I understood it.

[01:12:52] You know, you couldn't, you couldn't do any of that for a year after you left. So I honored that.

[01:12:58] And I took a different job. I was a game designer at Williams. At Catcom, I was director of engineering.

[01:13:03] So it was a step up. It was an increase in salary. It was a bunch of things. But it was not

[01:13:08] tinball design. You know, I honored, pretty much honored to contract there. Contrary to Williams,

[01:13:13] believe they sued me, we had a three-year battle over that. Then basically it didn't end until

[01:13:21] about 1996. You know. And what was the outcome? It was a, it came to a push in the end.

[01:13:30] It basically doesn't drop, they dropped their push because the company, Catcom, kind of one under,

[01:13:37] you know, that was the end of it. There was no longer a threat. So there was no longer a need to

[01:13:41] continue with the lawsuits. So the end of Catcom is really what brought the end of the lawsuits?

[01:13:48] I think so. Yeah, because I was still being, you know, harassed and sued and bothered by this.

[01:13:53] Pretty much right to the end, as I recall.

[01:13:57] Were you pretty bitter about this? I was really bitter. I was then, you know, and then, yeah,

[01:14:02] back then I was very bitter. I didn't want to talk about it. I went through a tremendous

[01:14:07] period of bitterness after that. I'm not proud of that, but you know, it happened.

[01:14:12] Now was, at the time, Williams was trying to sue Catcom over a lot of other pinball-related issues,

[01:14:20] too, not related to you, but just like general pinball stuff, right? Right, right.

[01:14:25] I think it was more about harassment than anything. I think that, I think internally,

[01:14:30] that Williams was having that share of problems, too. I wasn't there for that. I can't really

[01:14:36] speak to that, but I know that from people that were there that told me, you know, subsequently,

[01:14:40] that, hey, you know, that place was up for grabs. There was management issues. Everybody was going

[01:14:45] in 15 directions. It was crazy. You know, and you could kind of see it in the games. The games were

[01:14:51] not as strong. I would say from 94 out to, until you had stuff like attack from Mars, you know,

[01:14:59] those games were just kind of, they were kind of iffy. They weren't, they certainly weren't their

[01:15:03] best work, not in my opinion. So we kind of knew that something was up over there, you know, and

[01:15:10] you know, I don't know about this whole magic versus, you know, theater magic and all that

[01:15:16] stuff that was going on. I mean, there was a lot of talk about that, you know, you could say that,

[01:15:20] I guess, if you wanted to. You mean that Williams kind of got, got, got win that you guys were doing

[01:15:26] a magic game and came out with their own magic game. Yeah, I mean, you can, you can say that if you want.

[01:15:33] I've never been, you know, I've never felt like they were trying to steal what we were doing,

[01:15:37] but I do think that we definitely, you know, we put a little, we put a little scare into them

[01:15:43] over there because here was a company that was doing all new stuff with their hardware and doing

[01:15:47] really cool stuff for the operator, you know, our games were well built. They were,

[01:15:52] they may not have been that much fun out of the gate, you know, I mean, magic was a pretty cool game.

[01:15:56] I thought, um, magic's great game. Yeah, we, there are some stuff going on in there that,

[01:16:02] we're, we're, these were innovations that no one had seen for Penn Bonn Williams never did any stuff

[01:16:07] like this. We had, we had short circuit protection in there. We had to let the light bulb, you know,

[01:16:12] basically you would blow a light bulb in the game and tell you exactly where the light bulb was born.

[01:16:17] Right, right. There was no general, there was no general illumination. Everything was computer

[01:16:21] controlled when it come to lights. Right. That's correct. Everything was under process or control.

[01:16:29] No, Capcom did a great job. I mean, they made, they had some little things that I didn't like,

[01:16:34] like, you know, like the, the wiring going to the switches under the play field. I think it was

[01:16:39] too thin of gauge wire in the, in the surface mount on that switch board in the back box,

[01:16:44] but those are pretty, and maybe the size of the capacitors on the power supply. But, you know,

[01:16:50] in the big picture, those were pretty small issues. Yeah, they were, they really were.

[01:16:55] We, you know, I think, I think that, um, games like magic, big bang ball, you know, really showed

[01:17:05] that we had some, we had some design prowess. I mean, we had, we were making some good stuff,

[01:17:09] you know, I thought it was as good or better than anything else out there at the time.

[01:17:12] And there was no reason that we couldn't compete with everybody else out. And, you know, I think the big,

[01:17:19] the big sort of stake in the heart was, was the end of pinball. It was the end of pinball as a lot of

[01:17:24] people knew it. You know, premier technology was after then. You had, you had, um, Sega pinball,

[01:17:32] you had the loss that you have helped me out here. You had Gali at Williams. Everybody was pretty

[01:17:38] much cram and stuff into the market. So, you know, there's a whole lot of room. At some point,

[01:17:44] it's going to come to an end when you have guys that are, when you're,

[01:17:47] at your point of distribution that are stacking up 50, 60 pinball machines, you can't tell them,

[01:17:53] you got a problem, you got a big problem, you know. Now, was there anything that you felt that

[01:18:00] you could have personally done to help save Capcom from this, you know, from its, its doom?

[01:18:08] No, I don't, I don't think I had that kind of control. I think, um,

[01:18:13] I think there was a lot of stuff going on in the background that maybe we didn't

[01:18:18] went privy to. We didn't have a lot of information about what, what the, what the deputies

[01:18:23] intentions were. Um, it was very big. It was always vague to me. Um, that side of it was just kind of,

[01:18:31] you know, really not talked about, you'd get stuff secondhand, there'd be a, um,

[01:18:36] there was a lieutenant that worked in the office. I shouldn't call him a lieutenant who's a very nice guy,

[01:18:42] um, but he was, he reported directly to Japan and he would tell us secondhand, okay, we're going to

[01:18:48] do this, we're going to do that and they went this and that, and there'd be no discussion about it,

[01:18:51] that we would, you know, all the, the command would come down from Asia and basically we would have

[01:18:58] to ball in light, you know, and they just decided one day to, that's the end of it.

[01:19:03] Hmm, shut it down. Now, was, how did you, discussion, you know, how did you feel about the, um,

[01:19:12] you know, the decision to put out flipper football versus big bang bar?

[01:19:17] Um, not very good. I never really thought that flipper football was that great of a game to be honest.

[01:19:25] No, I, um, I felt it had, it needed some more work. It was an interesting idea.

[01:19:31] Uh, you know, the soccer thing was kind of a, was something that Python kind of really believed

[01:19:37] in. He was, he was way into it and thought it was the absolutely the right way to go.

[01:19:42] Um, you know, and I just kind of backed off of it and at that point I was working on my own game

[01:19:47] and, you know, my earhead pass. So I was back in the game design. In fact, I was heading up game design

[01:19:53] and, um, you know, it was work on with the game. So I kind of really didn't have, I didn't want to

[01:19:59] fight with those guys. They felt like I was fighting with them. Um, and some extent I was,

[01:20:04] but I didn't have the, I guess I didn't have the backing of the company, sort of speak,

[01:20:09] you know, to really make that right or to have those guys make it right at that time. They

[01:20:14] believed in it. And, you know, it was just kind of a, I don't know how to describe it. It was

[01:20:21] an uncomfortable time. I'll put it that way. Now, did you ever see the Ziggy Binging project?

[01:20:28] I did. What did you think? Not much. Explain.

[01:20:35] I thought, you know, I thought it was kind of hard edge and I thought, you know, it's one thing to

[01:20:42] be, you want to be controversial. That's great. That's cool. I just thought it was just kind of,

[01:20:47] kind of tacky to be honest. Um, you know, I, it's difficult to crack on another person's idea.

[01:20:56] You know, I don't, I don't realize that you need to be clean about it, you know. I just,

[01:21:01] I couldn't see that thing going anywhere, frankly. What was the Japanese reaction to that game?

[01:21:08] I'm not good. Not good at all. I recall. We shared it to the, to the model and he kind of walked

[01:21:17] into the room, ripped at it and saw what was going on, get in about face and walked out of the room.

[01:21:23] And about three weeks later, um, myself, a Python, some other people got called out to Japan.

[01:21:31] And we went, I should have known what was coming at the time, but we flew us out there. And, uh,

[01:21:38] we were brought out to a really nice French restaurant. I mean, no expense spared.

[01:21:44] Best wine, best champagne. Absolutely the greatest meal I've ever eaten. Um, and basically it was,

[01:21:50] Sinara suckers. Yeah, we're done. Wow. Now how far along was Kingpin, the game you were designing

[01:22:00] at this point in time? Uh, at that point, we were, I would say 75, uh, easily at the 80% mark. We

[01:22:09] were testing. Play field blows pretty much done on the artwork was done. I had, uh,

[01:22:13] examples of, um, had about six of them out on task. Well, we had, we had two

[01:22:19] resets for that game. We had a, uh, one set of rules that would, basically, it was a time play

[01:22:27] sort of game. You were playing against the clock when the clock ran out. Your ball was done.

[01:22:34] However, if you shot and hit the blue, there were blue targets and stuff on the play field,

[01:22:39] you could hit those targets. You could keep yourself alive and add time to the clock.

[01:22:43] We kind of worked it on that promise. The rules were the same where you had to do all these little,

[01:22:47] you know, work your way up the ladder as a gangster and that whole thing. Um, but we were,

[01:22:51] but it was not a three ball game. Though we tested that. Didn't do very well. Obviously, people

[01:22:58] weren't used to that. It just felt like you were getting, you know, kind of ripped off. Um, nobody

[01:23:04] liked it. Um, so we got to, we built the game in a three ball version after that. Um,

[01:23:11] and so the game could be set up in either way. Basically, you go through the, you go into the coin

[01:23:17] door and change the settings and you can have the rule set. You have the three ball or time play.

[01:23:23] So we, we were trying things. We were trying to get the income up, you know, we thought that, um,

[01:23:30] this is, this is something we should try again, you know. Well,

[01:23:34] not everything you do is the right thing, you know. Um, just didn't work out. Worked out

[01:23:38] much better as a standard three ball game. Um, think pen actually started off. Started life as,

[01:23:47] actually, it was called casino. It was a gambling face. A gambling thing.

[01:23:53] Um, so we kind of transitioned after several iterations and just not being able to work the rules

[01:24:02] and get the thing to where we are. We're happy with it. We kind of dumped it out and went on to the

[01:24:08] gang. You know what that was? That's all.

[01:24:14] Now, how far do you consider the software done in its, and its last iteration?

[01:24:20] Oh, you're never done. You know, there's always something you want to do. Um,

[01:24:27] you know, there's, there were probably several things I would change, you know.

[01:24:31] Unfortunately, we never got the opportunity. You know, the switch was kind of shit,

[01:24:35] but I was two months away from producing that game. It had things been different.

[01:24:43] Now, how do you feel about gene cutting hand possibly reproducing, King Pen?

[01:24:48] I think that's great. You know, has he talked to you about it? No. No.

[01:24:57] I haven't, I haven't talked to him about it. You're honest. Now, do you have a King Pen? No, I do not.

[01:25:03] So, gene never talked to you about that, but I mean, you just kind of heard about it through the rumor mill.

[01:25:10] Uh, you know, he tried to make contact with me, but it was, you know, he was looking for, I think he was

[01:25:16] looking for artwork or something. I don't have anything for King Pen, you know. So, I, you know,

[01:25:21] I don't know how I can help him. He did call me once right after, right after I left Capcom,

[01:25:31] and was talking to me about it. That had been 1997.

[01:25:35] And, you know, I just, I wasn't in the mood. I didn't want to, I didn't want to do anything. You know,

[01:25:41] I was showing my bitter face, you know. Well, I'm glad you're out of your bitter face.

[01:25:49] He too. No, was there any, did you have any kind of involvement with the James Bond game?

[01:25:56] You know what, I recall, yeah, word 10, was going to wanted to do a James Bond game, I think,

[01:26:01] when he was with us. But you didn't have any involvement with that? No, I didn't know if it was,

[01:26:07] it was in a prototype stage, you know. I really, no, I don't recall much at all. I recall more about,

[01:26:16] you know, Rob Morrison's game, Big Bang. Right. I remember what, having a lot of opinion on that,

[01:26:28] but not really, you know, I didn't know any design work on the game. I mean, Rob was pretty much

[01:26:32] a one-man show on that thing. How did you feel, Big Bang Bar came out?

[01:26:37] Excellent. I think it was one of the best efforts I've ever seen, you know.

[01:26:43] But here's a guy who has never designed a game in his life, you know. And just from being a pretty good

[01:26:49] listener and, you know, having a nap for a decent leader, you know, he got things done.

[01:26:56] Did a good job. It was a great game. Now, of all the, you know, the pinball games that you

[01:27:02] either worked with or haven't worked with, what would you consider your top three favorite pinball

[01:27:07] games? Of all time. Yeah. Well, Indiana Jones has been there for sure.

[01:27:14] From an 802. And I'd have to say high speed. I can't help but notice that all three of those games

[01:27:29] were richy designs. Yeah, I knew you were going to say that. Actually, you know, I'll tell you what,

[01:27:40] it's tough because having not having seen and played medieval madness a lot and not really

[01:27:48] having played it as long as those other games and not been able to because it's just not around.

[01:27:53] You know, that's a great game too. And that deserves certainly. That deserves to be in there.

[01:27:59] Why don't you give me four? How's that? That's fine with me. Give me four.

[01:28:05] So now, what about your favorite play field toy or mechanism that you designed? What would that be?

[01:28:12] That would be the kind of efficient reel on fish tails. You mean where you take the shot

[01:28:19] and a vertical up kicker then brings it across the play field and into that rotating reel and then

[01:28:24] catapults it around the play field? Yep. That whole little course of events, I think, is one of my

[01:28:30] favorite things. It's just so, you know, Rube Goldberg Mechanical. It's just cool.

[01:28:36] Yeah, that actually is really cool. I love the way it loads it for multi-ball. That's what I really

[01:28:41] think is cool. Yeah. Yeah. All right, is there anything else that you know, you would like to add?

[01:28:49] You know, not really. You know, I just really enjoyed talking to you. You had some good questions.

[01:28:57] It was a fun time. I was having my wife. I thoroughly enjoyed doing it. You know,

[01:29:03] like to do it again, they never know. Have you talked to Stern at all about doing any pitball design?

[01:29:10] I've been on it over the years. We've talked. I don't know if I'm ready to. I'm having a good time

[01:29:15] on my mat right now. So, I'm enjoying work on my old buddies and you know, kind of like old home

[01:29:21] week again. Yeah, you're at Eugene Jarvis's place at Roth Rills, right? Correct. Yeah.

[01:29:29] Also, I was George Pietro who runs the subsidiary company, Play Mechanics.

[01:29:35] Yeah, our flagship game right now is Big Buck Hunter Pro. And it's what it's doing great.

[01:29:42] Couldn't ask for a better game. Couldn't ask for a better group of guys to work with.

[01:29:46] Well, no, I played the original Big Buck, and I thought that was a great game.

[01:29:51] Now, you got to play, Pro. I mean, you got to forget about that other one. This is the shit here.

[01:29:56] You got to play it. And it has good earnings. Oh, absolutely. It's doing fantastic.

[01:30:05] Well, cool. Well, thank you, Mark. I really do appreciate the time.

[01:30:08] No problem. My pleasure. All right. You take care and have a good night.

[01:30:12] All right. You too. Bye. Bye. Bye.

[01:30:15] I really like to thank, Mark. Richie, for coming on Topcast Night and talking to us about

[01:30:20] his experiences with Atari, Williams, and Capcom Pinball. It was really interesting.

[01:30:25] It was great having Mark on the show tonight. It really was a pleasure. I really do appreciate

[01:30:30] its time. And I hope you all come back and listen to us again here on Topcast.
