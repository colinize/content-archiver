[00:00] Howdy y'all, this here's Ken, the pinball ripple, and you can bet to farm

[00:04] I'm listening to Topcast because it's bigger than Heck and half a Texas.

[00:11] You're listening to Topcast. This old pinball's online radio. For more information visit them anytime

[00:18] www.marvin3m.com slash Topcast

[00:33] Welcome to another edition of Topcast. Today's technical show is coming from the Department of New

[00:39] Recruits because Norm is not available today as usual. He's still in rehab getting himself

[00:48] sorted out as it may be. We have a special guest technical advisor to step in and help. I'd like to

[00:54] introduce Eric A. I'm sure everybody's heard of Eric A. We never say his last name and we're

[01:00] not gonna walk in. Yes because you can't. Eric, how you doing today? Just fine how you doing,

[01:05] Shaggy. Good. We've got a lot of very special special things we run today. Like usually,

[01:11] one thing we do is special love. You ever notice that? We don't do anything that's not special,

[01:16] which is kind of how it is. Okay, Eric. So first thing we're gonna run. We've got a new

[01:22] a new thing going today. And that new thing is we've got a special news advisor now that we've

[01:29] taken on. And you know, I'd like to introduce our special weekly news update show. It's time for

[01:40] Mort's weekend update the week's news in Himal. So we have a new news correspondent. His name is

[01:49] Mort and he's a you know, he's a nice guy. He's a little bit wacky but we're gonna let him have

[01:54] his own little show here. So I'm gonna introduce Mort. Hello, this is Mort and I'm here with the

[02:00] weekend update show. It's a weekend pinball update show that I'm doing here. It's my own show.

[02:05] It's special for me. Thank you. Thank you, everyone for listening. That's very nice of you to come

[02:10] on to listen to this thing live on the radio. I got a couple of things I got questions about and I

[02:15] want to tell you some things I know for sure. They're absolutely true that I made up myself. Thank you.

[02:19] That's true. Well, there's this fellows. These fellows are Norman Shaggy and they're on this radio

[02:24] show and they let me be on it. But I don't understand why they never tell me when it's gonna be on.

[02:29] I listen for it every week and I only hear me whenever I want to hear me. And I don't even know

[02:34] when they're gonna be on because they never tell me. And whatever happened to this norm guy,

[02:37] he's always be shaggy and norm and I never hear this norm guy. He's never around. What doesn't matter

[02:42] with him is he's sneaking off into some foreign country and doing something strange. I don't know

[02:46] what he's doing. So I don't get it. You don't know what? And I don't get really pretty nervous about this.

[02:51] And I... more orts. Just tick it easy buddy. Listen, you know, we do this when we we gotta do this.

[03:00] All right. Did you go what I'm saying here, Mark? Oh well, never mind. They got this classic

[03:07] play field reproduction guys are making them going to make a haunted house class. Now why

[03:11] do they call it classic play field reproduction if they're making a haunted house class? That makes

[03:15] no sense to the audience. Why do they do that for? They make it all crazy over here. Why do they call

[03:20] them glasses anyway? I mean, I've got a silly glasses and I don't have nothing in mind. Mine just

[03:24] have the word Japan written on this side of them. What's a big deal about having a haunted house

[03:28] written on your glasses for? I don't get it. Mark, that's because they silkscreen the play field

[03:34] and they silkscreen back glasses for pinball score glasses too. That's why there was silkscreening

[03:40] company. You get it now? Oh well, never mind. There's gonna be some more games coming. It's gonna

[03:46] be very big and big, big and fancy games coming out. Going to be a Spider-Man game coming out.

[03:51] Next, that's gonna be really cool. It's gonna have all kinds of neat things on it. And you're gonna

[03:55] be able to play it. It's gonna have some neat things at the top. It's gonna be awesome. You're

[03:58] gonna love that thing. It's gonna be great. Everybody, I saw pictures of it. No, I didn't. I just

[04:02] pretended like I did. But if you see the game, tell me what it's all about. But anyway, I heard

[04:08] it next next game. Obviously that one's gonna be real unfortunate. Now that should be good. That should

[04:12] be just be like this world poker tour that everybody loves so much. Oh, no, that was a good get.

[04:16] Everybody like that game. That was a good one. So maybe this one would be like that one. And then

[04:21] rumors have it that there's going to be a monkey python game now. I don't know much about these

[04:26] mighty python games. I don't even know what it is. It's something to do with a flying circus,

[04:30] but there's never so nobody flying in it. There's no flying circus people. And then another thing I

[04:35] saw was very crazy. Somebody went and actually some guy, some guy who sounds like he's

[04:40] a vegetable or something. Something about a corner. He's a vegetable. I think he's a vegetable.

[04:45] But he told us how fast the ball can go. He got him figured it out. He wouldn't have

[04:49] took a caliper or something like one of those little things. He put it on there and he checked it out.

[04:54] Maybe he took a ruler in there and then maybe a caliper. I don't know what he did. But he took one

[04:58] of those things. He fed out the ball. It goes at seven miles per hour. That's 121 inches per

[05:03] seconds. That's pretty fast. You think it would be going like a hundred miles an hour though. I mean,

[05:07] I shoot the ball. I know it goes a hundred miles an hour. But maybe those shaggy, no one. Maybe they

[05:12] get taken me again. I trust him a lot more than this other guy, the vegetable guy. And another thing,

[05:17] why is it two shows in the same time? Two pinball shows the same weekend. Next weekend is

[05:21] going to be two pinball shows. One's in New York and another one's in Texas. That's pretty far to go.

[05:26] You can't get to one from another without taking a plane in there. And I don't know which one to go

[05:30] to because I don't know which one. One may be better than the other one. And I don't know. They

[05:34] don't buy it on these people talk to each other. They give them a call on their phones. They say,

[05:38] hello, I'm having a party. I'm having a show. Would you like to come to my show and maybe you

[05:43] wouldn't have your show the same time? What is up with that? Why did they do that thing? I don't

[05:47] understand it. Well, I can see by the shaggy guy poking me in the side that is time for me to go.

[05:53] So listen, everybody, I really like being on here talking to you all and telling you all the

[05:58] pinball news. I know everything that goes on in a whole pinball world and what's good and what's

[06:02] not. So thank you for listening and hope you can come back again and listen to me again if they'll

[06:07] let me back. So you had to hear first on more show, more in update show under radio, internet

[06:13] up top casting. Yes, that's where you heard it at. And it's really good. And we are and

[06:27] is nice. Did you so Eric, did you like more? More sounded like you had everything going together.

[06:34] Okay, Eric, it's time for me to ask what new acquisitions you have.

[06:39] So tell me your story. You bought some games this week. Okay, I need you to tell me what you bought.

[06:45] Well, actually a few weeks back, I went out and got a very, very nice earth shaker.

[06:51] And the funny thing about that one was it was actually fully working, bought it with dead batteries,

[06:58] took it home, put it in the garage, and the only thing that wasn't working on it was the

[07:02] California fall lever and solenoid underneath the play field after I replaced the fuse.

[07:09] So when I went ahead and checked it out, turns out somebody rebuilt it with the spring on the

[07:14] wrong side of the assembly. So it was having a little bit of a difficulty pushing against the solenoid.

[07:19] And how long did that take you to figure out? About 10 minutes. How long do you think it should have

[07:26] taken you to figure out? About two minutes. Well, at least it was only 10 minutes and up like

[07:31] four days. Like it would have been me. You know, I mean, was it obvious or was it just like the,

[07:37] if you've never seen one before, what have you known? Well, the first thing I did after I replaced

[07:41] the fuse is when I activated that solenoid and it didn't actually function, I went directly to the

[07:46] assembly. You know, they had some nice tape on the upper side of the play field. And once I took

[07:54] that off and it still didn't work, I went directly to the assembly underneath.

[07:58] Nice. That's real nice. I'm working on a acquisition this week, but I'm very, very superstitious

[08:04] about these things. So until it's actually in the garage, I don't like to talk about it. I think

[08:10] it jinxes it. It's just kind of a personal policy I have because I find that the walls listen.

[08:17] Well, you know what? That's very true because I almost lost the spider man that I got today.

[08:22] Oh, so you had another acquisition? Yes, I did. I got a spider man in the back of my pickup truck

[08:27] right now. And what, how did that come about? A friend of mine. Wait, is, is, we don't know him as

[08:34] D.U. Something, right? No. Okay, good. Okay. I didn't want to make sure it wasn't that cold friend.

[08:40] Okay. No, it was actually another friend. A lot of people probably know him. Ken D.Bull is his name.

[08:47] That's, that's not, no. Okay, good. Just thinking sure. Ken D.Bull, he contacted me,

[08:54] said he knew somebody that had a spider man in his basement for about 15 years. So I was hoping

[09:01] to get something that looked home use only. Needless to say, it did not look that way.

[09:06] And I went to his house today after last week of supposedly going, but he had too bad of a hangover

[09:12] to actually sell it to me. And when I showed up at his house, he wanted $400. I told him $350 and he

[09:20] said, no. And I said, all right, $375. He was like, okay. And I got it out of there as soon as I

[09:26] could. How's the play field? It's got somewhere. How's the back glass? Very nice. How's the cabin?

[09:31] Very nice. How are the battery corrosion? It's there, but it has not destroyed the board. It's

[09:37] just beginning leaking. Okay. All right. Enough of your silliness. Okay. You're making me jealous

[09:42] by and all this stuff. Okay. We've got another little segment to run. This one is...

[09:47] It's time for... Play a wee wee wee. Okay. We're here with Trent's play of the week. Trent,

[09:55] so you've moved up from fifth to fourth player in the world in pen, professional pinball playing.

[10:02] Great move, buddy. Have you been practicing? Absolutely not. I need to do that. What did you forget?

[10:09] Not just haven't had the time. Okay. Well then, I'm going to... You know, did I mention that I'm number

[10:15] six, so I'm going to be coming up on your butt. I'm ready for it. You're ready for it. Okay. All right,

[10:20] so you're in that front. Play the week this week. Oh, the play of the week this week is everybody's

[10:25] face is game black rose. Wait, black rose, that's the sheep man's pirates of the Caribbean, right?

[10:31] Well, yeah. Some people would refer to it as that. Yeah, because it's actually... it's a sleeper.

[10:37] I would consider it a sleeper. It's a novelty game. Not a lot of flow, but the minute everything

[10:42] gadgets. Okay, well, tell me about what's what's your play of the week on this one. Well, I get

[10:48] big points on black rose. You want to destroy the ships. Think the ships. To do that, you have to

[10:55] spell things ship. Wait, wait. Is there a big ship, ship, ship in the middle of the play field,

[11:01] like there is on that pirate thing? No, there's a big cannon. Oh, okay. Sorry, it's not an interruption.

[11:07] Keep that going. Anyway, to spell letters and sink, sink ship, you get it a multi-ball. Now,

[11:15] what you're supposed to do in multi-ball is light the lock with the in lane. Shoot the left

[11:22] loop to light the lock. Lock the ball. Get another ball to kick out. Lock it up there. Third ball

[11:29] kick out and then every shot, every major shot you make gives you two ship letters. Think

[11:35] when you spell sink ship, you can take a ship and you can sack those, of course. Wait, wait.

[11:40] To sink a ship, what are you going to do again to use a cannon thing? Well, you have to spell

[11:44] sink ship, first of all, and then you have to load the cannon. Okay, and how do you load the cannon?

[11:49] You load the cannon by looping Davey Jones Walker with the upper right flipper. You shoot that enough

[11:56] times, it'll open up and shoot it underneath it. That's Davey Jones Walker. Cannon will come down,

[12:02] start to turn, press the fire button, hit the flippers and bam. The shot straight up the middle

[12:08] is the ship shot. Okay, and what should do that? Well, then what happens? Well, the ship's next.

[12:14] You get 20 million, the first one. Is it like an animation? Yeah, and it's great. The game's got

[12:20] a great graphics, great sound to it when you think of the ship. The whole game really has really

[12:26] cool sound. Yeah, it's got the pirate babe. It's got the pirate babe on the back glass, which I've

[12:31] never seen any pirate movies where the pirate babe was dressed in like a tight one piece bathing suit.

[12:38] Well, yes, yes, pirate bathing suit, if you will. That's Linda D. Lortwerk. Good for her.

[12:47] Okay, so anyway, so how do you rape this thing for big points? So anyway, like I was saying,

[12:53] you're supposed to lock one ball, lock the second ball, start most ball, every shot gives you two

[12:58] ship letters, things ship letters. What I like to do instead of that is, like the lock, lock the

[13:06] first ball, it'll kick out the second ball. One is the second ball, it'll kick out the first ball,

[13:12] so now you've got two balls out there, lock the first ball again, and when you do that,

[13:17] it starts to time for about 20 seconds. Now while you're counting down, you're supposed to be

[13:22] locking the second ball. However, at that point, you've got a one ball multi ball going. I like to

[13:27] just collect letters for as long as possible 20 seconds. That ball kick out again, you know,

[13:33] lock it right back again for another 20 seconds, keep collecting letters that way. Now you only

[13:37] get one letter when you're playing the two ball multi ball instead of two, but you know,

[13:40] when you've only got one ball, the control is a lot easier. So you're able to make it ball,

[13:45] many things ship letters as you can, and start destroying ships. So you're basically in a

[13:49] multi ball mode with the ball locked over on the left side, right? Exactly. That's what you do.

[13:55] Okay, and that only lasts 20 seconds, you're saying? That's 20 seconds, which is a lot longer

[14:00] than you think when you say the word 20 seconds. So after the 20 seconds, it kicks the ball back out,

[14:05] but then you just lock it again and do it all over. Yep, exactly. Rinse and repeat. Yep. Okay, okay,

[14:12] any other tricks? Nothing really in that game. You know, it's a big point to put you

[14:16] got to do is keep destroying ships. You know, there's like three video modes in it that are

[14:19] kind of stupid and silly, but yeah, for the big points, just keep keep playing multi ball.

[14:24] You're right. It's a novelty. It's kind of a novelty game that can and thing and

[14:30] video modes are goofy, but they're kind of unique, you know, like it's a real novelty thing.

[14:35] You can get pretty big points on broadside, but it can be difficult. If you're really good at

[14:40] hitting a center shot and you get broadside started, just keep shooting that center shot,

[14:44] and it doubles every time you shoot it. What's broadside now? And the max depends on what the

[14:48] operator has it set on. I think a max is at it 64. What's broadside? Oh, broadside is one of the

[14:54] modes. There's a bunch of lightning bolt inserts going up the center of the play field, and every time

[14:59] you shoot that center shot, every other time you shoot that center shot, it'll start one of those

[15:03] modes. Three more video modes. One of them is broadside, and then there's a couple others I can

[15:07] hear over. I think extra balls, one of them. Okay, okay. Well, cool. Any any other tips on that one?

[15:15] Do I have any kids? No, God, you need to get a new phone. Do you have any kids? No,

[15:20] do I have any other tips? Tips, no, I have no other tips for that game. Just listen to the pirate.

[15:26] Listen to the pirate. Now, just curious, why did you pick this game? Because when you called me,

[15:32] I was setting it up in a location. Really? Yeah. Have you ever played it in competition?

[15:39] No, I don't think it's that good of a competition game. Why, it's too easy to rape?

[15:43] Well, it's not easy to rape, but it's different. You know, just just not enough to do. It's pretty

[15:47] linear. But you're flying somewhere, it forces you to play more stuff in the game. Okay, here's a real

[15:52] tough question, which do you like better? Pirates of the Caribbean? Or Black? Well, they Pirates

[15:58] are probably better, and as a tidbit, here's a little trivia for you. If you get far enough,

[16:03] and two Pirates of the Caribbean, you do get to fight Black Rose. Really? Yeah, you do. Well, that's

[16:10] kind of cool. And what Williams X Williams programmer, do you think put that in there? Yeah, I'm

[16:16] sure they're probably what. Yeah. Okay. All right, well, that's Trent's play of the week. Thank you,

[16:21] Trent. No problem, Glenn. All right, you take care. You do. That is our play of the week.

[16:29] Now it's time for everyone's favorite. Okay, oh, we. Okay, everyone now is time to look at the

[16:38] webcam on the home page of Topcast. Yes, now we're going to be discussing the game of the week.

[16:45] And the game of the week, actually, this week was something that Eric picked out, not me,

[16:50] not that I dislike this game, but this is Bonzai run, the Pat Lawler classic, actually his first

[16:58] game with the vertical play field, which we're showing on the webcam right now. And it's,

[17:04] it is really a cool game. It's a system 11 game. It came out in what way? You're going to come out

[17:07] 88, 87, 88, I believe. Yeah, 88. So system 11, and it's actually a well-implemented game. I mean,

[17:16] it really, I look it up. Yeah. So here, we got Eric actually playing it here. Yeah. So when you see

[17:22] the ball drain really quick, that's going to be Eric when you see a train. Actually, he's not

[17:27] playing it just yet on the webcam, but he's going to be, but the cool thing is, of course, you're

[17:31] trying to race in a motorcycle race against other riders, and you're trying to go become King of

[17:37] the Hill more or less, and you fight them on the hill. Okay. Now, here we're showing on the webcam,

[17:42] the prototype Bonzai run that was built in Lawler's garage. This is how he got the job at Williams.

[17:49] Is he basically dragged this thing in? He knew Larry D'Amara, Larry did the programming, and dragged

[17:54] this game in. Okay. Here you go. Trivia question for a free cliffy protector, okay, of your choice.

[18:01] What was the name of the Pat Lawler prototype? It was not Bonzai run, and that would be 1-800.

[18:10] If you know the name of the prototype, Bonzai run. Eric didn't know it. Am I allowed to say it now?

[18:16] Since I know. Oh, come on. No, no. I want a cliffy protector. No cliffy protectors for you. Those

[18:21] things are awesome. Yeah. Yeah. When we got a bunch of them too, Cliffy keeps sending them to me,

[18:25] and I keep forgetting to give them away. Anyways, here's Eric playing the game. He's really, he hasn't

[18:30] drained yet, but he can't get them all on the upper playfield. I want to show it up and go out to

[18:35] the upper playfield. Here we go. So you see you got a little magnet that drags it up to the top.

[18:40] Get it up to the second level. Okay, so you got to beat the first hill. Now he's got it in the second

[18:44] hill. Okay, so now the game automatically flips it up to the next flipper on the hill. Now he's

[18:50] got to make that final thing, and of course, Eric drops it. He can't just can't do it. Now he's

[18:54] going to do this about 14 times. There he is. He's going back, you know, he's going to put it back

[18:59] in the upper playfield. And, you know, come on, Eric, can you make the shots? I mean, what,

[19:05] listen, you got me here for tech work, not playing ability, all right? Yeah, he owns like

[19:09] 1400 pinball machines, and he can't play a single one of them. But I can fix them.

[19:15] Then actually, we don't really know that you can even do that. It's still that, I think the jury

[19:20] is still out, Mr. I burn up my playfields to take off my lar. I never said I could clean them either.

[19:26] I just said, I fix them. Here it is going to the upper playfield again. Okay, can he make it?

[19:31] And the whole, no. And there's even a ball stop that comes out between the flippers, the two

[19:35] vertical flippers. And there you can see Clay getting really sick and tired. So he just grabbed the ball.

[19:40] Yeah, he's grabbed the ball and put it up there because Eric just cannot make the shot. Okay,

[19:44] he's going to try again. He's in again. He failed. So here I am again, can I get the ball? You

[19:50] know, I got the glass off and Eric just, is he ever going to get to the top of the hill?

[19:56] I don't think so. Yeah, let's see. Oh, yeah, there he goes. There he goes. He made it to the

[19:59] second part. Okay, so the game puts it up to the second. Well, can he make it? No, he dribbles it

[20:04] out. So anyways, you can see Eric actually owns this game. But that's our game of the week is

[20:10] Bonzai 1, the 1988 Williams classic by Pat Lawler. Okay, so we're going to switch the webcam back

[20:18] to our ugly, our ugly mugs. See now, I might own that game, but I've never actually played a full

[20:28] game on it since I've owned it. Why? Because the play field is being fixed right now. By who?

[20:34] Am I allowed to say? Sure. Oh, play field renovations. And why did you choose them?

[20:41] So far, the people that I've seen have the best luck with those guys. What do you mean? What have

[20:46] you seen? What did you like about them? Oh, they're quality of their work. I had sent it out to

[20:54] some competition. Oh, you mean this play field had been somewhere else first? Yes.

[20:59] I'd rather not say who will watch the game. No, I don't want you to say I don't want you to say

[21:02] anything. But let me put it this way. The person that did have it, I must give them credit. They

[21:08] realized that it was above and beyond their abilities and they sent it back to me free of charge.

[21:13] So they did handle it in a very professional business-like manner.

[21:19] Okay, well now we're going to do another tech series here. This is something special.

[21:24] Brand new. We're going to run it right now. And now, Topcast is happy to present.

[21:30] I have survived the system 80. Presented by the man with all the answers. Curve!

[21:37] Hey, everyone. It's Curve with a quick system 80 tech tip. This tip has to do with the speakers,

[21:43] volume pot and the connectors. System 80 is known for bad connectors, but some often overlooked are

[21:50] the speaker push on female connectors. These are very brittle and can often break and leave the

[21:55] speakers not working due to them being connected in series. Remove the sunbore connector and

[22:01] locate the audio out pin on the schematics. Got we've grounded the other side of the speakers.

[22:07] So you only find one audio out pin on most system 80 games. Take a D size battery with the negative

[22:15] attached to the ground bar on the bottom of the game. Then take the positive side of the battery

[22:20] and touch it to the audio out from the sunbore connector. The speakers should all push the

[22:26] cones out away from the magnets indicating they should put out some sound. Inspect the weak

[22:31] speaker connectors and volume pot if you have trouble. Volume pots rarely go bad, so just turn

[22:37] them left and right a few times and try to clean off any build up on the rea stat. Don't forget

[22:43] to check out the system 80 repair guides and the great system 80 this old pinball DVDs at marbenthrm.com.

[22:50] Shoot chaggy an email if you have a system 80 tech tip that you'd like us to cover.

[22:57] Hmm what do you think? I wonder if the rea stats are potentiometers.

[23:03] I think it's a pot isn't it? I believe so. I think rea stat is basically just a higher

[23:08] wattage version of a pot. Okay you know so it's a small technicality. So you say potato and I say

[23:16] potato or we could say it in Armenian too. And how would you say that in Armenian? I don't know.

[23:22] Okay so here we go for their next little segment and now it's time for tech tech tip of the week.

[23:29] All right tech tip of the week this one was an interesting one and you're going to have to sit back

[23:33] and listen hard on this one because I was a friend called me with a monster bash and he said

[23:38] this guy doesn't know anything about about games other than where the start button is in the

[23:43] power switch. So he said you know I turned the game on and it goes pop pop pop pop pop and

[23:51] you know I start a game and I put the ball in that center hole and it sits there and just kind

[23:56] of looks at me and then everything starts going out and Dracula comes out and it seems really

[24:01] confused. We can all over and fix it. So you know being a nice guy that I am I go over to the

[24:05] guys house and the pop pop pop was the the hole kicker the vertical up kicker that you know the

[24:11] hole dead center in the monster bash the 1988 Williams classic monster bash has this kind of

[24:18] hole that loves to get chewed up where you know it seems like the ball is gravitates to there.

[24:22] So what happens is there is an optic switch inside that hole that senses when the when the ball is

[24:28] in there so you got like a basically a beam of light you've got a basically a flashlight an infrared

[24:33] flashlight that shines over shines over to an infrared receiver and when that light beam is broken

[24:39] it thinks the ball is in there and then it fires the vertical up kicker to kick the ball out. Well

[24:46] on this guy's game there was that wasn't working that you know that switch for whatever reason

[24:51] wasn't working. So Eric what do you think the logical first course of action would have been

[24:57] at this point what would have you done first? Probably put the game in switch test mode and I did

[25:03] that I put the game in switch test mode and found that indeed that switch wasn't working okay so

[25:08] that's step one what was the next thing you would do. The reason why I'm putting you on the spot

[25:11] is because you'll see I win a stray here in this repair and you know we'll see why so I'm just

[25:18] going to curiously know what you would do next. Next thing I would have done is to make sure that

[25:23] neither wire was broken off either the emitter or receiver on those little circuit boards and

[25:28] essentially that's what I did I pulled the it actually just two screws for each side pulls that

[25:33] whole receiver and transmitter right off the assembly and then I used one of these radio shack

[25:38] infrared sensor cards you know you could use a digital camera too and I could see that the transmitter

[25:43] was working and then I have a little pen flashlight that I stored keep with me and actually shine it

[25:48] in the receiver end and I noticed in the switch test that it made no difference whether I had the

[25:54] flashlight on the receiver end or not. So I pretty much determined that the transmitter end was

[26:00] working but the receiver end was not so what would you do next Eric. I would have gone to the head

[26:07] and gone to the CPU board and find out which wire was supposed to be going in there and made sure

[26:13] it was still in a connector. Okay I didn't quite do that and I'll tell you what the next thing I did

[26:18] is I broke it down a little bit further than that I did eventually do what you suggested but I did

[26:23] a couple steps before that. The first thing I did is I got out my volt-ohm meter and I put it across

[26:29] the two leads of the transmitter and saw 12 volts. So even though the radio shack sensor told me

[26:36] that there was you know that that was working I just wanted to verify that there was actually 12 volts

[26:41] there maybe the voltage was low so maybe the light beam wasn't as strong as it could be who knows. So I

[26:45] figured you know it just takes a second. So I measured 12 volts on the transmitter side then I went

[26:50] to the receiver side and again put my meter on that and it shows 12 volts then I took my flashlight

[26:56] and shined it in the receiver and I could see the voltage drop from 12 volts down to zero volts.

[27:02] So what did this tell me Eric? I told you the receiver was working right it tells me that the

[27:07] receiver is working. So I've got a transmitter that works I've got a receiver that works but the

[27:12] signal is not being interpreted by the CPU. So Eric's suggestion is well the easy way is to go to

[27:18] the CPU board to see if the wire actually came out of the connector. Well what I did is I pulled the

[27:25] the column and row switch connectors off the CPU board. So if you remember the switch matrix is 8 rows by 8 columns.

[27:33] Okay so across the bottom of the CPU board you've got connectors for the rows and columns. I pull those

[27:38] off while the games and switch tests and I take a little alligator clip lock it on you know pin 1

[27:44] which is row 1 of the you know of the switch rows and then I touch it to each one of the column pins

[27:51] and just see what it does on the on the dot matrix screen and it showed every every column working

[27:57] then I do the same thing I take my alligator clip move it to pin 1 of column 1 and then touch each

[28:04] one of the rows and it shows me each row is working. So I know that the 8 rows and 8 columns are

[28:09] working so I know that it's nothing on the CPU board so it's got to be something between the CPU

[28:14] board and that transmitter. So what do you think I did next? Well you could have gone back to the I

[28:20] believe there's an opto board underneath the game. There is. Okay and on that board itself you've

[28:25] got several chips on there and I can't remember off top of my head. Okay so that's exactly what I

[28:30] did. I went to the opto board and what it is is at first I always check the connectors coming to

[28:36] that board because they're IDC installation displacement style connectors and they typically they can

[28:42] break or the connections. Do you know what IDC stands for? What? Intensely dumb connection. Yes yes

[28:50] that's that's correct I believe that because I like the crimp pins too. Just want to share that

[28:54] with you. That's good thank you. So I pulled that board off I looked at the connector and make sure

[28:59] that on the male header pins on the board that there was no crack connections I buzzed I actually

[29:04] knew the wire color coming off coming I knew the wire color coming off the

[29:09] the wire color that was coming off the the opto and what I did is I changed is I I followed that

[29:20] to the oh man we lost our webcam sorry I got a little I just got a little weird there was

[29:28] sorry the webcam's off for temporarily. Anyways I knew the wire color and I traced it to the board

[29:34] I knew which pin it came in on that board and then I traced that to first its resistor so I

[29:38] measured all the resistors to make sure none of the resistors were open because sometimes the

[29:42] resistors go open and then I measured a continuity from the resistor to the LM339 chips there's

[29:48] three of these LM339 chips that are very much known to go bad. So I figured out it was you two

[29:56] so I knew which chip it was there's also a bunch of 1n 4000 and 1 diodes too I checked those with

[30:02] my meter two to make sure none of those were shorted or whatever because those go bad too so basically

[30:07] it led me to this chip and I thought gee it could be nothing else it's got to be this chip other

[30:12] than one other minor thing one other minor thing that I overlooked you couldn't have I overlooked it

[30:18] but you tell me what do you think you wrote that guide okay well tell me what you these wires are

[30:25] also daisy chain throughout the play field. Say that again please these wires are also daisy chain

[30:32] throughout the play field. Say that one more time please these wires are also daisy chain

[30:39] throughout the play field. Very good I did not think of that right off and I very carefully cut out

[30:47] the U2 chip with a little pair of very specialized cutters and then heated up each one of the pins

[30:54] remaining in the board pulled them out then took my solder sucker and clearly carefully sucked out

[30:59] all the solder on the chip and then replaced it with sip style socket and a new chip and it

[31:05] didn't make any difference it still didn't work. So Eric say one more time wires are daisy chain

[31:13] throughout the play field. I got a question for you. So this is the thing this is the first thing

[31:19] I should have done I went to the manual I looked at the switch matrix chart in the back and it

[31:24] shows all the rows and columns for each switch so I find that switch that optopopper switch okay

[31:30] and I find the row in the column it's in and what I do is I go down the column and I toggle each

[31:36] switch in the column and every switch worked in the column then I did the same thing for the rows

[31:41] and guess what none of the switch worked except for one one switch worked so I immediately knew

[31:48] that there was a break between that switch and all the other switches and it's really easy when

[31:53] when you do this you always started the switches at the farthest back of the play field because

[31:59] that's where the wiring harness comes in and that's the first switch in line that gets daisy chain

[32:05] so I followed that from the first switch to the second switch and at the second switch the wire

[32:11] was broken okay so then I reconnected that wire and guess what Eric these wires are daisy chain

[32:20] throughout the play field it worked it worked so that was you know what I oh go ahead okay I

[32:31] really think that we might have somebody telling a fib here I don't think you wrote that repair

[32:35] guide I think it would arm yeah yeah I often wonder about that myself too but anyways

[32:43] tech tech tech tech tech oh we that was bonehead tech tip of the week so you know I was

[32:49] very systematic in the whole thing I'm sure you were just checking for the obvious you know

[32:53] Eric I would like to say that nobody called us on our 1-800 number nobody called with the answer to

[33:03] our answer to our our trivia question I'm I'm bonsai run are you sure somebody's not on the phone

[33:10] no no the line's not busy nobody called so we're going to run our next segment which is another

[33:17] trivia conscience but I want to just tell you that the name of the prototype bonsai run wait wait

[33:23] can I say sure wrecking ball that's right wrecking ball that's what it was called wrecking ball so I

[33:29] got it right I get the clip protector right no you don't you know you don't so now we we move to

[33:35] our our next little segment which is another little trivia thing you know just when you thought it

[33:41] was safe to go back into the arcade hi people it's the corner welcome to this week's version of

[33:48] the conundrum here's how the game works I give five clues about a game's identity that's up to

[33:54] the listeners that's you to call in and guess what game it is pretty simple right if nobody gets

[34:00] it I keep giving more and more clues until someone nails it what is this week's prize shaggy this

[34:06] week's prize are the famous cliffy protectors for the game of your choice cliffy protector city

[34:13] all right let's play clues number one and two this is a got-leaved system 80 machine

[34:21] clue number three it's designed by John Trudeau clue number four it's a wide body

[34:30] and clue number five a bunch of sounds from this game in no particular order

[34:43] it is not black hole do not call and tell me it's black hole because it's not

[34:59] think you know what it is then call in shaggy give him the phone number just in case they

[35:04] forgotten 1 800 375 2529

[35:12] so Eric do you think anybody's gonna get this um I know the answer you do yeah well don't

[35:17] spew it out I'm gonna give the next clue okay clue number six this game has two playfields

[35:24] well if you took a saw to it you'd have two playfields on any game

[35:33] clue number seven this game has a spinning back glass animation

[35:40] does that help Eric it's got to be black hole it's not black hole

[35:43] right this game has six flippers it's got to be black hole it's not black hole

[35:51] oh god how many times I have to tell you that this is a tricky one I can't believe that nobody is

[35:57] getting it man we've got two trivia's who's listening out there like you know the clue number

[36:03] nine two of those flippers are in the out lanes oh boy that really helps it's not black hole no

[36:12] and clue number 10 this game has six kind of six slingshots six flippers six slingshots

[36:20] you really think you know what it is no then call in shaggy give him the phone number just in case

[36:25] they forgot me 1 800 okay that's corn's conundrum and now we're gonna take a little break

[36:33] and hopefully people will call in and uh so far yeah

[38:14] okay and uh we'll uh we'll get that right out to you all right sounds good all right thank you very

[38:19] much for call hey thanks okay bye okay so now we're going to do open up the lines to uh any tech

[38:25] questions you have any tech questions i need you to give me a call at 1-800 and we will take your

[38:33] tech questions on the air and uh we'll be right back after a couple ads

[38:44] hey George i just had to call and tell you about this really great magazine i guess

[38:49] it's called the ping game journal and it's the only magazine dedicated totally to pinball

[38:54] it's got great articles and interviews with designers and everything no George i won't

[38:58] loan you my copy who knows where you'll take it to you're gonna have to go to pingangernal.com

[39:04] and get your own subscription but George the guy says that each issue will give mail whenever he

[39:08] feels like it what's the deal with that all right George i gotta go got a call Elaine and tell her

[39:14] i can't believe how good this magazine

[39:44] now for a word from our lawyer the entire surprise goes with the pinball hall fame first episode

[39:48] also available some pinball machines were hurt during the family of the pins vids but they were all

[39:51] get your terrain to DVDs on coin up goodness now okay while we're waiting for a uh anybody to call

[39:58] in that has any tech questions again the number is 1-800 Eric do you know what that 1-800

[40:04] number spells no idea no idea 1-800 i better not say um that question

[40:16] hi you're on the air with topcast how can i help you yeah this is Rex and Oregon

[40:21] here Rex how you doing fine good can you hear us okay i can hear you just fine great so what

[40:27] what kind of question do we got for you well uh f1 i have a white water and f111 blows on it

[40:36] about every 50 games or so and that's the that's the fuse that runs uh the flasters go out and then

[40:44] the topper lights go out the chaser lights go out right basically or that's the uh what the 18

[40:50] bolts for the flasters in that the flasher or the lights in the topper 12 bolt bulbs so yeah

[40:57] but when the when the when the when the when the fuse goes out the the playfield flasters go out

[41:05] and also the uh the the top there it's a five bolt slow blow you mean a five-amp slowball

[41:12] five-amp slow blow yeah right right um you got any ideas Eric uh huh okay i had a couple

[41:19] suggestions one make sure that you don't have any five five five bulbs in the topper but you say

[41:25] it doesn't blow right away it blows after a while yeah and those bulbs would have smoked pretty quick

[41:29] because of five five five bulbs or six smoke bulbs running in a 12 volt circuit they would last

[41:34] about anil a maybe 30 seconds right but if you left an old one in that i put i when i got the

[41:40] machine i read your guide that told about things on the white water and i i bought brand new

[41:47] 194s i think they are right right and uh replaced every bulb up there okay good good

[41:53] good all right what else you got there uh bridge rectifier leg shorted on that yeah that would blow

[42:00] with a fuse immediately though if you got one leg shorted on i've actually seen it where it'll run

[42:05] because a filter cap is pretty substantial where it actually filters out that AC ripple but under

[42:12] time a slow blow fuse is going to blow all right that's an idea i would back it off a level though

[42:18] this is what i would do i would break the system down into smaller chunks first thing i would do is

[42:24] i would disconnect the um the 194 bulbs all of them you know there's a connector somewhere that

[42:30] runs power to that that waterfall thing on top of the back box how it goes to the uh there's a

[42:37] taster board up in the uh up in the top i could disconnect the voltage off of that right

[42:42] disconnect that connect the board that jacer board and you know the power that it outputs to the lamps

[42:49] just take that whole thing out of the system and you said it takes about 50 games to see if it blows

[42:54] yeah okay then i would play 50 games and just see you know what happens um i have a suspicion

[43:03] that it's still gonna blow because i don't really think that that's the problem but what you're

[43:07] doing is you're you're just breaking things down is it uh is it the jacer lamps up top or is it

[43:12] the flashers okay so let's assume that it does still blow okay so what's your next course action

[43:17] the next course action is to look at all your flasher bulbs under the play field and that just kind

[43:22] of make sure you might have some sort of a situation where one flasher bulb is very close to

[43:28] something else and maybe through the vibration of play you get um either one of the lugs of

[43:35] the flasher bulb it vibrates enough to touch some other maybe a g-i lamp socket or or even the

[43:43] frame of a metal solenoid or or anything enough to maybe blow that and just kind of give every

[43:50] every one of visual inspection and make sure you do look at every one um and i i did that to a degree

[43:57] and one of the flashers that i saw that sort of concern me is very exposed wires underneath big

[44:04] puts cave it's right above the pop bumpers there in the boulder garden right and so i sort of

[44:10] inflated that flasher the the bear lugs a little bit to see if that was a problem okay and what

[44:17] did you do to the lugs on our cities and inflated insulated oh insulated sorry

[44:22] insulated in my bad a little little shrink tubing on on the flasher so that it right nicely done

[44:29] if a ball got kicked up there it went it went hit the flasher okay now if i'm not mistaken you

[44:35] actually have there's a the flasher circuit has individual transistors that drive them correct

[44:42] that is correct okay well the next thing i do after that is if you got a meter

[44:48] stick it on current reading and then run through every flasher and see that as you're running it

[44:54] you're not getting a higher current draw on one flasher than another with your mother in the

[45:00] fuse holder yeah you can run that that test what is it all lights and all flashers tests but

[45:06] i would go individually oh you wanted a time flashers and see which one if any draws excess current

[45:13] compared to the others correct yeah yeah the only time you're going to run into a situation is if

[45:19] you have one circuit that's running two flashers as opposed to one flasher right yeah i mean i

[45:25] guess in theory you could have a ball that's causing an issue or the transistor itself or the

[45:31] yeah or the transistor itself i think all those would be a couple good hints um you know the

[45:37] other thing if you wanted to actually try and break the system down a little more uh the

[45:41] flasher system down a little more you could actually remove the connectors associated with any

[45:46] particular set of flashers and play your 50 games and see what happens if you think you have a

[45:52] hunch that any one particular flasher or group of flashers is causing you a problem and just keep

[45:57] on trying to make the system smaller and smaller and if you come to the conclusion that you can't

[46:03] find anything then you back up and do erics um erics replace the bridge rectifier replace it's

[46:10] associated filter cap and um if it's still bow and then uh then i'm lost at that point

[46:17] yeah and you know about every about every again and it don't happen at the same time but about

[46:22] every 50 games or so it it will get the you know the wpc reset thing going too so i've got on the order

[46:31] i've got um br2 and it's filter cap on order and i'm going to replace those for good luck

[46:38] you're saying that the whole game is kind of resetting and forgets its memory?

[46:41] no no it just gets the um you know on wpc games your site where where uh where the um on your site

[46:49] it says that there are reset problems with the whole game you know it'll right it'll go like it

[46:53] got a slam till uh but yeah the game will reset but i mean the slam tilt is different than a reset

[47:01] um you you but you know that right yes yes okay but it'll it'll just it'll just start the whole

[47:07] game over right well for there's a couple other things too for the reset issue is it a game of

[47:12] re-import i'm not sure okay check your jumper in the bottom of the cabinet actually it started

[47:21] simpler than that go and look at the serial number sticker on the back and see if it or

[47:25] and actually there's one on the inside right wall the cabinet too and just looking it'll say either

[47:29] the voltage is 120 or 220 or 240 and if it's 220 or 240 that means the game is re-imported but

[47:35] it was going to air come sorry if it is a re-import and you have to replace that jumper to convert it

[47:40] from 220 back to 120 yeah make sure it was done right yeah well sometimes that connector in the

[47:46] transformer plug will not seat real well and i actually had a problem on my on my twilight zone where

[47:51] that pin was almost barely coming out so as you were playing the game you get this intermittent

[47:56] reset periodically you move the play field and go away for one in addition to that the edge connectors

[48:03] where the five volts come in to the right side of the power driver to the left side

[48:08] reseek those connectors and just talking about j 101 when or two up on the upper right and then on

[48:13] the lower left right above the g i connector and below the the ribbon cable on the driver board

[48:20] and saying if you get any if you reset those and you get any different behavior like your

[48:25] resets went away that's an indication that those connectors are that you have issues with those

[48:30] um as a general rule whenever a replace b r two and it's associated filter cap i always replace

[48:36] the connector pins for j 101 always with new trifrecon pins i i've really come to conclusion that

[48:44] those things are all very very linked and that you know it's just a good way to a good thing to do

[48:51] yeah i'm looking at the sticker inside yeah it says 120 volt okay then that then that was

[48:57] uh that never left the country or never that was designed for north america then you know if it says

[49:02] 120 that game never left so that you know that that's just uh the reason why is like the movs are

[49:09] different for the export games and a lot of times people don't chase those out and some of the

[49:13] little minor issues that we don't really need to cover now we place you know it was a domestic

[49:17] game so but anyways give those a whirl and do me a favor send me an email and let me know what you

[49:22] come up with because this is the perfect stump the chump article for next week you know so you

[49:27] can see see how we did or see what you figured out but you know keep in touch and let us know

[49:32] shaggy at marvin3m.com send me an email and let me know how how you work you know what what

[49:37] resolution you came to all right sure take care bye okay one and once again their number is

[49:45] 1 800 if you want to call up with any um tech questions and in the meantime uh we also have on

[49:50] the website where people can email in tech questions and i've kind of been keeping a uh a little

[49:57] working uh a library of them and here we've got a guy frank from new york um he has a 1978

[50:06] bali playboy and his question was my lamp driver board does not seem to be working the mpu boots

[50:13] up fine sound is good all the switches on the play field work um he does say however i'll hit a

[50:22] target and sometimes the bumpers will fire and i'll come to that in a second but even though the

[50:27] switches work none of the none of the cpu lights turn on i checked the test points and i i get five

[50:34] volts do you have any ideas so i don't know what test points he checked um but the you know there's

[50:41] two sets of lamps or two circuits of lamps on that game there's a general illumination which is

[50:47] when you first turn the game on the g i comes on it's kind of like flipping a switch on on the wall

[50:54] and the light comes on type thing then they all run at six six volts ac okay that's the the g i

[51:00] i don't think he means that i think he means the computer controlled lamps because he talks about

[51:04] the lamp driver board though you know i don't he didn't really uh he didn't really say but i

[51:08] suspect that's what he means and those are actually driven by a separate circuit running off six

[51:13] volts dc okay now that power comes from the rectifier board in the bottom of the cabinet and there's

[51:19] a test point on that board that you need to check along with an accompanying fuse and also a bridge

[51:25] rectifier that filters the you know whatever seven volts ac down to six volts dc okay or vice

[51:32] first i can't remember which so you need to check that test point on the rectifier board to make

[51:37] sure you have power there then if you have power there i would lift the play field and put one

[51:42] end of my dm m my digital multimeter unground and the other end on um this kind of like you'll

[51:50] notice that between each one of the computer controlled lamps there is like a a braid wire

[51:55] that brings power to each one of the lamps it brings the positive side of the power to that

[52:01] just kind of make sure that you have six volts dc there because if you don't have six volts dc

[52:05] there none of the lamps are going to work for whatever reason and that could be either a connector

[52:09] problem or again that fuses out on the rectifier board because what that lamp driver board does is

[52:15] each transistor on the lamp driver board actually grounds completes a circuit to ground for any

[52:21] particular lamp as told by the CPU board okay now in regard to his question about when he hits

[52:29] one switch and it fires the wrong coil um i would check the connector on the solenoid driver board

[52:37] on the lower right side it's a small connector uh a point one hundred connector i would just pull

[52:43] that thing off run just a little piece of sandpaper over either side of the male pins plug it back

[52:48] in and see if anything changes is something changes and means you've got a problem with one of those

[52:53] connector pins um let me see if i got this right he's saying if you activate one switch of a pop

[52:58] triggers another solenoid yes okay i've actually run into this exact problem yeah me too specifically

[53:04] on a pop bumper right you know what it it could also be the caps uh besides that right when

[53:10] somebody replaced these coil sleeves at one time they pulled all three coils out and swapped two of

[53:15] them i swear to you that's exactly what happened yeah the other problem could be are the um the

[53:22] point oh five micro ferret uh capacitor disc capacitors that run on the switches for the

[53:28] pop bumpers those like to go bad so a lot of times if you just cut one end of those off and see if

[53:34] anything changes that'll that'll tell you right away if if you've got a problem with those you know

[53:39] that that is that's a real common problem let's look to see if the wires look pulled like the

[53:44] route like the wires are pulled really hard like they don't belong on that solenoid chances are they

[53:49] don't hmm any other interesting tips that you want to add i was gonna say the capacitor thing

[53:57] what capacitor thing well like they short sometimes and oh you mean the disc capacitors yes

[54:02] right okay okay well we're gonna take a little break here and again if you want to call in

[54:09] it's 1-800 if you got a tech question or you know you just are highly opinionated and you want to

[54:15] speak your mind i guess we can let you do that too no we can't okay all right top guess is

[54:21] brought to you by pinball life give your pinball machine new life with parts from pinball life

[54:26] we should pinball parts will want pinball life is located in the great city of Chicago their phone

[54:31] number is 773 202 875 we have an open door policy and you're welcome to call us with your questions

[54:39] and concerns 80m to 5pm central time when they do Friday their website is it pinball life that kind of

[54:45] pinball life no hassles just the parts you need to invest you're right Eric oh sorry i'm at yeah

[54:55] I just dropped the microphone almost okay all right so while we're waiting we've got another

[55:00] tech question that somebody emailed in this guy's name is Ben he's working on a united orbit shuffle

[55:07] alley okay and his question is I have a nineteen sixty three united orbit shuffle alley my problem

[55:14] is is when I throw the puck twice the pins go up but I don't get any points in the player and frame

[55:22] unit does not advance however when I manually turn the score motor it detects the pins and gives

[55:28] me the correct score as well as advances the frame in or it's player player unit I'm 99% sure that

[55:35] I have the fingers lined up correctly not really sure what he means by that but any any answers

[55:42] sure the first thing I would check is just the lane this is of course an electric mechanical so

[55:47] Eric is useless on this regard hey I think the last goes game yesterday what what what do you have

[55:53] can't electric mechanical yeah what was it I don't know they all look the same to me

[55:57] well what did you fix there was a switch is tilt relay bank was actually giving them a problem when

[56:05] he first got the game and he thought he had a fix by cleaning all the contacts but of course he's

[56:10] color found that there was actually a cold side of the white was actually broken off who was just

[56:14] touching the switch deck very nice I'm amazing aren't I no you can't even remember the name of the

[56:20] game so I kind of kind of mutes the whole thing you know what I mean why remember it was called a

[56:25] tilt relay that's nice anyways back to the orbit again when he throws the puck twice it's not

[56:32] doing any scoring across the back of the shuffle alley there is a whole row of switches that basically

[56:40] tell the game that the puck has been thrown and that it needs to register either the first or

[56:48] second shot relay so what happens is you've got this whole kind of matrix of switches so it's

[56:54] kind of shaped like a V kind of like you know bowling pins are set up in a in a V formation so the

[57:01] switches closest to the player like will raise the you know the number one pin the number two pin

[57:07] the number three pin so on and so forth to the number 10 pin okay so as the puck hits each one of

[57:11] those it raises up the pins associated pin but then the very last row of switches that's furthest

[57:19] away from the player actually tells the game that the puck has completely passed all the pin

[57:27] pin switches and that it should register as you know a completed shot and then it'll pull in

[57:33] either the first shot relay or the second shot relay depending if it was you know the first or

[57:37] second shot so if you open up from the bottom of the game there's usually like a metal plate that

[57:44] you slide out and then you can see all those switches I suspect that he has a broken wire because

[57:50] those switches again are all daisy chained across the back or those switches are misadjusted or

[57:55] those switches of dirty or the connector that connects all those switches to the rest of the game

[58:01] is dirty or has some sort of an issue maybe a broken wire so that's that's what I would check I

[58:07] suspect if he does that he'll be good to go yeah I was gonna say broken wire on a stack switch right

[58:14] that was a joke get it no I can you explain that to me please

[58:20] you know what we make a perfect couple you got a face for radio and I got a body for one

[58:29] yeah yeah you got any other interesting tech stuff that you want to throw in Eric I know you

[58:33] always come across some interesting stuff

[58:39] there's nothing like dead air I love telling you that silence there you know my brain was

[58:44] Ryan thinking there for a second I running all kinds of crazy stuff well I want to hear it what

[58:48] what do you got okay how about this one while back I was working on a taxi pinball machine and I

[58:54] called Klan of course he wasn't in help and I had I had a black knight 2000 displayed board in a

[59:03] taxi machine and that won't work specifically because there are jumpers placed in a black

[59:13] night 2000 board on the display board whereas certain segments are stolen for the extra display on

[59:20] a taxi game it was really strange because you'd have to go back to the schematics on a taxi game

[59:26] and see that these jumpers weren't used on this board hmm okay I know yeah that that one is a bit

[59:32] odd okay here I got you the speaking of odd I got this email this one's kind of interesting I got

[59:37] it his name is Scott his location is San Diego and he has a Valley theater of magic he says hi I

[59:43] just picked up a theater magic and both the trunk magnet and left drain magnet fuses were blown

[59:49] there is continuity between the board and the magnets with no shorts I disconnected both magnets

[59:53] and replaced the fuses plugged in the left drain magnet and worked fine plugged in the trunk magnet

[59:58] fuses also controls the ball release and I could tell that the coil locked on in the fuse blue

[01:00:04] I replaced the flip tronix board with a new pin LED board that I intended to put in my Indiana Jones

[01:00:11] but instead I put in the theater or magic the game seemed to work fine for a while except after

[01:00:16] 10 to 15 games the trunk magnet flew fuse blue again replace the fuse and after you know 10 to 15

[01:00:23] games it blew again what what could possibly be the problem since I put a new pin LED board in

[01:00:30] well it turns out that for games that that the flip tronix board which is normally used just to

[01:00:38] control the flippers on some games with like theater magic they used some of the transistors on

[01:00:45] the flip tronix board to control other things since the game flip tronix board is designed to

[01:00:49] control up to four flippers theater magic only has two flippers so they basically have some

[01:00:55] free transistors that they can use to control other devices so pin LED actually has a modification

[01:01:02] that you need to make to their board to make it work in these style of games like theater magic

[01:01:08] and you need to refer to their website I thought that was kind of interesting I guess I would go

[01:01:13] back and put your original flip tronix board in and I also would check those magnets to make

[01:01:20] sure that they have good resistance and and just as kind of a rule maybe if they are blowing a

[01:01:25] lot of fuses you know periodically I would replace them because again even though the resistance

[01:01:30] may check out okay remember that coils are inductors and with time inductors do strange things if

[01:01:37] they have been locked on for periods of time where the insulation gets a little baked even though

[01:01:44] the resistance may not change the inductance level might change and it can cause fuses to blow so

[01:01:49] I would replace those two magnets so you know that's good you got anything else you want to throw

[01:01:54] in there no I was thinking about that too what the magnet actually being bad you're kind of a

[01:01:59] liar aren't you yeah I just followed the master I want to get called back can you folks tell

[01:02:06] yeah okay Eric well we've been going at it for an hour wow yeah it's blue by huh that's fun

[01:02:15] yeah you had fun good well we might bring you back who knows it's hard to say I don't know we'll

[01:02:19] have to get a pole going and see if you know people like I bet you a lot of people on IRC right now

[01:02:24] are going what a brown knows it all right well I want to thank Eric A for coming in and helping

[01:02:30] us today because Norm again is still in rehab getting his problems all straight down I think he's

[01:02:34] in the same rehab clinic as Britney Spears really I heard Norm shaved his head too

[01:02:46] all right we'll get thank Eric A and good day from Topcast and this was our

[01:02:51] technical show and we'll see you all later have a good one
