[00:00] Hello my creatures of the night. You know I never drink wine.

[00:06] But I do listen to Norman Shaggy on the Topcast. Yeah.

[00:11] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio. For more information visit them

[00:16] anytime www.marvin3m.com.

[00:20] Welcome to another episode of Topcast. Today on Topcast we're going to be talking to a

[00:35] gentleman that did the dot matrix art for a good number of the 1990s Williams

[00:43] Valley dot matrix pinball games. He did games from attack from Mars,

[00:48] Circus Voltaire, cactus canyon, Indianapolis 500, junkyard, medieval mannest,

[00:54] monster bash, no fear, no good gofers, red and Ted Rocho, and he did a number of the

[00:59] pinball 2000 games too, the 3D animation in those games too. Adam has also done

[01:04] the dot matrix art for a couple of the newer stern games too. Now we're going to be

[01:09] talking to him on how he did these games and his experiences as an art and

[01:13] dot guy on these on these machines. Special guest, special guest, special guest,

[01:19] I'd like to welcome Adam Reign. Adam again worked on you know a good

[01:25] majority of the WPC games, the dot matrix artwork and animations for the

[01:33] WPC games. Adam did a total of 26 games for Williams and Valley and then of

[01:39] course he worked on the pinball 2000 games. So let's give Adam Reign a call

[01:43] right now and let's let's talk to him. Adam it's Clay. Hi there how are you? Can you hear me okay? I can hear you just fine. Cool. So you know I went to the internet pinball database

[02:03] and I just did like you know I did I attempted in your last name under people and it

[02:08] it brings up a bunch of games you know that that you were quote acknowledged as

[02:13] as doing I'm sure you've probably done more than this. Actually this morning I

[02:18] spent a little time writing out this is the first time I've done this so all the

[02:21] games that I did work on that counted 26. Okay so yeah they're three short. You know

[02:26] what they always are they're they always kind of leave people out. Especially that

[02:30] guys. Yeah yeah you guys are kind of like you know the important part that

[02:34] everybody forgets right. Very well said. Yeah well it's true because you know all

[02:39] the visuals are right you know are there but anyways okay let's let's back up

[02:45] like how did how did you get started in the whole pinball thing or were you like an

[02:49] artist and you kind of got sucked into this or were you a pinball guy and you

[02:54] want it to be into this. Well actually yeah that yeah sort of as you said got

[02:58] sucked into it. What had happened is I graduated from college with a degree in

[03:03] illustration. While in college I had done some freelance computer animation work

[03:08] for an educational movie company and this man had loaned me and get this a 386.25

[03:14] with a 14 inch monitor. Super high tech back then this is 1991. So upon leaving

[03:21] college so on the paper for deluxe animation animator. I figure how how much

[03:27] different could it possibly be from Autodesk Animator Pro which is what I was

[03:30] using. So I interviewed and got the job actually at WMS gaming which was the

[03:36] video lottery terminal and flood machine division of Williams. To that time

[03:40] they had been using Linda Deal who was a pinball artist. Right. Who had done

[03:45] the theater magic doctor who those sort of games but she was way too busy for

[03:50] gaming. So they decided to hire a full timer and I was the first one. So you

[03:55] actually brought you came in under the slot machine division but this was just

[03:58] you were just responding to an ad in the paper. Exactly so while there I

[04:03] definitely learned the chops of how to be a digital artist in a game environment

[04:06] working with software engineers and game designers but for gambling. So while I

[04:11] was at WMS gaming my coworkers and I would sneak over to the Williams

[04:15] building and we would play pinball. Did you were you playing? Were you now were

[04:20] you at California Avenue or were you at what Keegan? Yeah this is California

[04:24] Avenue. Okay so did they and that's where all the designers pretty much were

[04:28] located back then. Exactly. Pinball had these the top floor which is the second

[04:33] floor and at that time midway was the first floor and then the building adjacent

[04:38] to it only separated by an alley was the gaming division. Okay now at the

[04:44] time gaming was going through they were getting sued by IGT. Very much so yes.

[04:49] And they were they're at forced Williams to go from like a real-based slot to

[04:54] basically video slots and that's where you came in as an artist right. Right

[04:59] they'd actually they're very first towing the water of gaming was video lottery

[05:03] terminals. So these are state sponsored gambling terminals like in self-

[05:08] Carolina you know now I'm forgetting all the states but definitely not Illinois.

[05:13] So I was working on video poker video slots but only on the video side. And how

[05:20] was I mean were you doing like just general color animations on like a VGA style

[05:26] monitor type thing? Exactly. I would do you know lucky sevens and I would do

[05:31] cherries and different different gaming graphics whatever animations had to be

[05:36] done and then as we moved into the real spinners which were the actual physical

[05:41] slot machines that had those spinning wheels then I was doing what's called

[05:46] belly glass art. So that is actually very high res illustration for what you see

[05:52] in the middle and the top of the game like where the the pay table is. Are you

[05:56] talking is that like soap screen dark? Yeah that's eventually soap screen but we

[06:00] were creating it in Adobe Illustrator. Oh okay it Adobe Illustrator so that means

[06:05] that everything was instead of vector it was yeah it was vector graphics instead of

[06:10] pixel graphics. Exactly so it's sort of at that time graduated from pixels to

[06:14] vectors. Okay now was it hard working in vector versus pixel? At first yes but they

[06:21] had hired a man named El Thomas who was he worked out in Las Vegas as a

[06:25] game graphic designer and illustrator for the gaming industry. When he was

[06:32] brought over to Chicago he taught me the ropes he is just an absolute genius when

[06:36] it comes to Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. So just by sitting next to the guy

[06:40] by us Moses I learned pretty much the fundamentals and how to think and

[06:47] create using those programs and I'm still using those same skills today. I

[06:51] mean we're originally when you now where did you go to college what's

[06:54] school? I went to college at Northern Illinois University in DeKelpe. So when

[06:58] you were in college where you you probably weren't using the computer at all

[07:03] for any. I did not touch a computer my entire four and a half years well in

[07:08] college. Fortunately that education and movie producer loaned me a computer to

[07:12] use it school as a freelancer that's how I got my chops down. Okay so by that

[07:16] school nobody was doing that huh? Pretty much right there I think there's one

[07:20] Macintosh and the whole building and that was for the visual communication guys

[07:23] which were doing page layout which was very boring. It was at a black and white

[07:27] Mac at the time. I believe so yes I've seen it but I never touched it. Okay okay

[07:32] interesting now what year did you graduate? Graduated in August of 92. And they

[07:37] had no computers back then. Well at least in the art department we were even

[07:41] told that you won't be seeing computers in the art field for another five years

[07:46] boy were they wrong. Yeah like usual huh? Those college guys they just don't get

[07:52] out those college professors they just don't get out much. They certainly do not

[07:55] and actually when I had gone back there I told some of my professors in

[07:58] commercial illustration guys you might want to look around there's something

[08:02] called Photoshop up there and a year after I told them that they started

[08:06] getting computers into that department. So when you said Photoshop told them

[08:09] they give you like a blank stare. I think they had heard of it but they had no

[08:13] idea it was as pervasive as it was at that time. Okay so now you're doing

[08:18] slot machines at WMS and these you graduated to the ones where you've got the

[08:23] real slots but some of those machines had dot matrix displays right? Actually

[08:29] when I departed gaming that was actually before the integrated dots into

[08:34] slot machines. Okay so your first your first workings in dot matrix was in

[08:39] pinball then. Exactly. Okay now so you've got a dot matrix display on pinball

[08:44] which is what a 128 pixels wide by 32 and how many levels of intensity is

[08:52] each dot is three? There are three shades there's the 100% on 90% on and 75%

[08:58] on and then zero. Erred off. Right okay so when you start doing art for that I

[09:05] mean that must have been required some learning curve there. Oh incredible

[09:10] it is so simple it's difficult. There's a paradox. That you know how hard

[09:16] could 32 pixel high graphics be in three colors? Well sit down and try it.

[09:21] Right. Yeah I definitely went through some pain in just wrapping my brain

[09:29] around how to create the illusion of reality and motion only using three colors

[09:36] with 32 pixels high. So what was the first game you worked on? Very first game

[09:41] was Corvette which is a George Gomez game. I had done I believe it might have

[09:46] been like a shoot again or replay animation. I had come in very end of that

[09:51] project and fortunately a lot of the dots were already done as far as drawings

[09:55] of Corvettes. So I was able to cut and paste and create new graphics using Scott

[10:02] Flowmeoni and Eugene Gears graphics. Okay now when you're doing this what

[10:08] developmental tools do you use in the dot matrix thing? Well back then we're

[10:13] using actually to this day we're using Deluxe Animation which is by electronic

[10:17] arts. The last update of that software was 1990. Oh wow. Yes talk about software

[10:25] with dust on it but you know what? Since then there have been no other tools

[10:29] that have been as perfect as Deluxe Animation for doing this kind of graphics.

[10:34] Does that even run in Windows? It does run in Windows. I haven't tried on an XP

[10:41] but it does run in win 95. I would guess that there was well there was

[10:46] any Macatash tools or you were using a PCI. I know it was an all PC company and

[10:50] it probably still is. So they plot the PC and my desk and said here you go.

[10:56] So even today like you've done some recent stuff you've done you know you did

[11:01] Ripley's in NASCAR. Exactly. Are you still using the same tool? I am still using

[11:06] Deluxe Animation. I have a win 95 computer in a very small room my condo and I turn off

[11:11] all the lights and I just I get into the dot groove just like it used to be in

[11:15] pinball. Now when you started doing the the dot matrix animations and all that

[11:22] for the pinball side was did you like basically abandon everything else that

[11:27] you were doing and you just became a dot guy and nothing else? Well here are

[11:31] you referring to after work or at Williams. On both actually. Well at Williams

[11:36] here's what has happened the gaming department after being there a year and a

[11:39] half. It was a very volatile company and it still is on the gaming side. They

[11:45] decided to have a big transition and they decided to lay off a fourth of the

[11:49] art department and they told me I was heading out the door. So at that time they

[11:54] invited me to interview in pinball and in video which it was midway. So I

[11:59] interviewed with Greg Ferris and I interviewed with some video guys and I was

[12:03] actually at that time turned down by both. So I got my walking papers and I

[12:09] immediately the very next day after getting laid off I went to Data East. So

[12:14] went to Data East to talk to Joe Kamenka who hired me on the spot but there was

[12:18] a caveat there. While I was at Williams I had signed a non-compete contract which

[12:24] as a 22 year old and a very stupid one at that I didn't read the fine print

[12:29] which said that I cannot work for a competitor of Williams for a year after

[12:34] leaving no matter what division it happens to be. Right. So here I was a

[12:41] gambling artist or a gaming artist interviewing at a pinball company and I was

[12:46] still prevented from working there. So some lawyers got to work between Williams

[12:51] and Data East in the meantime. Scott Fulmiani was promoted to game designer

[12:56] and Eugene Gear was promoted to a video artist at Midway. So now suddenly there

[13:01] were two slots open for dot guys. So I got a call from ex-Jews Ken Fidesna who

[13:08] is General Manager of Williams saying hey want to be a dot guy? Okay so I went

[13:14] over to join Greg Ferrer's and his team and I became the first of two new

[13:20] dot guys. Who was the other guy that came in with you? The other guy is named Brian

[13:25] Morris. He is a guy from Chicago and we had a

[13:29] quite a few people out there for a lot of the interviews. He's a fantastic

[13:33] artist and a really great and warm guy and I think he's the only person in my

[13:37] entire life who I saw interview while wearing sandals and still got the job.

[13:43] Now how come I don't see his name? I mean you see if you look on games I know I always

[13:49] look for you know the list things and I see your name not as much as like

[13:54] Scott the dot. Scott the dot you see almost on every game it's sure and I see

[13:59] your name occasionally but I don't think I've ever seen his name. Let's see

[14:03] Brian look at my list Brian Morris was definitely part of think theater of

[14:07] magic might have been his first game and that was 94. Now Brian lasted all the

[14:12] way until medieval madness and then when we went through a round of layoffs at

[14:18] Williams Brian was moved part-time to Midway so he was still doing dots for

[14:24] Williams but he was also a video artist for Midway. Okay so he's sharing this

[14:30] share in the limelight as it may be. Exactly. Okay so now your first game was

[14:35] Corvette and you said that some other guys had done most of the cars. Right it was

[14:40] flown the ony and Eugene gear. Okay so now when you when they passed this off to

[14:45] you are you just doing the art itself or do you actually have to do the code

[14:51] that animates the art? No I did well there I did no code whatsoever. I would

[14:56] create these animations on individual frames in deluxe animation which you

[15:01] can page through either individually or plain sequence. We would export what

[15:05] are called BBM files which are as obscure as you can get. We would hand these

[15:11] single BBM files over to the programmers. For instance like Matt Coriel, Dwight

[15:17] Sullivan, Lyman Sheets those are all programmers who would then take these

[15:20] BBMs and import them into their system and I don't know what kind of magic or

[15:26] voodoo they do but it appeared on the dot screen in the choreography that they

[15:30] wanted. Now when you're developing this using your software you're doing it on a

[15:36] standard video monitor right? Exactly. So but when they're doing the animations

[15:41] in that they're I doing it on a dot matrix or something? Yes and actually about

[15:46] halfway through my tenure there they they built me what's called a dot box which

[15:50] was actually a plasma display in a metal casing that could be plugged into the

[15:55] printer port of my computer. So I could actually send any frame I wanted to

[16:01] print and then I would see it displayed on an actual plasma display. Was that a

[16:07] helpful tool or no? Absolutely very helpful because what I noticed is whatever

[16:12] you do on screen is actually appears wider on the plasma display because of

[16:18] the spacing in between the light bulbs. Oh okay. So if you do someone's face and it

[16:23] looks absolutely perfect on your computer and you display it on the

[16:27] plasma screen they get a little fatter. But they didn't do this to what year

[16:31] did you get that? Oh boy 97 maybe it was late in the game. Wow so so when you

[16:39] would export these things and give them off to the programmers in that would they

[16:42] come back and say you know this one looks funky can you make them skinnier or

[16:46] something? Oh sure or I'd actually go to their office we'd hang out and they'd

[16:51] actually play back the animation in their development game and I could get

[16:55] definitely get a sense of what I did wrong and what needs to be changed. And how

[16:58] much of that iteration did you have to go through on any particular game? I

[17:03] guess it depends on the programmer. Somewhere we're picking you than others. I

[17:07] think there were more iterations when it came to actual like licenses and

[17:12] recognizable actors. Oh right. For instance NBA fast break and I forget the

[17:18] count but I had to do over 140 portraits of the starters of the NBA. I mean

[17:25] that must take it forever. It did and I was not given all the reference material

[17:29] I had to go surf the web to find some of these rookies who became starters and

[17:32] there were no photos of them on the web. I had to go you know research magazines

[17:38] or or find action shots of them and try to make them look like portraits. It was

[17:42] a complete nightmare. And so you spent more time on NBA fast break than you did

[17:47] on anything else then? Not necessarily but I do remember in particular just

[17:53] taking at least two weeks just to draw portraits of these starters. Wow. And it

[17:59] became a little tedious after a while. So most of your work was on the front end

[18:05] of the game development. And then you hand this off to the programmers and most

[18:09] of their work and then is going to be more on the back end. So it sounds like

[18:13] that they would get into more of a crunch when games needed finished in time

[18:18] than you would that you might be able to relax a little bit. Yeah there was the

[18:24] fortunate part of being a dot animator is that even though I worked on every

[18:28] single game I didn't have a focus when it came to what they called game hell I

[18:33] was usually spared most of the hell part. Okay now when you went over and started

[18:39] working for Stern on these on these on these last two games was the development

[18:45] procedure or you know how you did everything and who you worked with was it

[18:50] really any different than with you know with Williams. Well actually I never

[18:54] worked at Stern I did this on a freelance basis for Pat Lawler design. Okay it's

[19:00] actually at home in my condo safely tucked away and I would create these dot

[19:05] animations and then email them to Lewis Cozyars. Now did you have do you still

[19:11] have that plasma dot box that cooks up to your printer board? Not at all and

[19:14] in fact all the dots I did for Ripley's for Grand Prix and for NASCAR I have

[19:20] never seen I've never seen any of these games. Huh okay now you weren't able to

[19:27] when when WMS you know or when Williams closed down in 99 they didn't as a

[19:34] going away present give you one of these boxes. Actually as a going away

[19:39] present they made a revenge from Mars available to me to purchase so I did

[19:43] definitely purchase one. Okay now when they went to when they went to pinball

[19:48] 2000 did you were you involved in that much? Very much so I was the animation

[19:54] coordinator for the whole department so what had happened is as soon as we it

[19:58] was I should say the platform was announced and approved and we got the go

[20:02] ahead I was asked if I could leave the team to do all the 3D video graphics.

[20:07] I accepted but I accepted at a time when I had no idea how to do 3D design.

[20:13] So another learning curve? That was it talk about an extreme learning curve

[20:18] that was the dot learning curve was nothing compared to this. So what tools were

[20:23] you had did you have to use for the pinball 2000 stuff? Well initially we're

[20:27] going to go with 3D studio max and I must admit that that's a much harder

[20:32] program to learn from the ground up than others. So I remember some very long

[20:37] nights I had all the manuals at home reading them covered a cover thinking how

[20:42] the heck am I going to do this? Because not only do I have to perform but I have

[20:46] to leave the team in developing graphics on a platform that has doesn't even

[20:50] exist at the time. So did anybody else that was working with you know how to do

[20:56] this? Well we had we fortunately put together a really good team. I was the first

[21:01] one and I was I headed up the video department. We brought on Jack Liddon who had

[21:08] come from Data East as a dot guy. He was working in gaming at WMS but he had

[21:13] had a 3D background. So we brought him over to work on pinball 2000. Then we

[21:19] started interviewing some new guys. We brought on Dave Miller and Scott Sanders.

[21:24] Both of which were at the time really young guys fresh out of school but they

[21:29] had a lot of 3D experience. So did they help you get through this curve? In fact

[21:35] it was Scott Sanders who recommended using what called Lightwave which is a

[21:40] product by Newtech. Now Lightwave fortunately for me was a much easier tool to

[21:45] learn especially when you have someone sitting next to you teaching. Right. So

[21:49] instead of 3 studio max which was a major headache and I did learn it later on

[21:54] in life but at the time Lightwave was an absolute godsend. I was able to learn

[21:59] the software, master it over time and help everyone else get into the pinball

[22:05] groove. Alright so let's let's take an example on like say revenge from Mars. When

[22:11] the game boots up you know you see the you know the saucerships and they

[22:16] kind of come at you. Right. Okay. Was that like one of the first animations you

[22:21] did for the game? Actually that was not mine that was Scott Sanders and in truth be

[22:25] told that was one of the only animations he did for that whole game. I had teamed

[22:30] him up with Greg Ferraris and asked Greg to do a storyboard to design the intro

[22:35] to the game. So Greg Ferraris who's one of the most talented artists that

[22:39] ever met drew some fantastic storyboards. He had enough to Scott Sanders and

[22:43] they worked forever to get the choreography down on that thing. So just a

[22:47] because a lot of people probably don't know what a storyboard is. The storyboard

[22:51] is just like basically almost a comic strip of hard art that he basically

[22:57] just drew with a pencil right? Exactly. They're the key moments in an

[23:01] animation or in a film I guess you could say that the you hand this

[23:07] sequence or sequential drawing off to an animator who then makes sure that

[23:13] those key points are hit during a film. And of course they have to the

[23:19] animator has to fill in between each one of these frames everything in

[23:24] between too. Exactly. So it's a huge job obviously. Oh yeah. So now doing

[23:32] animation for the pinball 2000 platform. I mean the actual once you learn the

[23:38] tools how much more difficult was it than using the doing the animations for

[23:45] you know a dot matrix screen? I would say almost infinitely because when doing

[23:50] 3D modeling and 3D animation the development cycle is far greater. When you

[23:58] create a 3D model you're literally creating it in three dimensions. You

[24:02] have to do the side in the back of any object that you're creating. Right you have

[24:07] to be able to draw basically every angle of it and then after you have that

[24:11] drawn then you can use the package to you know spin it or turn it or make it

[24:16] go forward left or right or backwards. Exactly that's that's right. Okay so you

[24:21] actually have to draw something that looks like you know like if you're drawing an

[24:25] egg you've got to draw every side and every ripple and it's and it's casing and

[24:30] everything right? Yeah it's it's a complete as opposed to just drawing a portrait

[24:35] which is one view of one person you have to draw the sides and back of their head

[24:39] and if you want them to talk you have to put extra geometry or three-dimensional

[24:44] geometry into their mouths and their eyes to make them blink mouth to make them move

[24:48] it's it's a much bigger deal you are trying to replicate reality in three

[24:54] dimensional space. Now for Star Wars did on did Lucas help at all with any of

[25:00] this? They both helped and hindered this is this was hysterical that we actually

[25:06] received some CD-ROMs from ILM and we were just like little kids were all excited

[25:11] wow ILM graphics and here they are well guess what they purposefully ruin the

[25:18] models the 3d models they gave us damaged and corrupted models so that we would

[25:24] not reverse engineer what they do and help their competitors. Oh man so basically

[25:31] what they gave you was useless then. It was in part useless we had to go spend many

[25:36] weeks on each model to repair them and we repaired them using our software so

[25:42] when we were finally done we had something that we could use but definitely would

[25:46] not be useful to any of ILM's competitors. So and that was their intention obviously.

[25:51] Yes but what was really frustrating is Williams paid the most money ever for that

[25:57] license. I'm not sure the exact dollar amount but we were told this was the most

[26:02] expensive pinball license in history yet after forking over all that money they

[26:07] gave us damaged goods and there was nothing you could do about it. No I mean how

[26:12] are you supposed to argue with Lucasfilm and ILM. Now who's ILM? That's

[26:16] industrial light magic George Lucas owns that company and they do all the

[26:22] special effects for all Lucasfilm movies and they do I guess other movie companies

[26:29] can hire them to do their graphics. And I mean if they had given you actual 3D

[26:35] models could have you reversed engineered and really done that what they were

[26:39] for you know. I would say no because here we were 5 or 6 guys you know pinball

[26:44] artists working in a very small environment we didn't have the equipment that

[26:48] they had at ILM. George Lucas has two billion dollars in his back pocket so

[26:53] the budgets are quite skewed there. It would have been very challenging to reverse

[26:59] engineer and to you know sell off or reveal any of their secrets to anyone. I

[27:04] was very frustrated that business decision. And do they does the light magic

[27:11] company did they use the same software that you guys were using? No they used

[27:14] let's see I don't remember what they used. I believe it was both soft and

[27:20] mosh and I can't remember it's one of the higher end Silicon

[27:26] graphics that was it. And so that's a lot more. A lot more expensive.

[27:31] Into the 5 and 6 figures for each workstation. So yeah it was night and day.

[27:35] Right right so okay. So now the so the Star Wars thing to get the Star Wars

[27:40] graphics up and running was that a lot more work than the revenge? It was

[27:46] different in that we had to use their graphics but it was also exciting in that

[27:50] Larry DeMar actually sectioned off part of the pinball engineering department

[27:56] behind lock doors there were only 19 of us who had signed non disclosure agreements

[28:01] with Lucasfilm who were allowed in that in those rooms. So John Papadouk had a

[28:07] actually I think it was a chemical waste cabinet with a lock on it the huge

[28:12] metal cabinet with all of Lucas's secrets documents and style guides and CD

[28:20] ROMs and the 19 of us were working on the game had access to it but no one else

[28:24] did. And when the game was done I mean did he have to dispose of that stuff?

[28:29] You know I don't know where it went but yeah when the game was done the door was

[28:33] unlocked and everyone can come on in because the secret was out. Right right.

[28:36] Okay so let's back back up to the to the dot matrix stuff. When you were doing the

[28:42] dot matrix what was the game that you were most proud of that you did? I would say

[28:46] it's a combo of two there is a tech from Mars and medieval madness. They're

[28:52] both Brian Eddie games and Brian was unique in that he definitely ran his

[28:58] teams as with the with the capital T as a team. He listened to everybody's input

[29:05] no matter who it was and if your ideas were any good it actually went in the

[29:09] game. So did you have any good ideas again implement? I think so I brought the

[29:15] big old beam to the table during a tech from Mars and the extra ball show was

[29:21] actually my idea with the Martian getting smacked in the head by the pinball.

[29:25] Yeah it's a good one. I like that one. You know I had it in mind what how I

[29:30] wanted it to feel and look and play out and Dan Forden must have read my mind

[29:35] because I didn't talk to him at all. He saw the show did that great music with

[29:39] that really grotesque impact sound with that squishy sound effect and it was

[29:46] just complete perfection when he got through with it. Now what was this one's

[29:51] maybe more strange what was the one game that you were least proud of? I guess

[29:56] there are a couple games which are very frustrating I wouldn't say I'm not

[30:00] proud of them but they were a little more difficult. Congo actually was a game

[30:05] it was a John Trudeau game I believe the first play field was developed and

[30:10] then rejected so they had fallen way behind on their development cycle. Brian

[30:16] Morrison and I are the two dot guys we're working on three other games and then

[30:20] that was foisted upon us as a late-comer where we were told do it as fast as you

[30:24] can. So in between doing these three other games I you know I had to squeeze

[30:30] in Congo dots and I don't think I did as good a job as I could have also we

[30:36] were not provided with a lot of reference material from the movie company.

[30:41] Was this before the movie came out that you were working on this?

[30:44] Yeah it was quite a bit before. I went ahead I purchased the book and read it but

[30:47] that really didn't help. We only had a three-minute trailer of the movie to work

[30:52] from. The rest we kind of made up and I would have liked to have done it better

[30:59] you know with more time more development cycle and better references. So when

[31:03] you're doing a license theme you guys don't get to see the movie ahead or

[31:08] anything? We did for Johnny Namanik and believe me that was not a treat. I mean

[31:14] when you have to you saw that movie where you like all my can we can we turn

[31:20] this license in? All the directors cut which actually had a different ending. It

[31:24] had an ending where Johnny Namanik the counter-reve character did not get his

[31:28] memory back. So it's a little bit edgy. I thought okay that's the

[31:31] pretty thing that the hero didn't actually win. He got the bad guy but he didn't

[31:35] get his memory back. So when my friends and I all went to the movie theater to

[31:39] go see it the final cut it had this sweet sappy ending where oh Johnny gets

[31:45] his brain back and it was just absolute Hollywood garbage. Now when they

[31:52] would send you this director's cut would it come on like a DVD or how?

[31:56] This is back in the good old days of VHS so we sat around. Actually I watched that

[32:01] movie back to front 22 times by time the game was done. You mean just to make

[32:06] sure that everything you were implementing was correct? Right we had to

[32:09] Brian Morris and I had to find the exact scenes we had to replicate in dots and

[32:14] we had to watch it over and over make sure we had the graphics right just the

[32:18] rather people. And does the company you know the movie company come in and see

[32:23] your game or have to approve any of the animations? Good question I don't know

[32:29] if either Johnny Demonic or Congo really went through that kind of approval

[32:32] process. Now Star Wars is a different animal. They sent a Lucasfilm rep showed up

[32:37] and she reviewed the game very critically. What kind of comments did she have?

[32:43] She actually had most of her comments for the back glass. Kevin O'Connor I guess

[32:48] had not made the pod race large enough and when she wanted him to make it

[32:52] bigger it was pretty much too late. How do you go back in with an eraser and

[32:58] fix a painting? So what happened? We might have talked our way out of it or

[33:03] maybe he put a glow behind it. I forget exactly what he did to make them happy

[33:07] but they eventually signed off on it. So the translate is a natural painting

[33:12] then? Yes all the artists throughout the William's history actually would go

[33:16] ahead and hand paint all of these back glasses. They would do it with airbrush

[33:21] acrylic paint watercolor. Whatever tool they needed. Exactly and then it would be

[33:27] photographed at the end of the day and run as a translate. Okay so now some of

[33:34] these other animations like when you're working on a non-license theme you

[33:38] know like most of your games are actually non-license themes. So they were

[33:42] they actually in fact easier because everything was in-house and you didn't

[33:46] have to deal with any of these exterior motivators. Yeah I definitely say so

[33:50] because we got to use whatever references we wanted to. Like for a tech from Mars

[33:55] we went ahead we went on a movie binge purchasing movies like I think it was

[34:02] that the day the earth stood still and I think it was like flying saucers from

[34:07] Mars or all the old black and white. Yes we collected all the 1950s movies and we

[34:12] set there just had a great time watching these things and we would watch for

[34:16] the scenes which were very indicative or very they represented the whole genre

[34:23] and we would steal those scenes and put them in the game. Now when you were doing

[34:27] Red and Ted Roacho what was the girl singer Carlisle I believe or

[34:34] I came in very late on that game I think it did the multi-ball start for that. I

[34:39] didn't do too much else that was a Scott Phil Mianney but yeah that was an

[34:43] original theme I don't know if that country singer had anything do with the

[34:47] approval process. Okay because I know that like people have tried to license the

[34:51] you know the art on the cabinets and they have to get a they have to get a

[34:55] approval from her as a third-party license and I know I have a contract with

[34:59] Williams as far as what they can do as far as resale of the art. Now how did you

[35:04] feel with any one of the particular designers did you have a particular

[35:08] favorite that you like to work with? I would have to say it was Brian Eddie and it

[35:12] was simply because he he was a very team-focused guy that whatever theme he

[35:19] was working on he wanted to hear everyone's opinions no matter how diverse

[35:23] or odd they were and as a team we would sit down and decide what was suitable

[35:28] for the game and if you had a good idea it would go in the game and I was as

[35:32] it was just a thrill to have either my dot ideas or even some of the speech

[35:37] that I wrote actually show up in the game. Now on the internet pinball database it

[35:42] says you there's 23 games you did but you said you did 26. What are the three

[35:46] left out? Well I'm not looking on the computer right now I can give you a run

[35:50] down of the games. Yeah sure go ahead. These are I don't think they're in order

[35:54] but they're that they could get Corvette was my first one. Yeah that's not in the

[35:58] internet database. Well I think maybe my name's not on the actual play field

[36:03] that could be why it's not on the internet. Gotcha. Dirty Harry. Okay. The

[36:08] shadow. Yeah now that was the other one the shadow isn't listed either and that

[36:13] was of course another Brian Eddie game right. Right now that's where I had met

[36:16] Brian Eddie I think I did one or two shows for that again that was I was I showed

[36:21] up on board a very late net design cycle. Now the shadow did how was that that's

[36:27] a license theme too. How was that one and that one and did you guys get to see the

[36:31] movie ahead on that one? That's a good question if anyone in the department

[36:35] saw the movie before came out I don't know because the game was pretty much

[36:39] finished by time I jumped on board. Okay okay that was just kind of curious I

[36:44] mean did what did you think of that game in general? That was a really fun game.

[36:48] I did see where the magnet that held the ball towards that door in the back.

[36:52] Yeah and threw it off. It would end up scraping the play field and it would kind of

[36:56] dirty up the game but other than that sort of I guess design issue that was a

[37:03] fun play field. Yeah I think that's a really fun game I'm pissed at the person

[37:09] though that put Alec Baldwin on the back glass. You know I mean you know that

[37:14] one makes no sense to me. I'm no great fan of his that's for sure. Yeah and also

[37:19] since you know the lead actress of course was certainly one of the most you know

[37:23] beautiful women of certainly of that era and she's got she's been totally

[37:29] minimalized you know. It could have been based on like a heavy-handed

[37:33] license or Doug Watson did the painting for that he might have been responding

[37:38] to some sort of demand where Alec Baldwin had to take up you know 50% of the

[37:44] back glass and the actors had to take up 25%. If you look at demolition man you

[37:50] see that Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stallone were exactly equal in how

[37:55] large their heads were and that was a demand by the licensure. Really so Sandra

[38:00] Boett got the shaft then. Pretty much figures. Okay I'm sorry to interrupt you

[38:06] this what other ones did you do. Okay let's see Roadshow theater of magic attack

[38:12] from Mars Arabian Knights Jack Bot no fear safe cracker Indy 500 NBA fast

[38:21] break medieval madness Johnny Namanik Congo ticket tech toe which I guess you

[38:28] could argue if it's a pinball game or not. It's close enough. It's close enough.

[38:35] You can argue with Cameron all you like scared stiff champion pub circus

[38:42] Voltaire junkyard no good gofers monster bash cactus canyon revenge from

[38:49] Mars Star Wars episode one and Wizard blocks. Yeah there's a few that in there I

[38:55] don't see your champion pub being listed being listed either I mean now that

[39:00] that game was kind of an interesting game I mean was the animations were they

[39:05] challenging for that one. They were challenging actually I had rented or purchased

[39:09] the movie I think it's far and away with Tom Cruise it was a movie all about

[39:13] bare-fisted boxing. So we got some great nothing of a time cruise fan which I'm

[39:18] not. We got some great footage of you know bare fists on people's faces and

[39:24] destroying their lips and their nose and that was a lot of fun to do each of

[39:29] the boxers getting pummeled in that. Now on Circus Voltaire you really went crazy

[39:35] with like some mini movies almost you know like the animations for with the

[39:39] balls and the clowns passing them and that really incredible work. Well thank

[39:45] you but I needed did was that like because Papaduke was was fortunate to do

[39:51] that kind of stuff or was that all just you know you could do it. As a couple

[39:55] of both John Papaduke especially in that game he wanted to let his creativity

[40:00] flow that was a very he wanted to push the boundaries in the edge of what it

[40:05] was known as pinball you know pinball to that point was all no fear and NBA

[40:10] best break it was very you know hard driving sort of a one-dimensional he

[40:16] wanted to have a more of a artistic flair to the whole package so we really

[40:22] tried to have fun and push the dots into places they'd never been before.

[40:27] Yeah I can never imagine somebody that would come up with a theme like that you

[40:31] know what a 17th century philosopher as the you know it's it's the game is

[40:38] this a man from a theme did you guys I mean when you were sitting in that room

[40:43] you know and he presented that to you I mean you all kind of look at each

[40:46] other and say you know where you sure. Yeah to me and this is just my personal

[40:52] taste I was not crazy about the art package even though I'm not adverse to

[40:56] something different than like an Indie 500 or something that's like a straight

[41:01] up you know mechanical forceful game the the acid greens and the oranges and

[41:07] the yellows just got a bit much after a while. Right right you know I like to

[41:12] game and Cameron's home run certainly really opened that game up.

[41:18] Definitely you know if he was given the time he could have made it a much more

[41:22] a deeper game much more engaging game. Right now when you were working on these

[41:26] games did you have an opportunity to buy each one of them you know when you got

[41:30] done. Well that guy's had a different arrangement than everyone else we were

[41:33] able to buy one a year at the I guess a very reduced cost we could buy a

[41:38] prototype game which were not legally allowed to be sold you know two

[41:42] distributors or operators. You mean like an engineering sample. Exactly. Okay so

[41:46] the games that I picked up well there was theater of magic. Attack from Mars

[41:51] medieval madness and oh monster bash and of adventure Mars. Now how was it

[41:58] working on monster bash with doing all the monsters. You know what now

[42:02] I just bring up that I think that might have been the most fun game I worked on

[42:05] because I'm a big heavy metal guy. Okay my iPod is jam packed with just you know

[42:10] charging heavy metal so working with Vince Panna Relle on the you know doing the

[42:15] sounds because he's a he's a guitar player first and foremost that was a lot of

[42:19] fun to work on. Now did um was the license a hassle on that one. It was because

[42:25] George Gomez had wanted to license monster mash and get that song. Right. The

[42:31] owner of that song and I don't know the guy's name was going to charge us I think

[42:35] $20,000 to use that song. Wow. And for a Pimble game that's that's a bit

[42:41] much. Yeah especially for that's a fairly old song that came out in the 60s.

[42:46] Yeah this guy you know you hear it every year in Halloween he must be it's just a

[42:50] cash generating machine for that guy. Right well you know that you got to

[42:55] retire on a song there you go. That's the one to do it on I guess it keeps

[43:00] given every year. That's right but you know one of the animations that I'm most

[43:03] proud of is actually in that game and very few people see it. It is the the

[43:08] monster mash pit. I don't know if you're familiar with that show. Yeah yeah I am.

[43:11] That is cool. Do you know where where I pulled that from? I have no idea. What I did

[43:16] when I was told to do the monster mash pit and I want to do all the monsters

[43:20] jumping around I thought well I could just do them mashing which is to be

[43:24] expected but what if I have them do something a little different so I went to

[43:29] blockbuster and checked out Charlie Brown Christmas special and there's a

[43:34] dance scene in the Christmas special where the little redhead of girl was

[43:38] nodding her head back and forth. I think it's Schroeder has his arms out with

[43:42] his fingers down and doing a little dance. Okay I pulled each of the peanuts

[43:47] characters dances and gave it the dance to each of the monsters. So they are

[43:53] going from left to right doing you know Charlie Brown dances and when put to

[43:59] the the grinding heavy metal of imponorelli to me that was sort of a juxtaposition

[44:05] that I just I live for. Now Lyman's lament that's in monster bash. Did you do

[44:11] after do any special animations for him? No I think you know I haven't seen

[44:16] that long time. I think he used existing dots in that game to put together

[44:20] the little men's but yeah that's Lyman complaining and he's very famous for it

[44:25] he probably still is so we made a whole mode out of it. Did he know that or I

[44:31] mean did he ask for that motor? Did you guys just kind of I think George Gomez

[44:38] wanted to institute it but of course Lyman was the only programmer so I think

[44:42] Lyman actually programmed that mode. Right okay well I kind of make sense it

[44:47] kind of ruins the surprise though. It does but you know if if you know Lyman if you

[44:51] spoken to him it's it's very much him. Alright we're gonna take a little break

[44:55] from talking to Adam Ryan. Pins and vids episode two attack on the phones is now

[44:59] available at pinsandids.com it's the best pins and vids yet double the fun and

[45:04] half the underwear the first episode. Surely it'd be nominated for a Oscar for

[45:07] the best use of fake phones in a niche video or best special effects during a

[45:11] dream sequence. Worth much much more than the six dollars including chip and

[45:15] selling price it's worth at least seven or seven fifty. Get your copy now at

[45:19] pinsandvids.com and now for a word from our lawyer the entire surprise goes

[45:23] with the pinball hall of fame. The first episode also available some pinball

[45:26] machines were hurt during the pinball pins vids but they were all get your

[45:28] great DVDs on cornup goodness now. Okay we're back with Adam Ryan from Williams

[45:34] Valley Art Department now on Safe Cracker. How much of a challenge was that to

[45:39] have basically you've got a board game going on you got the pinball going on and

[45:43] then you have the what is it the assault of all type you know that secondary game.

[45:48] How much more of a challenge for Matt Coriel who programmed that game. As

[45:54] far as dots go it was fairly straightforward we had certain shows to fulfill

[45:59] and you know and had to make them the best that we could. I think it was definitely

[46:05] more of a game designers challenge to pull it all together and pull it off.

[46:09] Unfortunately the sales do not reflect a victory for us. You know we tried hard

[46:15] it was very innovative but I don't think it worked in the marketplace. It works

[46:18] great in my basement. I think it's a great game you know I it's one of my

[46:24] favorite actually you know it's it's it's fun it's cute it's tight it's you

[46:30] know there's a lot of different aspects to it. The kids love it the adults love it

[46:34] I mean to me it it appeals for a wide range people. Yeah it did to us too we

[46:39] had a nir testing area and we would play it for hours and we thought yeah this

[46:42] was really fun but I guess it was sort of an in-between game that some arcade

[46:47] thought it was a redemption game some thought it was a pinball game and then they

[46:51] couldn't decide why or where to put it and why to buy it. I wasn't on the

[46:55] sales team but something someone dropped the ball there. Right now on Jackbot

[46:59] how did you feel about that kind of like that recycling of the pinbotton and

[47:04] kind of adding a gambling aspect to it. Well for me it was kind of fun because we

[47:09] were told that oh we have to fill there was a hole in the schedule as far as the

[47:13] factory goes. I forget the whole circumstance there but they wanted to bring out a

[47:18] game very quick so they brought out a winner which was pinbottes. They repackaged

[47:22] it as Jackbot with John Yosey artwork on it and as far as dots went since the

[47:27] first game didn't have any dots Brian Morrison I were told do whatever you want

[47:32] and that was a thrill. It was. Because I did the I think it was

[47:38] multi-ball where you fly through all those doors. Right. I sort of was

[47:42] channeling in a way what Python or the game designer Python would have been

[47:48] thinking with each door had a different card symbol the clubs the spades the

[47:54] diamonds and then I put the Yin and Yang and when the heart opened it was a

[47:57] broken heart. I thought that that something is weird as he would do and then it

[48:02] leads to the jackpot eyes and you pan up to his head which is all those

[48:05] mechanical stuff and then explode so we had all the memory we wanted to play

[48:11] with so I made a very long show. Now at the time no Python was no longer with

[48:16] Williams right. No he was he was showing the door well before I got there I

[48:21] met him once great-for-ers introduced me to him he had dropped by I guess the

[48:25] Pitcha Game idea which was not accepted thankfully I think you took Big Bang

[48:30] Bar elsewhere and yeah but it was his sort of artistic philosophy without all

[48:38] the psychosexual stuff I thought he's kind of this crazy guy so I wanted to put

[48:43] some craziness into that dot show. Now how was Dirty Harry in working in that

[48:49] license? Well that was kind of a mess I was brought in late in the project I

[48:53] guess it was a license that Williams had paid for several years prior to that

[48:58] and never used and suddenly the whatever company owns Dirty Harry put pressure

[49:03] on Williams to actually do a game. So Barry Auser was what I was told forced to

[49:09] do that license and put together a game in a hurry. And did that make your

[49:15] schedule compacted? I think Scott Follon-Neon had done most of the work on that

[49:21] game by time I got there but the game felt rushed even though it was a novice

[49:26] in the Pimble Department it definitely felt different than some of the other

[49:29] games that were coming out at the same time. And did Clint Eastwood have to

[49:33] approve any of the dots? Not to my knowledge I think the license was sold by that

[49:38] time and so was Clint that he no one I don't think anyone really cared. Now what

[49:43] about scared stiff? How was that to work out? That was a lot of fun because it's a

[49:49] great theme and actually Cassandra Peterson showed up in Pimble and we got

[49:54] the meter and she's very very short. Oh really? Yeah no I didn't. Without her

[50:00] makeup she looks very very old. Really? Yeah which it's like wait that's

[50:04] so it's until she smiles and you see her teeth you realize who it is. Right

[50:08] well she's probably 50 I would think. Yeah I don't know her biography but

[50:13] whatever makeup she puts on covers a lot. Right how is she still cute lady though?

[50:19] Oh yeah she's very very fine very you know personable she looked at all the

[50:23] dots she thought it was funny so that's pretty much the only celebrity meeting I

[50:27] had while at Williams. And she was easy to work with? Yeah I only met her once I

[50:31] guess it's her husband and her manager so he approved the whole game after it

[50:35] was done and I don't think they had much of a problem I mean if you look at

[50:39] her the license of her pretty much anything goes with that. Right right right so

[50:46] I mean was that I mean how how sexy could have you made the game or did they

[50:50] want you to make the game? I think we just stuck with you know what you see with

[50:55] her on television is how far we went with it the rest of it was all with

[50:59] monsters and creatures and more of the ancillary stuff. Right now on medieval

[51:05] madness any interesting stories related to that game? Yeah we sent I remember

[51:10] the team sat in the room this is Doug Watson had been laid off before that

[51:15] game came out because we were going to bring the attack from Mars team back

[51:18] together so we're all sitting in a room we knew what pressure we were under

[51:22] everybody wanted Brian Eddie to make another attack from Mars so he even

[51:28] shared that pressure with us that we really need to do attack from Mars but

[51:32] better and we thought better you know we had there's such such sparks flew when

[51:38] we put together attack from Mars how are we supposed to top that so we started

[51:44] working on the game and it ended up being like a Monty Python rip off as we

[51:48] were starting now was Monty Python supposed to be the license? No not at all it

[51:52] was going to be in that vein but the idea was going to be storm the castle and

[51:58] in fact it took months to name that game we I still have a page of about 50

[52:04] names where we were bouncing around none of them seemed to stick so finally we

[52:10] had a voting and I think medieval madness came close to the top and then

[52:13] Brian Eddie circle it and said that's her name now when they were using the

[52:17] attack from Mars is kind of like a you know a benchmark at the time I mean they

[52:23] only sold about 3500 units of attack from Mars why was that earned very well

[52:27] and I think a great reviews and well I'm sure you've played it yeah yeah I

[52:33] own one it is great game but you know it's to me for as good a game as it is

[52:38] and they only made 3500 units it seems kind of odd well it's odd but consider what

[52:44] was happening to the industry at the time I believe theater magic sold about

[52:48] 6500 units right right I don't have the yep yep no that's right from theater

[52:54] magic we went downhill from there right as far as units sold until we came out

[52:59] with revenge from Mars which I think went over 7000 we were looking at the you

[53:04] know below for figures right and actually um scared stiff and medieval madness

[53:10] were both you know kind of high for that error they were about 4000 games each

[53:14] right and those were considered hits whereas five years prior to that that would

[53:18] have been a dud right right so when you when when you guys did the medieval did

[53:23] you feel like you surpassed attack from Mars I think we did and it's because we

[53:29] really got into the creativity of it I wrote some speech for it I helped design

[53:33] two modes for it John Yelsey was brought into replace Doug Watson on the art

[53:38] package and you can see by that backlash and especially the side cabinet that

[53:43] is some of the finest Yelsey artwork at least in my opinion I've ever seen

[53:48] now what what happened to you know Watson you said was in early and then he got

[53:53] laid off and one of the you know when they decreased teams or something yeah

[53:57] they they did a big cut I forget it was 50% or whatever number but they sent a

[54:02] lot of us engineers home and I mean did did any of the Watson art survive no I

[54:08] don't think he had even started sketching on that yet maybe he was talking to

[54:11] Brian Eddie that part I don't know but yeah he actually think Doug Watson was

[54:17] working on ticket tech toe art when he was asked to leave now let's talk about

[54:23] cactus Canyon sure a game that I really really like but one thing that

[54:26] everybody always brings up is that you know and a game match sequence it seems

[54:31] really plain what what's going on there I think well cactus Canyon as you know

[54:38] was the very last dot game and we were being pushed hard especially myself to

[54:44] get rid of the you know leave the dots behind and get on to Pimble 2000 so it was

[54:51] my basically my time was cut short by learning 3d design working with George

[54:57] Gomez and Brian Eddie on Revenge of Mars really myself and also Jim rap who is

[55:04] the other sort of a dot guy who had contributed a little bit to it we were just

[55:10] both pulled away from that game far too soon so you mean that the animation's

[55:14] never got drawn then you know I'm forgetting all the the exact but yeah

[55:20] there I don't think they got a complete dot package at least as complete as I

[55:24] would have made it had I not been the Pimble 2000 guy has anybody come back to

[55:29] you to revisit that and say hey we we really like you know to see a better

[55:34] match sequence can you draw something up well you know I've stayed in contact

[55:37] with Matt Coriel he now lives in Lexington Kentucky working for Lexmark he

[55:43] may have enhanced his rhymes but he has not asked me for any dots and actually I

[55:48] would ask for payment to work and since no one seems to want to write a check

[55:55] I guess the game is as it is right right now it's speaking of which how much

[56:00] time would it take to do like a match sequence like that from a dot point of

[56:05] you yeah yeah not that long matches usually you know if a concept is very easy

[56:10] like single frames or something it would have gone very quick it was programming

[56:14] with much harder than than animating so I couldn't speak to the actual coding

[56:18] but yeah I could probably do a quick match sequence okay well just in case I am

[56:23] going to get asked this what's looking at what's the what's the number on the

[56:27] check that we need to get it made out so that we can get this done have them

[56:31] they can email me at Adam at hebrart.com and we'll talk yeah because I think

[56:37] there's a lot of people that would like to see that you know something something

[56:41] done on the at the end of that I don't know how how much Matt's into doing it

[56:45] though well you know I don't know if Matt's going to listen to this tape or I

[56:49] can even email him I'll find out yeah because there's some people that would

[56:53] that would it mean included that would definitely be willing to contribute to

[56:57] that to that cause to get that maybe get that enhanced that would be great now

[57:02] wizard blocks how much did you work on that well we as soon as the very minute

[57:08] we finished with star wars episode one the whole team jumped on wizard blocks

[57:12] and we were working hard on it but I think we all saw the writing on the wall

[57:17] at that point what you know star wars did not make its numbers it did not

[57:21] sell well in non-English speaking countries like germany france which is where

[57:27] we used to sell most of our pimble games we kind of knew that the axles falling

[57:32] right but that was partly management's fault they raised the price of the

[57:37] game 500 box and got a bunch of those European orders canceled yes that

[57:42] too but the the earnings we were following the earnings and when a star wars

[57:46] episode one was put in the movie theater it was earned the people couldn't

[57:50] shove money in that thing fast enough but apparently it didn't earn as well in

[57:54] some of those other countries it was a damn jar jar well you know we saw the

[58:00] style guide from Lucasfilm and they had a chart how the demographics that each

[58:05] of the characters was supposed to skew towards so like the battle droids were

[58:09] young males and princess amadala was young female and old female and then jar jar

[58:16] was supposed to appeal to everyone male female young and old and I remember

[58:22] telling the rest of the group Lucas is either exactly right or exactly wrong

[58:27] yeah we know which one too that damn jar jar no what he was thinking can you

[58:34] read your jar jar into something else I don't care what it is can you take

[58:39] the graphics or playboy and put it over over jar jar just something I don't

[58:48] care take the wizards from wizard blocks I don't look into that damn jar jar you

[58:53] know in my opinion he made a better pinball character than he did a movie

[58:56] character because as you were to shoot the ball he'd fall over I was actually

[59:00] used by that right right but not only he just pisses me off on all levels I

[59:04] just don't I'm not a jar jar fan you know but I guess that isn't gonna happen so

[59:09] now I'm wizard blocks how far did you get with wizard blocks we started getting

[59:13] into some of the modes now pet waller who he's a very meticulous when he

[59:20] designs his games he is in control of all the modes and he does he designs some

[59:26] fantastic games but he definitely doesn't show his hand until he's ready now

[59:30] that works okay and dots where I could put together a brand new show in two or

[59:35] three days if he changes his mind but in 3d if you design like human models or

[59:41] creature models and he throws the whole mode out then you have to start from

[59:45] scratch and that could be a month of work so we did run into some time constraints

[59:50] as far as changing of minds you know dynamically to make the game better the

[59:57] designing graphics was a brand new ball game how many wizards did you get

[01:00:02] designed haven't seen that stuff in a while there might have been five wizards

[01:00:08] you know you guys can correct me if I'm wrong yeah I think there's five wizards but

[01:00:11] you didn't get them all drawn right no I think we were 3d modeling like there's

[01:00:15] the young boy wizard I think there's the Egyptian goddess wizard that was

[01:00:20] modeled I forget the other ones but I was working on a character called the

[01:00:24] underground terror which was sort of a little green Grimland guy sort of a

[01:00:29] hybrid frog human who John Yelsey had drawn in 2d I created a character in 3d and

[01:00:36] I was able to animate him and I'm giving you the extra ball had him throwing a bomb

[01:00:41] at you there a lot of fun stuff I really pushed my 3d skills at that time

[01:00:45] but then they closed the doors now was that typical where Yelsey would would

[01:00:51] draw something and you guys would have to 3d it it was only typical on that game

[01:00:56] before that you know when Yelsey had contributed to revenge from Mars we kind of

[01:01:02] knew what the Martians look like right right now let's talk about the black

[01:01:07] Monday thing you know what how did that go down for you I showed up we actually

[01:01:12] had an intern from Holland who was staying for a couple months and I had gone to

[01:01:16] my mother's house got all these dishes for him to use because he had nothing he

[01:01:19] had paper plates so I walk into the company with a big box full of dishes and I

[01:01:25] walk it over to his desk and Paul Barker who is a production artist at the time

[01:01:29] turning me said Adam you might want to be taking boxes out today not bringing

[01:01:33] them in because by time I showed up at work that day the internet had been

[01:01:40] shut down the network had been plug it been pulled and there was supposed to be

[01:01:44] a meeting at noon that day a company wife so we all knew what was about to happen

[01:01:49] right so they brought us all into the cafeteria and they told us what we all

[01:01:54] knew which is pinball has been you know losing money like an open wound and they

[01:01:59] can no longer justify to their shareholders why we even exist so they we're

[01:02:05] all going to get severance in some degree based on our tenure there and artists

[01:02:10] and programmers were going to be interviewed at midway so did you go for an

[01:02:15] interview yeah actually interviewed back at gaming which is sort of a full

[01:02:18] circle for me didn't like what I saw there so interviewed at midway and I

[01:02:24] eventually hooked up with their sports department working on red card soccer

[01:02:30] okay so now how was it working over on the midway side well I would define it

[01:02:36] as the inmates running the asylum there's a lot of a lot of designers who are

[01:02:43] very young compared to especially compared the managers and pinball I didn't

[01:02:47] I didn't feel they were managing things very well I mean they're all fantastic

[01:02:52] talents and great designers but as far as managers go I think they weren't in

[01:02:57] the correct roles right so it just made everything just chaos huh yeah I you

[01:03:03] know I expect a certain level professionalism and maybe that's that's a bad

[01:03:07] expectation in the game company but I just really didn't like the vibe there so

[01:03:13] I learned 3d studio max as fast as I could from one of their experts there and

[01:03:17] during that time is everybody remembers the dot com era was in full swing so I

[01:03:23] taught myself HTML and I had all the graphics skills down so put my resume out

[01:03:29] and boy did I get some bites so you didn't how long were you in midway I was

[01:03:33] in midway for about six months when I got an offer I absolutely not refused from

[01:03:37] a dot com company and how long did you stay at that company I was there actually

[01:03:43] year and a half one of our clients was in one of the twin towers JP Morgan

[01:03:49] Treasuries services and that was one of our graphic clients through that

[01:03:53] company so after 19 months I decided to fly a plane to the building right we

[01:03:58] pretty much lost our only source of revenue at that time they laid off our

[01:04:03] whole department wow wow were there any year any your client killed in the

[01:04:10] that I don't know that I think they were low enough in the building I think

[01:04:14] they're like 11th floor something like that I think they all got out right you

[01:04:18] know I praise God I hope they all got out yeah yeah tell me about it okay so

[01:04:22] now you're starting to do some stuff you would for Pat Lawler yes are you gonna

[01:04:27] still continue to do that oh I am um he you know I work with him on Ripley's on

[01:04:32] Grand Prix in NASCAR I chose not to do family guy why why not sure what he's

[01:04:38] doing next but I did say hey you know if you've got another game give me a call

[01:04:42] why didn't you want to do family guy for me it's two full first off I really hate

[01:04:47] that show and second I just I find it to be a very there's pretty much an

[01:04:53] obscene show I mean sure that the symptoms get a little raunchy with their

[01:04:57] humor but family guy yeah there are no other level up or other watch level

[01:05:02] yeah maybe I just didn't really want to sign my name onto that kind of license

[01:05:06] right right now did do you think Pat Lawler had a problem with that license um I

[01:05:11] really can't speak for them but I do know that was not their first pick right

[01:05:14] right well it seems the game seems to be doing well you know good the

[01:05:19] Pimble industry definitely needs some blood flowing or else the the only

[01:05:24] company left on the planet earth is gonna have some trouble now how is how was

[01:05:28] Ripley's how did you feel about doing that one Ripley's was cool I wasn't

[01:05:31] crazy about the backlash and John you'll see is a friend of mine I respect him

[01:05:36] like no other artists on this planet but I think the backlash is a bit of a

[01:05:39] turnoff for players yeah it's um I don't know you know I guess it kind of

[01:05:44] captures the whole Ripley's theme fairly well but it's not you know for me to

[01:05:50] walk up to it I kind of look at it and yeah yeah yeah I'm not a

[01:05:55] squeamish guy but that's a little grotesque yeah it's it's you know I kind of

[01:06:00] like the glasses with the chicks on it you know it's just me though it works

[01:06:03] every time it does it does and what what is there to complain about that what

[01:06:07] her cleavage is too low I mean you know what we're you know who's gonna ever say

[01:06:11] that not too many people not too many well there's some debate about theater

[01:06:14] magic that I won't go into that you know yeah I'm speaking of theater magic

[01:06:19] the the lady that did the voice for theater magic entails for the radio

[01:06:24] nights that was the same person right I think so okay did you I mean was this

[01:06:29] of a pop it do thing that he just chose the gold kind of that route because

[01:06:32] I believe I think he liked her voice and that it matched his his sensibilities

[01:06:38] or his his aesthetics and he just went for that and I mean those two games have

[01:06:43] a very similar look and feel to him definitely he pop it up with more of a

[01:06:47] crossover in that a lot of games that Williams put out like a no fear in the

[01:06:52] 500 definitely skew masculine period there is no effort made to appeal to

[01:06:58] anyone but you know guys like cars that kind of stuff right pop it up added some

[01:07:04] art and some flare to his games and definitely a theater magic there was some

[01:07:08] crossover play and I think that's why it earns so well now was there where

[01:07:12] the people that complained about that backlash I'm about the public but I know

[01:07:18] it within my own family sphere and friendly or friend fear there is a question

[01:07:24] there was some concern exactly some concern now how would you know you did you

[01:07:29] also did some racing things of course you did any 500 and you did you know the

[01:07:33] Grand Prix slash NASCAR for Pat Waller you know how was how was it doing those

[01:07:38] you know racing style games well with Indy 500 that was challenging because the

[01:07:43] license or did not want us showing pretty much anything fun it was driving the

[01:07:49] cars going left to right cars going right to left cars going at you cars going away

[01:07:52] from you and as a dot guy that's very limiting so you know we have a car one car

[01:07:58] accident on the display and then the announcer comes and said but he's okay

[01:08:03] huh yeah yeah I mean you couldn't have you know a car going through the pits and

[01:08:08] guys flying left and right and tires and wrenches and stuff exactly so instead we

[01:08:12] had more fun with cows right and I mean was that I would have never thought that

[01:08:17] Indy 500 would be a difficult license to work with well difficult in that as

[01:08:23] far as dot go it was the same thing over and over again we we had very little

[01:08:28] variety going so there was no way to implement anything else into that not

[01:08:35] really it was you know when the trophy drive the car drive the car around drive

[01:08:41] the car over something drive it under something it so that wise there's really

[01:08:45] no human activity for players to to engage with and you you came up with

[01:08:51] obviously with other ideas and you're saying the like the the license or just

[01:08:54] I know pretty much it was they wanted a very straight up Indy 500 theme yeah

[01:09:00] that if my memory serves I don't think the design team really you know push that

[01:09:04] envelope they're just so happy to have that theme or that license that we just

[01:09:07] went with it well that game is kind of odd because there's no like the

[01:09:11] son of a land to it you know I like well let's take like World Cup soccer

[01:09:16] um you know you you have different matches that you're building up to you know

[01:09:21] the final match with Indy 500 it's like one big race that never ends you know

[01:09:28] it just keeps going it's you know what I mean at the if it was me I would have

[01:09:34] had you know races building up to the one big race you know or you know

[01:09:39] qualifiers or something and it just it doesn't I don't really you don't really

[01:09:44] get that feel from it you know what I mean I agree I was left a little cold and

[01:09:47] especially the the play feel art I think it's Dan Hughes he was a freelancer

[01:09:51] pulled in for only a couple games it didn't really excite me that much now the

[01:09:56] backlash itself with the cars very very well rendered right that's yeah I feel

[01:10:01] I think the colors were a bit acidic there's a lot of clashing it just didn't do

[01:10:06] much for me why now why would they bring a freelancer in for that I think it

[01:10:11] two things I think the Stan Hughes guy and I've never really never met him I was

[01:10:15] told that he was a very good auto in auto illustrator so he could paint cars

[01:10:20] very well hmm so that's one one reason to bring him in second I think everyone

[01:10:24] else was busy oh okay okay yeah that's a game I'd sure like to see the software

[01:10:30] updated on but I guess that's a dream yes well just like any piece of art at

[01:10:36] some point yet put the brushes down and hang the canvas right right right now

[01:10:40] how was Grand Prix slash NASCAR um that was more fun uh pet wallard definitely put

[01:10:45] some more into it some more interest in it um as far as like spin-outs some

[01:10:50] crashes and stuff I have more fun with that it could also be because of where I

[01:10:54] did I did at home uh which is very different for me to do dots at home as

[01:10:58] opposed to in an engineering department but uh I know I had a good time doing

[01:11:02] that one now no good gopher's how was that can uh if that was a theme that you

[01:11:08] know path started I think it went a couple different directions before it

[01:11:11] finally he stayed with that one theme I had a lot of fun with the gopher's you

[01:11:17] know sending pinballs to hit them they were launching it with a swing shot

[01:11:23] as far as the game play itself maybe I just wasn't very good at that play

[01:11:27] field with with the scoop that launches the ball I can never get the whole one

[01:11:31] but at least with cartoon gopher's it was more fun to beat him up right right

[01:11:37] now the um back a year a year ago there was that um uh Lewis was uh

[01:11:46] changed the software a little bit for one of these charities were were you

[01:11:52] involved in that at all no ever since leaving Williams and except for the

[01:11:55] the pet wallard part I really haven't contributed much to the world of pinball

[01:11:59] okay I was just curious because I think Lewis changed the software a little bit

[01:12:04] for some sort of a charity event but then there was some legal thing and they

[01:12:09] they ends up that they had a that they couldn't release the code and that's too

[01:12:13] bad because you know Lewis is a just a gifted programmer and I'm sure if you

[01:12:17] got another crack at it after you know you're two of playing the game you

[01:12:21] could probably improve things right right right now how was jump yard anything

[01:12:25] interesting in that oh yeah definitely um I guess Barry Elzer created the

[01:12:30] play field and then handed to Dwight Sullivan and that was it done if there is

[01:12:34] no thought behind it no theme nothing so someone had come up with with sort of a

[01:12:40] junk theme like you're trying to free some people from a junkyard but that was

[01:12:45] it so I walked into Dwight's office and said there's really nothing nothing here

[01:12:50] in this game to make me want to win it it's just collecting junk so you said

[01:12:55] all right Adam I'm going on vacation for two weeks when I get back in two weeks

[01:12:58] I want a theme and he left so when he got back I gave him one and that's

[01:13:03] essentially what's in the game right now so you're pretty proud of that I am

[01:13:07] because he Dwight definitely likes to code what he's interested in and take

[01:13:12] control but I was surprised when he liked my theme and we went with it which

[01:13:17] was building the jolopy right and oh you know and I mean looking back on it

[01:13:21] you're all a okay with that you want to make any changes um the thing the

[01:13:26] biggest disappointment with that game was the playfield I believe on that

[01:13:29] that left I forget that the scoop or there's a less lane on that game that

[01:13:34] is nearly impossible to hit right I mean unless you're liming sheets you just

[01:13:38] can't hit that right right now what about anything interesting on Telsie

[01:13:42] Rivian Knights that was a let's see let's go back away I like that kind of

[01:13:49] theme I like to sort of the Middle Eastern a little more flair to the visuals

[01:13:55] the music was very good in that game I think there's just a pleasure to do

[01:14:01] Papadouk is just a great guy to work with and what about who done it who

[01:14:06] done it back to Dwight to me that game every time I hear of that game or think

[01:14:11] of that game I remember sitting in his office and we were trying to do those

[01:14:14] talking heads of the different characters and we wanted one of their mouths to

[01:14:19] open a certain way and he asked me can you do a half pixel and you can't turn

[01:14:26] half a light bulb on right and he I think he was serious to this day I'll never

[01:14:32] know but I just was so perplexed by that request I left his office so now how

[01:14:37] was it working with Richie on no fear I didn't work with him that closely I

[01:14:41] think he was one foot out the door at that time he was trying to go over to

[01:14:46] I believe it was a Tari in California to do California speed so he's trying to

[01:14:51] get no fear done and just get the heck out of Dodge right right but I do remember

[01:14:55] he I think due to all of his motorcycle racing he's partially deaf in either

[01:15:00] one year or both right so he kept asking Vince Panarelli for more base

[01:15:04] everything was more base he wanted to feel music so that game is very base

[01:15:09] heavy I like that more base yeah I've heard that he has a has a hearing problem

[01:15:16] yeah so yeah that's interesting there's that one quote in the game second

[01:15:20] place is the first loser right and as a player that doesn't really make you feel

[01:15:25] that good no that you know that whole game that no fear I it a game never

[01:15:29] did anything for me of course I kind of have problem with games without pop

[01:15:32] bumpers but I mean there's some exceptions like I like champion pop as

[01:15:36] much as some people don't like it I think it's kind of a cool game and that

[01:15:40] has no pop bumpers but you know yeah but generally say it's you don't care

[01:15:44] it doesn't have pop bumpers and I have a problem with games you know that like

[01:15:48] that but yeah yeah yeah well it's you know popovers have been around since you

[01:15:53] know 1948 and I just said something you know flippers pop bumpers and slingshots

[01:15:59] every game has to have that right it's like changing the formulation of Coca-Cola

[01:16:02] he likes not the same yeah exactly so what was there anything I left out or

[01:16:06] anything you want to add oh let's you know looking over my list here well I

[01:16:12] guess that the transition from dots to PIN 2000 was was quite an exceptional

[01:16:17] experience it pushed me on every level and I'm proud of what I did and what

[01:16:22] our team did even though we were only given pretty much two and a half games to

[01:16:26] work on before we're all said packing the normal game cycle was nine months

[01:16:32] and you can make all the pregnancy jokes you want there but for PIN 2000 a

[01:16:38] platform that had not been you know it went from zero to a hundred in seven

[01:16:42] months and every member of that PIMO group just busted their back sides to get

[01:16:48] that out the door and we brought to London to a trade show that January of

[01:16:52] 1990 yep I remember and I was there and I was just wasted as far as just how

[01:16:58] much work we had put into it in the long flight and all that but standing there

[01:17:02] and having people have never seen it before run up to the game and play it and

[01:17:06] really get into it there was nothing like it wow it's just a very emotional

[01:17:13] experience for me and I think everybody else felt the same that when the

[01:17:18] sales started rolling in we at that time we thought we had saved PIN

[01:17:22] ball we were just euphoric yeah little did you know though I mean how did you

[01:17:28] feel about management's reaction to the whole PIN

[01:17:31] vault 2000 thing I was happy with them that they gave us the shot they gave

[01:17:36] the money to actually dumps PIN ball as we knew it and recreated from the

[01:17:42] ground up with George Gomez and Pet Lawler's amazing idea because they really

[01:17:48] they had sort of they were inspired by John Papadu's idea but they took at one

[01:17:52] level farther with the whole hologram thing now were you there for that first

[01:17:56] meeting when when Pat and George wasn't there for the meeting but I someone came

[01:18:02] in my office at Adam you've got to come over here so we all went over to the

[01:18:05] midway building and that's where they had hidden the very first prototype and

[01:18:10] I walked in the room and they said Adam take a look at that what do you think

[01:18:14] and I was I was nuked by it I couldn't believe it I was seeing that it actually

[01:18:19] worked you could put a hologram on a play field and interact with it and now

[01:18:24] how would how are they implementing that on their on their model I believe a

[01:18:29] foam core play field George had taken some comic books and cut them up and made

[01:18:34] a backlash out of it and he had one picture using an amiga computer if you

[01:18:40] remember what the yeah I remember with a some sort of monitors suspended the

[01:18:46] correct angle and there was sort of a like one of those robots from Robocop

[01:18:50] standing there facing you with this gun named at you and it was just in your

[01:18:55] face and it was a thing of beauty huh so right then you saw the potential we did

[01:19:01] and actually was a John Papadu team we went on to lunch after that he had been

[01:19:06] developing a different version of Pint 2000 with a monitor in the back glass

[01:19:09] yeah kind of like a reflected baby Pac-Man type thing yeah I guess that those

[01:19:14] thought and he was designing a whole cabinet to frame it and everything and

[01:19:18] during this lunch or the very depressing lunch actually that John had put his

[01:19:23] heart and soul into it and he went around the table asking us well what do you

[01:19:28] think this new thing that George and Pat had brought in and we all very

[01:19:33] reluctantly admitted that this hologram thing is just so cool we have to go

[01:19:39] with this version so he was pretty hurt huh well I hope he wasn't because his

[01:19:44] his product was magnificent as well but the the cool factor was definitely there

[01:19:50] especially the interaction with the ball and the the video graphics would have

[01:19:54] Papadu's flavor of Pint Malt 2000 would have it been as much work to program as

[01:20:01] Pint Malt 2000 yes because the graphics would have been the same amount we we

[01:20:06] have been doing different things with them but it would have pretty much been

[01:20:09] playing movies back as you play Pint Malt yeah you know that's the problem with

[01:20:15] that and I know this kind of this maybe isn't a good thing to mention to you a

[01:20:19] dot guy is that sometimes the movies can overtake the pinball when it

[01:20:25] interrupts the whole flow of the game and the good thing about Pint Malt 2000 is

[01:20:29] that it influenced it right into the game so that you don't have to look up to

[01:20:33] see it right that definitely that married animations with physical pinball and I

[01:20:39] think that's what really stood out from their innovation and that's why we all

[01:20:44] voted for that yeah and that's why I was kind of curious did you ever do like

[01:20:49] you know you know frame basically a mini movie and then have a designer say

[01:20:54] you know that's you did a great job but that's just it's too much it's too long

[01:20:58] and it takes too much time away from you know interrupting the flow of the game

[01:21:03] to anybody I mean that all the time because as that guys you want to do the

[01:21:08] best stuff we can and play these movies back and just show how cool we can get

[01:21:12] dots to work but you're you're doing it at the disservice of the game right and

[01:21:17] there are a lot of times programmers would implement flipper interrupts where

[01:21:21] if that long multi-ball show is going to play again just hit the flippers you

[01:21:26] know both flippers same time and the show interrupts and it's just that's

[01:21:29] being balled at you right did that hurt you when when they did that really because

[01:21:34] the show is in there for people who don't know about flipper interrupt and people

[01:21:37] who like to watch dots it's there right now we we were criticized all the time by

[01:21:42] people saying well no one watches the dots so that makes us feel real good I'll

[01:21:47] tell you my ego got kicked every day but really if you had a game without dots

[01:21:53] no one would play it because the games with dots were more engaging right the

[01:21:57] people who play games over and over again they stop looking at the dots right

[01:22:02] right right really couldn't win yeah we're a necessary evil to some people now

[01:22:09] did you ever have a problem with the thing that they called bog where the

[01:22:15] machine couldn't you know wasn't this the 60809 that was running wpc wasn't

[01:22:21] fast enough to display your animations and you know and flash the lights and

[01:22:26] update the scores and yeah we were often we would have to scale down the

[01:22:31] shows and actually take what's called dither out of the shows which are the

[01:22:34] alternating dot patterns we have to smooth out the dots and actually take

[01:22:39] detail out of our shows in order for them to play back in real time because

[01:22:44] lineman was the king of choreographing what he would just yell out bog you

[01:22:51] choreograph that out and make sure the light shows behaved he was exceptional

[01:22:55] that yeah because the the one that always comes to mind is is Johnny Mimonic

[01:22:59] uh... in the in the lane change when you go hit the flipper to do the lane

[01:23:04] change and it's like two or three seconds later before it actually does that

[01:23:08] you know well you know the processor speed and you have the doctor playing the

[01:23:11] music is going on the light shows so there's a lot happening on a very weak

[01:23:15] processor right right so you had to deal with that then huh yeah we sometimes

[01:23:20] we'd have to strip down the shows but they're in some cases there's nothing to do

[01:23:24] that you know if you put one pixel up there you're gonna bother game so we

[01:23:28] have a little bit now have you worked with

[01:23:31] all i'm in new system on uh... at stern the sam system that has more than the

[01:23:36] three levels of intensity in the dot no i haven't i've heard about it and

[01:23:41] and as a former dot guy it sounds really cool that's what we're all praying for

[01:23:45] back then

[01:23:46] um...

[01:23:47] you know why couldn't they do that at williams

[01:23:49] what was it why couldn't they do that at williams have the

[01:23:51] i think they were reluctant to they didn't want to put the effort into

[01:23:55] engineering that when you can make the same amount of money with three colors

[01:23:59] right right

[01:24:00] so

[01:24:01] does your tool package change when they change the dot intensity

[01:24:07] um...

[01:24:08] always for it like the yeah i'm doing now well yeah like for so now you've got

[01:24:12] i don't know it's got nine levels of intensity or whatever

[01:24:15] um...

[01:24:16] you know i can't answer that question without talking to those guys my guess

[01:24:19] would be we can still use the luxe animation because uh... deluxe animation

[01:24:23] can support two hundred fifty six colors okay

[01:24:26] okay so that just a guess i i think that's an educated guest not a actual fact

[01:24:31] so you're looking forward to do more in games and

[01:24:33] yeah i wouldn't mind if my schedule opens up i have a full-time job and i'm

[01:24:36] doing a lot quite a bit of freelance of my own fine art in the evening so

[01:24:40] uh... my days are pretty much book morning tonight really

[01:24:44] well it's good i'm from major busy and you're good

[01:24:48] good combination of the two well i mean you did outstanding job

[01:24:51] i mean specially like circus well tear i mean that

[01:24:54] the animations on that i'd to me and and attack from ours are just

[01:24:58] you know that whole thing with the extra ball i mean that's that's all classic

[01:25:01] i mean people talk about that

[01:25:04] all the time

[01:25:05] when they come over and play that game and they get an extra ball and they see

[01:25:08] that animation they're like you see that

[01:25:11] that makes me feel good because as an artist

[01:25:14] i could do all the art i want in in my studio or you know under a desk or whatever

[01:25:18] but uh... it's when people actually interact or

[01:25:23] or respond to my art or my animations

[01:25:25] that's the real reward i i'll leave you the story i went downstairs to our

[01:25:31] testing area and there's a guy playing monster bash

[01:25:34] and he got the extra ball with Dracula doing the john trouble to disco scene

[01:25:38] right right actually rented uh... setter tonight live

[01:25:41] or i'm sorry tonight fever and uh...

[01:25:44] and digitize

[01:25:45] trivola to be Dracula

[01:25:47] and then sponor really had done that disco theme i think it was uh... like

[01:25:50] why mc a or right right in the the other thing falls on his head exactly so i'm

[01:25:55] this guy he's the only one of the room he did not notice me come in

[01:25:59] and when he got extra ball he started dancing exactly how Dracula was dancing

[01:26:03] and as soon as he he kind of heard me after he was done he turned around his

[01:26:08] very embarrassed

[01:26:09] because i caught him dancing

[01:26:12] i smiled ear to ear just knowing that i have reached someone

[01:26:16] and someone actually

[01:26:18] watched my animation heard the music from vince and responded how exactly how we

[01:26:23] wanted him to which was in a very enjoyable way he was completely part of the

[01:26:27] game at that point

[01:26:29] well you mentioned something in there you said you digitize part of the movie

[01:26:33] what do you mean how did that how does that work

[01:26:36] we have some different tools actually we're using uh... one tool that was written

[01:26:39] by the midway guys for moral combat um...

[01:26:42] you would actually

[01:26:44] you could take a vhs tape

[01:26:46] uh... click the like the button capture and capture several frames

[01:26:51] i think it a very low resolution

[01:26:53] uh... and bring those frames as uh... gray scale frames into deluxe animation

[01:26:57] and then break them down by hand into dots

[01:27:01] did that make things easier

[01:27:03] it did when you had to get very complex things happening special like human

[01:27:07] movement

[01:27:08] and uh... let's say it like a car or spaceship rotating

[01:27:12] uh... it really helped

[01:27:13] right otherwise you have to draw all that by hand

[01:27:16] and i'm you can probably look at several games and see where we did do it by

[01:27:20] hand and where we digitize that there's definitely a difference

[01:27:24] okay now

[01:27:25] yet like i'm not secretive talking about a monster bash

[01:27:30] like that the Dracula in the in the mirror ball or whatever

[01:27:34] the way because the way their size and you have to show

[01:27:38] distance between the mirror ball in the top of his head

[01:27:41] everything had to be fairly small

[01:27:43] yeah unfortunately i would have liked more height on that to show more detail

[01:27:46] of Dracula doing the the trivola dance

[01:27:49] right because he's just not big enough to get in the screen doesn't provide that

[01:27:53] level of detail

[01:27:53] no but that part of the art is can add them to it in thirty two pixels high and

[01:27:58] you know i'll leave that up to

[01:28:00] the public but i think i was able to pull it off

[01:28:02] yeah i was going to say it it seems extremely challenging to do something

[01:28:06] like that

[01:28:07] well you have to leave a lot of details all like his eyes are just literally

[01:28:10] two black dots he has no mouth

[01:28:12] memory serve

[01:28:14] um... you just have to get

[01:28:16] what when an animation is moving when a character is moving

[01:28:19] the human mind actually

[01:28:22] adds more detail to it than is actually there

[01:28:25] because when it's when a shape is moving like a human

[01:28:28] you describe human qualities to it

[01:28:30] gotcha

[01:28:31] i'm trying and sometimes not succeeding to

[01:28:34] actually use the human mind to fill in everything i can't draw

[01:28:39] right now i mean to do anybody ever say

[01:28:41] well maybe you could show it from you know the top of the mirror ball and show

[01:28:44] the mirror ball coming down

[01:28:46] and as you know it gets closer and closer to his head he gets bigger and bigger

[01:28:51] i don't know when they've had suggestions that particular one but i have

[01:28:54] had requests before where they wanted to zoomed in on something and then

[01:28:57] pan out to show something else but

[01:29:00] for people who don't do dot every day they keep forgetting

[01:29:03] that we only have thirty two pixels high

[01:29:05] so there's only literally so much we can display at any one time right

[01:29:10] right uh... what do i like to do is actually edit he'd like to show

[01:29:14] one scene and cut to another scene and cut back to another scene

[01:29:18] to try to

[01:29:19] just like a tv show give you the impression of what's going on in a larger space

[01:29:23] right like multiple camera angles

[01:29:26] into that drive you not

[01:29:27] no it's definitely a challenge versus some of the other shows i've done

[01:29:30] because usually a show is just one camera

[01:29:33] let's follow the action and then go play the ball again

[01:29:36] uh... do i like more sort of some of the graphic feel

[01:29:40] right and so that you know provided more work for you though

[01:29:44] oh sure did but you know i

[01:29:46] dot sort of a very

[01:29:48] uh... rewarding experience

[01:29:49] it's something that even when i did

[01:29:52] uh... ask our and rickley's at home

[01:29:54] it still wasn't

[01:29:55] the same as working with those guys at the company itself

[01:29:59] right because there's more feedback and

[01:30:01] and and whatever you know we actually serve

[01:30:05] during least the eight or nine or ten hours out of every day i would live the

[01:30:08] whole thing which is you do the dot show

[01:30:11] you bring to the program or they they put it in the game

[01:30:13] then you get to flip the game and see how it feels it doesn't feel right you

[01:30:17] tweak it you bring it back

[01:30:18] and it's for the iterative process

[01:30:20] and the

[01:30:21] just having a whole experience

[01:30:23] was just really rewarding in a cannot be reproduced

[01:30:27] i've been at web companies you learn companies

[01:30:31] you know i'm at a company we manufacture massage tables and their creative

[01:30:34] director

[01:30:35] nothing compares

[01:30:38] the whole pinball experience

[01:30:39] so i know when you

[01:30:41] worked in that when you went walked into pinball

[01:30:44] you know from the gaming had you you never owned a game before

[01:30:48] how much pinball you ever played

[01:30:49] only that when i would sneak out of the a gaming

[01:30:52] uh... division and sneak over and play pinball

[01:30:55] that's the experience i have but prior to the also moral combat to their

[01:30:58] increasing u.s.a. but i didn't play those they play pinball

[01:31:01] now prior to this though

[01:31:03] how much pinball experience did you have to stop pretty much zero

[01:31:07] i really never experienced a lot of pinball growing up

[01:31:09] i did hang out you know the orchids playing uh... like tempest

[01:31:13] or uh...

[01:31:14] or tron which is actually george goma's game right

[01:31:18] uh... play those as a kid but then i sort of dropped out of video games until

[01:31:21] i

[01:31:21] i actually joined w.m.s

[01:31:23] now do you still own the games that you bought from

[01:31:26] you know i told two of them and actually uh... if your listeners are interested

[01:31:30] i am looking to sell my attack from our medieval madness and my uh...

[01:31:35] theater magic

[01:31:36] why

[01:31:37] i don't live in a very big place and word

[01:31:40] just really have no room for pinball so currently these people games are

[01:31:43] at friend house

[01:31:44] all right

[01:31:45] which is kind of too bad i mean if we're ever by like a really big place and have

[01:31:48] a basement

[01:31:49] into the pinball thing

[01:31:51] at the moment they're not here and if someone is interested in picking those up

[01:31:55] i'd definitely make them an offer

[01:31:57] okay cool while i'm sure you're gonna get some

[01:32:00] well they're very good game that must have been right

[01:32:03] okay well cool i don't really really appreciate time

[01:32:05] thank you okay

[01:32:07] i'd like to thank adam ryan for joining us today

[01:32:10] and talk to us here on top cast

[01:32:12] uh... really really great interview and joy talking to adam

[01:32:15] and his experiences doing the uh... dot matrix

[01:32:18] artwork

[01:32:19] on the wpc pinball games

[01:32:21] and the new or stern games too

[01:32:23] so thank you again adam and that's another episode of top cast i hope

[01:32:28] here's again soon
