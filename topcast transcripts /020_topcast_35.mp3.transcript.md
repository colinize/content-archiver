[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:19] Today on Topcast we've got a Williams designer that's started working at Williams straight

[00:22] out of high school in 1970 and in 1978 designed his first game Phoenix for Williams.

[00:29] In between 1978 and 1996 he designed 35 games for Williams and his sales numbers are

[00:37] unbelievable selling over 135,000 pinball games for Williams in the period from 1978 to 1996.

[00:57] So I'd like to welcome Barry Ausler to Topcast today and Gary designed some great games

[01:03] for Williams including Gorgard, the first talking pinball machine, Jungle Lord, Barra

[01:09] Korra, Defender, Joust, the head-to-head game, of course Space Shuttle, Comet, Grand

[01:17] Lizard, Pinbott, Fire, Space Station, Cyclone, Police Force, Jokers, Bad Cats, Hardly

[01:25] Davison, Doctor Who, Hurricane, Brahms Stroker's Dracula, Dirty Harry, Who Done It, Jack

[01:32] Bach, Junkyard and many others.

[01:35] Barry Ausler was definitely very prolific for Williams and again selling over 135,000

[01:43] pinball games for Williams during this period.

[01:45] So we're going to give Barry a call right now on the phone and have a little chat with

[01:50] him.

[01:51] Hello.

[01:52] Hi, it's Barry there.

[02:02] This is Barry.

[02:03] This is Clay.

[02:04] Hey, how you doing?

[02:05] Good, how are you?

[02:06] Oh, pretty good.

[02:07] So tell me how you got into pinball and how you started working for Williams.

[02:14] I started working there the day after I graduated high school back in 1970 and I got a job

[02:21] working in the factory as a tester.

[02:25] What were you testing?

[02:26] I started out testing the back boxes, what do you call it, the neck panels that went

[02:32] inside the back boxes and the old lecture mechanical games.

[02:36] Oh, so what year was this?

[02:38] 1970.

[02:39] Oh, okay.

[02:40] So between 70, you know, it looks like your first game was the 1978 Phoenix.

[02:46] So between 70 and 78, you were basically working the factory line?

[02:52] I worked in the factory for about two and a half years and then I was offered a job up

[02:56] in engineering as a technician.

[02:58] So I went upstairs and I worked with Norm Clark and Steve Kortek.

[03:04] And designed the games and I would basically put all the whitewoods together and wire

[03:08] them up and get the game all ready for them.

[03:12] Now did you, you said you started working straight out of high school?

[03:15] Was this something that you wanted to do or just kind of fell into?

[03:19] Well, my father was working down in quality control over there and he told me that they were

[03:25] looking for some help there down in the, it was a place called the sample room where

[03:30] they would build like the 30 or 40 prototype games and that's where they got me in over

[03:36] there.

[03:37] And were you a pinball player or interested in pinball before this?

[03:40] Games, I always just play every chance I got when I, they were illegal in Chicago at

[03:44] the time.

[03:45] So anytime we won invocations or out of the city where they had games, I'd always look

[03:49] for them.

[03:50] So was this like, you know, just kind of a circumstantial thing that you just kind of

[03:55] fell into or you really wanted to work there?

[03:57] I guess at the beginning I think I kind of fell into it because I didn't really know

[04:00] what I was getting into when I started there.

[04:03] I won the full time job and things just happened to fall into place.

[04:08] So then after you were in the engineering department and putting together the white woods and

[04:14] working with Norm Clark and Steve Hordeck, you know, how did, how did things progress

[04:19] from there?

[04:20] Well, from there I guess I got a little better at putting these together.

[04:23] I was able to start drawing up the schematics for the electro mechanical games and I had come

[04:28] up with an idea for a game because I know it's a couple of the other guys that were working

[04:32] as technicians.

[04:32] They gave them a shot to try designing games and I told them I had an idea and they said,

[04:38] go ahead.

[04:39] Is that what ultimately became Phoenix?

[04:41] Right.

[04:42] And so that was, you know, the unique thing about Phoenix is that you've got the, in

[04:47] the center of the play field, you've got two singular drop targets and the lanes across

[04:51] the top and the lanes on the two in lanes, control those drop targets, raising them up.

[04:58] Right.

[05:00] And was that, that was, you know, what was the thinking behind that and how did you sell

[05:05] that to management to get the job?

[05:07] Hard to remember everything but I know we wanted different ways to make certain scores.

[05:12] We had to do one thing in order to earn something else.

[05:15] But once you knocked the target down, you couldn't get them back up again until you went

[05:19] and went over the roll of lanes.

[05:21] I guess they seemed to like the idea of that.

[05:23] They liked the idea of the little ramp I had on the left hand side.

[05:26] Or that one shot where it kind of goes up that, that almost like that tunnel, they hit

[05:30] that one target.

[05:31] Right.

[05:32] They could spell off Phoenix.

[05:33] Right.

[05:34] Right.

[05:35] Right.

[05:36] Yeah, actually, I actually own that game right now.

[05:38] Who you?

[05:39] Yeah.

[05:40] Alright.

[05:41] I kind of tripped into it but I, I really thought it was kind of a cool game myself.

[05:46] You know, and it was one of the early solid states.

[05:48] Now how was your transition from the lecture mechanical stuff to the solid state?

[05:53] It wasn't so hard as far as the game design.

[05:58] It was just trying to do any repairs on it.

[06:00] Because I mean, I know basic electronics but I can't really fix a circuit board, you

[06:05] know, trying to find out what the problem is.

[06:06] I can repair it.

[06:07] If somebody tells me this part's bad, you need to change it.

[06:11] But I wouldn't know how to troubleshoot it.

[06:13] The mechanical games I can do on blindfold.

[06:15] And was that because you were so used to putting them together in the engineering room?

[06:19] Right.

[06:20] So what I would do in the evenings and weekends is to work on the side repairing games for

[06:24] some of the operators.

[06:26] Because, you know, when you work on a factory, you know, they don't pay as much money or

[06:30] when you first start doing stuff up in engineering.

[06:33] You don't make as much as you do when you're designing.

[06:35] So I got into doing that.

[06:37] Now, it's probably making more money on the side.

[06:41] Now the Phoenix sold like slightly over 6,000 games, which actually seems like a pretty

[06:48] good sales number.

[06:49] Were they pretty happy with you?

[06:50] Yeah, they were.

[06:52] And that led, of course, to your next game, which was the time warp.

[06:57] Correct.

[06:58] And now that one sold even more.

[07:00] You sold 8800 units of that one.

[07:03] And you put something on this game that was this, your idea or was this management's idea

[07:08] or somebody else's idea to put banana flippers on that game?

[07:11] It wasn't really the first game to hit it on disco fever.

[07:16] And they said a lot of the women like the flippers because they can cradle the ball and

[07:19] make back shots and other stuff with the flippers.

[07:22] And they wanted management one of those flippers on the game.

[07:25] I didn't really.

[07:27] So that wasn't your idea then?

[07:29] I mean, there was a nice idea for doing some shots, but it's hard to make a good shot

[07:34] that you're aiming at, if you're aiming at a ramp on the game or something.

[07:38] And then you went to, you kind of hit the ball out of the park in 1979 with Gorgon.

[07:46] Gorgon, the first talking pinball machine is it maybe.

[07:50] Is there any stories behind that?

[07:52] Only story I remember from there, not so much how it came about, but when we had the

[07:56] game at the show, I don't remember the AMOI show or the ACTI show.

[07:59] The thing was so loud that Sam Stern came over to our booth and asked him to turn it

[08:03] on because they couldn't hear his games.

[08:06] Oh, because at the time, Sam Stern, of course, was now had part of his own company.

[08:13] He had the original Stern pinball, but he used to be over on the Versi Street.

[08:18] Right, because at one point, he was management at Williams.

[08:21] Right.

[08:22] He owned Williams at one time.

[08:24] Right, right.

[08:25] And then I forget the transition of how he came about with Stern.

[08:29] He bought Chicago coin.

[08:31] Right, right, right.

[08:33] So now when you sold on Gorgon, you sold like 14,000 units.

[08:37] I mean, they must have been loving you.

[08:39] Yeah, well, I think the main thing to the help that was that it was the first talking

[08:42] game in Gorgon happened to come out around the time that they developed the sound system

[08:47] for it.

[08:48] So you mean it was purely kind of coincidence that your game ended up with the talking?

[08:52] I kind of think it is.

[08:54] I mean, it was a good game to play.

[08:56] You know, I had a nice shot with the magnet on or something that we hadn't done on a pinball

[08:59] game before it magnets.

[09:00] It just happened to come about that.

[09:02] They had, you know, the talking system was limited, only a few words, but no other game

[09:08] had it at the time.

[09:09] Right.

[09:10] It was a seven word vocabulary, but it was still understandable and it worked.

[09:16] Right.

[09:17] Yeah, yeah, and it is a good game.

[09:19] It's kind of, now the artwork for Gorgon, was that your idea or just the artists?

[09:24] It was more of the artists.

[09:26] Did you have a theme in mind?

[09:28] Not 100%.

[09:30] We're trying to come up with something for it.

[09:32] We wanted to make it, I wouldn't say futuristic, but something unusual.

[09:39] Well, you know, I don't want to use the word demonic because that's not what I was looking

[09:43] at.

[09:44] But that's kind of what it looks like, but there was a lot of these dungeon and dragon type

[09:48] movies coming out around that time.

[09:50] And I think we tried the cash in on that, but heroes trying to save the girl from the

[09:55] beast.

[09:56] Now, on your prior games and games right around this, generally speaking, did you pick

[10:02] the theme or did somebody else pick the theme?

[10:05] I would come up with the theme or the name of the game.

[10:10] I mean, there had been like one incident maybe where somebody else comes up like a laser

[10:14] ball.

[10:15] Originally, we were calling it Williams Lanes.

[10:17] We were making a bowling game out of it.

[10:18] That's why I had the 10 roll over buttons in the middle.

[10:22] And we even had artwork and everything done on it.

[10:24] Then they decided that they didn't want to do it.

[10:27] They wanted a different theme.

[10:28] And I think somebody, I don't know, Steve Carter or somebody came up with the name laser

[10:33] ball.

[10:34] And on that game, that didn't do nearly as well as the Gorgar at 4,500 units sold.

[10:41] Was there, was that just because, you know, there was different change in the environment?

[10:45] Or, you know, it just, you know, you can't, you can't sell a million of every game every

[10:49] time.

[10:50] Are you referring to laser ball?

[10:51] Right, laser ball.

[10:52] That was a wide body game too.

[10:54] Right.

[10:55] Oh, so for a wide body, that was actually pretty good sales.

[10:57] Right.

[10:58] They never sold that many of them.

[11:00] Right.

[11:01] Right.

[11:02] And also a wide body too, which came out next.

[11:05] Yes it was.

[11:07] Now what was there any stories behind the Scorpion game?

[11:10] Not, not too much that I can remember.

[11:13] I was just trying to make this, another follow up to the last wide body that I made and

[11:19] just trying to do some other unusual stuff.

[11:21] I think that then they had, I think Atari was doing middle earth or, oh, they were, they

[11:25] might have been after that even.

[11:26] But we were just trying to come up with it like a similar type of theme.

[11:31] Now why were they going with the wide body pins opposed to the normal size ones?

[11:35] What was the thinking behind that?

[11:37] The only thinking I can come up with really is that somebody else was doing it too and

[11:42] they didn't want to be left in the dust, you know, if it did take off because then Atari

[11:47] was doing nothing about wide bodies at the time.

[11:50] And so the competition was basically driving that horse.

[11:53] Right.

[11:54] Nothing valid was doing wide bodies.

[11:55] So if you don't do one and the games do well, then you're going to be the last one.

[11:59] Right.

[12:00] How did you feel about the wide body theme?

[12:03] It was good if it was done right.

[12:05] Like when I did laser ball, I kind of laid it out like a narrow body game and had other

[12:10] stuff along the sides.

[12:11] So the game would play like a small game.

[12:13] But some of them were so wide that it just took too long for the ball to do anything.

[12:18] There's just a lot of open dead space.

[12:20] In 1981, Jungle Lord came out and there was, I think, where the cabinet was available,

[12:27] I guess, as a red cabinet and then it switched to a blue, what was the story behind that?

[12:34] I think that was mostly just because they just didn't like the color.

[12:38] I don't know if it just didn't test well or somebody in management didn't like it.

[12:42] It just didn't look right.

[12:44] So that was nothing that you were determining there?

[12:47] No, no.

[12:48] Sometimes they'll make a couple different sample color cabinets and if they don't like it,

[12:51] they'll go and switch it.

[12:52] They'll people involve the marketing people and the designers and somebody says they don't

[12:58] like it.

[12:59] It'll take like a vote on it then.

[13:01] Prior to Jungle Lord, who was doing most of the programming for your games?

[13:07] Different people.

[13:08] Well, I know Eugene Jarvis and Larry Demar were doing programming before they got into

[13:12] the video.

[13:13] So I ended up until 1980.

[13:16] I kind of think who else was there.

[13:19] There was a guy named Randy Fyfer.

[13:21] I know he did some programming for us.

[13:23] Did you have a particular programmer that you really like to work with?

[13:27] Well, later on we did when Bill Fudsenroider was programming and some of the later guys,

[13:33] you know, Dwight Sullivan, the people that are still around doing it.

[13:38] But in the past, the programming really wasn't as complicated as it is now.

[13:44] Right.

[13:45] So it didn't make that much difference really.

[13:47] Right.

[13:48] So your fire sold just, you know, you know, like a little almost 800 units.

[13:54] What, what was the deal with that game?

[13:56] Why did sales not do so well on that one?

[13:59] With that, it was probably because of the timing on it, when Defender had come out and

[14:05] somebody, all the other video games were getting really hot and everything in early 80s,

[14:09] which was completely dead from like 81 to 85.

[14:13] And you're lucky to sell 2,000 games of anything.

[14:15] And I think Solar Fire was one of my best layouts.

[14:18] Action it had, you know, a two level play field on it.

[14:21] Yeah, lots of shoot at on a lot of rules.

[14:24] Yeah, it's kind of a cool game.

[14:27] Was Solar Fire, do they ever consider having that, having speech for in Solar Fire at all?

[14:32] Not that I recall.

[14:33] I don't remember them ever putting it in there at the time.

[14:37] And where did that theme come from?

[14:39] I just kind of came up with it, you know, I just wanted to do something, you know,

[14:44] what do you want to call it, like sci-fi?

[14:46] You did a lot of like the space and kind of sci-fi, you know, theme.

[14:52] You really liked those, eh?

[14:53] Yeah, I kind of did, yeah.

[14:55] Okay, did you, when you were growing up, were you like a comic book person or anything?

[15:00] Oh yeah, I liked those.

[15:01] I just like, you know, whatever sci-fi I can find, which is a little harder back then,

[15:05] except for the old B movies.

[15:06] One that people really like as far as the artwork goes was the Barra Cora, or Barra Cuda.

[15:13] I guess was the original name?

[15:15] Yeah, I guess it was like a chorus between a woman and a fish if you kind of look at the

[15:19] creature.

[15:21] So they could be under calling it Barra Cora, like her name would be Cora and the Barra Cuda.

[15:26] Becky originally was laid out by Roger Sharp and Steve Epstein and the layout I guess

[15:33] was as good as they wanted, so they wanted me to help them with the side just took it

[15:37] and just relayed out the whole playfield made a whole new drawing for it.

[15:41] Kind of touched on that the game actually came from Roger Sharp and then you kind of like

[15:48] finished it up, is that what you were saying?

[15:51] Yeah, Roger Sharp and Steve Epstein had drawn up a playfield, you know, years ago back

[15:57] before Barra Cora and I basically took a little bit of what they had and just redesigned

[16:03] the whole game, came up with a whole new playfield for it.

[16:06] So did you incorporate their ideas or their design at all?

[16:11] Right, there might have been a little bit of it in there.

[16:13] I don't have a copy of the old drawing, I wish I did to make a comparison, but there

[16:18] are a lot of changes made out of it.

[16:20] Did that game ever, was it ever meant to have speech?

[16:22] No, I think so.

[16:23] Did it take a longer or shorter amount of time to develop that?

[16:28] I mean, you know, because of the Roger Sharp and the Epstein involvement, that made things

[16:34] easier or harder.

[16:35] It didn't really take that much longer because back then the playfields were a lot easier

[16:39] to do.

[16:40] They didn't have any toys on it like they have now, you know, anything that we made

[16:43] back in the 90s.

[16:44] Those games back there, I mean, that's the word about mecha, I can draw a playfield up

[16:48] in two or three days.

[16:50] One that you put together that didn't get ever gets sold was the spellbinder, which I

[16:55] guess was like maybe the mate hyperball, you know, really wasn't a pinball game, it

[17:00] was more of a gun game and a pinball cabinet.

[17:02] Hyperball.

[17:03] Yeah, so what was the story with that?

[17:05] Why didn't that ever get made?

[17:06] I mean, they only made, I think, like ten of them, the game played real well, but I guess

[17:10] hyperball kind of crashed or having a lot of trouble.

[17:14] We had the ball feeder on there and the things were breaking down a lot and just didn't

[17:17] do as well as they thought it would do.

[17:19] So then they kind of took it and put it on the shelf.

[17:22] So what was the difference between spellbinder and hyperball and gameplay?

[17:27] Basically the rules that we had on there.

[17:31] What I did is I had different shots.

[17:33] We had to do things that were different than a hyperball and on the back I did remember

[17:37] like the bear used to shoot on the old gun games.

[17:40] We did it with a dragon.

[17:41] You'd have to hit it before it got off to the edge of the site.

[17:45] If you hit it, it would keep going back and forth.

[17:47] Hyperball was just like shooting at flashing lights and that was it.

[17:50] One game that you did was in 1982, the end in 1982 was defender and I understand that

[17:56] you worked on that with Joe Chemical.

[17:58] Right.

[17:59] I think Joe and I came in with Larry was involved in that.

[18:04] He wanted to do a defender pinball so I came up and did the actual play field drawing

[18:09] for it and Joe helped out with the rules and some of the other things on the game to

[18:13] make it as close as we could to the actual, you know, to the way the video game played.

[18:19] And how was it working with Joe?

[18:21] It was pretty good.

[18:23] I mean, you had a lot of ideas and he was good at getting things done like we needed

[18:26] to get a license for a game or something.

[18:28] He was able to find the right people to do it.

[18:31] Of course he would.

[18:32] How long had he been at Williams at that time?

[18:34] I want to say it could have been more than a couple of years at the lowest.

[18:38] It's that long because I think he left there after space shuttle, like 85, 86 or something.

[18:44] I know he'd only been there for a few years.

[18:46] What was the deal with in another one that kind of got that didn't get made was rat race

[18:53] with Steve Cordack.

[18:54] Is there any stories with that?

[18:57] I think the game might have been ahead of its time.

[18:58] We were trying to cash in on the novelty craze because the pinball was still kind of quiet

[19:03] around that time and I was trying different things.

[19:06] I was doing that, you know, any kind of game that was maybe close to pinball but not quite

[19:12] a pinball that maybe we can use in place of some of the arcade games that were out there.

[19:17] And one of the mechanical engineers that worked there came up with a mechanism that he

[19:21] was used to tilt things back and forth like the old Abram toys that.

[19:26] And I decided to develop it into a game.

[19:29] So he put joysticks on it to control it.

[19:31] We had a couple of motors so you can go on an XY axis with this thing and try and guide

[19:35] the ball through a maze.

[19:36] I mean, everybody loved the game but for some reason it just didn't take off.

[19:42] Now what was Cordack's involvement with that?

[19:48] I mean, I had a lot that I could remember.

[19:50] I mean, he was supportive with it but just about the whole design on it was mine as far

[19:55] as the play field and the mechanical engineer did the actual mechanism that went underneath

[19:59] it.

[20:00] Remember his name was Doug but I can't remember his last name.

[20:03] Another one that was really pretty cool that might have been ahead of its time was the

[20:07] head to head game Joust which is really kind of a wild game.

[20:11] I mean, that was your, how did that come about?

[20:16] I wanted to do a game that was basically based on the Joust video game because in that

[20:21] game you're playing two people, you know, constantly head to head on that game and I wanted

[20:25] to see if I can do a pinball that was like that and it was great if you had two people playing

[20:29] but when one person played he had to operate both sets of flippers and it was a lot more

[20:34] difficult for anybody to do that.

[20:36] And you think that's what held the sales back?

[20:39] Probably plus I think a lot of people felt it wasn't really a true pinball game because

[20:43] it didn't have the back box on there and some of the other features.

[20:46] Well then in 1984 of course you hit another one out of the park with Space Shuttle.

[20:55] Give me the background on that game.

[20:58] Well, that was a game that originally that was Joe Kamenkau and Larry DeMarr had come

[21:05] up with a layout for a play field.

[21:07] I think that you would have a placement at an arrest round.

[21:12] I said finally we would draw it up just like we've got it, we'll build a game and see

[21:16] how it plays and it just didn't work out as well as they'd hope.

[21:19] So that was another one sort of like Barracore where I took it and re-drew the whole thing

[21:24] and made a whole different play field layout.

[21:27] Was it really a lot different than what they first came up with?

[21:29] Yeah, it was a lot different.

[21:32] I wish I'd kept the original drawing.

[21:34] Also that placement has a lot gone, huh?

[21:36] Yeah.

[21:37] Yeah.

[21:38] But you could have seen the difference.

[21:40] Now did you have to...

[21:42] The contact NASA and get us everything we needed in your pictures and permission to do

[21:47] the whole thing?

[21:48] So you had to actually license that with NASA?

[21:50] I don't know if we actually paid them or not.

[21:52] That I'm not sure but I know we had to have permission to do it.

[21:55] When that one sold, you know, that sold like 7,000 units.

[21:58] They must have, you know, in prior to that, you know, not since Jungle Lord in 81 had

[22:05] really any pinball machine sold any kind of substantial numbers.

[22:09] Right.

[22:10] They'd given us an ultimatum, what they did was before that game was produced.

[22:14] They went and looked at all the games that we were developing at the time and they came

[22:18] down with whatever game we pick as to make it big this time.

[22:22] Otherwise we're going to shut down pinball.

[22:24] That's where it ended up.

[22:25] And they decided to go with space shuttle because I already had Starlight done before space

[22:31] shuttle.

[22:32] And I think Mark Richie had something going, Steve Richie had something going but I guess

[22:36] they weren't far enough along and they liked this game enough to give it a shot.

[22:40] And the rest was history, I guess it worked.

[22:44] Do you think that the space shuttle theme really helped with it?

[22:48] Or do you think it was just the, you know, the basic game rules and game design that really

[22:52] sold it or just a combination of everything?

[22:54] I think it's a combination.

[22:55] I mean the theme melted a lot.

[22:57] Plus it was the first game we had with plastic ramps on there and we put a little model space

[23:02] shuttle on there to work.

[23:03] Too many toys on the previous games until then.

[23:06] And then the next one that you did that went, that you sold really well on another one

[23:10] that you hit out of the park was of course, comment.

[23:13] And that one you were working with with Python on.

[23:16] Right.

[23:17] Was there was this the, was that the first game you worked with Python?

[23:21] I believe so, yeah.

[23:23] How was it working with him?

[23:25] It was an experience.

[23:27] I mean Python's a great guy.

[23:29] You know, he's a little strange, but he's really good.

[23:32] He's really talented.

[23:34] You know, you know, he knows what he's doing.

[23:35] Now was he doing the helping with play field designer?

[23:38] Was he doing the art or a little of both?

[23:40] He was doing the artwork.

[23:42] And some of the later games he would come up with themes and sometimes I would actually

[23:46] build the game around the theme.

[23:48] This game originally, comment was originally called Riverview.

[23:51] I don't know if you're familiar with Chicago with the amusement park that you used to be

[23:54] here.

[23:55] Right, right.

[23:56] The Riverview.

[23:57] Right across the river from Waroyums is, and I had originally called a Riverview and

[24:02] designed all the different rides on.

[24:03] The comment was the right at Riverview.

[24:05] And they had, you know, the dump, the dummy and all the other different rides that I

[24:10] had on there.

[24:11] And then we decided that not enough people around the world know what Riverview is.

[24:16] You know, somebody in Europe wouldn't know what it was.

[24:18] So we decided just to give it a different name.

[24:20] So I needed to have to one of the rides.

[24:22] The artwork, you know, on comment, I mean, was there, did you give any direction there?

[24:27] Was that just Python to all of them?

[24:30] That we kind of let Python go wild with it.

[24:32] Now I gave them an amusement park theme with all the different rides and just, you know,

[24:37] come up with something good to go with it.

[24:38] That's where you put all the people on the play field looking up at everything and the

[24:43] back glass with the different characters and some celebrities in the back of the roller

[24:47] coaster.

[24:48] Yeah, that one that came that came to really well.

[24:51] I mean, it's, you know, a lot of people, I mean, look for that game till today.

[24:57] It's one of the first games they said to the two that a lot, it was like equally played

[25:01] by men and women.

[25:02] In the past, they might think most of the man's game or young guys we played it.

[25:06] But this game, young people, old people, women, everybody was playing the game.

[25:10] And I tried to make lighter based themes while some of the other guys that were designing,

[25:14] were doing some of the real macho games, but they kind of kept certain people away from

[25:19] them though.

[25:20] Oh, you mean that certain people got steered towards certain themes?

[25:24] Right.

[25:25] The Steve Richies of the World got like the macho stuff.

[25:27] Right, you know, he's got the black knight or some other, you know, big tough guy on their

[25:31] high speed, which I mean, those games are both great and they did really well.

[25:35] And I was trying to make something that was more universal that everybody could enjoy.

[25:39] You know, I have to try and aim it at one group.

[25:43] And speaking of which, on the space shuttle, I mean, do you, in your opinion, you know,

[25:47] a lot, you hear a lot of people say that was the game that saved Williams.

[25:50] I mean, is that kind of how you read it to?

[25:54] Well, that's what everybody was saying.

[25:56] I mean, I guess whatever game they put out, if it, if another game had been put out and

[26:00] that game did well, that would have been called the game that saved it.

[26:04] That just happened to be the game that they picked.

[26:06] You know, I can't say what the other games would have done.

[26:08] Right.

[26:09] Glad it worked.

[26:10] Yeah, and it sure did work.

[26:12] Yeah, at least we got another, you know, 10, 12 years.

[26:14] How do Williams?

[26:15] Right.

[26:16] Right.

[26:17] So were they serious about shutting it down?

[26:18] Yeah, they said they were.

[26:19] Well, that would have changed a whole bunch of stuff, huh?

[26:22] I know.

[26:23] Because I mean, nothing was selling more than maybe 2,000 games if you were lucky.

[26:27] Up until that point.

[26:29] Tell me about Grand Lizard.

[26:30] You know, how did that game come about?

[26:33] Grand Lizard was, I guess, that kind of did it as a filler game.

[26:37] I basically took solar fire since it didn't do as well as I wanted.

[26:41] I took the whole solar fire game and made it into a single level game.

[26:44] And if you look at the layout on it, it's real similar.

[26:48] Look at all the shots and everything on it except it's a single play field.

[26:53] And then we came up with some new idea of putting these wire cages on it to launch the ball.

[26:57] So you can get the ball up over different areas right off the shot to make up the difference on it.

[27:03] And we had Paul Ferris do some artwork on it.

[27:07] And Python originally did the lizard head on there.

[27:12] He's one of like sculpted the original head.

[27:15] And then what did they, what did he sculpt the head and then they sent it out to get him molded?

[27:20] Right, well he came up basically like the drawing for it.

[27:22] Then there was a guy named Jerry Pinsler who used to do all of our, not really molds,

[27:27] but he would come up like our actual sculptures.

[27:29] And he would take it and he made the actual sculpture for us.

[27:33] And then they do what they make a mold off of that.

[27:35] The next one that you really was a big home run was of course pinbat.

[27:40] And you did that when I guess with Python?

[27:42] Yeah, that's when I, Python and I worked together.

[27:45] Python came up with a crazy drawing for a robot with flipper fingers and different other little crazy ideas on there.

[27:53] And I took his actual artwork drawing and made a game out of it.

[27:58] I took what he had under.

[27:59] He had, you know, like the robot with the visor and the eyeballs.

[28:03] And I had the idea of putting the target bank in front of something that I had designed.

[28:07] So we kind of use that as his teeth where you basically hit him in the teeth and that drops down.

[28:11] The visor opens up.

[28:13] Yeah, that little corkscrew.

[28:15] He had something on the side and I worked on that with Joe Joe's to try and get a skill shot out of it.

[28:23] But it was like Python's original artwork drawing that I had worked on in order to make this whole thing work.

[28:30] And then what is, and then that was programmed by I think Larry Demar?

[28:33] No, I think was what's.

[28:37] Okay, now you see that Bill and Python seem to be kind of a team.

[28:44] Was that by invention or was that just how it worked?

[28:48] Well, certain times you want certain people on your team to work on a game.

[28:52] It's something like that.

[28:53] What do you mean?

[28:54] You know, when you got a game where you think it's going to be really great,

[28:58] you want to try and get the program where you think it's the best that you can get the work on it.

[29:02] And plus Bill worked well with Python.

[29:04] I worked well with Python.

[29:06] You know, there's certain people sometimes that they can't work together.

[29:09] Certain people didn't want to work with Python or some people maybe didn't want to work with a different programmer.

[29:14] But the three of us seem to be pretty well.

[29:17] Python really is first name.

[29:20] Yes, his name is Python Vladimir Angelo.

[29:23] Yeah, man, we got to have some words with his mother.

[29:28] He's a very unusual person, but I tell you he's very smart.

[29:32] Right, now what was any interesting stories working with Python?

[29:36] I heard he was a little wild.

[29:38] Yeah, he was pretty wild.

[29:39] I mean, he would be working on a project with us and he would disappear for a week to weeks at a time.

[29:46] And just come up with some big story when he came back.

[29:48] He was all fun, so far he went national geographic or whatever he'd come up with.

[29:54] And then we'd have three days from our deadline and then he'd work for three or four days straight to get the artwork done.

[30:01] So he never missed a deadline?

[30:03] Not that I remember.

[30:04] I mean, he got it done, but he was like, he worked better under pressure.

[30:09] If he gave him three months, he'd wait two months and 27 days before he'd start on it.

[30:16] Yeah, I bet that drove some people crazy.

[30:18] Oh, yeah, because especially with management, they want to see something.

[30:21] They want to see a sketch.

[30:22] They want to see something on it.

[30:24] To see how it's going to look and it's going to work.

[30:27] They want something thrown at him and say, well, we're forced to do it now.

[30:31] Now, whose idea was it to come up with the fire pinball?

[30:35] That seemed like kind of a cool theme.

[30:38] That was something I worked out at Mark Springer.

[30:41] I can't remember if he came up with the fire theme or if I came up with it.

[30:44] He came up with the idea of doing it as like an old period piece like a Skogel fire from 1800s.

[30:51] And whose idea was it to put the cow thing in there?

[30:55] That was one of the programmers.

[30:56] I don't know where they got it from.

[30:58] They started putting cows in every single game we made starting right around that time.

[31:03] Or even doctor who any game you make certain shots on there, you start getting these moves

[31:08] sounds.

[31:09] There's some kind of like a joke that they had done in there, but you only get it at certain

[31:13] times.

[31:14] So that was the programmers that were doing that?

[31:17] But the cows in this game kind of fit because we kind of loosely based it on this

[31:20] recall of a fire when they always get a cow kicked over the lamp.

[31:25] So it's kind of fit in with this.

[31:27] Now why the fire champagne edition?

[31:30] That was back when the, we used to call them fern buyers, were real popular.

[31:36] Like the Benningons type restaurants where the people would sit there with the brass

[31:39] rails and they'd be having their drinks.

[31:41] They wanted something that looked like a piece of furniture that they would put in some

[31:45] of these places that you wouldn't normally get a pinball machine.

[31:49] So was this a request by some of the distributors?

[31:53] I think it was more management.

[31:55] Unless somebody said something to them that I'm not aware of, but they wanted to make

[31:59] like a few hundred of these pieces and if they worked out they might even make more

[32:02] of them.

[32:04] And basically the cabinet we had like gold rails and an oak type look to it.

[32:09] And I guess you had some mechanical animation in the back box that wasn't in the standard

[32:13] fire.

[32:14] Right.

[32:15] We had the legs were like brass plated.

[32:16] The armor was brass plated.

[32:18] You know we had the brass bell up on top.

[32:20] Then remember in the play field you had the little rotating lights.

[32:23] We had two of them in the back box in addition to it.

[32:26] Like right around the squirtish plays or something right?

[32:27] There were two of them back there.

[32:30] Yeah were they like above the displays or something?

[32:34] Yeah, yeah.

[32:35] Yeah, because the displays were down at the bottom between the speakers.

[32:39] They were like right behind the horses.

[32:41] There's like one on the left side, one on the right side.

[32:44] And if you have a picture in front of you or your computer in front of you or anything.

[32:47] I'm just kind of going by memory.

[32:50] You know I own that game for a long time and due to space constraints I got rid of it.

[32:58] The one thing that was funky on that game for me personally is it had no pop bumpers.

[33:04] You know I thought that was really unusual you know because pop bumpers and slingshots were

[33:08] like the pop bumpers slingshots and flippers were like the three mainstay things of pinball

[33:13] machines from the beginning of the end of World War II.

[33:18] So it seemed it was kind of odd that it didn't have any.

[33:20] I was trying to do something different with the game.

[33:22] I wanted to make it like you're actually fighting fires and if you put them off fast enough

[33:25] the fires would start spreading.

[33:28] You know you have to hit the target.

[33:29] If it's street targets flashing you have to hit those targets before a fourth one catches

[33:33] on or a fifth one.

[33:34] So the really wasn't room for the jet bumpers because I wanted some other different features

[33:39] in the back end over there.

[33:40] The space station game.

[33:42] Was that your theme or somebody else's?

[33:44] That was mine.

[33:46] Now why space station?

[33:48] I wanted to do it as a sequel to Space Shuttle.

[33:51] It's something else you know to make it a lot different.

[33:53] Plus they're always talking about building the international space station.

[33:56] So I was trying to you know catch up with the themes.

[34:00] I know like we do with space show.

[34:01] We got it that one.

[34:02] It was popular and this is when the space station was becoming popular.

[34:07] There were three number 1251 flash lamps that essentially kind of stay on in the in the

[34:13] back box during the game during gameplay.

[34:17] Was that by design or what was the thinking behind that?

[34:21] Yeah we did it delivery.

[34:22] We just wanted the back glass to pop out more than what normal lights on there.

[34:27] You know a few more hot spots like in the tail of the space shuttle that was flying

[34:31] up there and you know around the space station.

[34:34] We just wanted to stand out more.

[34:35] Okay now in what about the the lack of any in lanes on this game which

[34:43] kind of seems unusual for games of that time.

[34:45] Was there what was the thinking behind that?

[34:47] So with that I just wanted to make some more shots at the bottom of the plate to which

[34:51] we normally couldn't have because if you put you know double lanes on both sides and

[34:55] put the slingshot kickers in there you can't shoot as far down on there.

[35:00] So what I did the conference say is I put two kickers on either side to return the ball

[35:04] back into play if you had a lift.

[35:07] And how did you think that worked out?

[35:10] I thought it worked out pretty good.

[35:11] I mean we tried to develop a mechanism in there so we at least we had like a little space

[35:15] station that would actually move and send the ball to different shots when you make it

[35:19] depending on what position it was in.

[35:21] I don't remember exactly what the numbers were on it.

[35:24] Yeah it sold about 3,800 or so but I mean which was probably pretty decent for the

[35:29] time.

[35:31] You know but it was nothing compared to what you came out with next which was cyclone

[35:36] and again that was with Bill and Python and that game sold you know over 9,000 units

[35:43] and that was another home run.

[35:46] You know anything now why cyclone?

[35:48] Well I like the way the comment team was received so I wanted to do another I guess

[35:56] a amusement park theme and I was kind of in the rollercoasters because I spent my childhood

[36:02] going to Riverview and all the different local amusement parks and the themes always seemed

[36:07] to work out pretty good so I tried to make a whole different layout now put some different

[36:10] features on there.

[36:11] I think that was when I had the Ferris wheel on and had some different ramp shots and

[36:17] all the crazy stuff on there.

[36:19] The wheel of fortune in the back box we just got into stepper motors and I wanted to find

[36:25] some way of putting that into the game so that we have at least some kind of a random thing

[36:30] in the game where somebody has a chance to get something that maybe isn't that good

[36:34] of a player.

[36:37] Now Python did he help out much with that or did he just do the art?

[36:43] That one was more my idea but he came up with all the crazy ideas for the artwork but

[36:48] the actual mechanical play field layout was mine on that one.

[36:53] His main one was when he came up with in bot where I kind of designed it around his

[36:58] artwork.

[36:59] I had a theme ahead of time and back in the old days we started doing games like in the

[37:05] early 70s and 80s we would just develop a game and come up with a theme for later on

[37:11] and put artwork on it.

[37:13] But as time went on we started actually designing games around the theme so it fit together

[37:18] better.

[37:19] Now whose idea was it to put the celebrities on the back glass on that one?

[37:24] That was Python.

[37:25] Was there any repercussions to that?

[37:31] Not really because that one was I think was not the one with the Reagan's on it.

[37:34] Yeah exactly.

[37:35] Right and he was president and they make political cartoons with the president all the time

[37:40] so without any problems.

[37:42] I don't know what the word is that he used for it but like public domain or whatever it

[37:48] is.

[37:49] Right and now the management didn't have any problems with that either?

[37:53] No.

[37:54] Was there anybody in the cars in the taxi?

[37:59] Pardon me?

[38:00] I said if there was any problems they would have changed it like they had to do with taxi

[38:04] when they had Marilyn Monroe on there.

[38:07] Do you remember that?

[38:08] Yeah I remember they had to change it from Marilyn to somebody that didn't have blonde

[38:12] hair.

[38:13] We're going to rebrew that and call it a Lola or something else.

[38:16] Right.

[38:17] Because I guess her state the people were complaining about they didn't want her likeness

[38:20] on the game.

[38:21] We're going to take a short break talking with Barry Ausler the Williams pinball designer

[38:26] and we'll be back in just a moment.

[38:28] The Pin Game Journal is a proud sponsor of Topcast.

[38:31] It covers pinball like no other publication can.

[38:34] The Pin Game Journal is America's only pinball publication.

[38:37] Whether you're looking for new games or the classics reports on industry shows or collector

[38:41] expos.

[38:42] Insights on a game you want or features to help you fix the game you've got pin game

[38:47] journals for you.

[38:48] Your website is at pingamejournal.com.

[38:51] Alright we're back with Barry Ausler the Williams pinball designer.

[38:55] Now when you did these games did you keep any of these games for your own collection?

[39:00] I had a lot of games.

[39:03] I didn't start it with Space Shuttle.

[39:04] I had gotten one of every game that I had designed but then I ended up selling them a couple

[39:10] years after I was let go over it Williams.

[39:13] So you must have had a pretty good collection then?

[39:15] About 12 or 13 games at one time.

[39:17] There are a couple people that there's likenesses of them but not exactly on that thing.

[39:21] I think one guy and I were supposed to look like little like Harold Washington.

[39:26] That would used to be the mayor of Chicago.

[39:29] But the other people is not really anybody from here.

[39:33] I think on comedy had a few other people that looked like different celebrities.

[39:37] So now the next game that came out was Joker's and that game again was with Python and

[39:43] it used stereo sound.

[39:44] What was the story behind that?

[39:46] I think they just changed their sound boards so we're able to get a little better sound

[39:52] effects where they can actually work at a left channel and right channel where you can

[39:57] make the sounds come out differently on there.

[40:01] You can make the left speaker talk, make the right speaker talk separately.

[40:04] Did you think that worked out pretty well on Joker's?

[40:06] I think it worked out pretty good because it had some pretty good speech in there.

[40:09] It was kind of a funny thing too.

[40:13] Yeah it's a good game.

[40:15] I see a lot of them too.

[40:16] I'm kind of a poker for neck.

[40:19] I've been playing poker all my life.

[40:21] So I wanted to do a card game and Python came up with all this artwork to go with it.

[40:27] We used a wheel in there that we had from Cyclone.

[40:31] We used that in there to help deal cards off for like a special hand.

[40:37] Now on police force you worked with Mark Richie and Python on that.

[40:41] Was there any stories behind that game?

[40:44] That game originally wasn't police force.

[40:46] It was going to be Batman.

[40:49] But I think there were some delays with the movie or some problems getting the license.

[40:53] And we had to come up.

[40:54] We had a game already to go.

[40:55] We had all the artwork done.

[40:56] Ready to screen the playfields.

[40:58] And we were told we had to change it so we came up with a different theme.

[41:02] So instead of having a Batmobile we used it as a police car and the spell off sound like

[41:07] the police spell out.

[41:08] I think originally it was Batman.

[41:11] So we had to come up with all new artwork for it and new rules.

[41:14] Now when something like that happens does that really put a damper on the project?

[41:20] It can.

[41:21] I mean it sometimes it can really throw you off and screw you up on there.

[41:24] But this one I mean we seem to still get the game out in pretty much record time.

[41:29] I think they want to hurt the most.

[41:30] I think it was Python because he had to redo all of our work.

[41:33] When you were trying to get the Batman theme was just prior to any of the Batman movies?

[41:37] This was right around the time that the first Batman movie came up.

[41:40] I'm trying to think what year that was.

[41:43] Well the game came out in 1989.

[41:46] I don't remember.

[41:47] The movie was out around that time.

[41:50] 88, 89 some were on that time.

[41:52] Yeah because it seemed to me that Dede East got that theme but it was more like a 91 or

[41:57] something.

[41:58] Maybe it was tied in with the second movie.

[42:01] You know Michael Keaton, what do you do two or three movies?

[42:05] You know I don't know I'm not familiar enough with the Batman theme.

[42:08] With the very first one they did.

[42:10] But you couldn't you just couldn't get that license huh?

[42:12] Right.

[42:13] Or there was a delay with the movie.

[42:16] There's something that kept us from it.

[42:17] I'm thinking I had something to do with the license.

[42:20] Now what was Mark Richie's involvement with this game?

[42:23] We both kind of came up with the ideas.

[42:25] What we wanted to know he came up like part of the play field layout.

[42:28] I came up with part of the layout and I drew it up and Mark and I.

[42:34] I think the puts him right about working at one two of this and also Python and we all

[42:38] worked on the rules together for it.

[42:40] Now the next one he came out with was Bad Cats which was kind of an interesting game.

[42:45] Single ball not a multi ball game and it had really kind of cool animation in the back

[42:50] box.

[42:51] Any stories behind that game?

[42:52] That was some that Python came up with that one too.

[42:55] He always had something unusual that he wanted to do on the game and this one he had the

[43:00] idea with the woman swinging the broom, swatting the cat and the cat would spin around.

[43:05] We took, I think it's another one we used a stepper motor in there that was used on

[43:10] jokers and on cyclone.

[43:13] Kind of a cool game.

[43:14] You know, it's really interesting looking that's for sure.

[43:19] You know, I guess that's Python again, huh?

[43:21] Yeah, it was.

[43:22] I had one of those games and I ended up selling it years ago.

[43:29] Who was it?

[43:30] I think it was it lead singer of the drummer from Motley Crew.

[43:33] They were looking for a game and somebody I know, I guess knew them and I knew that I

[43:39] had a game and we ended up selling it to them.

[43:41] Now why would he want that game?

[43:43] I guess they liked the game.

[43:44] There's some reason, you know, maybe they thought they were bad cats.

[43:48] Yeah, there you go.

[43:50] Yeah, I'm trying to think of the guys and I think it was the singer but I can't remember

[43:55] his name on top of my head.

[43:57] Was there ever, I mean, that was like a not a multi ball game.

[44:01] Was there, why did that game go with just a single ball instead of multi ball?

[44:07] I still wanted to do it like I did with cyclone and comments.

[44:12] Yeah, I just was more, you know, interested in the gameplay than having to have multi ball

[44:18] on it, you know.

[44:20] So there wasn't any pressure from anybody to say, hey, most of our games are multi ball.

[44:24] You know, you didn't get that any of that kind of pressure.

[44:27] No, because I did a lot of games like that.

[44:29] Even other games are multi ball.

[44:31] I go into a single ball game and I do multi ball.

[44:34] It's kind of like alternate back and forth.

[44:36] Did you find that the single ball games were harder or easier to design?

[44:42] It wasn't really any easier, I mean, because you had to compensate by having the rules,

[44:47] you know, be a little more complicated on the games.

[44:49] Now the next one that you did was the Harley Davidson game and that one seemed, all

[44:54] of us like the Gottlieb Street level games where there weren't any ramps.

[44:59] It seemed fairly simple.

[45:02] How did that game work come about?

[45:04] Yeah, that's pretty much what they wanted to do because Gottlieb had outsovers sluggier

[45:08] and that was the back one games where starting to slow down again and they wanted to make

[45:11] a game that was a little bit less expensive to make that they can, you know, sell for

[45:17] people with very low maintenance.

[45:18] Because all the other games had so many mechanisms on the games that break down people, be

[45:21] fixing them every other day.

[45:23] But this one had hardly any moving parts other than the bumpers and the kickers on it.

[45:27] How did you think that came come out?

[45:30] I thought it came up pretty good because we worked hard on the rules.

[45:32] I worked on that with Mark Springer and we both, Harley Davidson, planned up in Milwaukee.

[45:37] You know, took some pictures, talked to people there and this came up with some ideas

[45:41] what to do with it.

[45:42] We decided to make a cross country trip where you're hitting all these cities along the

[45:46] way.

[45:47] Were there hardly any sort of hard license to work with?

[45:50] Really, we didn't really have any problems with them.

[45:52] They just had to approve what we did though.

[45:54] Once we got all the artwork done, we had to submit it to them before we can do anything

[45:58] to make sure that they approve with the way the artwork, I guess, would portray them.

[46:02] And there really weren't that many revisions on there after they looked at it.

[46:06] The next one you came out with in 91 was Hurricane and that was your first game with

[46:11] a dot matrix display and also art by John Yalsey.

[46:16] Any stories behind that game?

[46:18] I think Python was already left Williams.

[46:21] I remember Cretty because he didn't do that much on that game.

[46:25] He even though he worked on the first two carnival games.

[46:27] Now, I just wanted to do a trilogy and do a third beat, you know, up when they were

[46:33] called like a carnival theme, like the other ones were amusing park theme.

[46:39] And we used John Yalsey who had done some artwork for Pat Lawler and a couple other guys

[46:44] there originally.

[46:45] So the hurricane was the trilogy of the kind of the roller coaster games.

[46:50] Was hurricane based on any particular amusement park?

[46:54] Not that one really.

[46:55] I just tried to come up with a clever roller coaster.

[46:59] The roller coaster is always the main thing and I tried to come up with a clever roller

[47:02] coaster name.

[47:03] And I'd gotten some different books.

[47:06] He had books on Riverview and books on other places that had roller coasters and there

[47:10] was one called a hurricane.

[47:12] The name kind of caught my eye so I decided to use that name on there.

[47:16] I took the Ferris wheel and decided to make it into a double Ferris wheel.

[47:20] So I remember seeing one.

[47:21] I don't, at some place at a carnival in Tandoor was a double decker Ferris wheel where

[47:26] these things would be one spinning on the bottom and one spinning up above with a shaft

[47:29] in between them and they would alternate places.

[47:32] Instead of being at the top of the Ferris wheel, you'd be at the top of the second Ferris

[47:36] wheel.

[47:37] So I tried to use something like that except that didn't really have the height to do

[47:39] it.

[47:40] So I kind of put them side by side where one would be the other one.

[47:44] And how did you think that game was received?

[47:47] It was fairly well but I'm thinking that was around the time that they were making

[47:53] Adam's family so it didn't do as well as it could because of the games that were coming

[47:58] out right around the same time.

[48:01] Did you like the dot matrix display?

[48:03] Yeah, I thought it was pretty clever because you can do a lot with it now instead of

[48:06] just having scores on it, they can actually put an animation on it.

[48:09] We could put a little miniature video games into the game.

[48:12] If you do certain things on it, you can get a little video mode.

[48:15] We'd start putting it into the games.

[48:18] What did you think?

[48:19] Did you like the video modes?

[48:22] There were a couple of them that were good, not all of them.

[48:26] I mean a lot of them were received very simple or waste of time.

[48:31] But it was a little break.

[48:33] If you did something really well in the game, you could get a little break to sit down

[48:37] and relax for a second.

[48:39] Next one they came out with was Doctor Who.

[48:42] Now how did that license come about?

[48:45] That one, I was a big fan of Doctor Who and Bill Futzenverter was a big fan.

[48:51] He wanted to try and design his own game.

[48:54] There were a game of chance.

[48:56] He was mostly this programming and he thought he could do the whole game himself and he

[49:00] made up like a rough play field layout.

[49:04] I guess he was running into a lot of problems with it.

[49:07] I joined up with him and re-did the whole layout and tried to keep some of what he had

[49:12] on there.

[49:13] Then I added on to what I had done on pinback before with the visor that went up and

[49:19] down, decided to put a three level into there.

[49:22] We have a little play field on top and you have the target you hit when it's up.

[49:26] Then when it's up all the way, there's like three little trap doors in there.

[49:30] We worked on this whole thing together.

[49:32] It was a joint design.

[49:37] That moving, I don't know if you want to call it the elevator or whatever, that was really

[49:42] well done.

[49:43] I thought that was pretty cool because you locked the two balls and it moves up and you

[49:47] hit the set of targets and it moves up again and you drop the balls inside.

[49:52] The one thing that was really always scares me about that game is whenever I take the top

[49:57] class off.

[49:59] You get that message, keep your hands and fingers away from the meat slicer.

[50:04] I know.

[50:05] We used to have different names for that thing.

[50:07] We were calling it a lot machine or the food processor because I mean if you did put

[50:12] something in it when it was going up and down, it would snap a pencil.

[50:15] Then when we put a safety switch on it, some guy was working at it and there was a kid

[50:20] and he had a kid and he stuck his fingers in there.

[50:22] We wanted to do the fingers chop off.

[50:23] Did you ever get any stories where that actually happened or is somebody got hurt by it?

[50:28] I haven't heard anything.

[50:30] The glass is off or the front door is open.

[50:32] The play field won't move.

[50:33] Right, which is probably a good thing.

[50:36] Right, because I mean you always hear about these different lawsuits for every little

[50:39] thing.

[50:40] There's always some dummy using a thing that I can do it is I'm not going to get hurt.

[50:45] Now how did management feel about that whole apparatus?

[50:48] That thing had to be expensive to make.

[50:52] It was quite expensive but I made that the main feature in the game.

[50:56] You notice there's not too many other moving parts on there except for a couple of ball

[50:59] poppers.

[51:00] You know you've got some bumpers and a couple of kickers and your flippers.

[51:05] Some other games might have three or four different gadgets.

[51:07] We decided to put it onto one big gadget but it did a lot of different things.

[51:11] It was like three different toys and one.

[51:15] Now whose idea was it to put the lightning flippers on which are about just a little bit

[51:20] of smidget shorter than the standard flippers?

[51:22] I think it was kind of a mutual thing because they were trying to keep the ball time down

[51:27] in some of the games because they get some of the operators and other people were complaining

[51:32] that the games weren't making as much money as they like.

[51:34] So we tried to shorten the ball time a little bit on there but put no slippers on there

[51:39] which did the job.

[51:41] And other things too with the slippers is they don't flex as much as you have the ones

[51:44] you can make some of the shots better.

[51:46] You just can't make certain shots if they're way off the side at easily.

[51:50] So you didn't see them as a bad thing at all then?

[51:53] No.

[51:55] The banana flippers like I said back on time or if not that was something different.

[51:59] I didn't really like that much but management wanted them on there.

[52:02] These I didn't really mind the shorter flippers on there.

[52:06] But when you designed the game, the game was designed with normal flippers right?

[52:10] Right originally.

[52:12] Right and then they just kind of added these on at the end.

[52:16] So before we ever really put them on a test plan, we'd just build one game and we would

[52:21] play it and kind of determine what we should do with the rest of them.

[52:25] We try with the shorter flippers and the shots are a lot stronger with these shorter flippers.

[52:30] Just that some of the shots that are way off to the far right or far left, they're a little

[52:34] harder to make.

[52:35] But you have a little better control with these flippers.

[52:40] And it does keep the ball time down.

[52:42] So was everybody pretty happy with the doctor who?

[52:45] Yeah, I think they were.

[52:47] Now what about the Dalek thing on the top?

[52:51] That was originally animated right?

[52:53] Right.

[52:54] The original, I think the first ten games or so we had that on there where when the Dalek

[52:58] talked ahead with swing back and forth as it was talking just like it did on the doctor

[53:02] who TV show, then they decided to cut some of the cost back on the game.

[53:08] Do you think that was a detriment to the game?

[53:10] I don't think it really hurt because I mean the game sold pretty well.

[53:13] Like it sold like 8000 or so then.

[53:18] Yeah, it sold almost 8000, that's right.

[53:21] Yeah, it did really well.

[53:22] That was my first doctor who was my first Williams dot matrix game that I ever bought.

[53:30] I thought it was a great game, but just I had never even heard of doctor who before at

[53:35] the time.

[53:36] So it was kind of a, I didn't know what doctor who was.

[53:39] Well, I mean that's been around since the early 60s.

[53:42] Very old, I mean it was on TV for like 30 years.

[53:45] I must have missed it.

[53:46] I was over here, I think it didn't come around here until like the 80s.

[53:50] Yeah, I must have missed that whole doctor who thing because I didn't have a clue what

[53:53] it was.

[53:54] It turns out my sister was a big doctor who fan and she kind of like, you know, informed

[53:59] me of what it was.

[54:00] Well, yeah, actually in every episode.

[54:02] Right, so you were a huge fan of doctor who was.

[54:05] That's why I didn't mind working on this with with with with with.

[54:10] Now Linda deal did the artwork was this like your first experience with her?

[54:13] Yeah, it was the first first game I worked out with Linda.

[54:16] She had been there for a little while, but it was the actual game.

[54:19] First game I worked out with her and this seemed to work out pretty good for her because

[54:23] her artwork was more lighthearted.

[54:24] This seemed to fit, you know, what she was doing.

[54:29] You know, more than I would have Python or somebody else do it.

[54:34] Okay, now the next game is one that's really dark, but it's really a cool game is the

[54:39] prom strokeers Dracula.

[54:41] How did it was that a theme that you wanted to do?

[54:45] That one.

[54:46] I remember who the movies do on up with Columbia or who the studio is.

[54:52] They approached this with the themes.

[54:53] I guess they knew we were starting to do other games like we'd done Indiana Jones and

[54:57] some other movie themes and they want to know if we were interested in licensing, you

[55:01] know, that particular product and I grabbed it up and designed a game around it.

[55:06] I kind of worked on that one in Mark's Springer.

[55:08] I'm getting the copies of the script and we got some still shots and they gave us some

[55:12] speech from the actual movie that we tried to tie it in with the actual movie release.

[55:18] But I did want to do it because what happened originally it wasn't Dracula.

[55:24] Originally it was going to be tied in with the Alien 3 movie that was coming out at the

[55:28] time and they decided to rewrite the whole movie.

[55:31] I mean I had the game all laid out as being aliens and when I had the movie ball on the

[55:36] play field it was tied in with the Alien theme originally.

[55:41] What they did was they completely rewrote the script and changed the movie for aliens

[55:46] and it wasn't time and I had a game ready.

[55:48] We needed to build something and they happened to come up with the Dracula theme so I just

[55:52] kind of changed it over and made a few adjustments on there and made it actually fit in with

[55:56] it.

[55:58] So who did that must have impacted obviously the art but it must have also impacted the

[56:03] programmers too.

[56:04] Not as much because a lot of the stuff was on there in programs you know we had a lot

[56:11] of the rules in there we just changed what we call them.

[56:16] But as far as what the game actually did it was still pretty close to the same.

[56:22] Now how was the Mist Multi Ball thing incorporated into the Alien thing?

[56:26] Don't remember exactly what I was doing with the Alien because it never really got to

[56:30] that point.

[56:31] I think that was something I was just developing right around the time when we had changed

[56:35] it.

[56:36] I come up with some crazy idea because people always tell us there's magnets on the games

[56:39] that move the balls.

[56:40] I decided to put a magnet and I actually moved the ball except I wanted to make it do more

[56:45] than just that.

[56:46] So we ended up putting a little infrared beam on there where the ball would be sitting

[56:50] on the beam while it's moving across and if you knock it off you start a multi ball

[56:54] on a double score or triple score or whatever it's doing.

[56:57] Yeah it was really a cool effect.

[56:58] I mean it's basically like a genie garage door opener underneath the play field with a

[57:02] magnet attached to it that drives the ball across and you're trying to knock the ball

[57:07] off the magnet during multi ball.

[57:10] You know really really imaginative.

[57:12] It's one of the coolest toys I've ever seen implemented into a pinball machine.

[57:17] It really enjoyable thing that you know I mean it's like whenever I play that game it's

[57:20] like man I got to get Mist Multi Ball.

[57:22] I got to see it do that.

[57:23] I know it and we had three like three different multi ball features in that game and if you

[57:28] got all three of them going you'll get like a super multi ball and the points would you

[57:32] know be like kind of like 10 or 20 times whatever it was.

[57:36] I've read about technical manuals and stuff where it said that the flasher's could actually

[57:41] mess up that infrared beam that has to go across the play field which tracks whether the

[57:47] ball is on that missed magnet.

[57:50] You know tell me about that and any problems that you might have encountered.

[57:53] It wasn't too much with it but if somebody took a real bright light or a flashlight after

[57:59] room was too well lit we tried to shield as best as we can but the light actually got

[58:03] in there and interfered with it.

[58:05] It wouldn't really know if the ball was ever there or not because the ball could be knocked

[58:08] off and there would still be light shining on there.

[58:12] I know we had that problem before with some of the ramps where they had instead of a switch

[58:16] they had apples on the ramps that would detect the ball going by and every once in

[58:21] a while either the general illumination lights or the flasher's would set it off and make

[58:24] the ramp start scoring or make it look like there's a stuck switch when there really wasn't.

[58:31] Was there anything else about the Dracula game that you were you know that you thought

[58:35] was a pretty neat feature?

[58:37] Everybody seemed like the coffin multi ball we put the ball inside there and originally

[58:43] we wanted him to sit up in the coffin when the balls went in but we had too many mechanisms

[58:48] on the game already plus the height restriction wasn't a room to have the guy actually sit

[58:52] up because he'd be hitting the glass but I think on the very original prototype we had

[58:56] a little solenoid in there with actually make the body sit up in the coffin.

[59:01] Yeah that would have been really cool.

[59:04] Yeah I would have loved to see that.

[59:06] Yeah I guess you can have it all huh?

[59:09] No I know we had to limit it somewhere plus it was kind of restricted because we had

[59:13] the you know the multi ball mechanism underneath there and the bumpers and everything else

[59:17] right in that same area this wasn't a room to put all the parts.

[59:21] Now the next one that came out was kind of an odd game the pup I saves the earth.

[59:26] How now who came up with that theme?

[59:29] That's another python.

[59:31] He completely drew up a whole thing that looked like a cruise ship like a Noah's Ark

[59:36] cruise ship with some crazy little animals on there and different things and that's another

[59:42] that I did sort of like pinbott where I took his artwork and developed a game around

[59:46] the artwork.

[59:47] I mean if you had like Blutel said I put things where you can actually hit Blutel in the

[59:51] face or his nose would light up or different things on there.

[59:56] Now why would pup I want to save the earth though?

[59:59] Puppie to me was always about eating the spinach, beating up the bad guy and getting the

[01:00:04] chick.

[01:00:05] I never would have ever thought about pup I and saving the earth as being two things

[01:00:10] that would ever collide.

[01:00:12] This was python stab at ecology I guess trying to save all the endangered species and

[01:00:18] you know the greenhouse effect and everything.

[01:00:21] So he's trying to use something that everybody knew pup I and tie it in.

[01:00:26] We've taken all the animals and maybe starting a whole new world.

[01:00:30] Did you guys ever say anything to him about this?

[01:00:33] I don't know everybody thought he was kind of crazy doing it.

[01:00:38] I mean the game got I guess a lot of ribbing you know a lot of people made a lot of jokes

[01:00:43] about it over the years.

[01:00:45] Yeah damn you sold 4200 of them though.

[01:00:49] Yeah I think a lot of them were sold overseas because I think in Germany and France some

[01:00:54] of those countries they like Puppie.

[01:00:55] I mean he's been around for like 70 years or something.

[01:00:59] Yeah I mean I just management didn't say anything to him and kind of scratch your head

[01:01:04] about the Puppie and saving the earth and those two things.

[01:01:07] The management loved python.

[01:01:09] I mean he could do no wrong with them.

[01:01:12] If he said he wanted to do something they would let him do it.

[01:01:15] If he thought it would work because I mean most of the time he was right.

[01:01:18] So how did he get out of Williams then I mean if he was you know so well liked by management?

[01:01:26] Well I think he went over eventually he went over to work for Capcom I think he left Williams

[01:01:30] before that.

[01:01:32] I think he wanted to go out on his own to do his own thing.

[01:01:34] What I can remember the best.

[01:01:37] Now the next one you did was Dirty Harry.

[01:01:39] How was it working with the Dirty Harry theme?

[01:01:43] That one I like.

[01:01:44] I was always a Dirty Harry fan and that was kind of my idea from the beginning to do a

[01:01:49] Clint East with Dirty Harry game.

[01:01:51] Except we decided to do it with the younger version because he was getting too old and he

[01:01:55] hadn't really done any Dirty Harry movies in a while.

[01:02:00] I tried to develop something around that.

[01:02:01] We put the gun in and it shoots the balls out and you know we had all the different

[01:02:06] cruxers we tried to take bits and pieces from some of the movies and the sound bites

[01:02:10] and you know tied in with it.

[01:02:13] Did you have to work with Clint Eastward at all?

[01:02:14] I never got to actually meet him.

[01:02:16] Our sound guy that was doing it I think I want to say Paul.

[01:02:21] I'm trying to remember who did that now.

[01:02:23] I'm the sounds but he actually went out there when he was filming Bridges of Madison County.

[01:02:28] And how did Clint Eastward you know respond to the whole pinball thing?

[01:02:33] He seemed to like it.

[01:02:35] We actually wrote up what we wanted him to say and in between when he wasn't working

[01:02:39] on the movie he actually recorded some custom speech for us and then the rest of it we took

[01:02:44] the clips from all the different movies he had.

[01:02:47] We took like every movie, watched every movie like 5-10 times and picked out all the lines

[01:02:51] that we liked and that would fit perfectly in the game.

[01:02:55] But he seemed to go along with everything.

[01:02:56] He actually said he'd do custom stuff for us.

[01:02:59] Were you happy though with the speech that he did give you the custom speech?

[01:03:03] Oh yeah it was great.

[01:03:04] Because I've heard a lot of people say that maybe he seemed a little lethargic and his

[01:03:09] emotions or whatever.

[01:03:11] But that's kind of how he is though.

[01:03:14] I mean the way he talks is kind of slow and dry.

[01:03:16] You know it feels lucky to hear you.

[01:03:20] You know it kind of hesitates when he talks.

[01:03:22] You know he doesn't really put a lot of emotion into it but yet you get the message.

[01:03:27] Right right right.

[01:03:30] Now the who done it game in 1995?

[01:03:34] Whose idea was it that come up with that kind of that mystery theme?

[01:03:40] That was something I worked on with Dwight Sullivan who was a programmer and he also kind

[01:03:46] of I guess called him a co-designer.

[01:03:48] That was like the first project that he worked on.

[01:03:50] He had come up with a lot of the ideas on there.

[01:03:53] I had some ideas for some mechanisms on there and he was thinking about doing a clue type

[01:03:57] game like the old board game.

[01:04:00] And once again you were using stepper motors to drive you know like a slot machine

[01:04:06] rails.

[01:04:07] Right we wanted to make the game take place in a casino.

[01:04:09] So I developed some little actual little little slot machine mechanisms.

[01:04:13] It took three steppers and made my own little rails and put them on there and then we decided

[01:04:18] to make our whole little mechanism and make it a like not really a random feature where

[01:04:22] you can actually control the wheels on it.

[01:04:24] Make it by making certain shots so you can try and earn extra balls or special points.

[01:04:29] How did you feel that game came out?

[01:04:31] I think it came out really good because that was a game now where you're actually I guess

[01:04:36] trying to concentrate more on the rules and then just doing the shots.

[01:04:40] You're actually trying to figure out a mystery like who's the killer.

[01:04:44] You do certain things you go to the telephone, the telephone will give you a clue you know

[01:04:48] who it is.

[01:04:49] In regard to the clue tie into who done it.

[01:04:54] Why didn't they actually get the license to use to use clue and why did they go with

[01:05:01] this you know the who done it name versus actually getting clue.

[01:05:06] We never really bother trying to get it.

[01:05:08] I mean we just wanted to do our own little like murder mystery.

[01:05:12] It was Dwight Sullivan and I kind of came up with you know the whole idea to do this.

[01:05:18] So you mean there was never any idea to actually go and try and get a clue tie in.

[01:05:23] No I mean there's something similar like the old who done it you know movies and similar

[01:05:28] thing to clue.

[01:05:29] You know what the weapon was who the different person was that actually was the murder.

[01:05:34] There's something different we wanted to do with pinball you know to make the rules a

[01:05:38] little more interesting.

[01:05:39] But not you weren't so you never went after the license then.

[01:05:43] No no we never tried.

[01:05:46] Now the next game was Jackpot which was kind of a recycled theme of the pinball with gambling

[01:05:52] thrown in.

[01:05:53] What brought that about?

[01:05:56] That one I think they needed a game very quickly.

[01:05:59] That one I didn't really do too much with it.

[01:06:00] They just took my pinball game and put new rules on it and new artwork because they

[01:06:06] needed a game to fill up the lines and the other games that were in process weren't really

[01:06:11] ready yet.

[01:06:12] So could you were you able to get that game out really quickly?

[01:06:14] Yeah they came out really quick because the whole game worked on all the shots were

[01:06:18] down the parts were all designed for it.

[01:06:20] All they needed was a couple of months that I think a nine ten months to develop a game

[01:06:25] they can knock it out in three months.

[01:06:27] And that was Larry DeMarg at this one the programming.

[01:06:30] Yeah he did the programming on it and I think Jim Patler worked on some of the rules with

[01:06:35] him.

[01:06:36] I had a little bit to do on it.

[01:06:37] I didn't really do that much.

[01:06:38] I got credit because it was my original game design.

[01:06:41] What about the junkyard that one that one was all yours right?

[01:06:45] Which one?

[01:06:46] The junkyard?

[01:06:47] The junkyard was my idea.

[01:06:48] I had an idea to do a game like that years ago where I wanted to take all the parts that

[01:06:52] were used on other games and just kind of throw them on it like a pinball junkyard but I

[01:06:58] guess they didn't really fit in the way I wanted.

[01:06:59] So then ended up doing it where it was actually stuck to see the junkyard.

[01:07:03] Old refrigerators and old toilets and old beat up cars and stuff.

[01:07:07] Now there was originally a magnet underneath that kind of wrecking ball.

[01:07:11] What was the purpose of that magnet?

[01:07:13] The only purpose of magnet was when the ball was done swinging we wanted to grab the ball

[01:07:18] fast enough so it would be ready for the next time you wanted to hit it.

[01:07:21] I was the ball would just sit there and swing in the breeze for a while.

[01:07:26] So we put that there purposely just to stop from swinging.

[01:07:29] Why would it not stay in the final game?

[01:07:32] I think more for cost than anything.

[01:07:36] I think they want you know because it knocked a good junkyard plus I guess they realized

[01:07:40] it didn't need it.

[01:07:42] Do you mean that the wrecking ball didn't swing that much?

[01:07:46] It's one enough but the reason when I had a actual wire cable hooked onto the ball would

[01:07:51] swing but I guess after a while the wire would start wearing out.

[01:07:56] We had to put it putting a chain on it and use a mechanism to lift the whole arm up

[01:08:00] and down instead of actually pulling on the cord.

[01:08:04] That was right around the time I left.

[01:08:05] I had the game already to go and that's when I got laid off over there and they took

[01:08:10] over and made some changes after I had gone.

[01:08:15] Now why do you think that they laid you off?

[01:08:20] Here you did like 35 pretty darn successful games for them and was it just a bad time

[01:08:29] for pinball?

[01:08:30] Yeah I guess they saw that it was starting to go downhill again like it was in the early

[01:08:33] 80s and they laid off.

[01:08:36] I think at least half of the people in January probably about 35 people got laid off there.

[01:08:41] I think a lot of it had to do with certain people were making certain amounts of money

[01:08:45] and they laid them off more than some of the new people they had hired.

[01:08:48] Within two years they closed on anyway.

[01:08:52] Right now how did you when you got laid off?

[01:08:56] What was your feeling?

[01:08:58] Did you see this coming?

[01:09:00] I did not see it coming.

[01:09:01] I knew that they might slow down a little bit but I never saw it.

[01:09:04] I've seen a dozen layoffs while I was working there.

[01:09:08] I mean it hit me like a brick.

[01:09:10] When Williams actually in 99 when they actually closed the pinball division and you weren't there

[01:09:18] but how did that make you feel?

[01:09:22] I mean felt pretty bad.

[01:09:25] Not as bad as when I first got hit with it but then looked like the door closed permanently

[01:09:29] and there would never be a chance to get back in.

[01:09:31] You ever considered going and doing anything with Stern?

[01:09:35] I tried over there before and mostly they wanted people to work under contract for them

[01:09:40] redesign a game and they'll pay you.

[01:09:42] I wanted something a little more steady where I would get a paycheck every week

[01:09:46] and not just depend on if they want my game and decide they want to put it in there.

[01:09:51] I know Steve Richey and Pat Law are all those guys.

[01:09:54] If they don't design a game they don't give any money.

[01:09:57] What they are doing between?

[01:10:00] Where did you end up going and working after Williams?

[01:10:05] I got a call from Betson and went to work for them.

[01:10:09] They are the biggest distributor in the country.

[01:10:12] Oh yeah they are huge.

[01:10:14] I worked there for 8.5 years.

[01:10:16] Were you happy with that situation?

[01:10:18] I was happy there.

[01:10:20] I was enjoying it.

[01:10:21] I stayed there a long time.

[01:10:23] I stayed at Williams a long time.

[01:10:25] I thought it would have been at Betson a longer time but they decided they cut back there too.

[01:10:29] That's all I've done my whole life basically is work on games.

[01:10:32] So it's been hard to find something anywhere else even close to it.

[01:10:36] Anything I left out of the pinball timeline that we should throw out there?

[01:10:41] I think you covered just about everything here.

[01:10:45] Yeah we went through all your games.

[01:10:47] We went through all your games and did 35 games which is pretty impressive.

[01:10:52] Those are just the ones that they did artwork for.

[01:10:55] Well how many games did you design that actually didn't get out there?

[01:11:00] I mean there might be another 10 or 12 games that I had done playfields on it

[01:11:04] and just didn't like it and scrap it.

[01:11:06] Sometimes I'll build up a white wood and didn't like it and I'll throw it away.

[01:11:09] Because I was able to develop games faster than a lot of the other guys.

[01:11:13] I could take a game and get the whole thing built up within a month sometimes.

[01:11:18] Or sometimes the other guys would take six months just to do the drawing.

[01:11:22] So I'll make another one.

[01:11:25] Do you save any of those white woods?

[01:11:28] Most of them we scrapped them.

[01:11:31] They weren't worth saving.

[01:11:33] I would have made it into a game.

[01:11:35] Right right. So was there any that actually got names that we don't know about that are undocumented?

[01:11:42] Well the only other game really was the cosmic gunfight wasn't cosmic gunfight originally.

[01:11:47] It was called Dragonfly and we actually had artwork for it.

[01:11:50] And why didn't it get made as Dragonfly?

[01:11:53] I think I don't know if somebody in management or somebody when we had it on test,

[01:11:58] or if someone didn't like something about it, it kind of looked like a silver surfer-type character

[01:12:05] with his arms out though with wings.

[01:12:07] It was like a man with Dragonfly wings on the glass.

[01:12:11] It was kind of a real unusual.

[01:12:14] Who did that artwork?

[01:12:16] Connie Mitchell.

[01:12:18] Do you still have the artwork?

[01:12:20] I don't know what happened.

[01:12:22] I used to have a couple of the back glass that Williams and when I left there,

[01:12:25] I left a lot of stuff behind.

[01:12:27] So people just grabbed everything up and I had my office there.

[01:12:30] But I had a couple of them in different colors.

[01:12:32] We tried one character, it was kind of reddish color, no one that was blue.

[01:12:35] We did them in all different colors too.

[01:12:37] And I wish I'd kept some of this stuff now.

[01:12:40] How did you feel about the cosmic gunfight?

[01:12:44] It was an unusual, it was an okay game that was back during that period when everything was really slow.

[01:12:50] It didn't do as well as it could have.

[01:12:53] Maybe it had a different time.

[01:12:56] I mean the theme was okay.

[01:12:58] Yeah, we really didn't talk about the 1983 time fantasy either.

[01:13:03] What was your perception on that game?

[01:13:06] That game was another one too.

[01:13:09] I was just trying to make this the simple low maintenance, you know, inexpensive game

[01:13:14] that had good rules on it.

[01:13:16] Because that was the time when the Citin Ball really wasn't doing really well.

[01:13:20] So we figured somebody could buy a game and get it for a good price.

[01:13:23] And they don't have to keep spending money fixing it.

[01:13:25] Maybe they'll buy more games instead of buying a video game.

[01:13:28] Do you think that theory worked?

[01:13:30] It worked fairly well for its time.

[01:13:34] I'm trying to take with that one sold there, time fantasy.

[01:13:38] Yeah, it didn't sell a lot, it was only sold about 600.

[01:13:41] It was about 600 games only.

[01:13:43] Nothing was selling even a thousand.

[01:13:47] Yeah, that whole era from 82 to 84, you know, it was all three digit sales numbers it seemed.

[01:13:56] Yeah, we really put a damper on everything.

[01:13:59] They barely broke even building these games.

[01:14:02] Right, it was just you were just keeping everybody employed.

[01:14:07] All right, well cool Barry, I really appreciate the time.

[01:14:10] It was great talking to you.

[01:14:12] I mean, you've designed some amazing games through the years.

[01:14:15] I mean, did some absolutely great stuff.

[01:14:18] What I should have done is added up all the production numbers that I had.

[01:14:21] And I bet if I do, you sold over a hundred thousand games easily that you have designed.

[01:14:29] Yeah, I know, it was quite a bit.

[01:14:31] Yeah, you did some amazing stuff.

[01:14:34] Absolutely amazing games.

[01:14:37] I mean, there's people that, you know, I hear about all the time, you know, space shuttle, that's my favorite game.

[01:14:42] All the cycle on the, man, I love that game.

[01:14:45] And bad cats, you know, you're all kinds of stuff.

[01:14:48] And, you know, people that, you know, and like, you know, the Dracula, I mean, that was like a late buy in my buying of Williams games.

[01:14:56] Man, that's a great game.

[01:14:58] I mean, it's dark, but it's really, really is a fun game.

[01:15:01] Well, the movie was dark, it's why, you know, but I enjoyed the game.

[01:15:05] I enjoyed working at it. I enjoyed playing it.

[01:15:07] There was another one of my favorite.

[01:15:09] Really dark game. I remember playing it the first time.

[01:15:11] I kind of felt dirty after I played it.

[01:15:14] But it was, you know, it kind of really grows on you, especially that mist-multiple thing.

[01:15:20] That is, like I said, that's one of the coolest pinball toys I've ever seen.

[01:15:24] No.

[01:15:26] Well, Ken, Mary, I really, really appreciate your time.

[01:15:28] And thank you again.

[01:15:29] Oh, thank you, too.

[01:15:30] I'd like to thank Barry Asler for joining us today on Topcast and sharing his stories on all his different pinball games that he designed for Williams from 1978 to 1996.

[01:15:42] Again, I really appreciate Barry's time.

[01:15:45] And I hope you can all join us again for another edition of Topcast.
