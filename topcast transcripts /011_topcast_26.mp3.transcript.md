[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:22] Alright, welcome to another episode of Topcast.

[00:25] Today, we're going for the department of three big dummies.

[00:29] You notice that they could be awesome.

[00:34] They could cheat this radio program I've ever been at.

[00:39] We are sharing two guys are sharing one headphone and one microphone.

[00:44] I feel like John Bingle has just stroked up inside the mic.

[00:48] Say hello Eric.

[00:51] Say hello Eric.

[00:53] Hello Eric.

[00:54] Okay, so today we have the genuine three dummies with us.

[00:57] We've got of course me I'm Shaggy and we've got Norm.

[01:00] Say hello Norm.

[01:01] Norm.

[01:02] Hello.

[01:03] Yeah and we've got of course we've got Eric A is joining us again

[01:06] because he had so much fun last time.

[01:08] Say hello Eric.

[01:09] Oh my god this is even better in the last time.

[01:13] Alright, no it is not.

[01:16] What are you doing?

[01:17] Always waving on the webcam.

[01:18] Waving on the webcam.

[01:19] It's Norm waving.

[01:20] How are you doing there?

[01:21] All the 37 and a half people that are watching right now.

[01:25] If anybody cares Norm is on the webcam he's in the green shirt

[01:29] and Eric's in the orange shirt.

[01:31] So or is it the other way around?

[01:33] I always forget.

[01:34] So but anyways this is a good color but it's a tag of shit so uh

[01:39] that's he's got that going for him.

[01:40] Maybe a two hour show right?

[01:44] Okay so what's up first guys?

[01:46] I'm poor.

[01:50] Okay it's time to uh call Trent up and uh get him on the horn and see what

[01:54] this week's play of the week is what Gami has in store for us

[01:58] this week to make us a better pinball player.

[02:01] Let's give him a call right now.

[02:11] Is this Trent Mr. um second place in the entire world of

[02:17] professional pinball players Augustine?

[02:20] Yep that may.

[02:21] Tell me about Trent's play of the week.

[02:23] Well I was thinking about covering Mars God of War.

[02:26] Are you familiar with this game?

[02:28] It's a got leave.

[02:28] Yeah it's a got leave system 80 yes I am nice and

[02:31] I believe the white body as well.

[02:32] Yes it's a good game too.

[02:34] It's a great game there's a lot of underplay.

[02:37] Uh the most important thing you remember is don't ever open the back box.

[02:42] Because the back of the fans light the back glass will

[02:44] immediately burst into pieces.

[02:46] Why?

[02:48] Uh second most thing you remember is to uh shoot down the drop party.

[02:52] Wait wait wait why would the back glass open up and break?

[02:55] Why would the back glass open up and break?

[02:58] Well I don't know that's what happened.

[03:00] What do you mean it happened to you?

[03:02] For design I guess.

[03:04] Okay.

[03:05] Yeah it's impossible to get into the back of the game because of the back glass

[03:08] configuration.

[03:10] Okay why is it different than say black hole?

[03:13] I think black hole is attached to the head or the attached to the door right?

[03:17] Right right it's hinged.

[03:18] Well that's not that way.

[03:20] Oh yeah there's door open.

[03:22] And then you got to figure out how to get the back glass out of the game to get to the board.

[03:26] Okay and what's the next thing I got to remember?

[03:29] It's different in its duck.

[03:31] Okay.

[03:32] So anyway yeah that's the most important thing.

[03:34] You never ever open up the head.

[03:36] Okay.

[03:38] And what about the gameplay?

[03:40] The gameplay is actually pretty cool.

[03:43] I believe it has a double flipper on both sides which is actually kind of neat.

[03:47] There's no real purpose uh to the flipper on the right side but the upper part of the left

[03:52] you can use it to make the right cup much easier.

[03:56] Basically there's a forward bank drop partner right in front in the middle of the playfield

[03:59] and there's a four bank drop partner way up on the right hand side.

[04:04] So goal number one is the roller was at the top of the Mars M-A-R-F

[04:10] and they also light up a pop bumper.

[04:12] Now the interesting thing is the right flipper but not only moves the roll over that you want to get

[04:18] but it also changes which pop bumper is a lit and the lift pop up is worth a thousand point.

[04:24] So you can try to move the pop up around to uh to try to get the ball to be hitting it most

[04:28] of the time the lift works.

[04:30] Which I generally ignored because I thought it was important to try and get the Mars

[04:33] letters so I tried to get the unlit Mars letters or the lit Mars letters over top of what I need.

[04:38] So is that like a lane change?

[04:40] It's a lane change.

[04:42] And so if you fill Mars your multiplier goes up.

[04:45] Multiplier is very very important in the game because the bonus is worth quite a bit.

[04:49] You can get the bonus ruled up to 29,000 or 29.

[04:53] And then of course if you get it up to five times it's 155 million or something.

[04:57] Ah by that.

[04:59] But anyway you can also advance the multiplier by shooting the shot at the operating corner

[05:06] which you can either kind of shoot it straight up there with the very tip of the right flipper

[05:10] or you can get lucky to have a mouth up there backhanded or something like that

[05:15] or you can shoot the ramp when the ramp is down which the ramp is down when the

[05:18] cutler lift or the ramp is down uh after it goes through the right anyway which it doesn't do very often.

[05:25] But in general I ignore that so I'm trying to get the multiplier up as high as possible.

[05:29] The ramp is also a hard shot especially if you got flippers.

[05:33] So anyway get the multiplier up if you knock down the set of banks uh drop

[05:38] partisan in the front the less cup is lit if you knock down the bank the right

[05:42] partisan the operating corner the right cup is lit.

[05:45] Once you get a cup lit you can lock a ball in there give you another ball you can either

[05:51] shoot it up the ramp to release the ball lock ball or you can try to lock the other ball

[05:56] and get a three ball ball thing on.

[05:58] When you say that the other scores are doubled and tripled it really adds up on the set.

[06:02] When you say cop you mean uh kick out hole right?

[06:06] It's a kick out hole yeah that's what the locks are.

[06:09] So that's the whole point of the block and get them kicked out so you can start to work points.

[06:14] And that's it?

[06:16] Yeah it's not a very complicated game but it's challenging.

[06:18] Challenging to do this thing.

[06:20] The less cup on the left side is kind of tough to shoot and if you miss this you'll

[06:24] ball very easily could roll down the middle.

[06:27] Uh the one on the right side easier to shoot from that upper left hand flipper and uh

[06:33] and then you can play two balls if you don't want to try going for the third block.

[06:36] And it's also kind of dangerous to shoot those four drop targets in front.

[06:40] I try to shoot them with the upper left flipper.

[06:44] Left danger that way.

[06:47] Well that's an interesting you know get your multiple wire maxed out which is pretty easy to do.

[06:50] It also has this kind of neat feature where every time you shoot down a drop target

[06:55] uh one of the inserts for the spinner will line up and then if you shoot the spinner it'll

[07:00] collect those inserts one at a time and add them to your bonus.

[07:03] Which I've never seen anything new before it's kind of a neat feature.

[07:06] We don't pay too much attention to it but because it's really easy to max out the bonus but that

[07:10] happens.

[07:13] All right well I guess that's trends play the week.

[07:15] Mars got a war.

[07:16] The game is more exciting than explanation but it's a lot of fun.

[07:19] It is okay.

[07:20] And remember don't take that back last hour.

[07:22] Yeah you mentioned that I um whatever.

[07:25] Okay I guess I've never opened one up before so I'll go try that right now.

[07:30] You should do that I think there's another game that does that as well but I can't

[07:32] remember what it is.

[07:33] Hmm okay well thanks Trent.

[07:36] Hey no problem.

[07:36] Hey there's our whole way to the week.

[07:40] I don't know what he was talking about.

[07:41] You know if those little plastic tabs aren't there

[07:45] you're not going to have a too good of a result with the glass staying in.

[07:49] Okay all right well next we're going to run our tech tips of the week.

[07:53] And now it's time for tech tech.

[07:56] We got all we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got all right so my tech tips I had two I've got two pretty good ones that are are kind of quite strange.

[08:03] So a while ago I was working on a Phoenix.

[08:07] It's like a system three a William system three.

[08:10] Uh William's Phoenix three or four or something like that somewhere around that in the late 70s.

[08:14] And this lady had me come all around and I replaced the interconnector going between the the CPU and the driver board and you know

[08:21] did a bunch of the standard up grazing at that game all working.

[08:23] It was working real nice and she was real happy.

[08:25] So that was maybe two months ago and then I got a call from her a couple weeks ago when she said you know the Phoenix isn't working

[08:31] And I'm thinking to myself and I went through that game

[08:33] It's got to be something really goofy. She says it won't kick the ball out whenever people say it won't kick the ball out

[08:38] It usually means the game isn't even turning on they just you know, it's not booting

[08:42] So I you know, I'm thinking well, maybe it's a bad user something so I'm making an appointment for her and I go over there and

[08:48] And you know, I look at the game. I don't even turn it on I just open up the back box and I open up the back box and swing the

[08:55] Insert panel because it's hinged out and immediately I can see exactly what the problem is you have any ideas I'll just give you guys a guess

[09:05] What do you have any guesses there norm or Eric what what it might be?

[09:08] Oh mouse nest. I must have told you this story before because there was a mouse nest in the back box

[09:15] I mean a huge mouse nest so this mouse is in this basement a nice home

[09:19] Crawled up the pinball leg through one of the bottom vent holes into the lower cabinet up through the back

[09:26] Through the neck and into the back box and he dragged about a six inch ball of like Owens fiber pink

[09:34] Insulation into the back box and then he started chewing on the wood on the insert panel and he tore up all the little

[09:42] Pieces of paper where the you know, it says like the dip switch settings and you know stuff like that sure

[09:48] Ball that all up and made a beautiful little home

[09:51] Inside the game and there was a whole pile of mouse crap too. You know if anything with mice is

[09:55] Did you won't have fiberglass installation for like 600 miles yet? You'll find it wherever they've been

[10:02] Yeah, exactly because they look I don't know they love this stuff or something. I don't know what I guess pretty good

[10:06] I think I told you this story. He's a genius. Yeah, yeah, he's a genius. I'm a potent

[10:15] Is that more than potent

[10:18] It's like high potency

[10:21] High test

[10:22] So I cleaned out she gave me some rubber gloves. Thank you very much clean out the mouse nest

[10:27] She got out of vacuum cleaner cleaned it all out

[10:29] I checked all the fuses and basically and then plug the game in because it wasn't plugged in for some reason and

[10:36] Turned it on and sure enough it worked fine. So I don't really know what the mouse was doing in there

[10:41] But he was doing something nasty trying to create a life for himself and make a family. Okay, so maybe that was just talk about

[10:48] Vermin in games. I've only had

[10:50] Things droppings in my haunted house. It's the only game that I've ever found anything and how about you?

[10:56] Well, I found the mud

[10:59] Remain nest of something in a black hole and just it yeah, the mud dapper wasps

[11:05] Things is that we're talking about yeah, you take a spatula to it and try to get all the smell out of there with the bleach and

[11:12] For breeze and nothing works. So that's when you saw the game air exploded to his mother

[11:19] One of my favorite stories was

[11:21] EM Dave he he had a game and there was a dead cat in it and it had become like dried out

[11:27] And he first he wasn't sure what it was

[11:30] He took a screwdriver and he put it into it and pulled out a dead cat that been mummified

[11:36] You know all the liquid have been gone. So is this mummified?

[11:39] Cat inside of a game and of course he sold it

[11:43] Well, he sold the cat or the game

[11:48] Yeah, well, I thought that was a good okay now. I'll give you a real tech tip

[11:52] Okay, this was a William system 11 game. It was a jokers in the insert panel general illumination was not working

[11:59] Okay, so what what do you think that might be Eric?

[12:04] Burn header

[12:05] Yeah, the connectors believe it or not because there's like an interconnect board that the GI comes up into and then it goes off to

[12:12] Somewhere else and there's there's like you know a million connectors all over the place

[12:16] It was not a burnt connector anywhere what any other ideas blown fuse now. It wasn't a blown fuse either because I check those oh

[12:23] Oh

[12:28] No, what it was is on the inside of the insert panel

[12:32] They have a little like a little board with a fuse mounted on it so that they can

[12:37] Programatically turn the insert panel GI on and off kind of like an effect

[12:42] You know by the the fuses when the fuse isn't activated

[12:46] The GI's on but when the fuse pulls aren't the fuse when they're really yeah when the real a is an activated

[12:53] The you know the relay is unenergized the GI powers on but when the relay pulls in the GI turns off

[13:01] So they can turn the relay on and off to you know flash the the GI and what it happened is is there was a little zero-ohm

[13:09] jumper on that

[13:11] Fuse board because that fuse board is like a single side of printed circuit board

[13:15] So if they will need to go

[13:17] Over the top of a trace they put a like a jumper on the other side of the board and the reason why they use these

[13:22] Zero jumpers instead of say a piece of wire is because they have a machine that actually picks up the components off

[13:30] like a long string of components and then

[13:33] You know automatically inserts them into the board and what happens is is that the these

[13:39] Zero jumpers they look like resistors, but they're they're really not they're really just a jumper

[13:44] But they they go bad inside they they go open and that's what happened

[13:48] They had gone open so that the the the the GI power which with the return which is shut on and off through the relay

[13:56] Just wasn't making it back so it never turned on and off. There's only a certain number of watts they can handle right right

[14:03] so what do you replace those 44 bulbs with

[14:07] 47 there you go was that for a question? No, that was just another reason to replace them

[14:12] Huh and I used a piece of wire for the jumper

[14:15] Why are you doing that norm?

[14:17] You're a Norseman disgusting. No, I'm what's your tech tip of the week?

[14:24] Always use novice on a play field

[14:27] Okay, all right just on the play field

[14:31] Just on a play field

[14:33] Okay, all right now Eric you got you got a tech tip right? Yeah, I was working on a dad at East Batman yesterday

[14:39] Had no display

[14:42] The small and this is the the 16 by 128 display the small dot matrix. That's no longer available right right we can get them from pin LED

[14:51] Right for a million dollars

[14:53] No 1.2 million anyway, so he had no controlled lamps no flashers, you know everything was out

[15:00] So we checked the voltages coming off the power supply and everything was there except the 12 volts and the game was booting game was booting and playing

[15:10] Okay, so we'll just lay it all so we tracked back in the circuit and found where the fires on the back box

[15:18] That's actually mounted to the back point right and the fuse was blown so we replaced the fuse and the fuse was blown

[15:27] real quick

[15:28] so we disconnected everything on the outgoing side to make sure we had nothing loading it down and

[15:34] and

[15:36] once we figured out that

[15:40] We had nothing loading the bridge rectifier down it was still blown the fuse drawing like a million amps

[15:46] We decided that maybe we had a bad bridge

[15:49] So then we took our meter put it on diode setting and filed Marvin's repair guide

[15:55] Not Marvin. What a guy Tonya and determined that we had a shorted side on the bridge rectifier

[16:00] Say put a new bridge in and everything was happy everything was happy very nice very nice. That's good

[16:05] I just turned 50 at the C my proctologist and got my

[16:09] rectum fly too. Did you ever have that done

[16:15] I don't know if you call it a rectum fight, but I'll tell you what I'm never going to see that doctor again

[16:22] Tech tech tech. Oh, we

[16:25] All right, that was tech tip of the week and thank you Norm that was

[16:29] Most interesting now actually Norm was the only person that liked this that we did last time

[16:35] So we're doing it again. It's time

[16:38] March weekend

[16:41] The week's news in

[16:44] More is back good old mort is back. Well, we've shortened them up a little bit

[16:50] We don't let them ram along quite as much because we know how much everybody loves more time

[16:55] I'd like to introduce more with this week's news in pinball

[16:59] Hello, this is moight and I'm here again to talk to you about pinball because I know so much about pinball

[17:05] And I get to be able to talk to you and it's very nice that these shaggy and now I want to say something about the norm fellow

[17:11] You know every time I listen to you hasn't been on you that much but when I do listen and he's on there

[17:16] That's when it's very good. It's very good show and I say thank you Norm because I know you're sitting there right now

[17:22] Been saying very nice things about me. Yeah, that's thank you, too

[17:27] And you know, I really like you you're you're very humble person and you're very nice and

[17:34] My 10 seconds over people have said a lot of nasty things about me on the internet. That's not very nice

[17:39] They think I'm somebody else. They think I'm crazy. You know something. I'm not crazy. I just talk like this

[17:44] This is nice not therefore, you know, it's not my fault

[17:48] I just trying to do my thing, you know talk about pinball. I think there was your mother's fault

[17:53] Why you talk like that and possibly your father who used to beat you?

[17:59] Tent of course he used to beat you with

[18:01] Well, we got to talk about something for real. That's something important. There hasn't been much happening

[18:06] I did go to the Texas show and for some reason

[18:08] Shaggy didn't let me talk about the Texas show because I had a little whole thing

[18:12] I knew everything there was to know I saw that whole thing I even told Gene cutting hand where to sit

[18:17] I even put the chair right there for him and said sit right here

[18:20] You can sit right here and you can talk and we'll do that and ask exactly what he did

[18:24] He sat right there in that chair I gave him and he talked and that was how it went

[18:29] Yeah, and Gene was given away free big bang bars

[18:32] I took four of them home so loved for $28,000 a piece

[18:37] That's the truth and it was a very good show

[18:39] I liked it very much that they were very very nice to me they came over to me and they said hello Morton

[18:45] These people said hello to me that didn't even know who I was some people knew who I was and they and they said hello

[18:51] And it was very nice people were very very very very nice in Texas. I'm gonna go back there again

[18:56] Sometimes whenever they have a nice show like that again, so so that's where I want to tell you about the show

[19:02] Oh, good hit me good hit me good hit me

[19:06] Thank you for having me on the show again, and that's that's all I got to say for today

[19:16] So next up next up and now it's time for everyone's favorite

[19:21] Yeah, oh

[19:24] Sweet Adeline. It's a Woodrail and there'll be pictures of it coming up on the webcam

[19:30] Gottlieb, 1950 find sweet Adeline the thing that's kind of interesting about sweet Adeline like a bingo

[19:36] Yeah, it has a bingo card in the back glass and the thing that makes that kind of unusual is that

[19:41] David Gottlieb if he if he was paying attention would have crapped a small little blue football if he had known

[19:48] That Roy Parker and Wayne Nions had snuck this bingo card into the back glass because the

[19:55] He was totally anti gambling. I didn't want to have anything to do with with anything that was gambling and bingo was of course considered gambling now

[20:03] The the girl on it. It's got a nice little girl

[20:06] She's had an adding machine and that's where those numbers come up and they relate to playfield features

[20:11] Now they also have a real the girl actually on a playfield is way more attractive than the girl in the back glass

[20:16] No hands. Yeah, well because Roy Parker didn't like to draw hands

[20:20] So he would often hide the hands, but this is a rollover game meaning that you have to try and the object is to try and go over all the rollovers

[20:29] If you can get every rollover

[20:33] Rollovered or every rollover rollovered you will win up to 26

[20:39] Credits and it knocks them off. It sounds like a machine gun when the thing goes off

[20:43] It just that a rat that that that that that that that that as it's knocking off the credits now

[20:48] You can also if you don't get all the rollovers all 16 rollovers 16 is a 16 or maybe more

[20:54] I can't I can't remember but 16 rollovers within your five balls

[20:58] You can also light the center gobble hole for some specials and it'll light up

[21:04] One arrow will give you one replay three arrows will give you three replays

[21:08] but overall it's a pretty fun game and here we are like playing the game and

[21:13] You can see that it's it's a pretty snappy game. I mean I've got mine set up pretty fast norm

[21:19] Rumor does it like it when I set them up like this? No, it doesn't make any sense

[21:23] And how are people gonna see this on the internet when they download this?

[21:26] They're not they're not why this why you're supposed to play the

[21:29] You got the half the viewing up it

[21:32] People are right now at your studio. How was anyone gonna?

[21:35] The audience sorry half the audience is sitting here in this room and they have three other people somewhere else and here

[21:43] You can see I'm playing multi ball because I'm so impatient. I can launch all five balls at once

[21:49] Because you do that on the old manual ball load games. That's the only reason why I play EMS

[21:55] They don't take these games and bastard eyes and this is not appropriate. They are what they are

[22:00] You know we're gonna make this wood rail tape

[22:02] They're all gonna be hopped up and then he's not gonna let me put my ending attribute to a place that I made

[22:07] Where I played these wood rails because everything has to be in terms of 90 steroids use up machines now

[22:15] It's showing right here. I'm showing on the webcam that I got one arrow lit two arrow three arrows lit in the special area

[22:21] Because I'm going over different rollovers. I got almost all I got two more arrows lit

[22:26] And I'll have them all lit for the big 26 replace and you'll hear it knock it off on the on the web

[22:32] on the webcam

[22:37] Not off all the credits when I got all those all the arrows lit, but anyways, that's our

[22:45] Talk about my stuff. We're gonna do something about moving games once you buy it

[22:50] You know everybody's bought a game haven't you some people have bought weight way too many

[22:56] It takes experience to go ahead and

[22:59] And you know get these games. I remember the first time you buy a game

[23:03] You didn't know how to disassemble this assemble ed or do anything did you never so you got to you know it takes experience to go ahead and do this

[23:11] Somebody gonna help me?

[23:14] Well, yeah, the first thing I like I went

[23:17] Okay, I went over these people's house the other day they had a a Williams solar fire

[23:22] Which is what a system I want to say system six game with from 1980

[23:28] 79 or 80 it's multiple all it's got a cool game wide-body game and the lady says I need you to fix it

[23:34] It's sitting right in the middle of my garage floor

[23:37] So I thought she meant it was sitting there on the legs so I get there and it's

[23:41] It doesn't have any legs, but the head is on and I said why isn't this game in your basement?

[23:46] And she said well

[23:47] It's not in the basement because the movers said that they they couldn't move it

[23:51] It was too big it wouldn't fit and I'm like well if they took the head off

[23:57] It's pretty easy to move

[23:59] You know so people don't know that I mean they move games with I've seen games and pick up trucks with the head and legs on

[24:05] In cart them off without taking the legs off you've seen that I've seen that like crazy and drives me nuts because you just

[24:11] Worry about them making that first turn and it ends up on the first corner. It doesn't worry me

[24:15] I just I'd like to watch it happen

[24:18] Okay, well I got one we went to an auction once a pinwall auction they had video games and a friend of mine bought this game

[24:24] It was a boxing game and it had two monitors in the head. I forget what that's called is

[24:29] Punch out. Yeah punch out. That's exactly what it's called

[24:33] So we buy the thing and we put it in the back of his pickup truck and he only lived like five miles away

[24:38] So only

[24:40] Only

[24:42] Five miles away. So we we load the game into the back of his pickup truck

[24:47] And we push it standing up set up position all the way forward towards the cap and

[24:52] Of course we didn't tie it down because we're only going five miles down the road. So

[24:58] I'm following him in my car and

[25:01] You know, I he knows how to get home obviously so I'm letting him drive and his and his pickup truck and

[25:07] He gets on the highway and I couldn't believe it. I'm like, why is he getting on the expressway?

[25:12] We didn't tie this thing down and he gets going he cranks it up

[25:16] About 65 miles an hour and the thing gets over I mean literally out the back and

[25:23] He's got this apparatus that goes around for like holding

[25:26] ladders and the thing tips over and is the monitor head hits the ground off the back of the truck in the front

[25:36] Like where the leg level is our is wedged between the tailgate and this thing that holds ladders and he's driving down the expressway

[25:43] Well, it's dragging down

[25:47] And Clay starts screaming gut it gut it. What did he pay for this game?

[25:51] Oh, it's like a hundred bucks or something at the auction and it worked well it did good

[25:55] You know, so we pull over to the side

[25:58] He actually notices that all this is happening and I'm looking at him like Ralph. Are you like insane?

[26:04] What are you doing? You know and he's like well?

[26:06] We'll just push it back up and then I want you to ride in the back and we'll come back and get your car

[26:10] And I'm like first off

[26:12] I'm not leaving my car abandoned on the side of I 96 in Detroit. I don't think so

[26:17] Second off you're insane. Yeah, but it wouldn't be abandoned for very long. Yeah

[26:23] That family of six would be living in it

[26:27] So did the game ever work after that? Yeah, we got at home in a work fine actually

[26:31] It was a little little scraped up obviously, but you know just on the edges the cord goes through this in a more systematic approach

[26:38] All right, go ahead buying games at an auction

[26:41] I mean, I think when you start out you don't want to be buying game in an auction

[26:44] I think until you level of

[26:47] Expertise that repairing these things because auctions can be dumping grounds

[26:51] I mean if you're gonna get a game it's working you take more risk to do that, but a dead game and

[26:57] I think maybe

[26:58] Shaggy might buy one Eric might buy a dead game, but you wanted to see inside what's in there, wouldn't you?

[27:04] Yeah, definitely, but you know we all start out and it seems like that's where we all start out from

[27:09] We start out at these auctions you get excited you hear there's Schmiel before the auction starts you get excited and you

[27:16] Now just got done paying 600 bucks for your first DM that doesn't even have the head

[27:20] Well, I did this once I says you know I heard bad things about auctions. So what do I do?

[27:27] I take a car that I know I can't bring a game home in I had barely enough money no tools

[27:33] I sold it that I knew I couldn't get the thing home. What do I do? I buy a skill pool Chicago coin right for a hundred bucks

[27:40] And then I now I got to get this thing out one day

[27:42] So I give a guy 20 bucks to take it to my house. He takes it away

[27:46] He has some smuck to take it to your house for 20 bucks. Yeah, can I that smucks phone number?

[27:50] Can he follow me there we auction I go to man

[27:53] He was just hired up for cash the 20 bucks. He brought it right to my house

[27:56] I mean with a great guy. That's good people in football. They're not all like you

[28:01] Yeah, they are yeah, but that was like 20 years ago, right? Yeah

[28:06] 15 years ago. Yeah, yeah, well 20 bucks would buy you a take a gas back then

[28:09] Yeah, nowadays if you actually paid somebody to take a pinball machine home for you they'd go to their home with it

[28:16] What was the frady was gonna do that?

[28:20] Okay, so one of the things you should do when when you're thinking of buying a game

[28:23] You should look at the price guy. There's two of them out there. He's got one and

[28:28] Dana's got one and there are good general

[28:32] About information to buy pins although the prices in those are kind of

[28:38] questionable at times. I don't think they can quite evaluate every game so they give pretty much wholesale

[28:45] generalized values for machines and they can fluctuate in the market is fluctuating right now

[28:52] Yeah, but at the same time they give you a good idea where to shoot for so you're not paying

[28:58] $3,000 for a

[28:59] 1975

[29:01] poor player. Yeah

[29:03] So what what I think when you first start you start acquiring games at the level of skill or

[29:09] Knowledge that you have to repair them or have others that you know repair them. I don't think you start off trying to

[29:15] Amass a huge collection or buying every game you you don't want to necessarily go ahead by games that flip them and make money

[29:23] I think you need to develop some logic and some knowledge over time

[29:27] So don't get too crazy in buying. I don't know. We're going out with Shaggy once and he bought 14 games in one day

[29:34] Took a trailer and then he had to unload 14 games. He had no idea where he's gonna put them

[29:39] But he's just so excited on getting a deal for like I was 700 bucks and he got 14 EM

[29:45] So he just and one was a one ball horse racing game to wait about

[29:49] 700 pounds and of course all this was in a basement and the only two of us were there to pick it up and and it's and it's another thing

[29:56] I forgot about that I forgot about that day. I got one question for you Shaggy

[30:01] What have you ever bought one pinball machine without having somebody move it with you?

[30:08] Maybe no, okay, no

[30:10] Okay, I always buy a car that's too small so I got to have friends like Eric around

[30:15] You know, I think was always buying pins of work

[30:18] So I kind of knew that even if they didn't work or they were just getting going or they didn't work when I got home

[30:24] They could be pretty easily fixed you start buying dead games

[30:28] I was always uncomfortable with that missing parts and I wasn't always that

[30:34] I got missing boards hacked up games you got games at certain

[30:38] People sell that we won't mention that dumb games at auction carcasses and bad boards and Eric he must have had this

[30:47] Yeah, actually you know, it's very fortunate. You say there's good people out there

[30:50] You want to meet those people because they will give you a heads up when you get excited about a game

[30:55] You're looking at a game like some high-end dollar game. You're all excited and go. Oh, yeah

[31:00] Well, it's missing a magnet assembly over there

[31:02] Hey, Eric it just for the record am I one of those good guys? Yeah, you are you but I've never stuck around with you in an auction

[31:09] So why do you have your fingers crossed?

[31:11] You saw that huh?

[31:13] Yeah, so buying a sort of a poor questionable game is good in effect that you can always use it to upgrade

[31:19] You know if there's parts on it that you want to swap on to your other one

[31:22] You have two Indiana Jones and you need a better glass you need better ramps or wire forms or whatever it is

[31:28] You can use that and and you know be honest about disposing it to the next guy

[31:33] Show the things you should look for is a

[31:35] Rost inside games. I'm not really keen on that

[31:38] There's a lot of flooding and storms going on throughout this country and a lot of messed up games

[31:43] You really don't want to pursue rusted water damage cabinets

[31:48] mold mildly smell

[31:50] Hell's going on over there

[31:53] Although I know people in this room that will buy any game site unseen with any condition even mildew

[31:58] For 50 bucks absolutely

[32:01] Times to

[32:03] You guys are nuts. I mean it's those are games that you're gonna just dump on somebody else

[32:07] You're not gonna put a smelly game in your house like that. Are you?

[32:12] No, so I'm gonna put it in your house

[32:14] It started because then I got some sort of conscious dealing with people when I want to give rid of this crap

[32:20] I got enough crap as it is. I don't need more crap

[32:23] Yeah, but if you sell it on eBay you never have to see it again. Okay. All right

[32:27] Well, do you have any more to say we got another page of craft to go?

[32:30] Oh my god, so you should be inspecting your games even when you're buying it anywhere. I'm not just talking about

[32:37] Auctions at all, you know, you should look at like I said your level of confidence

[32:41] And I think as Eric and

[32:43] Shag will say that as you start out early

[32:46] You know, you don't want to go ahead and buy these basket cases

[32:49] Just gonna frustrate you no matter how good you think your knowledge is and your skills are that's not gonna work

[32:55] You should look at the back glass you should

[32:58] Take it out if you can look to see how much repairs

[33:01] You can always see that sometimes back glasses have been docked up from behind

[33:06] You like to think up and they're all messed up and you can't get caught up in the moment of of these games

[33:11] And you get home and you find out the glasses missing painter been painted poorly

[33:15] One of the big things is check the size you need to know what your house looks like and where you're gonna put this thing

[33:21] Everybody's made a mistake in buying too big of a game for a space

[33:24] They can't fit it in and then trying to do absolutely insane things to your house

[33:28] Such as try to get them in well. I'm on a puck bowl or once I I needed I wanted to get a ball bowl

[33:34] For years and I ended up buying a puck bowler and then it was three inches too big to get in my house

[33:41] So I end up taking the

[33:47] So I end up I had a friend it was good at work

[33:51] Work in games so we we cold chisel off the head

[33:55] But we indexed it first with some screws and then took the coin box off and then I had a straight shot

[34:02] Once I got that done I was able to open a bathroom window and put this thing through the bathroom window down a stairwell

[34:08] They're getting in the game now when I die this guy's not gonna know it

[34:12] They're never gonna get this game out of the house. They're gonna be swearing at me, but I really don't care

[34:17] There's there's people I know about ball bowlers that couldn't have get them in their house

[34:21] Shaggy's bought games and I've had to come in here and get them into his house

[34:25] He bought one game and wouldn't go and finally had to disassemble his staircase

[34:28] I

[34:30] Was that anything normal that anyone in their right mind would do for my staircases now easily

[34:37] reversible into a game

[34:40] Loading zone that's not really a normal thing that people should be doing is taking their houses apart

[34:45] There's things in some of these houses you go into changes have been made in houses

[34:50] You go to a house to buy a game in a in a basement and you find out that you can't get it after lugging this thing up a flight

[34:56] There's some 300 pound thing that you got to remove the door molding

[35:00] You know people have done it right here

[35:04] Yeah, my what wait I got a good story do you have a spare?

[35:07] Yeah, but my back door of my house is now easily removable the molding that goes around it for the screen door and everything

[35:15] This guy called me this only happened to come away

[35:17] Wait, wait, but the long the the more the time goes on the longer the screws get to put a back together

[35:22] This guy called me with a a checks, you know ice hockey, you know thing the checks hockey thing and you know

[35:32] He wanted at first a million dollars for it and I told him look I am only willing to pay this much which was not much

[35:39] And he finally said okay fine come over and get it so I'm like okay so I go over there

[35:44] I actually brought my dad who's 73 years old

[35:48] Because he has a pickup truck and he was having to be visiting me so we go over the guys house

[35:53] This is in the winter and you know like I said just a few months ago and

[35:58] You know I go down there and there's a game and sure enough it works and you know looks okay

[36:01] And so I start disassembling it so that the the head kind of comes off the game the part with the dome on it and

[36:08] I'm like okay, let's turn it sideways and let's get this out the door and

[36:13] We get it up there and

[36:15] And we get that part out so now it always leaves is the pedestal

[36:20] So we go take that up the stairs and it won't go it no matter how you turn the thing sideways upside down

[36:26] You know at an angle it doesn't matter

[36:28] It's not going out and I look at the guy said

[36:30] How did you get this in here and he goes I I didn't I bought the house it came the game came with the house

[36:36] And I'm like did you finish the basement? He goes yeah, I finished the basement

[36:40] It was just you know an empty basement when I got here

[36:42] You know I put the trim around it and everything and I said well

[36:45] You'll lock the game in the in the basement. We can't get it out. He goes wait a minute

[36:50] Wait a minute and he goes out to the garage and comes out with a crowbar and he starts like ripping the molding off

[36:58] The the door frame that goes between the basement to stairwell up to his kitchen and I'm like

[37:05] I stop the guy said look

[37:06] I don't really need to buy this game

[37:08] I need another game like I need a hole in my head. I've got three this will be my third check socky

[37:13] Why don't you say that a lot lately? Yeah?

[37:15] Yeah, buy that off you know you still have that check socky. Yeah, I do I've got my third check socky

[37:21] Why do I need three? I don't know that you can get more out there there are tough there

[37:24] Those are check sockies are tough games to to get out I had problems getting one out with Rick

[37:30] But um he's right you got to know what you're where you're getting these games in and out of it

[37:35] Wait wait I'll tell you then so I told the guy look I don't need to buy this and he's like

[37:39] You're buying it. He wanted this money and it wasn't that much money

[37:42] And so he just starts I mean he goes nuts. He starts taking the old you know the nicely-case door

[37:49] Apart that leads to his kitchen. He starts just taking a part like a wild man with this crowbar

[37:55] Yeah, but you would have used a hammer instead of that crowbar

[37:58] Well, he got I mean we only had a half inch despair, but I got the game out

[38:02] They get the house back together. Yeah, oh and this was the funny thing

[38:05] I originally told I air I'll spill out the numbers

[38:08] I told him I would give them between five and six hundred dollars for the game and

[38:13] When and actually came time to pay him

[38:16] Which was before he ripped the door apart. I only had five hundred and seventy five dollars with me because I told them between five and six

[38:22] You know I didn't mean six well he thought that meant six and of course me that meant five

[38:28] So I brought enough money in my eye and to him I didn't bring enough money

[38:32] So I stole a lot of twenty five dollars and I'm like pushing this thing in the car

[38:37] I'm like grandpa get that frickin thing started get out of here as quick as possible

[38:41] I'd not give him that twenty five and I'm like yelling out the back see

[38:44] Yeah, I was like what's my twenty five dollars?

[38:46] I work off that twenty five bucks. How did you bother that off any other services? No other services, you know lie

[38:54] So other things you should consider and I know I have a stairwell with a

[39:00] With a base that I pre-measured and made a template for any kind of game that I know how I can put it on this template

[39:07] I know the size of largest footprint this thing can make spend this game around and move it around

[39:11] So those are things you got to you got landings and that you got to know what your size is and before you make some crazy

[39:17] Purchase another thing you got to consider is is wait you should really research weight of of some of the games

[39:23] like

[39:25] Woodrails aren't usually too bad. I've taken a thirties wood rail apart myself

[39:29] Take the play field out and I've

[39:32] taken the game down myself

[39:34] That's another thing you should consider doing is to reduce your weight you can disassemble the game

[39:40] You can remove the head off of the you know these new solid state

[39:44] Games not many people usually do that they take them intact

[39:47] But you can take the head off and wait you don't need to take the head off sure

[39:51] I mean no no all you got to do on the new solid states where the games where the head slide it down the stairs

[39:57] No, no all you do is loosen the head and rotate the head 90 degrees that way you don't have to disconnect all the wiring

[40:05] But that's still I mean I'm talking about reducing weight in certain

[40:09] I'm talking about not be able to get it through a doorway

[40:11] I'm talking about reducing weight if you have people that are worried about hurting themselves taking

[40:16] Games that's what I'm not having your fricking grandpa mold my games for me down in the basement once the last time

[40:22] He moved the haunted house down the flight of stairs. Well that head comes off. That one's not a big deal

[40:27] I'll never mind

[40:30] I took a haunted house completely a part it took the play fields out took the cabinet through the head apart and reassemble it

[40:37] Just because I was tired. I'm getting tired of moving games

[40:40] I'm getting to be real old and I don't want to kill myself

[40:42] I most kill two people with the jukeboxes. So you really should should research the weight a pinball machine

[40:49] Two to three people to move one of those up and down apply the stairs the jukebox

[40:54] Three people and a hand card a good hand card something with stair climbers and

[40:59] Industrial one like something at U-Haul that you go and rent for about ten bucks

[41:03] Yeah, I don't know about moving jukeboxes, but I'll tell you this you put on about a hundred pounds

[41:09] And it's a lot easier to counterbalance yourself against a pinball machine

[41:13] I pull those things up a flight as stairs now with no problem. What's your heart is not the same?

[41:18] You're gonna lose you're gonna have a heart attack doing it

[41:20] I bought a wood rail from a lady once and didn't bring a hand truck with me of course and I

[41:26] Buy myself took the game all apart and and and moved it up her out of her basement stairs all by myself because she was like a hundred years old

[41:34] And you know, I mean what I did is I bear hugged I set the body headless and legless on its butt

[41:40] Set it up and I would bear hug it and lift it up one stair at a time one stair at a time by bear hugging it and bringing it up

[41:47] Each of the basement stairs. Okay, that's even dumb in my eyes. Okay

[41:52] Yeah, I think I think you should have just taken the play field out glass out and taking it out in power

[41:57] So this lady was scaring me. I just couldn't get out of it. I want you to kick your ass. She's a hundred years old

[42:03] No, no, I mean not that kind of like she was sharpening knives while I was the

[42:08] Sharpening knives while I'm moving this thing out of there

[42:10] I just couldn't I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible. Well, I bought a Seaburg

[42:15] jukebox the bigger one. Alright, well just they make and I almost kill two people draw

[42:19] I could have dropped this on another thing is bowlers or another thing

[42:22] You want to have three people moving a bowler when you're taking a band box likely took and Shaggy didn't get it was Shaggy left because he had a

[42:29] Booth back and he had five people lifting this thing had to be over 700 pounds three people pushing it from the back

[42:38] It just people don't let people know what this is it was a music box one of those ones like the Marvin collects that has like a

[42:45] Giant compressor in it. Yeah, and the thing like you know, it's like

[42:50] You know

[42:51] It was huge and we waited a ton

[42:53] I knew what I couldn't get out of there quick enough and a bunch of people that saw that on eBay

[42:57] You can't fathom how big this thing is it's amazing. No, and that wasn't even what I was talking about Eric that thing

[43:03] That wasn't this thing was like that times a hundred what we're talking about

[43:08] So looking at that thing weight six to seven hundred pounds and now top cast is happy to present

[43:13] I survived just a baby

[43:16] Presented by the man with all the answers

[43:21] Hey everyone, it's curved with a quick system 80 tech tip

[43:25] This tip has to do with dip switches mounted on the CPU board and line of four packs of eight switches

[43:31] Most system 80 CPU mounted feature adjustable dip switches are blue and color and work fairly well

[43:38] But in the Mars God of War era you can sometimes find red dip switches

[43:43] These red switches are junk and should be replaced without even bothering to test them

[43:49] They work spotty at best and will give you headaches when trying to figure out what's going on when the game starts doing odd things

[43:56] Just replace them with modern dip switches and be done with it

[44:00] It's a good idea to test all the dip switches and switch dials at the same time with the CPU board out

[44:06] CPU board is gonna be out more than once anyway, so take a few minutes to perform these tests

[44:12] Close all the dip switches and put your digital multimeter in diode test

[44:16] Test each diode through the dip switch any abnormal reading should have the focus to put on either part as being defective

[44:25] Don't forget to check out the system 80 repair guides and the great this old pinball DVDs at marvin3m.com

[44:32] Chuchegin email if you have a system 80 tech tip you want us to cover

[44:39] All right, we're back norm are you finished with your damn story?

[44:42] No, we got more to talk about oh come on

[44:45] No, I'm the tools that you got to take it. Oh please normally said people know this stuff. They don't you get well

[44:53] Fine you don't want to talk about it Eric come back Eric. Where are you?

[44:56] Where are you going come back Eric some put this guy on it?

[44:59] It's right picking up white castles

[45:01] I'm going home normal shut up

[45:04] Just tell us the hatchback story mr. Shaggy. Oh, how you broke the hatch

[45:09] On your car on your wife's car because you loaded up a

[45:14] Gun game it was a gun game. We went over a guy's place here in Detroit and he had I don't know

[45:21] We were buying a couple gun games and a pinball and I basically called Rob and Norm

[45:27] I called on my friends because they all had to take at least one game one way or another they were taking a game

[45:32] Only one guy showed up and that was me

[45:34] I didn't get a game came he took a game, but I didn't get it. Hey well you sure of it's not my fault

[45:40] You were bitching and moaning about somebody died or something. I don't remember what it was

[45:45] But just a friend yeah

[45:47] cold-hearted

[45:48] Bitches that way you're gonna say thanks. Yeah fun to mind died

[45:52] So it was more important to go move an old moldy

[45:56] Mildude game out of a guy's basement. They've been there for 25 years walk out though. Yeah, it was a walk out basement

[46:03] Well anyway, so this is gun game and Norm's looking at it going

[46:07] That isn't gonna fit in there and I'm like it's gonna fit in the back of my hatchback car

[46:11] It's gonna fit. Why wouldn't it fit? You know when he keeps telling me it wouldn't because you want it to fit

[46:16] So that's why it's supposed to fit well anyways

[46:19] So I get the thing in there and we're pushing in prod and but a third of it is hanging out the back

[46:25] Right when you say easily a third?

[46:27] Well you couldn't shut the ass properly

[46:29] Right I couldn't shut the hatch so we tied it down with a bunch of rags and

[46:35] Other crap and then I driving down the expressway 696 and the hatch was kind of bobbing a little bit bobbing a little bit

[46:44] Yeah, and it was raining and it's fine no one wants to hear me anyway. Yeah, well

[46:51] Why don't I want to tell this story? So he's driving down the expressway in the rain and his hatchbacks is

[46:57] Explodes and he's driving 65

[47:01] And then he gave some cocka made me story to his wife how you know this glass broke on his car

[47:08] And I don't know. What was it? What did you what was your name? Excuse?

[47:12] No comment thank you. He was too strong and he just shut it too hard

[55:25] We jammed half in the trunk and half in between the front seat the back seat the two kids in the back seat in the adult and

[55:32] We cross back into Canada and the border looked at us like we were stupid

[55:37] What did you how did you declare that we told them it was timball parts

[55:41] And did they buy it? Yeah, we went right through and they didn't have to pay any duty. No lucky you because it's made in the US, right?

[55:48] No, they're imports from Japan or something

[56:33] How you still there? I'm still here. We get we get to hang and but give us your story out

[56:38] Well, I was at this auction and I met these people people who would remind their first game

[56:42] It was a rocky and bow-winkle and I'm saying there

[56:45] Look at them and they just bought it and I was like, you know how you getting home?

[56:49] They said well, we got a van. I said okay

[56:51] So first thing you want to do is take off the antlers on the top so they don't get broken so I they did that

[56:55] And I said to them now the first next thing you want to do is you want to bend the head down

[56:58] You want to put a strap around it and then you want to take the bag legs off and then you want to put it

[57:03] Put it down the ground then take the front legs off

[57:05] So I come back about a half hour later and I see the game sitting up on the top of two folding chairs

[57:11] And I'm looking at it. I walk over looking at it

[57:16] No legs on just sitting there with these two folding chairs and it's on the on the back

[57:21] You know the part your back goes against it's actually sit up on top of them and I'm like

[57:26] I'm just trying to figure what are they going to do now

[57:28] I mean I just can't figure out they're going to get it out of here. So I walked away. I just walked away

[57:33] That's nice nice guy

[57:35] Yeah, yeah, so you didn't like give him any help

[57:37] I would put the link back on and start all over. Yeah, they could have done that but you know it was funny. I thought it was funny

[01:02:57] Frank is this you then we're talking about now?

[01:03:00] No, it's not me. Oh

[01:03:02] You may as well back about something or forgot but I'm gonna respond

[01:03:07] Just remember when the radio but it wasn't me

[01:03:09] Yeah, well to the plot basically have is just about finding the games and stuff and knowing what's worth repairing and not and how do you guys decide that

[01:03:17] How do I decide that person? Yeah, well, how do you find a how do you find the games go around looking find the games and then be

[01:03:23] What do you think is what you look for going into the games? What is worth repairing or not?

[01:03:28] It's either obvious play field stuff

[01:03:30] That stuff is just starting to keep her not

[01:03:33] No finding the games is it's part of the fun. I mean you can look at classified ads in the paper and try to get the state sales

[01:03:41] There's a ton of that stuff laying around there's operators. You can go through

[01:03:45] uh

[01:03:46] Yellow pages and and look one thing would be to actually go to your library or local library look for

[01:03:52] Yeah, but mentioning them with going on Craigslist and stuff and checking the classifies

[01:03:56] I'm in the New York area and everybody just wants a lot for these machines. I'm saying you what you need to do is go to your old

[01:04:02] Local library and go back in 80s. No, no, no, what he's just going to the library and to and look at the old yellow pages out of the library

[01:04:10] Look like a old operator. Yeah, look under amusement devices

[01:04:13] Okay, I'll give you a better idea. This is way better than that. It's way less work too

[01:04:18] Yeah, no, if that is an eBay

[01:04:20] Okay, what what I used to do I used to do this all the time and it worked really well is go to

[01:04:26] I don't what part are you near New York City? Yeah, in a new York City put in the paper

[01:04:31] Yeah, I put a wanted ad wanted to buy in like the little the little papers

[01:04:35] I mean you're gonna have to get away from New York City and go up you know upstate a bit

[01:04:41] You know figure out how long you're willing to drive you know like if you're willing to drive an hour

[01:04:45] You know to pick it see then you put an ad in the little either the buy-and-sell or those little trader those shopper papers

[01:04:52] The local paper you know and they're usually like they're it never pick a daily paper

[01:04:57] Always the weeklies. It's got to be a weekly paper that comes out just once a week

[01:05:02] And usually it's like three or five bucks to run a like a 15 or a 20 word ad and you put one at the buy

[01:05:08] Broken pinball machines any condition you have to say any condition because otherwise people say

[01:05:14] You know, nobody's gonna want this piece of junk I got when it's really like a mint nags or something

[01:05:19] Okay, now now that you gave away

[01:05:22] On the on the videos and stuff you guys have these containers. What are you just import them from Europe and how does that work?

[01:05:29] Yeah, but that party's over that party's over. Nobody's gonna be you know, it's hard to import stuff now

[01:05:35] When the opportunities close a lot of those games the good games are gone

[01:05:39] Been gone over the last seven years. I mean you can still get it, but the condition and

[01:05:44] Is very poor. Yeah container games overpay so much. Yeah, we used to get games they were running if you can believe this

[01:05:51] Anywhere from 200 or 500 dollars from oh, I remember getting container games for a hundred bucks

[01:05:57] Yeah, I mean we got like anything from a pop-eye for a hundred bucks to twilight zones are running six

[01:06:03] 700 dollars for twilight, but that that window is is gone unless

[01:06:07] So the next question is how much do you decide what to pay for these things? I mean that's up to you

[01:06:12] I mean, that's what you're comfort level with I mean when you're running the ads in the paper saying I'd buy games any condition

[01:06:19] I used to put I would pay anywhere from I would say up to and then a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars and that would really

[01:06:30] You know in the reality is is that you would never end up paying that much and you know

[01:06:34] It would bring a lot of stuff out of the woodwork that I think was really cool especially old the amps

[01:06:40] I know three guys that put classified ads in the papers segge's one another two other friends and everyone

[01:06:47] Got responses. You're gonna get weird responses. You're gonna have somebody to get say uh home you so only a fireball

[01:06:53] You're gonna get kids pinball machines that are spring loaded marble games

[01:06:57] They're gonna call you about all this stuff, but you're gonna weed through it. You're gonna get a lot of video games

[01:07:02] But but you're gonna get hits I friends that hit on games that were 15,000 dollars

[01:07:07] You know you got a 15 I just don't know what's worth spending me I don't want to spend that like if it's

[01:07:14] I'm not you're gonna have to spend a couple hundred bucks words and money. You don't know how do you

[01:07:18] Gage you mean? How do you do when you go and look at the game?

[01:07:21] The 90s games that these you to see right the older one let the older ballad and

[01:07:26] The end I want to get an EMR to start falling around with more to play with I don't know what the get the guys get very

[01:07:32] Bises guide or what's it a ballpark to look at well you get the guides out they'll they'll be they'll be accurate to come out every year

[01:07:39] It's really your comfort level me as a general rule any pinball machines gonna be worth a hundred bucks

[01:07:44] So or 50 50 to 100 bucks. So I always start there no matter what people call up with it's like yeah, you know

[01:07:51] That wasn't exactly what I'm looking for but

[01:07:54] 50 bucks would buy it. I mean, you know

[01:07:57] And then you know I was kind of looking at worst case scenario if it's a parts game, you know

[01:08:03] You know parts along just to take and trip it apart and film the ball. Yeah, yeah exactly, you know

[01:08:08] Yeah, like the mr. pinball price guys pretty good it gets you a good starting point

[01:08:12] but

[01:08:14] You like Clay said there's such a wide range on these games you go and show up and just depending upon their cosmetic condition

[01:08:21] Start there and if your guys like us that work on your own games. You don't care what the mechanical right

[01:08:26] I guess I mean I had a guy I'll tell you the story unless you were guys one of the years

[01:08:29] I had no 78 ballakes and it was in my parents' space in a few years and they didn't want to

[01:08:35] We didn't work and we wasn't sure who worked and my brother had a six million dollar man both the same

[01:08:40] Mara and a call the guy in here to take a look at him and go is that they charge a hundred bucks to take a look at them

[01:08:46] Each one was on my house one of their brothers house he goes they're not worth anything but I'll give you a hundred bucks

[01:08:50] Get my back. I said this is ridiculous. They nailed to work more than that

[01:08:53] And I started searching for an a fan you videos and gone through stuff make ones through a short

[01:08:58] spent a

[01:08:59] About $30 in my machine to get it working the

[01:09:03] This soundboard was basically the pins were loose and it's re-signed them and got it working and play around some

[01:09:08] Myples and everything was fine and the other one I replaced the mpubord and I just have to work on the

[01:09:15] The driver's war one of the sellings is picking and that should be it. Well, I think is is there's a lot of people like it says going around

[01:09:20] You then just make these offers and he was looking to buy your games

[01:09:23] I'm trying to get advantage of you because I know you can have exactly. He was looking to buy games cheap and resellum

[01:09:28] So that he either resell or whatever but me and me he was a crook and I thought he was a crook me

[01:09:32] I'm just looking to buy games cheap the the hoard

[01:09:35] Eric was just counting all the games of my basement and he was like what did you say to me Eric?

[01:09:41] Two or three

[01:09:43] Set up in in working in my basement. Yeah, you married by chance or no. Yeah, I am actually I don't let her come in the basement though

[01:09:56] There's I get four or five will be happy with that. Yeah, what about Eric? This is my basement. Look like a dump

[01:10:01] No, you can't walk around in it though

[01:10:04] Well, Eric's kind of a large man. I'm smaller so I get around fine. Hey, I dropped 20 pounds from a belly to my butt last month

[01:10:38] If those guys are real helpful and they give you a wide you know

[01:10:41] You want to pay as little as possible you got to know the market you got to know the feel for each person buying it

[01:10:45] You know, yeah, I mean some people wanted to start astronomical amount of money for a game and you got a letter with them

[01:10:50] Yeah, and you just walk and I mean if it's a game you really want bring the price guide with you

[01:10:54] And you can actually show them the price guy and don't insult anybody. Yeah, and then well unlike me

[01:11:00] How are you on top guest?

[01:11:03] I was wondering if you guys knew I have two

[01:11:06] Bingo machines once from 78 and once from 80 and I know that the play field from the 78 is actually made of

[01:11:14] plywood

[01:11:15] But the one from 80 is more like a plastic

[01:11:19] Does that go with pinball games too?

[01:11:22] When you say plastic, you mean it's actually like an acrylic

[01:11:25] Yeah, like and then this is a bingo not a pinball but a bingo

[01:11:29] Yeah, bingo machines. Yeah, I've seen that before they actually

[01:11:33] During the 70s I've seen a couple manufacturers experiment with the you know acrylic plastic play fields

[01:11:39] There was actually a couple games that that you know that had them. I mean, I don't see it often. What's uh who made the bingo

[01:11:47] The book made by Bali

[01:11:49] I'm sorry by say by who?

[01:11:51] By Bali. Okay. Yeah, I mean Bali was making bingos as gambling devices, you know into the 80s

[01:11:58] I don't know a lot about them though. Do you know?

[01:12:00] Well, I think there's still making them in europe. Belgium is still big in bingo

[01:12:03] Yeah, for in Germany. I think there's still being made out there. Yeah. I mean, you know it happens

[01:12:08] I mean, you know, it doesn't really surprise me

[01:12:11] Um

[01:12:12] You know what I want one that's a whole other story, but you know

[01:12:18] I'm you know, I don't know that I'm sure it happened

[01:12:23] Well the techo with the ball game soup in that area or is it just thing?

[01:12:27] No, no, I mean a couple manufacturers experimented with that but um, yeah, there was

[01:12:33] Yeah, order one aside from orbiter one. I mean, there was I think sonic or somebody

[01:12:38] Experimented with with plastic play fields, but it didn't get real far

[01:12:42] I think I rid of that because the screws are stripping on it, aren't they?

[01:12:46] Yeah, there was a problem with attaching parts from the underside

[01:12:49] You know wood was just a lot more versatile for for allowing stuff like that

[01:12:53] So you know hope that helps

[01:12:56] Yeah, okay. Okay, we take care. Bro, bye

[01:13:00] That was a kind of a different question. Sure. Corn, will you please close?

[01:13:07] I'd hate to give out that number. Oh

[01:13:10] 1 800 in just in case anybody really wants to call or is even listening

[01:13:16] You know, what do you know, but we wanted corn to call back

[01:13:19] Please gourd

[01:13:21] We didn't get your story and we were pretty insulted that you hung up on us. He's still on hold

[01:13:27] No, he isn't he isn't anyways

[01:13:29] The guy that was with the tilt switches that was calling or with the tilt where his Williams game was there

[01:13:35] Yeah, and his ass tack on his EMS

[01:13:37] Yes, that is very common for Williams games

[01:13:39] Most of them when you turn them on what it does is it pulls in the tilt relay as as a method so that the last game that you were playing is

[01:13:48] fully done in over

[01:13:50] That's that's real common um, you know

[01:13:53] Well, does the game stay in tilt? Well, you know, make puts some credits on it man or set the thing on free play and get rockin and rolling

[01:13:59] All right, we got another call here. Hold on

[01:14:02] Hi, you're on top cast. All right, you want the story this time or not? Well don't hang up on us. Thank you very much

[01:14:08] What is wrong with you? Why'd you hang up on us?

[01:14:10] Chicken no, no, no, you hung up on me. No, I did ache. I'm in your corner corn. He's an a-hole

[01:14:17] Anyway, you want the story or not?

[01:14:19] Go on go on

[01:14:22] Well come on spit it out. All right, so I

[01:14:25] Have a high speed in my living room which is my it's my first game when I buy my seconds

[01:14:29] I got to give you know

[01:14:30] I got to move it into my second bedroom, which obviously it never had a pinball in it

[01:14:33] So I flop the head of the high speed down and I break out the measuring tape

[01:14:38] Go to the door and I measure it and I figure out that if I completely remove the door and the hinges

[01:14:45] I'll have exactly enough room to slide this thing through the door sideways

[01:14:50] So my wife and I we break down the high speed we get it up on sand we get it into the doorway and I push

[01:14:59] And it doesn't go anywhere

[01:15:01] I sort of neglected to remember that there is the hinge on the back of the back box

[01:15:08] So what happens is the game is now there is no part of the game actually touching the floor anymore

[01:15:14] Because it's absolutely wedged inside of this room

[01:15:19] So law story or the door frame lost I just pushed like crazy and you know when I when I moved out I had to replace some trim and you know

[01:15:27] White out over the whole thing. Oh, oh yeah, this is good too once

[01:15:32] My well, this is a bit of a personal story

[01:15:34] We'll have to add it out of the final version of this film for some reason my wife had a headache and I was really mad

[01:15:41] Do you know what I'm saying here norm? Not tonight. Yeah, not tonight honey and I got really mad

[01:15:45] And so there was a living in the apartment

[01:15:48] So this was when I was in my 20s and the testosterone levels were real high

[01:15:52] And I actually punched a hole in the closet door and so when I moved you know they do that that security deposit

[01:15:58] I just spun the door around

[01:15:59] I punched a home deposit door with you

[01:16:01] Yeah, my fist okay. Oh, I thought you're supposed to just cover up that hole with toothpaste

[01:16:06] Haha

[01:16:08] Anyway, I guess that really doesn't remain in the do with your story though corn

[01:16:12] No, I know the whole lot, but you know, hey, it's all good. Thanks for calling
