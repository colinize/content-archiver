[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:11] Music

[00:20] Tonight on Topcast we're going to be talking to somebody who's a famous pinball

[00:24] in video game programmer.

[00:26] It did pinball programming for games like Firepower, High Speed, F14 Topcast,

[00:33] along with some other games, mostly Steve Richie games, and also he programmed

[00:37] some pretty famous video games too like Defender, Stargate,

[00:41] Robotron, Targeter, Smash TV, and the Fast and Furious Driving Games.

[00:47] Special guest.

[00:51] So I'd like to welcome Eugene Jarvis, the Topcast tonight.

[00:57] We're going to give him a call right now and talk to him about pinball

[01:00] programming and video game programming.

[01:09] Welcome to Ross Rills, if you know your party's extension you may dial it at any time.

[01:14] Your call is being transferred.

[01:18] Hello. Eugene?

[01:20] Yes.

[01:21] Hey it's Clay, can you hear me okay?

[01:23] You're loud and clear.

[01:24] Everett, a lot of your interviews and they always seem to focus really around the video game stuff.

[01:33] It's not that I don't want to talk about the video game stuff but I want to talk more about the

[01:37] pinball stuff and you know you started out at Atari and then you obviously went to Williams.

[01:43] But let's back up and what is your first memories of pinball when you were a kid?

[01:48] You know it's funny I used to play this is crazy but this was back when I was about eight.

[01:57] And we used to meet in the kids, you know the big deal in those days you didn't want to get out of

[02:03] the house and you would ride your bike up to like 7-11 or you know the corner candy store or whatever.

[02:11] And it's how I lived in there was there was a place called Johnny's Smoke Shop.

[02:17] And this is a place where your mom told you you never were supposed to go.

[02:21] You know?

[02:21] Yeah I had one of those when I grew up on Long Island. My grandparents lived on the tip

[02:28] in this little fishing town and there was a similar it was called the cigar store and I got

[02:34] the same speech.

[02:35] Yeah so it's like whatever you do don't go into Johnny's Smoke Shop but Johnny and they filled

[02:40] you know obviously all the tobacco stuff they had like the best candy counter in town also.

[02:44] Yeah same with me too.

[02:45] And just you know a wall of candy and then it was like what was going on in the back room at

[02:53] Johnny's Smoke Shop you know it's kind of like it's kind of like that you know the back room

[02:58] at the sopranos you know there was you know guys in there playing pool and doing weird shit

[03:04] you know it was all kind of mysterious.

[03:07] In what era was this like in the late 60s or something?

[03:09] This was in like mid 60s.

[03:12] Yeah.

[03:13] And but in the back they always had a pinball machine.

[03:17] You know back I mean there was almost back where the guys would hang out you know and smoke

[03:21] cigars and stuff.

[03:23] And I guess because it was like this forbidden place I don't know what it was but we

[03:28] we we went back there and we loved to play pinball.

[03:32] And so the and the challenge is you know in those days nobody had a lot of money and

[03:38] so you need to try to get a replay somewhere or another you know and I think it was like

[03:42] dime play in those days two four quarter or three quarter I guess three four quarter 10

[03:49] cents a block and five balls it's always five by grout out in California everybody always played five

[03:56] ball out there.

[03:57] And you know we just figure out you need to figure out some way to cheat the game you know

[04:02] and there was finally some of the kids you know the kind of the me today we have the internet

[04:08] you know those days it was like kind of the kids grapevine and some way it came down the grapevine

[04:12] that there was a certain pattern you know in the like what light was on and what light wasn't on

[04:20] on the play field that was correlated with the match.

[04:24] And we we've learned that you know the certain pattern of lights meant the match would be like

[04:30] zero or something. And so you the whole idea was you'd play your four balls and on the fifth

[04:36] ball you try to get the lights set up and then you tilt the game when it was a zero match and then

[04:41] the ball would train and then you boom you match a zero and you play again.

[04:45] You know you guys are like you know early card counters and lost Vegas.

[04:52] But you know it was just obviously we loved playing pinball and it was just it was a you know

[04:57] just it was the battle of you versus the machine and you know any way you could cheat that game

[05:01] you would you know. Now were these wood rails or metal rails?

[05:06] You know I tell you I'm a little vague on that it was the I believe it was a metal rail game

[05:14] you know I think the wood rails they went out in the late 50s or something.

[05:18] Yeah about 1960 and their whirlie wasn't matched didn't really come in until the metal to the

[05:24] to the metal rail so much so but you know I figured it could be either.

[05:28] Yeah I think it did have the automatic ball feed which I don't know what era that came into but

[05:37] different era for different different manufacturers Williams was one of the first to have

[05:42] the automatic ball feed you weren't using the manual ball lift so you were probably you know

[05:47] 62 63 I think on Williams. Okay and I mean there may have been a couple of old manual games I think

[05:53] ever we used to just load them all up you know the old manual game you just you know you you kick out

[05:57] five balls and just have some fun you know and play five ball multi ball. I still do that today.

[06:05] I think you know there was uh in the early years I think they had some of those games in there.

[06:10] Cool. But uh yes that was my you know that's kind of what got me into pinball and uh

[06:15] you know my mom uh I don't know she ever really found out we were in there you know maybe

[06:20] you know don't tell her you know what she'll download this and then she'll ridicule you

[06:28] she'll take away your privileges yeah yeah yeah okay so now when you uh in this all happened

[06:33] this was in California yeah okay what what part of California what what part

[06:40] been low part it was it's near San Francisco okay and that's where you obviously you grew up and

[06:45] went from went to high school yeah okay and then what you went to Berkeley after after school right

[06:50] that's right that's right and what graduated with with a double E computer science degree

[06:55] and actually that was the next place you know I played a hell of a lot of of pinball was uh I

[07:02] know I just hit a year kid in college and uh I don't know what it is like your first year in college

[07:07] you know you I mean you hit the books a little bit but you probably spent a hell of a lot more time

[07:10] playing pool and pinball I don't know why I don't know what it is and they had they had some great

[07:17] arcades around campus um and that kind of fell in love with the I mean that was in the in the

[07:24] mid 70s and I mean that was kind of the great age of Gottlieb Electromagneticals and uh that was

[07:34] just you know there were some like there was the Gottlieb games were just uh you know really really big

[07:40] and uh so I would you know play a lot of the Gottlieb classical uh Electromagnetical games uh

[07:47] but I wasn't school yeah I can remember in my dorm um I went to Purdue and they had a um they put a

[07:55] gorf a gorf in a wizard of war in the in the basement of the dorm and we were kind of in a small

[08:01] dorm and we figured out a way to to tape a uh a piece of thread to the quarter and we could

[08:08] fish it through the on the midway games you could fish it through the coin slots and get it right

[08:12] at the trip switch and just pull the quarter and crack the thing up to like 99 credits that's

[08:16] how we were cheating then yeah those the old the stringers man yeah there's okay I mean remember

[08:22] the another way they would do it uh on the tangent you'd remove a lake bolt and then you'd get

[08:27] a little wire in there through that hole and you'd you know I know you had to be some kind of uh

[08:34] you know insane genius but uh you'd bend the wire so that you could trip the coin neck coin

[08:39] neck but you know getting like a code hanger through the lake like net hole lake bolt hole

[08:46] yeah pretty crazy yeah that's why I wondered why they put um the later games put those metal plates

[08:52] in front of the lake bolts uh and the inside I always wondered why they did that that was exciting

[08:56] that was the reason guys were getting free games with wires I mean it's nuts

[09:03] yeah I heard like at one time they used plastic back glasses and guys would drill holes in the

[09:07] back glass so that they could actually move the credit unit up from the face of the game

[09:15] oh man the the old days yeah that was uh it was a fun you know I guess what was what was funner you

[09:22] know playing the game or cheating uh I think cheating it actually so tell me now you went to

[09:30] Atari right after right after Berkeley how did you get that job yeah so that was kind of crazy I um

[09:37] uh you know it was I graduated was graduated from Berkeley and uh so I went on you know all these

[09:43] interviews with the right interview with NCR and Hillet Packard and you know all these uh like

[09:49] the naval research I even interviewed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in uh Pasadena and it's like

[09:57] to uh computer programs for you know lunar probes and spaceships and stuff you know maybe I

[10:04] should have stuck with that job but anyway I ended up uh and I interviewed at this place called

[10:09] Atari you know which was pretty cool you know I was like wow man this is some pretty cool stuff and

[10:14] uh um I had studied computer science and you know when I favored courses it was micro processors

[10:21] and then at this time you know micro processes were just kind of like this is back in like 75-76

[10:28] and the micros were just like coming out and uh I used to go to this thing called the home

[10:34] brew computer club which was uh in the Bay Area and then you know guys like you know Steve Jobs

[10:40] are hanging out there and showing off the Apple one computer you know and uh it was kind of

[10:46] cool you know the geeks that were uh you know in the micro processes you know guy would come to like

[10:51] a meeting of the home brew computer society you know and and like shot his new system and like yeah

[10:57] man I got you know 16k of ram and I'm running at you know one megahertz and you know and I got you

[11:05] know three floppy disks cooked up to my system you know and the any decimal what are you what are

[11:10] you using it for you know you know and he goes well what do you mean what am I using it for I mean

[11:15] I got three floppy disks on my system and I got 16k of ram and I'm I'm kicking ass and it's like

[11:22] kicking ass and taking names but I have not a single application to run you know but it was like

[11:27] that was it was kind of like the hardware thing and it's like like guys soup it up their cars you know

[11:31] and uh yeah but then they don't have a driver's license exactly that was kind of the thing and

[11:39] so you know everybody was just crazy about micro processors and obviously Atari was getting

[11:44] going with some of their early games now did you see the early Atari games you see the pongs and

[11:50] all you know in the in the computer space that you know the the Nolan computer space and that

[11:55] stuff on location you know I never I don't think I ever saw computers but I've say I played

[12:01] pond a lot of location I don't know if I ever actually saw a computer space I must have somewhere but

[12:07] it's amazing that game was a complete bomb you know amazingly sophisticated game

[12:14] and you know obviously inspired by the game space wars from MIT and but nobody got it you know

[12:22] because that was before pong and people just weren't ready for like you know controlling a

[12:27] spaceship flying around you can even steer your shots you know which is something I don't even think

[12:33] you can rarely do in today's games you know it was just it's crazy yeah it's a quick it's kind of a

[12:38] cool game a guy just a couple miles from me like you know maybe a year ago said I get this old

[12:45] video game you want it you can have it for free and I'm like okay sure whatever and I go over

[12:50] there and it's a metallic red fiberglass computer space and I'm like oh my god you're giving this

[12:56] too many it's like yeah you can have it it doesn't work you know and I got it running and it was a

[13:01] bit of a game to play but you're ready what's kind of sophisticated certainly for TTL logic.

[13:07] That was cool yeah actually I have one of those in my basement I bought it you know it's a

[13:10] oxygen and like 82 for a hundred bucks and I also have the red metal flake single pair there were

[13:16] like double-player cabinets and there's a different variety different colors of that game.

[13:22] Yeah yellow green blue and red but the most common is red but I think that's the one that most

[13:28] everyone likes the sickest is the yellow and the greens are like man that's a strange color to

[13:34] make a game. It's funny I mind has the old probably years of the same way it has an old

[13:39] magnilocks monitor in there yeah it's like a TV it's two of yeah it's it's basically just an old

[13:45] tube TV and then they took the speaker out of the TV and like mounted it on the cabinet and that's

[13:49] the sound system and it's pretty the coin box was a gallon can of paint thinner and they like took

[13:58] a can opener and opened the lid on it and that was a coin box and I was going man you know that is smart

[14:03] you know yeah I and mine was missing the missing the coin box. Are you saying that you've got a dual

[14:08] computer space to play? I have a single but I think there were actually some dual ones out there.

[14:12] Yeah they're really really rare though I mean if a regular computer space is rare a dual is

[14:18] 10 times rare. Yeah I mean a buddy of mine worked at Empire Distropeting in Chicago once

[14:27] a summer and whose job was to put like a hundred of those in the dumpster. I mean how sad that is

[14:33] you know you think about it today they're probably I don't know what they're worth maybe a thousand

[14:37] bucks for you to sell. Yeah still it's like throwing money out. Yeah but yeah that's a cool I

[14:43] love that game I rewired mine to be asteroids compatible. I can play it because basically the

[14:49] the rotate and the thrust fire are exactly the opposite of asteroids and I just could deal with that

[14:58] you know my mind couldn't switch over right so I rewired it to make it asteroids compatible and

[15:05] it actually is pretty fun in that aspect and you wonder if like it's just that the control aspect

[15:10] where it had you shooting and thrusting with your left hand and steering with your right hand and

[15:16] like almost all video game sense had you shoot with your right hand and I just like there's

[15:22] something you know primal about you want to kill things with your right hand you know. Well yeah

[15:29] because most everybody's right hand it probably you know that's kind of the just you're killing your

[15:33] shooting hand and so I think they made a big error in their control panel there. Now so you didn't

[15:41] really know much about Atari when you went and interviewed with him. No other than you know playing

[15:45] pong and this was you know before the days of the the DCS you know the the 26th kind of wasn't even

[15:51] out yet so you know they were strictly a coin up company at this point I guess other than the

[15:56] pong home games too and so we know they were there and interviewed and it was like you know it's

[16:06] like a really exciting situation and like I interviewed on campus initially and then never heard from

[16:14] them again you know and liking was like four or five months and like well I guess I didn't make the

[16:20] up you know and so I actually ended up taking a job in the pilot Packard and working on some

[16:26] cobalt compiler project there's a six year project to implement you know and see you know

[16:35] 4.78493 cobalt you know. Oh fun delicious. Yeah so I lasted about three days at that one.

[16:43] I just after about the third day I just quit I couldn't deal with it anymore you know and uh and then

[16:52] it's curiously like a dare to lid I got a call from Atari and they finally you know I don't know

[16:57] what happened but my resume somehow served for service and their pilot said hey come on over you

[17:01] know you want a job. I was like okay. Wait I just like to talk about cobalt just for a second

[17:08] who was the genius behind this self-documenting language. I just don't get it. Yeah that was it

[17:17] was only the mind of the government employee could come up with something like that. Yeah it's a good

[17:22] thing you didn't take that job. Thank god you know what I actually I did that was the scary thing but

[17:28] anyway I ended up you know worked out I just uh the Atari thing they were saying hey come on over

[17:34] here you know you're gonna do uh pinball machines you know programming pinball machines like wow

[17:40] you know just I mean it was like the coolest thing ever and so uh I uh it's really it was such a

[17:46] chaotic organization at that time because they were you know growing by leaps and downs they were just

[17:51] at that point um those are early 77 they were starting to get ready to build the the VCS which is

[18:02] the 2600 and uh so there's just you know crazy things going on and uh I've ever been my first like two

[18:10] weeks I think my like a week after it was hired by boss quit and then you know a week after that his

[18:17] boss quit you know and all of a sudden I'm like the head programmer of all pinball you know and you

[18:25] know and I've been there like two weeks you know it's like no do we do we know who these two guys

[18:30] were where they go um they I guess they went to some uh actually some other super secret division of

[18:37] Atari um it's guy I guess we got him fed ye too and I think they're working on some sub secret

[18:44] video phone projects or something that never actually hit light of day um they it's when they

[18:50] had they had all kinds of knowing always had all these these projects going on you know different

[18:55] R&D groups spread you know up in the hills and this year is different places and uh there's a lot

[19:01] of strange things going on I mean a lot of a lot of the stuff never really you know made it uh made

[19:07] it to the real world but uh no one had all kinds of strange things going on so time 2000 what that

[19:13] was the first game you worked on actually was the Atariens which was the first Atari uh game and uh

[19:23] first pinball game they did and I kind of came in in the middle of that project and uh just had

[19:28] to kind of you know wrap up a few things and make a few fixes and uh you know kind of get it

[19:35] out of location testing and you know did you do the programming for the you know for the CPU uh

[19:41] you know the CPU system on that uh we know the program ran on you know I mean that's there was one

[19:48] program that you know was the CPU I mean that was it you know and uh so there was a soundboard

[19:57] they had a hardware sound uh system that was controlled by the main CPU so it was basically like a

[20:05] TTL not it wasn't a a DAC based system well it was actually which was pretty cool I don't know

[20:12] if they actually used the DAC but uh there was a uh I think I had four bits of resolution

[20:19] so it actually was a very small um they had it was a very early form of what you call wave

[20:25] table synthesis and they had a very small little prompt we don't remember that

[20:32] held like little you know I think it was like 16 bytes um that were four bits of resolution I mean

[20:40] it was pretty you know pretty much uh whatever came out of it was pretty much a swearwave you know but

[20:46] right uh so did you actually do the end up then doing the the game software for the Atariens?

[20:54] I think I took it over in midstream so you know I maybe did 20% of it

[21:00] so how were they programming that? It was all done on uh you know assembly language

[21:06] that was a motor oil 6800 but I mean what was were were were you using I mean what was the

[21:12] development platform? It was a they had they had to kind of their own uh I actually we used

[21:21] the motor oil exercise I believe which was the system you know debugging system

[21:27] and uh the crazy thing was we actually this was not to show you how how long ago this was

[21:34] you'd actually the programmers didn't have keyboards I think I believe it um

[21:42] we would you'd submit you'd write your software on like a piece of paper and then you'd submit it

[21:48] to the typist who would then type in your code on a they had like a pdp something

[21:57] many computer so you basically I mean this was the day you know like you just you know

[22:03] like write your code on a piece of paper you'd submit it to the typist then you'd go and play games

[22:07] for a couple hours while you'd wait for the typist to enter your program and then the program would

[22:14] compile then sit down to your machine and uh and then you'd test it out. Well would they like

[22:20] just hand you a set of ROMs or something? You know we actually had um I believe that this this

[22:28] is really nuts there was some kind of system where we would have a they could use core memory

[22:36] um that we bought these um cards that had eight kilo bits, kilo bites of core memory

[22:47] that any of you are familiar with magnetic core memory? Yeah sure. It was like every every bit

[22:52] I had like a little the little teeny um like a ring of like magnetic material of a couple wires

[23:00] coming through it and when they were starting to get it was almost it was so fine it was like if

[23:04] you looked at it it looked like a fabrad almost because you know the each of a bit I mean this this

[23:10] board had 64,000 little pieces of core you know strong with wires I mean it was it was like

[23:19] you know it's it's psychotic if you think about it today um and uh and that would basically that

[23:26] would be programmed by the the mini computer and then since core memory retained its memory when

[23:33] the power was off you just unplugged that board from the mini computer and then plug it into your

[23:38] development station and that was how you downloaded your software. Oh and then the developments

[23:44] it now how did you interface the development system or the core to the actual pinball machine

[23:49] to actually play a game? So then the basically that plugged into and I believe it was a motor

[23:55] exercise system which then um then it you know had some sort of um a billacle uh thing that plugged

[24:05] into the slot where the processor would go in the main system so basically the processor was

[24:11] replaced by this development station. So all the are you saying like all the adress and data lines

[24:19] on the 40 pin 6800 that was plugged into the CPU board on the pinball machine would basically have

[24:25] all these wires coming off into your development station. Exactly. So there would be a little

[24:31] socket and then 40 wires would go to your development station. And how um I mean what point in time

[24:39] did they actually say you know okay burn this to an e-prom? Well you when you that's the way you

[24:45] test it you know and from this burning e-proms could take you know an hour or something. So to get

[24:51] any kind of turnaround this core thing was really cool because then you could just you know

[24:56] you could program a core memory in like 10 seconds. So um when you finally you know felt your

[25:02] code was debugged and ready to roll then you'd burn the e-proms. So it's in the whole Atari

[25:10] development that you know when you were there you know you were there till 79. Was all the machines

[25:16] programmed in this manner? Well this was this was in the pinball department. Right. The um you know

[25:22] the other uh the other coders you know the video guys they kind of had their own things but you

[25:27] know similar similar systems in that the key punching was done by there's like a couple girls

[25:34] that typed in all your program for you. Wait what's up with the girls why would they have

[25:40] these girls do it for you? That was the way it was that's the way it was in the old days. I mean

[25:46] programmers uh you know it was like back in those days like men it was like beneath the

[25:52] stature of men to like type you know plus maybe you weren't that good at typing you know. So it

[25:58] was like women did all the typing you know it was just like the boss would you know dictate to

[26:02] a secretary you know all the typing I mean before like 19 you know before even maybe 1980 men

[26:10] did not type it was something about the secretary you had a secretary to do all your typing for

[26:16] so that words per minute really isn't words per minute since it's in men's case it's a

[26:20] wasper minute. That was just the way it was you know and the women typed you know. Okay so

[26:30] you're doing that you're so you did you did the Atari and you did what time 2000 Airborne

[26:35] and Airborne Adventure in Superman right? Yeah. Okay. Were any was there anything unusual or

[26:41] interesting about any of these games in the programming of them? You know it was all very pioneering

[26:47] you know and the funny thing was that I remember the most the most impressive thing I did

[26:52] one of the most impressive things. I guess like one of the guys that had been programming before

[26:58] you know there's always a fight between the programmer and the game designers as a programmer

[27:03] and the manager whatever and you know there it's go well why don't you make the machine you know I

[27:07] want to you know have the thing you know the lights to blink and flash and I want you know the

[27:13] bells to ring and then it serves you a chocolate sunday you know when you get a replay or something

[27:17] you know I mean and the programmer always goes well that's impossible I can't do that you know it's like

[27:22] so there's just like this tension between you know the programmer you know wants to he wants to go

[27:28] home at you know 430 he doesn't want to friggin work and and then the game design aspect for you

[27:33] want the game to do all this cool shit you know and so the programmer in this day such it was kind

[27:38] of a mysterious art you know nobody really knew anything about programming and it was all kind

[27:44] of magical like holy shit you know that the programmer had convinced everybody in the company that

[27:52] you could not blink a light on a pinball game there was impossible it was you know something in

[27:57] the program that you know that would you know just you know the programmer to explode or something

[28:04] like the light of the flip film so what you mean the light was either on or off but we couldn't go

[28:11] on and off quickly yeah it was just like lose its memory you know the state would be lost or

[28:16] something you know and so like when the like the second week I was there I like sort of blinking

[28:20] lights you know and this people were like amazingly impressed you know like and they kind of they

[28:28] were they were actually this guy a guy who was kind of the head of the design area guy by name

[28:35] of Eddie Boasberg I don't know if he used to be his family used to run New Orleans a double tea

[28:41] company okay I don't know they may still run that company down in Louisiana and he was like an

[28:49] old-time pinball guy and you know and he was just like he was so about he was so you know impressed

[28:54] that I blinked the light that he gave it a nickname dr. J so but then on I was dr. J and

[29:03] the rest of history so when you went to Williams and you did the multi-ball countdown on fireball

[29:10] you must have just like everybody was like dancing in the aisles and you get screaming your name

[29:15] like you know like you're a rock star well actually that was pretty impressive because

[29:21] again people were worried that if you you know the score was up in the display you know and so

[29:29] there was some really big concern that if you remove the score from the score display that

[29:34] your score would disappear and be lost forever and you lose your score and it would come back

[29:39] it would be different or you'd forget your score you know and so when you when they took away

[29:45] the score and did that countdown in there you know it was like people were oh my god you know

[29:49] where's the score you know it's gone you forgot it you know how do you remember how did you remember

[29:54] the score you know how could you do that you know oh my god so you didn't do any tricks like that

[30:01] of the tarry then um you know the the Atari games the the most exciting stuff I did was uh working

[30:10] with Steve Richie and uh I guess maybe the game time 2000 actually had two different bonuses you know

[30:18] it was you know kind of cool but um now I guess it was kind of a bizarre play field I had two

[30:24] complete you know sets of flippers and that was kind of interesting I didn't hear it play in the game

[30:30] but I had like two basically like two out holes and two like a complete double a play field pretty

[30:36] crazy as game well now this guy what Marty Ross and all he was the game designer for time

[30:43] so he he laid that one out he laid that game out you know then he quit you know like

[30:48] everybody kept quitting you know so he quit he had to get a game laid out and then he quit uh and

[30:55] then it was like you know this was like made my fourth week on the job it's like okay here's

[31:00] you're here's a new game you know like make it work you know do whatever the hell you want to do

[31:04] with it so you know we just you know me and some of the guys just kind of sat around and you know

[31:10] made up all the rules and made it happen you know and so it you know that was a fun project

[31:18] uh I guess the fun it I guess the most exciting things you know working with George Oppenheimer

[31:24] who was a did a lot a lot of the great Atari artwork of that era I mean the guy just made

[31:30] amazing artwork and had this kind of the Atari style of that era and they both the consumer packaging

[31:38] and the uh pinball art uh the guy was amazing and it was it was it was just wonderful the work of him

[31:45] well what happened to George Oppen you know George uh he continued working there and I think

[31:51] sadly he uh he died of cancer of like lung cancer I think uh you know maybe 20 years ago

[31:59] hmm maybe well maybe 25 years ago so now you you did airborne adventure and Superman was Steve

[32:06] Richie I mean is it how did you meet Steve I mean it was just purely through work right yeah so

[32:11] that I mean that that was you know in that really was was the highlight of my career in Atari um

[32:19] Steve was actually when I started he was just a guy in the prototype lab

[32:23] and he was just you know screwing post on games and screwing you know putting rubber on and adjusting

[32:30] flippers and you know that and first the Atari game was very notorious for unreliability

[32:38] and you know the ship would just fall apart um it was one of those things where you know no one

[32:43] but now he kind of looked at all the traditional pinball game to that era and you know this is just

[32:50] obviously this guy is in Chicago don't know what they're doing there a bunch of troglodites

[32:56] and we're going to redesign everything you know and obviously I think he had a great idea with

[33:01] with doing the solid state pinball and all the you know obviously all the um the atrix at that

[33:08] broad to pinball and all the uh game plan and special effects and everything but the he also

[33:15] uh kind of you know there was a redesign of every mechanical components in pinball

[33:21] and there were you know there was a lot of uh and when you start dealing mechanical things there's

[33:26] a lot of things and just kind of work over the years and you know you have an evolution and things

[33:31] are made a certain way because they they work you know and unless you're willing to you know

[33:39] test your components you know for millions of cycles and you know all that stuff I mean

[33:44] you're you're taking a big chance by redesigning all the mechanics of the pinball game and uh

[33:49] so regrettably you know in the you know kind of the the philosophy of the time that you know

[33:56] everything is new and everything old is stupid um the game was completely

[34:04] re-engineered mechanically and a lot of the stuff just wasn't very well tested wasn't very reliable

[34:09] not only that but parts were a major problem too like I know when I go to a fix in a tary game it's

[34:14] like oh my god I don't have any parts for them and they're all so so different than anything else

[34:20] you know like in the in the 70s got leaving Williams parts I mean they're not exactly interchangeable

[34:26] but you can usually they're interchangeable enough you know yeah yeah so um so yeah so that was

[34:35] just a huge debacle and Steve was you know one of those guys running around you know

[34:39] just trying to keep you know we had four or five test games out in location and just to keep

[34:43] those things running you know it was just uh a major effort and then they you know they had the

[34:49] boneheaded decision they put the electronic boards in the bottom of the cabinet

[34:53] yes so parts could fall off the play field and on to the electronics right and and so you know

[34:58] you had now he had these shady mechanical devices that were dropping screws and parts and ball bearings

[35:06] then you had the electronics sitting right under them to short out when the parts did fall down

[35:12] it was an nightmare but the games when they did work they made amazing amount of money and

[35:17] and just because of the cool new electronic sound and and uh the you know the cool effects are we

[35:23] able to throw into the program and then the white body uh a play field was really novel and had

[35:29] had you know he had to ramble out of stuff on it uh so Steve in in you know being Steve Richie

[35:37] in his spare time he would um he'd be laying out pinball play fields and so we would just kind

[35:44] of get together after hours and you know and have a couple of beers and uh and just hang out and you

[35:52] know and dream about the future of pinball and and Steve would be you know laying out these

[35:59] cool new designs you know trying all kinds of new stuff and um and you know just dreaming about

[36:06] you know getting his own game in production and eventually he he had dropped up an entire play field

[36:14] for the game Airborne Adventure and presented it to uh to management and uh

[36:21] uh and when they got approved for uh for production so Steve became you know from prototype uh

[36:28] builder to game designer what did you think of the game i loved it you know and i uh you know

[36:36] just jumped at the chance to uh program it so uh that was you know it was magical and uh

[36:44] you know we did a lot of work for the sounds and the effects and uh you had some of the first kind of

[36:52] combined effects where sounds and lights were synchronized and uh you know i thought that the game

[36:59] was with the blast so on did you have to do creating any like what you needed sound and i mean

[37:08] did every game have a new sound board and and new technology and sound no uh you know there was a

[37:14] standard does a sound synthesizer you know this hardware you know TPL synthesizer you know which

[37:21] had you know some programmability um you could you know have different uh waveforms different

[37:27] frequency tables so for that uh you know you would either programmer would uh you know create

[37:35] these different uh sounds and uh so you you know you'd you'd feed this synthesizer's different

[37:40] parameters and then get different sounds and so it was really fun to you know learn about

[37:46] the sounds and uh and and to just innovate and do new sounds at at this time nobody else was doing

[37:55] solid state sound everybody still had chimes and bells so that was one of the big big things

[38:00] the Atari game was it had these synthesized uh electronic sounds that were just you know really

[38:06] cool very spacey interview now how was Superman? Superman was you know just uh more the same um

[38:15] you know we uh put the uh you know see you put the play field together and you know we worked

[38:23] a lot that worked alongside of them and we you know did all kinds of interesting things with the

[38:28] sounds and the effects and um funny we actually put it out on on test we I was so you know we

[38:36] didn't know if we're going to get the Superman license or not it's actually the original test

[38:40] whitewood it was called rock star was gonna be you know that was like the code name and so we

[38:47] actually put a whitewood out on location you know which is the play for bear play field with no

[38:52] artwork on it whatsoever other than you know some lettering and uh on the lights to stand the

[39:00] k-warriors with shoot forms etc then uh actually it made a ton of money as a whiteboard on location

[39:06] so we knew we had a good game and uh um we always wanted to make it Superman um and it

[39:14] I guess either the odd thing was as both of us ended it had to quit actually before that game uh

[39:19] certainly Steve quid and I think I worked a little bit but I even I think I had left before the game

[39:24] actually had production because they had actually revamped their entire uh I think electronics and

[39:32] mechanical systems I think Superman went out with like linear flippers as opposed to

[39:38] their crazy rotary flippers and so they had Superman actually had a lot of you know with a pretty

[39:44] refined product that has a pretty good component. Did you now tell me about the Exodus from Atari

[39:52] and to Williams I mean Steve left first and then you followed? Yeah so he left in 78 and

[40:02] um basically uh I mean there was some uh different champ and uh I mean we could see that the uh

[40:09] you know we were you know we were really excited by our you know designs and concepts and

[40:14] the games would make tremendous money initially but then they'd always blow up and catch on fire

[40:19] fail and so the sales weren't as good as they could have been and and we could kind of see the whole

[40:26] the company was shifting obviously you know away from Pennball and you know really focusing

[40:33] on the video games which was whether their bread was buttered so kind of the writing was on the wall

[40:38] that uh Pennball was kind of on this way out. Did you want to work in the video game division of

[40:44] Atari? You know it's funny at that time video games were so simple I didn't really appeal to me

[40:54] you know like the pawn type games and even some of the early driving games and uh I mean the

[41:01] first game that really had any kind of appeal was breakout um and that was kind of it was a fairly

[41:07] fairly interesting game but again I mean it was just a bunch of bricks you know I mean uh

[41:13] it just didn't really have uh and it was kind of like a video game was something you'd play for

[41:18] you know 20 minutes than you were done you know so I was still you know very much at the Pennball and

[41:25] um there was uh the guy who was running Williams uh in Chicago Michael Stroll um somehow it got

[41:35] heard of Steve Richie and came out to to California to you know Silicon Valley to uh to recruit

[41:44] Steve Richie and uh so you know he offered him like you know three times what he was making at Atari

[41:53] and I was honey and uh I think Steve you know had a pretty uh had a pretty easy decision there.

[41:59] Now as far as pay it at Atari it was well first two-prong question was there pay equitable for the time

[42:08] and also did they give you like they sold a lot of a game did you get like a bonus or kickback?

[42:14] You know I don't think uh at least the Penn motherfucker we never got any bonuses um but uh I think

[42:21] there was some kind of bonus plan out there but it was it was kind of a catch 22 bonus plan you know

[42:27] it was like uh something like those Hollywood contracts where they give you a percentage of the

[42:31] profits or something and it was like no matter what you did the the game lost money you know

[42:38] what it was kind of thanks um but uh the uh you know the I think the real motivation uh I think

[42:46] going to Chicago was just the opportunity to really you know have a true Pennball factory supporting

[42:55] your designs you know and to I mean the guy said Chicago knew how to build Pennball games but they

[43:01] were they were pretty clueless as far as game design and like uh software and so it was uh

[43:09] you know it's natural for you know Steve and then later myself to to head out there you know just uh

[43:16] there was just such a need for for that kind of talent and there was such a great infrastructure

[43:22] for Pennball sorry and in Chicago I forget to ask you the Superman license who was uh I mean did

[43:29] did you have any involvement with actually getting that license was it a hard license again

[43:33] did you meet any of the personalities you know I didn't uh the you know that was all you know

[43:39] some guys some guys upstairs and uh the uh it was funny because Atari got sold to time Warner

[43:49] while I was there and time Warner I think owned DC Comics I believe and so it was like the same

[44:00] company actually owned it so you think it was be pretty easy but the way often these these big

[44:06] companies are run and it's by guess for the best really is um you know everything's kind of out

[44:12] to the highest bidder even if you know if you're in the end of the vision of time Warner you still have

[44:16] to bid higher for the Superman license and say got labor somebody else you know so there was

[44:23] it was kind of up but there was like you know some kind of negotiate you know eternal corporate

[44:27] negotiations about getting this title and so there's a lot of you know like would you get it

[44:32] we not get it you know even that even that's in the same company I mean it was crazy

[44:37] now when you got to Williams do you I mean do you remember your first week what was that like

[44:41] was it I mean was it like wow this is completely different work environment in the in the

[44:45] the uh corporate environment was I imagine it's got to be completely different than Atari

[44:51] um you know actually it wasn't uh it was a little more ordered but it was uh in that era it was

[45:00] very much a kind of a seat of your pants era and uh coming to Williams I remember I came in

[45:07] March of one year and you know you come from California which is beautiful green and warm and

[45:11] wonderful you come to Chicago and the snow is like piled up three feet high and everything is just

[45:21] gray and dirty and you know and greasy and you know you got to the Williams factory which was

[45:28] you know built in 1942 and and the walls are painted like the same green that they you know

[45:35] the one the government paid for the paint you know in 1943 you know for the wartime production

[45:41] that's paint still on the wall you know there were there's rats that have been in there since 1946

[45:47] you know and we were at the vending machines they they would never put any candy bars on the

[45:53] bottom two rows of the vending machine because the rats could get up and eat those you know so you

[45:59] have to you know they'd have to have them high up in the vending machine and uh you know it's just I

[46:04] think it was the most depressing place imaginable from you know certain aspects you know just

[46:12] they were just so bleak and and you know gray and cold and you know everything's old and rotting

[46:20] but you know actually the the the the wonderful part of it was you know just you know you're

[46:27] the you're the kid in the candy store and here you have this amazing factory you know that's

[46:32] going to build your games you know and uh so that was it was it was uh it was cool I mean

[46:38] just to see all the old guys on the line you know the guys who have been testing pinball games for

[46:44] you know 47 years and uh just all the uh kind of the spree decor and uh you know you'd get to know

[46:52] the the women that did all the soldering of the games and you know they could like have three

[46:58] conversations and being you know soldering 27 connectors behind their back and you know and

[47:04] think nothing other you know it was it was pretty amazing just the whole pinball factory uh

[47:11] they had to whatever your day had to walk through this huge factory to get to your office

[47:16] now um firepower was the first game you worked on at Williams and and this was a Steve Richie

[47:23] game did you come in right at the beginning or kind of in the middle of the project

[47:26] well actually that was the first game oh okay what was um the first game I worked on was a game

[47:33] called laser ball I don't know if you're very familiar with that title it was a white body uh

[47:39] it was a very osler game right yes I am familiar with it and uh and so that was uh

[47:47] I uh I had some fun with you know working the Williams had this this wonderful sounds

[47:54] synthesizing system which was just basically a microprocessor tied to a digital analog converter

[47:59] so you could write any program you you could think of to create sounds you know just amazing

[48:05] and uh so laser ball was kind of my chance to to um you know write some new sound programs and uh

[48:14] um so that you know I kind of introduce some really cool sounds in that in that game which

[48:20] um the sound system is amazing the entire sound system with uh the data for 32 sounds occupied

[48:27] 512 bytes of memory and uh it's pretty uh I'm pretty proud uh fitting all those sounds

[48:36] in the 512 bytes now that was the like the system 6 sound board that was in the lower cabinet that

[48:43] had the switch between one set of sounds and another set of sounds right right they had obviously

[48:48] they had the um they were concerned obviously when then the early days that uh some people wouldn't

[48:54] like the new electronics out so they had a switch you know that would give you chimes

[49:02] they're really stupid sounding you know computers synthesized chimes you know but I think

[49:06] anybody ever flipped that switch but you know we're just one of those management kind of things like

[49:10] oh my god those sounds are weird people want chimes so they had to switch I don't think

[49:18] it anybody ever threw the switch though no what they did is they hit the switch by accident

[49:22] then couldn't figure out why the game sounded like crap but uh so that was really fun so and laser

[49:30] ball kind of got that uh that whole thing going and you know learning the system learning how to

[49:34] program and okay we're gonna take a little break from our interview with Eugene Jarvis and we'll

[49:39] back right after this message hey George I just had to call and tell you about this really great

[49:47] magazine I got it's called the Ping Game Journal and it's the only magazine dedicated totally to

[49:52] pinball it's got great articles and interviews with designers and everything no George I won't

[49:58] loan you my copy who knows where you'll take it to you're gonna have to go to PingGameGenerale.com

[50:03] and get your own subscription with George the guy says that each issue will give mail whenever he

[50:08] feels like what's the deal with that all right George I gotta go got a call Elaine and tell her

[50:13] I can't believe how good this magazine okay we're back with Eugene Jarvis firepower was the

[50:21] what's my big project there and I guess really kind of why it came out there Steve uh

[50:28] had been Steve had just finished the game called Flash which was just an amazing amazing game I think

[50:34] to this day I think it was kind of the game that really um you know ignoring Atari and

[50:42] there early games which weren't really that refined. Flash really brought the electronic

[50:48] Iran for pinball in my mind um just with it's a fact flash lamps and sound effects uh

[50:57] yeah one of the first games was like a real background sound the background sound and the

[51:02] um the you know the modern style you know the stevery-che action type layout and stuff and

[51:12] you know it was it was cool it was amazing coming from the white body to the narrow body game and

[51:18] Steve you know how he was able to cram almost everything he crammed into a white body into a

[51:23] narrow body and the narrow body's played better too in my opinion. Yeah the narrow the the problem with

[51:29] the uh you know something that was that magic there with that dimension you know and the way

[51:35] it corresponds with the power on a flipper the problem is you bring a game too wide those wide shots

[51:41] are always on the end of the flipper and they're just kind of crappy shots just don't feel good so

[51:47] you really don't need anything more than a narrow body you know what all came well not what

[51:51] was it done and the narrow body was the the ideal uh you know kind of the golden mean and pinball design

[51:59] so Steve uh you know just you know with his layout of flash which I guess kind of stole a shot

[52:06] I think it was from 4 million BC or something the entry shot which kind of the cross-play field

[52:12] entry shot right right yeah which was awesome I love that I love that shot um and uh

[52:21] so that was you know it's just so excited to be working with Steve and and uh so anyway his

[52:25] programmer Randy Fiverr who did all this wonderful stuff um and of course Steve always would get

[52:31] the fight for this programmer's and you know he was very demanding and and programs would just

[52:37] get burnt out working on him and so Randy just you know packed his bags and said you know

[52:41] fuck you I'm out here and uh it's like freaked out like damn you know I need a programmer and

[52:48] so that's why he he called me to get me to Chicago but you know he was not ready with firepower

[52:55] so I did laser ball first and uh but uh I guess I did work on some sound effects on the game Gorgar

[53:04] which uh like the heartbeat of Gorgar and so that's uh I worked on that while Steve was finishing

[53:11] up the layout of the firepower but firepower we were so excited by firepower because um we wanted to

[53:17] bring back a multi-ball to pinball and you know that was just uh we had so much fun playing the old

[53:27] you know the bowl bally fireball games the I think was like wizard you know some of the

[53:33] classic uh bally um multi-ball tables from the uh they're early 70s yeah four million BC

[53:42] fireball and um uh nip it are the three you know the three classic multi-ball bally

[53:50] eums that people remember yeah who do I know uh now guy named Ted Zail did fireball

[53:58] and Ted unfortunately has long passed uh I don't know who did the other two I don't remember

[54:04] anyway those those are amazing you know inspirations and so that was the the idea of firepower was

[54:10] kind of to forget that back that excitement you know of multi-ball and uh back into pinball and

[54:19] and uh you know with the electronic age uh getting on the the late you know it just it just seemed

[54:25] like you know here was going to be a masterwork you know we could you know kind of synthesize the

[54:29] best of you know 20 you know 20 years of pinball and put it in the one game and uh there was uh

[54:39] I mean it sounds ridiculous these days and you think about it but I mean there was a lot of worry

[54:44] you know from a technical standpoint you know keep a track of the balls and and uh how do you know

[54:51] a lot of software issues when you when you when you have you know three balls out on the playfield

[54:56] and you're locking them and you know all this stuff and uh you have to construct a ball trough

[55:02] for multiple switches to sense on the balls so there's a lot of there's a lot of work on the

[55:08] software side which uh you know at the time was seemed like a lot of work and everything

[55:14] uh I mean today you know you know you're laughing you're laughing you're programming you know 10 minutes

[55:19] but um there's a big deal and uh um and we wanted to come over the way that multiple players could

[55:28] play the game and you know kind of share the locked balls and so we came with you know this all this

[55:35] all logic of you know what holds would be lit for locks and if a ball was already locked in the

[55:42] hole and you like some other hole and you know all that stuff and you know certain points you'd kick

[55:48] out a ball that was locked in a hole you know for the other player to play um you know very involved

[55:54] logic but allowed you know each player to have his own ball locks and and uh and play you know

[56:00] pretty much with that and a great too much with the other players. Yeah the one thing about um

[56:05] firepower was it was really the first game where um the the the the rules were really um for

[56:13] a multi ball game first multi ball game where the rules really really really made sense and they were

[56:20] simple um but difficult to achieve but they just the whole everything played together like even

[56:28] with flash you know the rules on flash are I you know they're either though they're not you know

[56:34] real deep they're they're a little funky you know what I mean they're not as refined as like

[56:38] firepower was like oh this is the way it's really supposed to be. Yeah firepower was it was just

[56:44] that the unity of the game right you know and then the absolute simplicity of it um where you just

[56:50] you knew what the hell you had to do and it looked easy there's the other thing now where you got

[56:56] those six targets right up front in the middle I mean shit you can't hit those you know the park

[57:01] and and uh but it was just you know obviously there was several you know just killer

[57:06] drain shots off that thing and you know in every table you'd have to you know learn you know

[57:12] one angle with drain you and what wouldn't and you know take the the safe shot and then try to hit

[57:18] the you know you could you'd like the the kicker um the save kicker you know if you hit a bank

[57:25] you know so you you wanted to you know get that thing with and um so it was uh you know the firepower

[57:33] thing was you know to get up high and get your multiplier going you know it had really great flow

[57:39] and he really wanted to um pretty much uh it made it for you to you know move the ball around the

[57:45] field and chewed almost every target on the game no but just the overriding challenge you know

[57:51] it was so interesting where you know pinball was really about the score you know in the in the old

[57:57] days pretty much and uh other than you know you try to get a special like if you think about the game

[58:04] kept it fantastic which is kind of cool where you pound away on those on the drop targets and then

[58:09] you pound away enough on them the specials would start lighting and you know it was pretty cool

[58:14] and so in some ways you could just play kept fantastic just trying to pound the targets and light

[58:18] the special and so firepower it was kind of like you pound the targets and then um you know light

[58:25] lock holes and you have to make the lock shots and you could get it all in there and get all three balls

[58:30] there boom you know the game which is explode um you know with the whole multi ball countdown and the

[58:37] sound effects and I mean it was just it was just amazing and you know the background sound would be

[58:42] would be getting up to some crazy high pitch and and finally when you got multi ball I mean it was

[58:47] just like you didn't really care what your score was or whether you had a replay or not or it was

[58:52] it was just you wanted to get multi ball you know and uh it was just all consuming goal and it

[58:58] was interesting there's a guy at uh Williams the time he was Ron Kraus and he called it the V ball

[59:05] and his his way of playing the game was he'd get multi ball and then he'd just like make a V

[59:09] with his hands and then and and just like let him all drain because I mean after you got

[59:15] everything's like don't have to come at it after that you know no wait I got a bone to pick

[59:21] with you though that the one thing that's weird about firepower and all the multi ball games of

[59:27] that era is that if you don't have all three balls in the ball trough you cannot start a game and

[59:34] this this must have just confused the crap out of operators because I know people that own the

[59:38] games you know they either either either one of the troughs which is broken or they they they

[59:43] you can't find the third ball and they they can't start a game and they're like oh they

[59:47] they keep turns on it works but I can't get at the start you know so you know I mean like newer

[59:52] games like 90s games if there's a ball missing eventually it'll let you play with you know a ball

[59:57] missing because it you know it doesn't want to hamper uh income as it may be but was that like a

[01:00:03] big decision in in the programming well I think it was yeah I think you know you were since this

[01:00:09] thing was so new you wanted to you know eliminate you know unknown conditions and uh

[01:00:18] see it was kind of like okay you got to have the fucking balls in the game and also part of the

[01:00:23] problem was you know operators which is put one ball in the game or something you know they wouldn't

[01:00:27] put three balls in the game you know so you wanted to force them to get three balls in the game you

[01:00:31] wanted to make sure the switches were working because if those switches weren't working the game

[01:00:36] was going to fuck up sooner or later anyway you know right and so it was kind of just forcing

[01:00:40] the operator to make sure the goddamn game was working you know and had three balls because it was

[01:00:46] just it was it wouldn't be you know it was just such a the only thing to do on fire power I mean

[01:00:52] the whole game is getting multiple you know right and if there aren't three balls and if one of the

[01:00:57] balls is stuck up on on a plastic somewhere you know you're not going to have very much fun playing

[01:01:04] it you know so it was kind of we are forcing the the game operator to at least have the game in some

[01:01:10] form of working order yeah I guess it's you it would make the programming a lot more involved if

[01:01:16] you if there was one ball missing you'd have to try and do everything in a two ball multi-ball and

[01:01:21] it would probably just make the programming that much more you know complicated yeah you just

[01:01:26] didn't want it you know we were we were having that era we were just having enough trouble just

[01:01:29] making the fuck if they weren't you know now on the the soundboard and the CPU on on that era of

[01:01:37] William system six was what a 6802 slash 6808 depending on you know what you got was that um how

[01:01:46] was the development platform at Williams compared to what you were doing in Tari not actually

[01:01:50] was fairly similar we use the the Motorola exercises which you know when I think about it today

[01:01:57] I mean there were there were pieces of crap I mean I mean these things would sell for like I mean

[01:02:03] it's hard to imagine but they would sell for like thirty thousand dollars you know in that I mean

[01:02:09] you think about thirty thousand dollars today to buy a computer with like a one-flabby disk I mean

[01:02:15] you you you gag you know but thirty thousand dollars in nineteen eighty is probably like three hundred

[01:02:21] thousand dollars today so imagine if you had to go to a computer store and buy a computer for three

[01:02:25] hundred thousand dollars you know I mean there's just it was ridiculously it was there was so

[01:02:30] expensive and they were you know just terrible unreliable you know horrible things to work with

[01:02:38] you know you you would you would rip your hair out on a daily basis you know just trying to get

[01:02:44] the thing to work you know so now after after you did firepower you you kind of went off with with

[01:02:51] Larry DeMar and did the is the Vid Kid thing right well now that was after firepower did defender

[01:02:59] at Williams well you did defender the video game not the pinball yeah okay yeah

[01:03:04] defender the video game and that after defender then Larry and I went off and did good kids now when

[01:03:09] you did defender at at Williams toward did they did you get any kind of bonus for sales or anything

[01:03:16] or were you just paid you know by hour or whatever well you know again in that your

[01:03:24] I think there you know there was not really there was no formal bonus plan and I think you know if you

[01:03:32] were really you know I think every now and then management might give you you know five or ten

[01:03:38] grand or something and then Steve Steve was kind of at the forefront of you know you know getting

[01:03:46] you know contracts and you know sticking up for his his rights and stuff and then he might have

[01:03:54] had some kind of bonus going but I think the rest of that I don't think we we had any kind of bonus

[01:03:59] with whoever anything formal at the end of the year we might get a little check something

[01:04:05] so now how now you and Larry are doing the Larry's obviously doing the pinball thing too

[01:04:10] who's coming up with like you know the blue flipper arm you know architecture and you know in the

[01:04:17] in the yellow flipper arm the green flipper arm is that you and Larry the this was I mean what

[01:04:27] here was well the yellow flipper arm was William system what system for I want to say then green

[01:04:35] flipper arm was what William system six like Gorgar and Flash and then the blue flipper arm is

[01:04:41] William system seven you know that's like their you know the system architecture and then you

[01:04:45] know you so you'd have the two system ROMs that were the same for every game within that system

[01:04:50] and then you'd have I see 14 which was the actual program ROM for the actual game right so

[01:04:57] I think the early ROM were actually they were they had been programmed by Paul the fault and

[01:05:06] Ron Krauss and perhaps man you fight for because the guy that did that William system three I just

[01:05:14] want to tear his head off because you know changing those dipswitches that changed yeah to change

[01:05:20] yeah to change the ball from three to five balls oh my god oh he was insane I mean they did the

[01:05:25] most horrible shit ever I can't imagine operators you know actually dealing with that that was

[01:05:32] you know the mind of a programmer you know certainly no human engineering there and I think when

[01:05:39] I came in which was you know they had been you know doing you know four or five games by the time

[01:05:44] I came in the we pretty much just you know the early games you know we pretty much just ignored all

[01:05:56] the code in the ROMs and just wrote everything you know in the in the game program the game game

[01:06:02] prompt you know it was pretty much dead code at that point other than you know the horrible test

[01:06:09] mode and things like that so they eventually Larry DeMarins will eventually rewrote all that stuff

[01:06:19] and you know kind of brought things you know in the in the ear of the black knight maybe in a few

[01:06:27] I think maybe the black knight started but I think the black knight started a new ear of some

[01:06:31] system or ROM or something and actually the stuff became you know usable at that point yeah black

[01:06:37] knight was William system seven which was certainly more usable system six was pretty good too

[01:06:42] you know the green rom the green flipper ROMs the blue flipper ROMs both the diagnostics were

[01:06:47] were pretty pretty darn usable and and made sense so you guys had to do all the pinball programming

[01:06:54] in a single 27 16 e-prom that must have been kind of challenging you know it was it was there was

[01:07:00] you know you were really working you know hard to conserve bytes and I mean there would be times

[01:07:08] when you know you'd be short you know three bytes you know and you'd go hunting through your

[01:07:12] program to find you know three bytes of code and often you introduce you know three new bugs by

[01:07:19] removing those three bytes it was it was very challenging you know it's crazy to imagine like

[01:07:26] today you know we're like the you know your cursor on on a PC is probably you know 32 kilobytes

[01:07:33] or something you know and and we were doing you know entire pinball programs and like two

[01:07:38] kilobytes I mean it's just a you can't even relate to it today I mean it seems like the amount of

[01:07:44] data is just so many skill that you hard to imagine anything could have done it all well that's

[01:07:49] why Windows runs like crap is because it takes 32k to move a cursor exactly you know and then

[01:07:56] I mean it's kind of sad I mean when you take you know some of the old computers of that era they

[01:08:01] would actually boot up faster than today's computers and the spreadsheets would run faster and

[01:08:06] you know just kind of scratch your head go wow that was one thing at one megahertz it has better

[01:08:11] performance than this computer I now have that's running at you know three gigahertz you know it's like

[01:08:16] are we making progress all right now tell me about the on defender I noticed that you said

[01:08:25] something about like you know well maybe this is more of a video game architecture question like

[01:08:31] when you're programming a video game in the defender stargate era and you know how did you guys

[01:08:38] determine the hardware to use like in pinball your hardware was pretty much static but in the video

[01:08:44] games you know you could get you know a new video processor or a new you know customized whatever

[01:08:50] to do to do something you know it seemed much more cutting edge yeah you know it I guess

[01:08:57] it's certainly pinball was very standardized and video could evolve a little faster but you

[01:09:02] kind of ended up it's interesting how you did end up kind of working a system even certainly

[01:09:08] in the in the early days of Williams video once we came up with a defender hardware system

[01:09:15] um that was really used that system was used for um refined a little bit but the basic system

[01:09:24] was very similar for defender stargate robotron jowth and sinister one of those games the systems

[01:09:32] were similar slightly different I think defender and stargate were almost the same but

[01:09:39] um when we designed the defender hardware um you know first of all I didn't know shit about

[01:09:46] video games you know being uh even though I had worked in the tutorial I never had program one

[01:09:52] and uh you know we were all pinball guys so um the approach was you know hey we need to

[01:10:02] crank out a game and you know you have like nine months and it's like okay well it was just throw

[01:10:06] a throw a processor out there try to get the most powerful processor we could at the time which

[01:10:13] was a 60809 and then throw you know a lot of memory out there and just have the processor

[01:10:21] basically move around the the bits on the screen and so basically the the Williams system which

[01:10:28] was amazingly primitive um kind of a brute force very primitive approach um was it just you know

[01:10:36] the processor was out there moving the sprites around the screen now were you like when you did this

[01:10:43] did you you weren't doing anything with sprites or anything it was just turn a pixel on and turn it

[01:10:48] off move it so there were I guess you could call them virtual sprites um but yeah so the you know

[01:10:55] basically the processor had to go out there and read right um every every bit on the screen right you

[01:11:02] had a you had like uh you know I had an apple too when I used to you know monkey around with it

[01:11:06] or whatever and you had a certain area in memory that was you know the the the text memory which

[01:11:12] was like 400 to seven ff and then you had you know the the high res menu memory which I don't know

[01:11:18] it was 4000 to seven fff and you know whatever you just would put a bite there and you know or change

[01:11:25] a bit and then change it back and is that basically what you were doing with the video games yeah

[01:11:30] what's defender with the Williams system um most of the other companies had more advanced hardware

[01:11:38] maybe less flexible but more advanced maybe in the sense of hardware sprites and you know more

[01:11:44] hardware uh graphical features um but kind of I guess the cooling about defender system being

[01:11:51] completely software driven system wasn't it allowed to a lot of to do all those amazing special

[01:11:57] effects that really made the game since the processor was moving every pixel you could have

[01:12:02] amazingly complicated uh you know explosions uh you know different special effects and uh so it

[01:12:12] was really really amazing uh you know we really razzle the death of the world with some really

[01:12:17] cool stuff that no one ever seen before now why did you and Larry decide to kind of kick off

[01:12:22] and and and kind of leave Williams and do this vid kids thing you know that was uh you know we were

[01:12:29] I guess uh you know the uh you know we thought you know defender had come and it was you know

[01:12:35] amazing success and you know we can see that uh obviously the future wasn't video at the at this

[01:12:44] point and that's where you know a lot of cool things were happening and we uh after defender

[01:12:51] became a big success Williams just started hiring you know hundreds of hundreds but tens

[01:12:56] probably hired 40 or 50 programmers you know they'd go out you know we had hired Jarvis uh

[01:13:02] DeMar and uh you know they did all these hit games mental just hire another 50 guys you know

[01:13:07] we'll get 50 hit games and so it became it started getting brave bureaucratic and you know

[01:13:13] there's all kinds of managers and politics and and this that the other and and uh so we just

[01:13:19] seen it and you know what um we could probably have a lot more fun and make a lot more money

[01:13:24] just going out of our own so that's what we did so now so did you buy one of these 30 000

[01:13:31] dollar development stations um as it turned out um you know we took off and then uh Williams

[01:13:39] called us up and hey you know why don't you guys do the next game on the outside

[01:13:44] so then we did uh Stargate on the outside and uh and so they actually gave us a 30 000 dollar

[01:13:52] development system and what was you mean you hauled one out of Williams and put it in your house

[01:13:56] yeah so we made Stargate was made and Larry had a two bedroom condo and the second bedroom

[01:14:04] was the development room and he worked during the night and I worked during the day on the same

[01:14:10] with 30 000 dollar computer so he had like two shifts so it's kind of like you know nowadays you

[01:14:16] know where they have guys that work in India and guys that work in America you know right at day

[01:14:20] and night we were kind of the vanguard of that you know now but this development system didn't

[01:14:25] have a color monitor hooked up to it so I mean how were you interfacing the development system to

[01:14:32] you know whatever the hardware that obviously the hardware was already set and stolen at that point

[01:14:37] right right right what was the same actually very similar system to what we use at the

[01:14:40] sorry where you was called an emulator where you basically the processor instead of a processor

[01:14:46] plugging into your hardware you remove the processor and plug in this cable that was then connected

[01:14:53] to the development station so the development computer was replaced the processor on the on the

[01:15:02] game board so you and Larry did Stargate and you did Robatron which were obviously huge hits for

[01:15:08] Williams yeah and financially did this really was this the right decision to do it outside of Williams

[01:15:16] yeah it was true it was I mean obviously you know when you did a hit game and you know you're

[01:15:22] getting some kind of royalty on it I mean it was amazing so we certainly you know did did

[01:15:29] very well there and had a lot of fun you know it's amazing how in that era you know you

[01:15:39] could have two or three designers and design a game that would gross you know $100 $200 million

[01:15:45] dollars and sales you look at the economics today and you would have maybe a hundred designers

[01:15:53] you know or 200 designers designing a game that will gross you know 50 million so it's like

[01:16:00] the profitability of video game design you know has really degraded over the last 30 years

[01:16:10] but were you and Larry smart enough to negotiate a you know a strong enough contract to really

[01:16:15] make this work we have we you know luckily we did we had some we had a great friend of ours was

[01:16:21] legal guys named Nate Dardick and he unfortunately was he didn't make too many friends at Williams

[01:16:29] but he was our friend so yeah so we had a great time and you know kind of worked ourselves

[01:16:39] to death though you know and and after doing Robatron and Stargate and then did another game called

[01:16:50] Blaster and I think a couple of their games we just kind of worked ourselves to death you know we

[01:16:55] had a company was like two or three people and you know it was finally you know I guess at

[01:17:00] the point where we you know we realized you know three guys cannot do a video game anymore you know

[01:17:06] the days of you know you know it just the amount of artwork the amount of production value

[01:17:14] we could even see it in that era in the in the mid 80s where the business was

[01:17:19] evolving and you know becoming more and more Hollywood more and more you know specialized

[01:17:27] you know you you cannot have I mean defender I did a lot of the I did a lot of the program a lot

[01:17:32] of the sound the way I work you know you you could you know everybody was getting specialized it

[01:17:39] was guys you did just artwork guys you did sounds guys did programs and became then each of those

[01:17:45] were specializing or a guy would do the the soundtrack the music another guy would do the sound

[01:17:51] effects you know another guy would do the speech you know a guy would do the you know the

[01:17:57] special effects programming another guy would do the physics another guy would do the

[01:18:02] artificial intelligence you know see you you creating you know millions and millions of specialized

[01:18:09] jobs you know

[01:18:11] each one had their own person

[01:18:13] and that's you know that's how that involved from two guys is adding a video game

[01:18:16] to

[01:18:17] hundred

[01:18:19] now when these companies go when they do this like these reissues like to the

[01:18:23] wind that the williams arcade class xd

[01:18:26] you know you guys are basically still making royalties off these games right

[01:18:30] we do you know i would now we get you know fifty bucks in the mail

[01:18:33] you know and uh... fifty bucks

[01:18:38] will be here there

[01:18:39] you know sometimes more

[01:18:40] uh... but uh...

[01:18:42] you know it's you know it is good uh... it's it's fine you know and uh...

[01:18:47] i'd love to see people feel playing the game you know

[01:18:51] you guys are freaking geniuses

[01:18:54] that whole bit kids thing you guys are that was like you and you guys were just

[01:18:58] thinking that one out good

[01:19:01] it was uh... you know it was it the fun thing is you know to see

[01:19:05] kids today you know a kid playing defender for the first time or

[01:19:08] playing over time

[01:19:10] you know just uh...

[01:19:12] you know it's in players that have been playing over time for twenty five years

[01:19:15] you know it's still into it

[01:19:18] you know it's uh...

[01:19:20] that is uh... it's a satisfying as a designer you know to

[01:19:24] to see the games live on

[01:19:26] and have new life and uh...

[01:19:29] now in the xbox live

[01:19:32] program uh...

[01:19:34] you can download the aeroportron to your you know xbox 360 and play there

[01:19:41] you know

[01:19:42] obviously with name out there

[01:19:46] you know what you're doing you can play you know any of you know

[01:19:49] hundreds of thousands of old games which is it's wonderful to see the old games

[01:19:54] uh... continue to be enjoyed and

[01:19:58] to uh... be uh...

[01:20:00] you know designers continue to be inspired to be inspired by some of the

[01:20:03] games

[01:20:04] well like speaking of maim how did you guys feel when you know there were

[01:20:08] you know people making these maim cabinets that you know would play you

[01:20:11] know

[01:20:12] hundreds of games including yours basically though without any sort of

[01:20:16] you know royalty free for you guys did you guys feel

[01:20:20] slighted at all with that

[01:20:21] you know i never really did uh...

[01:20:23] i'm sure

[01:20:25] you know some corporate teachers

[01:20:27] trying to figure out how to make money out of it but

[01:20:30] you know i i just you sometimes you just got to

[01:20:34] let things let the people have fun you know just like

[01:20:37] you know if you're

[01:20:39] you know public or people are you know download near to the south of

[01:20:43] the internet i mean

[01:20:45] you know what the hell can you do i mean

[01:20:47] you got making a few yourself and

[01:20:49] it's been people are you can just you know

[01:20:51] you know

[01:20:53] to carry bussings you know and uh... you mean you didn't mean Paul McCarty

[01:20:56] you meant metallic i think

[01:20:58] i'm okay with you right exactly

[01:20:59] paul did do anything but

[01:21:02] exactly you know and and and and you just got to uh...

[01:21:05] i mean i think i know

[01:21:06] you know i mean

[01:21:08] you gotta realize something's free

[01:21:11] there's gonna be a lot more distribution of something that's free and if

[01:21:14] there's something to pay for

[01:21:16] you know so are you really losing a sale

[01:21:19] you know i don't know

[01:21:20] i thought it's hard to say if you really lost a sale and the guy

[01:21:24] has a main cabinet has you know a hundred thousand games

[01:21:27] i mean

[01:21:29] would he have bought those hundred thousand games i don't think so if he had to

[01:21:32] pay you know

[01:21:33] be it maybe you know anything more than you know half a cent of peace

[01:21:36] you know

[01:21:38] side you know

[01:21:39] there at some point you know there's

[01:21:41] the money is just you know not really an issue and

[01:21:44] i think you have to look you know more about the game and

[01:21:48] having people enjoy your game

[01:21:50] having your game live on

[01:21:52] for future generations to to enjoy

[01:21:55] now in

[01:21:57] eighty four you came back to pinball and did the space shuttle was this at the

[01:22:01] time when you and larry were just

[01:22:03] burned out from the vids kids thing and you guys actually came back as

[01:22:05] Williams employees

[01:22:07] um... that you know it's interesting i went off to

[01:22:11] california to do

[01:22:13] the study of samford

[01:22:14] and uh...

[01:22:15] we've kind of just

[01:22:17] gave up on you know it's kind of

[01:22:19] mutually close down that kids and you know we had a great time and and we just

[01:22:23] we're just so burnt out and uh...

[01:22:25] larry

[01:22:28] uh... joke and a co

[01:22:30] you know it's an all three of us actually

[01:22:31] we're in some restaurant jacuzzi was grovers oyster bar and we were

[01:22:35] uh... which is no longer there but we were

[01:22:38] the classic you know trying out a napkin you know

[01:22:42] what we wanted to see in the next pinball game

[01:22:44] and uh...

[01:22:46] so

[01:22:47] space shuttle was born and

[01:22:50] and johen larry

[01:22:53] did the game at williams i

[01:22:56] i ended up going to california but i did the sound effects from california

[01:23:01] now i heard that that um...

[01:23:03] johen larry were like on in pat lawler were on like the same bowling team

[01:23:08] or something

[01:23:09] i think so yeah there was uh... it was called the ten hits

[01:23:12] and i had one of the shirts

[01:23:16] so you were not the bowling team

[01:23:18] i would you know i'm not a great baller i think uh... i went to a couple times

[01:23:22] and i think they stopped uh...

[01:23:24] they stopped telling me about when the next uh... match was

[01:23:30] now how was it working with chemical

[01:23:33] you know johen this was you know obviously you know before johen was uh...

[01:23:38] you know the same as gay today uh...

[01:23:40] i mean it was it was great i mean it's just a just a kid you know with with

[01:23:44] you know brimming full of

[01:23:46] of great ideas and then do she has a for pinball

[01:23:49] game the general

[01:23:51] so yeah it was it was really fun i mean i

[01:23:53] i might my involvement with the game was you know the initial you know helping

[01:23:58] you know kind of with the initial design and then and then doing the sounds

[01:24:02] you know obviously uh...

[01:24:04] uh... johen larry and i think that very uh... i think that came to yes yes

[01:24:08] uh... very you know i should you know that

[01:24:11] that the uh...

[01:24:12] you know they have a lifting on that game

[01:24:15] uh...

[01:24:16] but uh... that was you know it's great it's it's always a joy to work with

[01:24:19] johen now

[01:24:21] it so you went to stanford you were getting a master's right

[01:24:25] and um... but in eighty six you had the time to do work with richie again on

[01:24:30] high speed

[01:24:31] right and again i did the audio

[01:24:33] uh...

[01:24:34] and uh...

[01:24:36] you know worked on uh...

[01:24:37] i was you know very

[01:24:38] still very much interested in a lot of different uh... audio synthesizing

[01:24:43] programs and that was one of the last games that use the old uh... audio board

[01:24:48] and uh...

[01:24:51] and i was getting into some really crazy stuff like fm

[01:24:54] audio synthesis

[01:24:56] you know different strange both with modulation programs and stuff

[01:25:01] uh... it was just it was it was fun just to uh...

[01:25:05] i think i got like fifty bucks a thousand something

[01:25:08] side just you know going my uh...

[01:25:11] better of crank up the computer and just

[01:25:13] you know

[01:25:14] type in random numbers

[01:25:16] not so random numbers and just try to come up with

[01:25:19] you know a sound you know and maybe you know

[01:25:22] within a half an hour an hour i could pretty much come up with a pretty cool

[01:25:25] sound you know something like fifty bucks all right

[01:25:30] and a good day you might get you know you might come up with nine or ten good

[01:25:33] sounds you know

[01:25:35] and uh... you know after a couple weeks work you

[01:25:39] pretty much had the game now how were you developing the sound in california

[01:25:42] me what was your development station now

[01:25:45] so i had a uh...

[01:25:47] uh... what was known as funny lyric i went we

[01:25:50] when the four mits we

[01:25:52] bought this other you know it's a horrible luck with those more roses

[01:25:55] but others

[01:25:56] it was called the gimmicks g i m i x

[01:26:00] was a six-year-old nine

[01:26:02] computer and i remember it's funny everyone we were

[01:26:05] making a decision that it's just about this time the i b m p c came out

[01:26:10] you know we went out of computer star we look at the i b m p c and we've got

[01:26:13] man what a overpriced piece of shit you know

[01:26:17] the thing you know had

[01:26:19] you know it was so expensive

[01:26:21] the graphics were horrible

[01:26:23] you know who would ever buy this thing you know

[01:26:26] so we bought the gammace computer you know

[01:26:28] and uh...

[01:26:32] which was you know much nicer system and i ran for the model of six you know

[01:26:35] nine everything but uh...

[01:26:37] i guess uh... you know

[01:26:38] history has not uh...

[01:26:40] endorsed our choice computers

[01:26:43] but uh...

[01:26:44] it was a really reliable great system that uh... that we used to develop

[01:26:48] six you know six you know nine programs

[01:26:50] yeah i was you know i was an apple two guy and i remember when the uh...

[01:26:54] pc came out i thought the same thing as you

[01:26:57] and then a friend of mine

[01:26:58] he worked in california

[01:27:00] uh... at uh... at a uh... at a medical company

[01:27:03] he called me up and he goes

[01:27:04] had no this guy in japan he's making

[01:27:07] i b m p c motherboards he's gonna send me a couple you want one

[01:27:11] so like he says in one of these boards and i'm down by all the

[01:27:14] all the you know putting all the sockets on the board and you know we made up

[01:27:17] our own i b m

[01:27:19] and it turned out when it was also done a costus like a hundred dollars less than

[01:27:22] if we just went and bought the damn thing

[01:27:26] but it was cool

[01:27:27] he was fun it was something to do

[01:27:30] but you know what a piece of junk

[01:27:32] i know

[01:27:33] that it was uh... you know they had a segmented memory and everything i

[01:27:36] know that there

[01:27:38] it's amazing how certain things get to get to that i just more political you know

[01:27:42] well yeah because it yet the um...

[01:27:44] it was kind of like you know when they stayed with the the sixty eight oh nine

[01:27:48] you know with the w

[01:27:49] pc stuff

[01:27:50] you know the w pc pinball stuff in it's in you know you can only access the

[01:27:54] sixty-eighth only access

[01:27:56] you know sixty four k and anyone time so you got a you got a page memory

[01:28:00] everything i would have thought that

[01:28:02] you know that would have been a you know i'm kind of a big hassle to

[01:28:05] you're right with it

[01:28:06] you know i can't see it's a problem

[01:28:09] obviously the sixty thousand that was the uh...

[01:28:12] that was a three-professor which uh... you know apple and the pc that one

[01:28:16] and uh...

[01:28:18] you know with

[01:28:19] you know unfortunately i can one that were although maybe apples gonna

[01:28:23] and i went the

[01:28:25] maybe they're going to win the next round

[01:28:27] yeah you never know so now

[01:28:29] f fourteen time cat what was your involvement in that project

[01:28:32] so that game

[01:28:35] that's any of the history of opinion self

[01:28:38] so steve um...

[01:28:39] i had was working with my mar

[01:28:42] on high speed you know that was

[01:28:44] you know that after uh...

[01:28:46] steve

[01:28:47] cdc i've been out had been in california for a time and had a startup company

[01:28:51] working on video games

[01:28:54] and uh... came back to chicago in uh...

[01:28:58] eighty five eighty six time frame

[01:29:00] eighty five and wasn't uh...

[01:29:02] and you know very got back in the pimp on to the mario dot

[01:29:07] and did uh... you know they had collaborated on black night and other games

[01:29:12] so here they have to begin to do uh...

[01:29:14] high speed

[01:29:16] and uh...

[01:29:18] that was just you know high speed was kind of the game that you know

[01:29:22] made the exclamation point that you know like pinball is back

[01:29:26] i mean that was you know just huge runaway success

[01:29:30] kind of you know video was pretty much that at that point in the kind of

[01:29:33] like people sick video games

[01:29:36] and often like yeah you know that

[01:29:39] the uh...

[01:29:40] kind of the multi-level

[01:29:44] approach a story single-level but all the ramps and everything

[01:29:47] kind of high speed really introduce

[01:29:50] you know the first

[01:29:51] a new modern era of people

[01:29:54] which i guess we're still in today really

[01:29:56] starting with high speed

[01:29:59] and uh...

[01:30:02] and that was uh... you know after the mark displayed

[01:30:07] you know that all that cool stuff so uh...

[01:30:10] but you know as normally happens with steve richi

[01:30:15] he gets into fights with his programmers

[01:30:17] you know and that

[01:30:20] somehow larry and steve had a big falling out

[01:30:25] you know that i heard some room and some confrontation where you know

[01:30:29] larry was uh... steve or can fit as there somebody was like

[01:30:33] getting ready like to put the can bomb she and on to somebody and they were

[01:30:38] something she'll be better i think you want to show you that you can fit

[01:30:41] as that but

[01:30:43] what any rate uh...

[01:30:44] larry larry

[01:30:45] larry walked out

[01:30:46] and so against the people without a programmer you know and like and you know

[01:30:50] i need a programmer call you gene you know what the hell is he doing

[01:30:54] and uh... so again i get the call

[01:30:58] and uh... and i said i would tell you know i mean i was uh... finishing up

[01:31:02] at the time for it and i was like hey come on out to uh...

[01:31:06] scog on to another couple games like okay

[01:31:08] and i was uh...

[01:31:11] uh...

[01:31:12] i guess but i guess actually maybe that was a way to have a new uh...

[01:31:16] i guess i had already been coming out to jacquo to do a new video game

[01:31:19] which was a game dark

[01:31:21] and i guess somehow

[01:31:23] during that

[01:31:26] early days the whole

[01:31:28] thing came down and was like okay you gene you know

[01:31:32] take off four months and you know do

[01:31:35] f-14 contact with the first year and you know then get back to the video

[01:31:40] so

[01:31:41] that was uh... so i kind of was the you know

[01:31:44] the call went out and you know i jumped back in the phone

[01:31:48] so you did more than the sound for f-14 and i did the

[01:31:52] sound you know the program of sound all of you know

[01:31:55] most of the stuff i the uh...

[01:31:57] interesting enough my

[01:31:59] uh... junior programmer help me out there kid by the end of the end

[01:32:03] who ended up you know doing more combat but those games

[01:32:07] so i actually i had the pleasure working with at the end of his first project

[01:32:12] you was like my you know a fixed man

[01:32:14] and uh... he was my crutch player programmer

[01:32:19] now how much different was it doing f-14 tomcat then doing you know like you

[01:32:24] know the the last game that you really did all the guts for was firepower

[01:32:27] yeah well you know it was uh...

[01:32:30] you know what what different really

[01:32:33] you know was uh... you had more memory had to do more stuff

[01:32:37] uh... obviously you know the play for the most sophisticated uh...

[01:32:42] you know things had involved

[01:32:44] uh... but it was pretty much still the same old you know

[01:32:47] same old thing you know and uh...

[01:32:49] the operating system was you know actually much more refined and there was a

[01:32:53] lot of you know good stuff going on the hardware

[01:32:56] uh... everything but uh... it was pretty much the same old pinball from

[01:33:01] and uh... but it was really good

[01:33:04] it's funny how that project was uh...

[01:33:08] you know it was kind of the kitchen sink project you know uh...

[01:33:12] like well we've done three ball multi-value let's do four ball multi-ball you know

[01:33:16] we we had one spinning light on top of high speed you know let's have three

[01:33:21] spinning lights on this game you know and

[01:33:23] and so it was just like we just turned the volume i mean this was

[01:33:27] volume was on twelve for this game you know

[01:33:30] right that's typical steve richie again too

[01:33:32] and uh...

[01:33:34] you know and uh...

[01:33:36] it was uh... you know it was a whirlwind project and he's Steve i think it's been

[01:33:40] a long time struggling with the playfield

[01:33:42] which he always he always did i mean he's always trying to

[01:33:47] cram so much stuff and you know be open to so many ideas

[01:33:52] you know that

[01:33:53] he you know can end up being a look at his

[01:33:56] drafting board and you know it's like

[01:33:59] they can be months and weeks he puts the fund the races and you know like you

[01:34:03] come back to the monthly like

[01:34:05] what happened to nothing here

[01:34:07] but uh... you know after many many long hours of

[01:34:11] engineering and

[01:34:12] you know working on the new mechanical devices for the game which uh...

[01:34:16] it's like the vertical ball popper

[01:34:19] think that shot the ball up to the ramping system and the

[01:34:23] diverters to divert the ball and the

[01:34:27] that uh... the

[01:34:29] kicker that would kick back

[01:34:32] the general young off the kicker

[01:34:35] and uh...

[01:34:36] you know some of the the the things are the

[01:34:38] you know have a four ball ball trough you know three

[01:34:43] you know just not has a crazy little thanks

[01:34:46] to uh...

[01:34:48] make the game work and uh...

[01:34:51] so you know it was it was a uh... you know steve struggle and the time for

[01:34:55] quite a long time and uh...

[01:34:57] uh... then you know everything just kind of coalesced in the last you know

[01:35:00] three or four months

[01:35:02] uh...

[01:35:03] you know just uh... the south of the great uh...

[01:35:07] actually uh... we had Chris granner

[01:35:11] uh... f-14 used uh... I guess I guess that was the first machine to use a new

[01:35:17] Yamaha sound system

[01:35:19] and uh...

[01:35:21] uh...

[01:35:22] so then we uh...

[01:35:24] we got a guy guy

[01:35:25] i think f-14 was before tenbot right

[01:35:29] yes it was

[01:35:30] and so Chris granner

[01:35:32] you sound guy

[01:35:34] came on to do all the music and facts

[01:35:37] and uh... it's amazing stuff

[01:35:40] still use some of the old sound effects from

[01:35:44] my library

[01:35:46] and uh... but he brought in all this new Yamaha effects and great new

[01:35:53] music which i guess kind of

[01:35:55] high speed was the first

[01:35:58] Williams game that had music for background

[01:36:03] maybe the first industry game had a musical background that's it

[01:36:07] and then

[01:36:09] f-14 again had a wonderful musical

[01:36:13] background

[01:36:15] and uh... several things

[01:36:18] uh... wonderful stuff

[01:36:21] so is there any chance you're gonna come back and do any pinball stuff in the future

[01:36:25] you know i always uh...

[01:36:28] i always uh...

[01:36:30] you know i'm always nostalgic you know i was like god damn it you know i'll go down

[01:36:34] to stern and play them latest game ago

[01:36:36] you know i go wow it's really cool but why didn't you visit

[01:36:39] you know damn it if i was doing this i would do that

[01:36:42] you know and i'd you know

[01:36:44] so it's like and you really can't say much unless you're willing to go in there

[01:36:47] and forget to do it

[01:36:51] but you know i'm threatening

[01:36:52] i'm always threatening to come back and do a game so

[01:36:55] i'm sure sooner or later i'll have to come back and do a game and actually

[01:36:58] be fun to do a game with you but you made something

[01:37:02] but i would have been a lot of people

[01:37:04] well cool any other pinball stories that i forgot to ask you about that you
