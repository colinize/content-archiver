[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:20] Today on Topcast we've got a special interview with somebody that worked at Williams from 1954

[00:26] up to the mid 1970s and then he worked at Balley from the mid 70s to the mid 80s and he has

[00:32] designed a total of 65 different games for Williams from 1962 to 1975.

[00:38] So he's a game designer and he was also president of the pinball department at Balley from 1975 to 1985.

[00:46] So I'd like to welcome Norm Clark of Williams and of Balley to Topcast today for an interview.

[01:00] Now Norm has a medical condition that makes him very hard to understand and very difficult to record

[01:07] on the telephone. I had some problems especially in the first two or three minutes of the interview.

[01:13] I ask you just to bear with me. It gets much better after that initial two or three minutes

[01:19] and the recording cleans up a lot. So I'd like to welcome Norm Clark to Topcast tonight and we're

[01:25] going to give him a call right now.

[01:37] Norm this is this is Clay how you feeling today you okay?

[01:40] Not bad.

[01:41] Okay.

[01:54] You're doing fine Norm I really appreciate you talking to us.

[01:58] So tell me about your first memories of pinball and how you got involved into the pinball industry.

[02:05] Well that was kind of a strange situation. I was in electronics and friend of mine also

[02:18] was in electronics and he's voice was for Williams and he used to go over there and

[02:28] Harry Williams asked him what he do come work for him and introduce electronics into pinball industry.

[02:43] So he went over there and he brought his assistant Michael over and that's how I got his

[02:58] assistant ball industry. There's nothing about this ball.

[03:03] So what year do you think that was?

[03:08] Okay and so did Williams Harry Williams hire you right then?

[03:13] Yes right right then he hired me and of course back in those days we weren't into the chips

[03:24] as we are today we waxed two and the idea of both controlling the game with the

[03:37] most prominent wasn't feasible. So my friend left one to go on how far the

[03:49] speed to go although I was in fast-quaking bar to pinball and I stayed and at that time I was in

[04:03] the engineering department as a technician doing putting the games together, watering them and

[04:13] doing some of the circuit games and at that time we had Harry meds as the designer and

[04:26] the Harry retired from Williams went to Florida left him left we have brought high

[04:40] and dry for his design. Sam Stern was the president and co-earned order of the

[04:53] of Williams so he hired Steve Corbyn and the horse that made

[05:05] Sam Stern a little nervous having only one designer and no backup.

[05:15] So he asked me to carve my hand at the designing. The first game I decided was Kingpin

[05:27] back in 1961 and it produced early 1962 and from that time on I was a designer at Williams.

[05:44] I stayed at Williams to 1975 and those all had been asked for me to go to Bally.

[05:55] So eventually I ran to the point to Bally.

[06:01] So on your first game the Kingpin in 1962 were you were you pretty happy with that design when it

[06:08] came out I mean were you were you pretty proud of that game? Yeah it was the first first game

[06:14] but I had to do it. I made a couple of whitewoods prior to Kingpin and they were too advanced

[06:28] in the way pins were growing at that time so I landed up making Kingpin which became

[06:40] pretty good game and that's really made me very happy.

[06:49] How did you get along well with Steve Cordack?

[06:52] I always feel outside by side at the end of the year.

[06:57] I got along very well with him and never had any problems.

[07:05] So how did you guys figure out like did you alternate like you do a game one month and he would

[07:10] do a game the next month? We both do it in the game. So he's his room with right next to mine.

[07:22] And we both were at the beginning games and if he would ask me to play his game and I would ask him to play my

[07:39] game and that's where it went. No problem we both worked together. So I'm going to start.

[07:50] Did you guys ever collaborate on a game you know where it was like both of you designed a game

[07:56] or did it not work that way? He designed his game and I designed one that's the way it went.

[08:04] When he started he had a good game that was produced and I was the same with me.

[08:11] The two kept playing games with games.

[08:22] Now the one game that you did that's really kind of famous from that era is Molen Rouge.

[08:28] Tell me about how you came up with that idea with like the painting in the background and how

[08:34] it's backlit. Actually the idea of the background with the back glass was actually Harry William.

[08:47] He just because he did the game for a couple years prior to that and he used that that type of meal.

[08:57] That actually was his. This idea is backlit.

[09:05] Now did you like doing single player or multiplayer or add-a-balls or did it not matter to you?

[09:13] I did both of them all of them and it did not matter to me as long as the game was accepted.

[09:24] Now when you designed a game did you have artwork in mind for it or was that always the artwork

[09:33] people that came up with that idea? Well first of all years ago add posters is all the artwork.

[09:41] We never had an art department. The art department came much later in the year.

[09:54] Add posters we treat our art posters basically over one score and do the artwork and they

[10:02] bring it in and show it to us. If there is something we want to change they will take it back

[10:11] and re-read the minute. But basically the artworks were blocked off the art poster.

[10:21] Now in 1966 you did a game called Full House and it had score reels on the play field. Was that your idea?

[10:32] Yes. That cost you another game. I put the score reels right in a slot machine on the play field.

[10:45] That was fine. That's a pretty neat idea. It is very much slot machine-ish.

[10:55] Well in Europe that was accepted in the United States I had a change to symbol away from a slot machine

[11:08] but keeping the score reels. There was a difference in the artwork on the tapes on the

[11:20] score and playing the state and different for you.

[11:26] Now you also did a pair of games the Magic City and the Magic City. That was a pretty well-received

[11:37] game. Do you have any stories associated with the design of that game?

[11:41] Well there was one big story on the back glass. I had a colored wheel turn around and changing

[11:58] the colors in the back. Somebody in the waves at that time wanted to hire and send it

[12:10] casting it towards to put the color wheel in and he got Harry

[12:40] off and he was the best.

[12:45] Yeah they were both very well received. Another kind of unusual game at least by artwork design

[12:53] would be Eager Beaver in 1965. Whose idea wasn't to come up with that theme?

[12:58] Well in most of the king games the designer came up with the name and basically the theme.

[13:15] The artwork of course was done by Ed Poser and the space of the artwork and

[13:24] we would take changes or rules. But we most of the games Steve Rhyde did, we named the game

[13:40] or else we had people in Williams in the artworks coming and playing the game and some of them

[13:49] suggested the same but by all the reason we named the game.

[13:59] Tell me about Apollo and Lunar Shot. Those were two games of course. Apollo was the replay and Lunar Shot

[14:05] was the Attable and those were again games that were very well designed and very well received

[14:13] with back glass animation and people to this day. I mean they loved those that pair of games.

[14:20] Of course, it was interesting that I believe we actually it was performed from first to work with them in 1993 exactly 6 minutes and

[14:39] and the bit is the magic series of artworks. Okay we smile we got the time to embrace the later picture, maybe

[14:45] Rickey Cr Azashari as a lot of time but this is before we started to thwart it because while these are

[14:46] game, but I forget along with stuff now anyway.

[14:53] Whose idea was it to use that back glass animation in those two games?

[14:58] It's far scoring and the animation, it was our idea.

[15:06] The artwork was done around the work we did at the game.

[15:14] In other words, if we have a scoring thing or a ball of thing in the artwork we're starting around with that.

[15:31] Now another game you did in 1969 was called Gridiron, which was a pitch and bat football game.

[15:39] Any information about that game you can tell us about?

[15:46] The game is already called a game by memory.

[15:53] Was that the game with the target?

[16:01] It was set up as a football field and you would basically, it was a pitch and bat where the ball would come out the center and you'd kick it with a baseball style bat to get so many yards to get touchdowns.

[16:17] That was done with the baseball team only in Gridiron, the football rather baseball.

[16:31] I did it and made a football game.

[16:40] How did you think that came out?

[16:44] Pretty well, so pretty good.

[16:51] I recall I think it was Louis Goldberg who was asking me for quite some time of the building a game on football.

[17:08] I think that was the reason why I did it.

[17:13] Now you started working with one of the artists at artworks, his name was Christian Marsh.

[17:23] He did what's known as that pointy style artwork. What did you think of that style of artwork on your games?

[17:31] I think it is a point of view game by games and I was very pleased with the artwork.

[17:41] Spanish eyes for some other ones was done by first of all was done by Joe Vasek who used the work for ad poster.

[17:56] He finished the artwork for we were happy with it or something and something else you did it.

[18:10] Did you have a preference as far as the artwork on your game being the Christian Marsh pointy style people or the more cartoonish style or the more realistic style or did you have a preference?

[18:25] Not really. As time went on we started going towards the abstract part of art and it seemed to take so I was happy with it all.

[18:50] I think that's the kind of artwork that pointy people are working either love it or you don't. Some people really like it and some people really don't.

[19:00] It doesn't seem to be much middle ground on that artwork.

[19:10] What did you think of the abstract or more realistic artwork?

[19:16] That was real popular during the 1970s that modernistic artwork.

[19:24] As you went back in the late 1950s it was more or less the kids' style artwork.

[19:36] Tell me about travel time and that was a single player machine that came out in 1973 and it was basically a time game.

[19:50] Tell me about your design philosophy and thinking that was going on for that game.

[19:55] I was looking for some other way of producing a game like the certain territories that would allow replays.

[20:13] In other words you can get those add-ons for easily for New York. There were several places that you couldn't sell a replay game.

[20:28] I got the idea of a game with time and it would be acceptable so that's why travel time was made.

[20:44] How was it received?

[20:47] It was a few more times.

[20:50] How was it received by your customers?

[20:54] It was a certain location, it was a two-bath.

[21:04] It was a certain area.

[21:12] It wasn't something that would have taken life like I had hoped.

[21:20] One game that to me is a true classic that you designed was OXO which is basically a tic-tac-toach style theme on the playboard.

[21:33] It's really a cool game to play. Tell me about designing that game.

[21:39] It was special, it was really easy.

[21:43] Was it a hard design electronically?

[21:45] It was not any harder than the other game.

[21:51] The whole package is really interesting with the bluish greenish colors and the artwork and the fluorescent colors.

[22:03] The whole game came together really, really well. At the time I bet you were pretty proud of that game.

[22:09] Yes, I thought it was a better game.

[22:14] Now how did you feel about Strato Flight and Super Flight?

[22:18] Nothing special, but it was a very tough game.

[22:25] Now when you designed a game, did you have to design the electronics circuit too?

[22:31] Yes, I thought when we built the entire game, not by the art, but by the art, we were doing today.

[22:40] We put the whole thing together.

[22:43] I did the circuit for the whitewood and we built the whole game ourselves.

[22:54] When I say a one wood, we built a snow without any artwork.

[23:02] We put together many changes and played this continuously until we were done for a few of them.

[23:14] Now how would you, when you were done with the game and its whitewood, how would you go about testing it?

[23:21] Would you have like, somebody play it like hundreds of times, seeing how many replays or high scores and stuff like that you would get?

[23:29] We have people in the artworks, so on and so forth.

[23:36] After we were satisfied with the game, we have people coming in from the artworks and playing the game.

[23:48] Of course, we were always concerned with the time of it would take the play to game, so that the game did its play for half an hour, not making any money.

[24:04] So that was an important thing.

[24:08] And also that the balance of replays are accepted by things like that.

[24:18] So naturally we have played the game to the satisfaction of those conditions.

[24:32] Now, when did you have, get any influence from at this time, you know, you're at Williams, like did you see the valley and got-leab games that were being made at the time?

[24:46] And did they influence your design decisions at all?

[24:50] When the drop-leab would have a test game on location, well we would go and take a wheelchair, but basically we would see if there's anything different.

[25:11] We'd find out to copy anything that another non-facture did.

[25:21] So they didn't really have any influence, but you guys were just curious, huh?

[25:26] Yes, we'd go and see how the game was and what we wanted to do on the game.

[25:36] So that was the new feature, like a great feature, we would be tempted to do something about it.

[25:52] Normally, that's both the side, if somebody in San Francisco came over the game, we would go there to see it.

[26:10] Again, we basically would try and copy anything.

[26:22] When you started working at Williams in 1954, how old were you?

[26:30] About 32.

[26:33] What type of stuff did you do for a living before that?

[26:37] I was in the electronics.

[26:41] I worked for a housing faster radio to sit there working on single-sized-bound receivers and stuff like that.

[26:53] Now tell me about how you changed and went from Williams over to Valley. How did that happen?

[27:03] Well, Bill Dallow, who was chairman of the board, Valley, was interested in me and he had asked me several times about Jordan Dallow,

[27:21] and I had dinner with him and so on and so forth.

[27:29] In 1975, they called six of us into Seabird and retined contracts with Seabird to stay at Williams.

[27:45] I observed the apple part with Tam Sir.

[27:53] Bill finally made me a gig and another offer and I said, if I don't get called in to sign a contract with Williams, I said, such a date I would join him.

[28:17] That's what happens.

[29:17] He came to me and he said, not you, not you, not you, not you, not you, yes.

[29:27] That's it. Tam Sir was a great guy.

[29:35] I like him and he liked me but things didn't work out at the end. I joined the battle.

[29:45] When you went to Valley, was it a corporate shock? Was it a big difference in the corporate environment and the working environment or was it pretty much the same as Williams?

[29:59] When I went to Valley, I went to the head of the paintball department and I was made eventually a little walk over there on a paintball expressway, a president of the paintball division.

[30:17] I didn't actually sit down and design the gate there. I was head of the department.

[30:29] So who were the designers that were working for you at Valley at that time?

[30:35] Well, the gym path is great. Make George Christian actually George, I hired him at Williams and after I went to Valley, I hired him to cut the bow.

[30:55] Gary Geaton, great for making and the gym path at George Christian.

[31:03] Now at the time Valley had their own art department. Did that make things easier for your pinball people?

[31:11] Well, Valley had their own art department. Yes. It didn't make things any easier.

[31:21] I mean, you were working more closely with the artists I would think because they're all in the same building, right? That didn't make the games maybe, I don't know, maybe linked better to the artwork?

[31:37] Well, at Valley, you went in a lot with the personnel, the voice, evil, the QF, the stuff like that.

[31:55] And they had a big input on the artwork that was done.

[32:05] Now, when on some of the games like eight ball deluxe and kiss and space invaders and silver ball, Mania, did you have any involvement in those games?

[32:18] Because they have a very, the play fields kind of have a norm Clarkish feel to them as far as the shots and the layout.

[32:26] Well, as far as eight ball deluxe, I had quite a bit of input with George because I brought George over to Valley.

[32:38] And of course, I had done the eight ball the act Williams.

[32:47] And so I had, for the bit of input there, the other games, I had a little bit of input, there's a broken over with the design.

[33:02] The vice of some of the I did like a broken system, eight ball, once more for the games that had a course all the games that George would do I had input.

[33:18] But it became so much so very, a little more, because he was new in the design.

[33:26] Did you like working at at Valley more than you liked working at Williams?

[33:34] So I felt more home designing games that we had to tell the truth.

[33:43] What I liked about it, it really treated me well.

[33:46] So, the thing is, what I didn't design any of the games, I just always see the game.

[33:54] So you like to have your hand in the design, in the design aspect, it was more fun for you.

[34:01] Yeah, more rewarding in that sense.

[34:08] Now George Christian was the guy that you mentored.

[34:14] Now where did you get him from? Where did you bring him in to Valley?

[34:20] Well, when he was, well, I was at Williams. His name actually, I don't know, took a while I could say.

[34:29] His name was George Zazizza, if he changed his name.

[34:35] And he came into Williams as a technician, putting the games, putting the world together.

[34:47] After we designed the game, we did the circuitry.

[34:51] George and a couple other people looked together.

[34:56] When I left Williams to went to Valley, he called me and wanted to come to Valley with me.

[35:08] And I hired him.

[35:11] I hired him at Williams and I hired him at Valley.

[35:16] Why did he change his name?

[35:20] Well, people from Iran were one of those places.

[35:26] And I think that had something to do with it, but he changed his name.

[35:38] Now, how did you feel about the transition from electro-mechanical games to solid state games?

[35:46] Well, the solid state games were, the solid state was designed by, it was a different department.

[36:00] So, when we finished with the game, we reduced that department to put it into design together.

[36:14] And then, after that, we had the party department.

[36:19] When you were at Williams, were they starting to work on solid state games then?

[36:26] We were playing around with it.

[36:30] Yes, but they weren't producing solid state.

[36:37] Now, when you went over to Valley, though, did they pretty much have their system already kind of designed?

[36:44] Pretty much so, they were just starting to come up with it.

[36:51] It was in the system.

[36:57] How did you feel about the whole solid state thing compared to the electro-mechanical?

[37:03] Did you like electro-mechanical better or did you like solid state better?

[37:08] Well, you can do a lot more with solid state.

[37:13] It's easier to change things and you can do a lot more with solid state.

[37:22] For instance, with the 8 ball games, well, first of all, the 8th, first 8 ball games were 2 players.

[37:31] We helped with that because I designed the, I came up with the, the split banks.

[37:40] So, we had never, between first and second players, which was the only way we could do it with this.

[37:52] But I came up with the split banks.

[37:57] We'd have a reset for the first player, the reset for the second player.

[38:04] So, the really bank worked for both of us.

[38:09] Whereas prior to that, he had one, one reset for the bank.

[38:17] You couldn't, you couldn't do what the school were doing.

[38:21] And there was the use of the split banks for 2 players.

[38:28] But on the top, they keep about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 players, but they're not.

[38:37] They didn't need a bank.

[38:40] The artwork on 8 ball kind of had a, a happy day's faunzy type character on the back glass.

[38:48] Was there any legal ramifications from the TV show?

[38:54] So, the, the part that looked similar was a cousin and something else, one of the artists.

[39:06] So, we got away with it.

[39:09] Did they try and, did anybody try and sue you over that artwork?

[39:13] No, to write, no. I don't think we have any problem.

[39:17] The artist didn't really, it wasn't intended to have a kind of happy days of, what kind of license looked to it.

[39:27] It's just kind of how it worked out.

[39:29] Well, like I say, the guy was a cousin and something.

[39:37] It wasn't known, tried to call for calls and something like that.

[39:42] So, legally, he could prove what he did, but I never heard of any repercussions.

[39:54] Now, how long did you stay at Valley for?

[39:59] From 75 to 85, 10 years.

[40:06] In what major decided to get out of Valley in 1985?

[40:12] Well, the prior of ours had come to me and asked me about starting up with Timville department at this class.

[40:24] There were certain reasons why I was tempted.

[40:32] So, we set up a group, set up a slip of the loop.

[40:39] And of course, the Timville company, which at that time was for you, Scott Lee and Valley.

[40:52] They had their own design department, so they worked to, it tempted to boil sweat.

[41:04] And we were tempted to go to company in Europe to design games where they want to get into design.

[41:19] But our price and what they want to pay, it won't go.

[41:27] And what was the name of this company?

[41:36] Oh, okay.

[41:41] Okay.

[41:45] So, how did you feel about the video games?

[41:57] Because when you were at Valley, you had a lot of competition with video games at the time in the early 80s.

[42:02] How did you feel about that?

[42:10] The Timville industry was going a little bit too far, a little bit over producing, over kind of stuff.

[42:24] The games that were put in everything in both the kitchen and things.

[42:30] And my thought was that they were forcing them to end up the market.

[42:38] And I think they actually did.

[42:42] The video games were taking hold pretty well.

[42:50] And what about the Chimville games?

[42:55] Apparently we tried putting 50 cents of playing.

[43:01] But that was the working tool.

[43:05] And we were putting so much in into the games that did almost...

[43:12] We were going to pay a split for the Timvigames for the video games that they played.

[43:19] So, personally, I think they pushed themselves out of the market by putting too much junk in the Timvigames.

[43:32] So, at the time you're saying that video games sold brand new for more money than pinball machines?

[43:40] What we came over with Timville machines with ramps all over the place,

[43:48] built some special features.

[43:53] That's the point.

[43:57] What we used to do is we had to keep so many realies that go over so much.

[44:09] To keep the price down.

[44:13] But eventually they ran the ramps with the price going sky high of the Timvigames.

[44:22] And you could make good people wouldn't take that much surprising games.

[44:28] Was there any particular game in your history at Williams or Valley that you were associated with that you were really, really proud of?

[44:35] Like, you know, the pinnacle as far as your concern of your pinball work?

[44:41] Well, April was one of them.

[44:46] The Valley or Williams, April?

[44:50] Well, at Williams, at Valley, April the last did very well.

[44:57] It was a game for the year, a couple of years ago.

[45:02] April was one of them.

[45:09] A go-go was one of them.

[45:13] It did very, very well in Europe as well as in the States.

[45:19] And that's when I built the game with the experience in the play-gun.

[45:31] That did very well.

[45:34] Off-road was a good game.

[45:37] Well, undergain.

[45:39] Was there anybody at either of the two companies that you especially like to work with in regards to design or any aspect of pinball?

[45:50] Normally, at Williams where I was designing, either Steve or I, we never went to other people.

[46:03] And that's to help us with ideas and design.

[46:09] We design the game.

[46:11] We have people in the office coming up to play.

[46:16] Take notice of their family.

[46:19] How specific we have how the games came to be.

[46:23] Was there any particular feature that you really liked in the game?

[46:28] Like, a lot of your games had a really tight nest, especially your Williams games.

[46:32] Well, basically, a lot of your Williams games had a really tight nest of like five pop bumpers.

[46:38] Where the ball would get in there and I mean it would just kick all around all over the place.

[46:42] That was kind of a norm Clark signature feature.

[46:47] Was there anything else that you really liked to put in your games?

[46:51] Well, one of the features that I used about several games was putting the pop bumpers down at the fifth.

[47:01] The ball went and worked around this before easy go back on the point here, or go up.

[47:14] Which works out.

[47:20] Right.

[47:22] Also, are there features that I used that were where the temperature was a chunk up to the top of the point.

[47:34] Through an hour.

[47:37] Yeah, like fantastic.

[47:40] The Williams fantastic.

[47:42] I think that would have came out in 1972.

[47:45] That one had that pop bumper down by the flippers and it would sometimes it would get in there and it would just really, really kick around.

[47:54] Right.

[47:55] That was something like that.

[47:59] It would go down and actually go around from back and forth and go back to the place.

[48:11] That was a lot of time.

[48:14] That was over.

[48:20] Tell me about Doodlebog, the 1971 Williams game Doodlebog.

[48:26] That had to go back and forth on the playfield.

[48:31] That feature was used by Harry Wilson.

[48:36] That was Harry Williams idea.

[48:47] In that game it worked out well.

[48:53] It was kind of a cool feature.

[48:56] It was a little area.

[48:59] It was like a elongated slot in the playfield with a plastic window.

[49:04] And the ball would move back and forth between two magnet poles.

[49:09] The ball would only travel to two and a half inches.

[49:13] But it was very.

[49:18] Yeah.

[49:19] Sorry about that.

[49:24] Yeah.

[49:25] It was really neat in that it.

[49:30] It was very.

[49:32] Almost like a second hand on a clock going back and forth almost.

[49:38] That was a Harry Williams feature that I.

[49:44] I was really happy to see that.

[49:54] I know the game of yours that was really well accepted.

[49:59] What we talked a little bit about was the Spanish eyes.

[50:05] The really kind of cool artwork on that game.

[50:09] Were you pretty proud of that game?

[50:13] I think the artwork was helpful.

[50:18] It was a very good game.

[50:23] The artwork was well accepted.

[50:31] Now another pair of games that was real popular was Swinger and Funfest.

[50:38] And it had kind of a score reel in the back glass that would give you kind of like a bonus score.

[50:46] That was kind of a unique feature.

[50:50] Where did that idea come from?

[50:56] I would go blind.

[51:02] I don't think anybody ever did it.

[51:06] I thought it was kind of a neat feature.

[51:10] Was that just something you just came up with one day?

[51:16] Well, whether I was just as home-taker, whatever, some of these ideas just come to you.

[51:28] But just out there, I was in corporate in the game.

[51:36] But like the others, games like the Roulette Wheel, I thought that idea was toy store.

[51:51] You mean the Roulette Wheel like that was used in Fantastic?

[51:55] That's all with the play-pull.

[52:01] I don't remember if it was used in Fantastic or not.

[52:07] But I used to know several games.

[52:10] It's a matter of fact.

[52:13] I had mentioned we never tried to copy anything from a very manufacture.

[52:22] But that's the first one.

[52:26] So like that, take part in the game.

[52:32] I don't remember the game.

[52:34] But they call for this.

[52:40] Yeah, Fantastic used.

[52:42] It had that pop-up between the flippers and it also had that rule at wheel in the play field too, which was kind of cool.

[52:51] But the Roulette Wheel, I think, came to me in a toy store.

[53:02] And was that an expensive feature to implement?

[53:06] I took a water at every spot.

[53:13] It was a few bucks to flip.

[53:19] Like I say, then we were limited to price.

[53:26] So were you constantly trying to push the dollar envelope to get more things in your games that came under the cost envelope that you guys needed to hit?

[53:40] So we were basically aware of what we could do or how many we really could do.

[53:51] It cost sometimes when we run over but the feature was worth it.

[54:00] So if we ran over by a dollar to the technical of the feature.

[54:08] Overall, did you really like working in the pinball industry?

[54:12] I mean, was it a fun job?

[54:14] Oh, yes.

[54:16] I got the electronic industry into the pinball industry and stayed there.

[54:26] I was fact-infatuated with the pinball industry after I got in and I enjoyed working there.

[54:37] Were you a very good pinball player?

[54:40] To tell you the truth before I went to Williams and got the job there, I never played a pinball.

[54:53] After you started designing, did you get pretty good?

[54:57] Well, I had to get fairly good because after I put the game together, I played pinball all great.

[55:09] To more growth of the books and the time that takes the play and everything.

[55:17] Basically, after I designed the game and put it together, at that time I did and steamed and everything.

[55:29] We didn't have somebody put the wires together to put the whole thing together, put the relay and everything in the wire to all games.

[55:41] We designed the cable that you put together.

[55:45] It was all done by us.

[55:49] Not like the way it was designed the game and it turned it over to somebody else to put together.

[55:57] We did it all by ourselves.

[56:01] Besides designing games, I used to go on the road teaching school.

[56:09] Did you have any particular theme that you like to have your games, like a sports theme or a music theme or a current events theme or anything like that?

[56:19] It was all up to us.

[56:22] I had already seen the games and the books and themes.

[56:29] Everything we wanted, as long as the game was a half-way dish, a good game.

[56:37] Do you have any pinball games today or did you not keep any of these games when you designed them?

[56:45] I never owned a pinball game at home.

[56:49] I was born to my daughter in son of a, actually Rob's game with the music he gave to him.

[57:07] That's when he gave my every hand.

[57:10] I never kept the game.

[57:14] I started with the book.

[57:18] That's pretty funny.

[57:20] At the end of the day you had enough of pinball, huh?

[57:24] I was in a lot of places, but not to take home, not to play.

[57:31] I played them at home at work.

[57:36] This is the build.

[57:40] I used to play play some, but I was a kid at work all the weekend and played play the games.

[57:50] Is there any particular stories or anything that I might have left out or need to ask you?

[57:57] Anything you remember that was a good story or something that you'd like to add?

[58:01] I can say Steve Cordick and I worked together for years, time for his side.

[58:11] We got along fine and we are doing good work today.

[58:17] I enjoyed most of the people.

[58:21] I worked with Cordick for when you were going to plant this.

[58:25] There's always one or two that came out in the earth, but over the 30-some years I worked in the industry.

[58:38] I enjoyed people including the boss.

[58:44] I can say Sam Stern was a great guy and even with the belly of Bill Dahlens was a terrific guy.

[58:57] I enjoyed all of them.

[59:00] Thank you very much. I really appreciate you having some time and let me talk to you about this stuff.

[59:08] I don't want to. I enjoy talking to you.

[59:11] All right, well hey, thank you very much, Norman. You take care.

[59:14] You too. Okay.

[59:16] Bye, son.

[59:17] All right, I'd like to thank Noan Clark for joining us here on Topcast.

[59:21] We really, really do appreciate his time. I hope you can join us again for another episode of Topcast.
