[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:23] Tonight we're going to be talking to a Dene East,

[00:25] Sega and Stern programmer, somebody that worked on a lot of their games,

[00:30] starting in 1994 with guns and roses,

[00:33] Maverick, Frankenstein, Baywatch, Apollo 13,

[00:37] Golden Eye, Twister, Viper and Mini Viper,

[00:41] Independence Day, Space Jam, Star Wars Trilogy,

[00:45] The Lost World's Rassick Park, X-Files Starship Trooper,

[00:49] Lost in Space, Golden Q, Godzilla,

[00:52] and then with Stern in their South Park,

[00:55] Strikerslash, NFL Games in Playboy.

[00:59] So we certainly had a lot of programming experience.

[01:08] So now we're going to be talking to Orin Day of Dene East,

[01:12] Sega and Stern, and we're going to be giving him a call right now to talk about some stories

[01:16] in his time.

[01:18] He spent as a programmer at Dede East Sega and Stern.

[01:33] Hello?

[01:34] Orin?

[01:35] Yes.

[01:36] It's Clay.

[01:37] Hey Clay, how you doing?

[01:39] Good, how you doing?

[01:40] I'm doing good.

[01:41] So you got some time?

[01:42] Sure do.

[01:44] Okay, let's start at the beginning.

[01:46] When did you first get involved with Pinball?

[01:49] I mean, was this a youth thing or a business decision at a college or, you know, how did you get involved?

[01:56] Well, it was initially a youth thing that when I was a kid, we used to go to a resort down

[02:04] Sastakia, Florida, that had two pinball machines.

[02:07] They had a volley and a super soccer.

[02:10] Volley by Gottlieb?

[02:12] Gottlieb from 74 and 76, I believe.

[02:17] Yeah, right.

[02:18] The soccer was 74 and the volley was 76.

[02:22] Volley is a cool game actually.

[02:23] I'm not a big fan of super soccer or soccer, but I really liked Volley a lot of drop targets.

[02:29] Volley is my wife's favorite game.

[02:31] Well, it's got that lady on the play field, the kind of sexy lady, you know, kind of,

[02:36] I think it was, I heard that that game was made with, you know, what were the two kind of,

[02:43] I don't want to, Bobby King and somebody else?

[02:47] Billy Jean King and, well, the guy has blue hair, so I don't know who he is.

[02:52] Yeah, right, right.

[02:53] It was kind of that, I think it was kind of in regard to that, you know, the loosely themed around that.

[03:00] Yeah, yeah, but anyway, those two were great games.

[03:04] And I really loved playing those.

[03:08] And, problem was there really weren't a whole lot of mechanical pinballs around when I was, you know, eight or nine years old in places that I could get to.

[03:18] So the really the only time I played pinball was at Easter time when we would go take a couple weeks at spring break and go to that resort.

[03:26] Then when I was old enough to go to our Cades, a strange thing had happened.

[03:33] There weren't any mechanical games anymore. They were all solid state.

[03:37] And it was games, I think probably like Fathom and Centaur.

[03:42] And I would play those games and I would just get killed.

[03:46] I was no good at any of them.

[03:48] That would last too long, much quicker than the mechanical games.

[03:53] And for a long time I didn't play pinball very much.

[03:56] I really did not get back into it until I was in college.

[04:00] And then started playing games like Cyclone and Space Station and Fire and some of those, some of those Williams games.

[04:14] Where were you going to school and what were you studying in?

[04:17] I was at Duke and majoring in Physics and Math.

[04:24] Down here in Durham, North Carolina where I live now.

[04:28] And we had a wonderful arcade. It was called The Devil's Quarters.

[04:32] And they had, at the time, they had probably between 12 and 14 pinball machines.

[04:41] A ton of video games, a Czechs hockey, a couple pool tables.

[04:47] And that was a place where I spent a lot of time playing pinball and playing video too.

[04:56] I remember playing a lot of Super Basketball, which is actually the game where one of the cheers that the Duke students at basketball games came from.

[05:08] But when they say, Boink, Boink, Boink pass when the other team has the ball and is dribbling, that came right out of Super Basketball.

[05:15] Not a lot of people know that.

[05:17] But sort of, The Devil's Quarters was actually pretty good in terms of getting not brand new games, but sort of second time around games that they would generally get Duke with Duke owned it, operated it.

[05:36] Students worked there and Duke owned all the games, too bending.

[05:41] And they would get the games that were maybe 6 to 9 months old.

[05:47] So they would probably another operator had them, traded them in.

[05:53] So they started to get the dot matrix games when they came along.

[05:58] They had a number seeing a bad man there, sort of towards the end of my college days.

[06:05] They got an Adams.

[06:08] They had a Gilligan.

[06:11] I remember playing all those games there.

[06:15] And really enjoyed playing them.

[06:18] And I decided to stay at Duke for grad school.

[06:22] I was very close to going to Penn State.

[06:24] But I went to Duke for grad school in physics and kept on playing pinball.

[06:29] And while I was in grad school my first year, student graduated, got his PhD, and he happened to have a haunted house.

[06:40] It was a haunted house that had come from Brady down in Charlotte, brand new, and it had been at the Devil's Quarters for many years.

[06:50] Then just like all the property at Duke, the only way they can sell things is through the Duke surplus store.

[06:57] So that pinball machine ended up over Duke surplus.

[07:00] And my friend bought it, he fixed it up, had it at his house.

[07:04] And when he graduated and went off to go look for work as a professor somewhere, he sold it to me.

[07:11] So I ended up with a haunted house when I was in the department as a grad student.

[07:16] And never really could get it working.

[07:19] It had some electronics problems.

[07:22] But that sort of cemented my love affair with fixing pinball machines not very well.

[07:29] But to make a long story long, I only spent one year in grad school.

[07:36] Sort of the job market for physics people was not very good.

[07:40] A couple of people that I knew from grad school had gone up to Washington, D.C., and taken jobs at Goddard Space Flight Center, working as contractors for NASA, just outside of Washington, D.C.

[07:53] And went up there and interviewed for a programming job, and got a programming job and moved up to D.C.

[08:04] And it was a good job.

[08:07] And a nice thing about it was that had good internet access there like I did at Duke, and actually started to read rec games pinball quite a lot.

[08:19] What year was this?

[08:21] I actually started reading that news group when it was created.

[08:27] So that was like 90 or 91?

[08:30] I graduated undergrad in May of 91.

[08:35] It was in grad school from August of 91 through May of 92.

[08:43] So I moved to the D.C.

[08:46] And I got an apartment right across from up in Laurel, Maryland, right across from the Laurel Mall, which was sort of known for being the place where George Wallace was shot.

[08:59] That was right across the street from my apartment. There was a plaque there or something.

[09:05] But I didn't care about that so much as that they had a tilt over there at the mall, and I could pretty much walk right across.

[09:14] And they had a decent line of other games. They had an Adams.

[09:20] And then later on they got a Twilight Zone.

[09:24] Not a sample game, but an early production game with the Green Lock Light.

[09:30] They got that when it was new.

[09:33] And they had a couple other games. I remember exactly what they had.

[09:38] But we mostly played the Adams and the Adams and the Twilight once it was there.

[09:45] In fact, we helped, we did a little bit of repair on them.

[09:50] Me and Steve Yanke, who was very active on Reckham's pinball, he's active in the Maryland Free State Pinball Association.

[10:00] He was one of the people who started that league.

[10:03] And that was after I left that they started the league.

[10:06] But I met Steve through the news group and a couple other people had got her to play pinball.

[10:11] And we had a great time going around to a different arcade playing.

[10:16] We did some work fixing the games up at the tilt because there was nobody who knew how to fix them.

[10:23] There was an arcade that was up north of Baltimore that had probably seven or eight games, including a Jurassic,

[10:30] which had just recently come out.

[10:33] And we would just pretty much spend our weekends playing pinball.

[10:40] Steve had an eighth ball of the locks.

[10:43] And I actually got picked up.

[10:46] I tried to get that haunted house working.

[10:50] I went up to the old state sales and took the boards one by one and had them fixed.

[10:56] And I don't know what it was about that machine.

[10:58] It was a haunted haunted house because I just could not get it working.

[11:03] And up buying a second haunted house.

[11:07] I got it from Lloyd Doeburn, who runs Coenop Warehouse.

[11:12] But back then he was running a place called Lloyd's Two Boxes that was right down by dollars airport.

[11:18] Went down and bought that haunted house, the second haunted house, which was also a very nice shape.

[11:24] I think for about $400 back then, nobody really wanted those games.

[11:29] He had just rooms and rooms full of pinball.

[11:32] It was great.

[11:33] I had a lot of money.

[11:35] I certainly would have loaded up on his stuff.

[11:37] But as it was, I just got that one other game.

[11:40] And played a lot of haunted house.

[11:44] And spent a lot of time working and a lot of time on wrecking pinball.

[11:50] And that was pretty much how I got to know the people who were at Data East.

[11:57] Yeah, I was going to ask, how did you transition into this, and again a job at Data East?

[12:02] That's right.

[12:05] That there was an event that Data East did in conjunction with the off-broadway launch of Tommy.

[12:16] And that event was at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas.

[12:21] And they wanted to have somebody who was a pinball player to come out and sort of demo the machines and help them run some little mini tournaments.

[12:31] At Hard Rock.

[12:34] And I volunteered to do it.

[12:39] I was going to be on a business trip around then in Alabama.

[12:43] And I figured, oh, that's not too far to drive.

[12:46] So I took a little vacation time and drove down.

[12:49] They would have had Lyman do it.

[12:51] But Lyman, who was, who had started there, I think pretty recently,

[12:58] Lyman was on a trip to Spain.

[13:02] I think there was a tournament over there or some kind of a show or something.

[13:06] So he was unavailable.

[13:08] So they wanted to find somebody in Dallas and I emailed Joe Camico and Lonnie Rob and said,

[13:15] well, I'm not actually in Dallas and I'm not actually a world-class pinball player like Lyman,

[13:21] but I'd be glad to go and help you out.

[13:23] So they said, sure, and you know, sort of hooked me up.

[13:27] I drove down there and I stayed overnight with the friend who family lived,

[13:35] not too far outside of Dallas.

[13:38] And went down to Hard Rock and spent the day with those guys.

[13:42] I think it was Lonnie and Joe Camico and John Borg and Joe Blackwell and Jim Gorman.

[13:52] And I brought some resumes.

[13:54] Of course, I didn't have any game programming experience, but I had programmed,

[14:00] when I had an Apple II, I programmed tons of stuff in machine language and assembly language and games and stuff like that,

[14:07] just for fun when I was a kid.

[14:09] So I had some professional programming experience and I sort of knew what they were doing.

[14:16] And gave them some resumes and they said, well, you know, the pinball business is very small.

[14:21] You know, there's only so many jobs. There's, you know, so many jobs that got leave and so many at so many at Williams.

[14:28] And, you know, we've only got four or five programmers, but you know, if we ever have anything, we'll keep your mind.

[14:33] So that was, I think that was right around October, 1993.

[14:43] And so happened that I was going to be back in Chicago where I originally grew up.

[14:51] That next weekend for Columbus Day, where obviously government employees, we got all those holidays that only government employees and school kids get.

[15:01] All right, so I flew back to Chicago and they invited me to come in on Monday.

[15:05] And I looked around at what they were doing. It was really interesting.

[15:09] Of course, that was the Tommy games that they took to Hard Rock were those six pop bumper prototypes with the ramp that they were playing the drop the ball.

[15:21] And had a little bit different ramp configuration.

[15:25] Had a looping ramp on the left side. It was maybe a little bit more based on Jurassic than anything else.

[15:33] They sort of put it together a little bit more quickly.

[15:37] I think they built that game in six weeks.

[15:40] Right, for that event.

[15:43] Yeah. And so I got to see, I believe I saw, I think last action hero was on the line.

[15:53] And I saw the, so I got to play the Whitewood of Crypt, which was interesting because I've never seen a Whitewood before.

[16:00] And I spent all the time talking to Lonnie about pinball and what would be fun to do and stuff like that.

[16:07] But I went back to my job at NASA and I was looking for work then.

[16:14] Being a low level contractor in the DC area around them was maybe not financially the easiest thing to do.

[16:22] I think actually when I started out, I was in a rent control department that I made so little money.

[16:30] I did a little bit better after my first year there.

[16:33] But I was looking for work and thought I might end up back down here in North Carolina.

[16:37] But around the middle of November there was a post on Reckham's pinball that they were looking for software engineers for a data east.

[16:49] And I looked at the qualifications and said, you know, I'm not even going to apply for this because you know I've given them my resume and I don't think I have those qualifications.

[16:59] So I didn't apply. And about a week later I get a call from Lonnie.

[17:04] He says, hey why haven't you applied for the job? And I said, well I didn't think I qualified.

[17:08] And he's like, well of course you qualify. You know, we've got your resume and if you're still interested we want to bring you to Chicago for an interview.

[17:16] So they flew me out. I think the weekend before, I think maybe the weekend before Thanksgiving.

[17:23] And I interviewed on Friday morning and everything went very well.

[17:32] I met a lot of folks and Joe took me out to lunch with Lonnie and out at Serrentos, which is a restaurant where we would found there on Manheim Road where it seemed like we conducted a lot of our game design business at lunchtime in later years.

[17:52] And he made me an offer and I accepted and Kevin Martin actually came in and interviewed at one in the afternoon and he got the job.

[18:04] He also accepted a job that day.

[18:09] So I went back and told the folks at NASA that I was quitting and was going to start it.

[18:15] Wait, wait, Kevin Martin is the guy that runs Papa, right?

[18:20] Yeah, Kevin and I worked together at Data East.

[18:27] It was interesting how the jobs opened up and there were two spots.

[18:32] Joe and Camico and Neil Falcon and Lonnie Rob were having a meeting in his office discussing that they were going to add a programmer position.

[18:45] And they decided that they were going to add one programming job that they were doing enough games and they maybe wanted to do a little novelty and needed more people in the head.

[19:00] And as they were having that meeting, Christina Donifrio, who was one of the programmers, she programmed quite a few games.

[19:11] In fact, she was one of the game programmer on crypt before she left and Neil Falcon or finished it up.

[19:22] She knocked on the door and told them that she was going to resign effective the end of October that the job was too much for her that she didn't have enough time to spend with her family and her kids.

[19:38] And that she wanted to go back to work in Zina, where she'd been before.

[19:43] And that she'd accepted a job with them.

[19:45] So all of a sudden, they had just decided to create one job and all of a sudden there were two.

[19:51] So that freed up a little bit of money and they could bring in sort of two more junior people to fill in those slots.

[20:01] And this was a pay increase over NASA?

[20:04] Oh yeah, it wasn't a huge pay increase but in terms of absolute dollars but in terms of percentages, I think it was like a 20% raise.

[20:14] And the other advantage was that basically all my family was there in the Chicago suburbs.

[20:23] So when I moved back to Chicago, I actually lived at my parents' house for a couple months before I got into the department.

[20:31] And it was like a 10 or 12 mile commute to the east.

[20:36] That's amazing that NASA doesn't pay much money.

[20:40] Well, the job that I had was in a great group but it was an astronomy group.

[20:50] We were pretty much doing science.

[20:54] And we had a lot of astronomers on the staff and the folks that had the PhDs were the ones who were better compensated and appropriately.

[21:08] And we were contractors so it was sort of keeping this contract based on the lowest bid.

[21:15] And they rebid the contract about a year after I was there.

[21:19] And people's benefits got cut and nobody got raises and stuff like that.

[21:26] But the change in the administration happened then when Clinton came in and there was sort of a change in priority of what NASA was going to do.

[21:37] That there was a lot of money going into earth mapping and instead of high energy astronomy.

[21:46] So it seemed like sort of the writing was on the wall there and I needed to make a change of some sort.

[21:52] So when did you actually start work at the east?

[21:55] It started on December 13th, 1990, 1993.

[22:03] And what was your first day like or your first week?

[22:07] What was interesting, I actually started working there before I started.

[22:17] When, as I said, I interviewed the Friday, the weekend before Thanksgiving.

[22:24] And I actually came back to Chicago for Thanksgiving, already had plane tickets.

[22:32] And since I was going to be leaving, since I was going to be leaving NASA, I didn't try and just change my tickets around and just skip Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.

[22:42] I actually needed to go back and resign so that I could give them enough notice that I could leave.

[22:49] But I actually went in the Friday after Thanksgiving.

[22:54] And that was a very interesting day because Slash was in town and they were working on some of the initial designs for guns and roses.

[23:05] So I actually got, actually came in and got to hang out with them.

[23:10] And in the evening, I don't think Slash got there till like 430 or 5. He was not an early riser.

[23:17] Did you know that Slash was going to be there? Or was that just, it was just dumb luck?

[23:23] It was just dumb luck that that was when he was going to be there.

[23:26] And I was just reading his biography. I got it for Christmas.

[23:32] And a very interesting book, though certainly not for the kids, that his girlfriend at that time was from Chicago.

[23:47] So they were sort of back for Thanksgiving, I think was sort of the thing.

[23:51] So they weren't guns, wasn't on tour or anything like that.

[23:55] So they just flew to Chicago and he was around and it was the perfect time to have a design meeting.

[24:02] So there's Alba. He had some booze and that was sort of interesting to see in a workplace.

[24:14] And of course he was smoking like a chimney. Neil was smoking, I think Joe actually walked out of the room and came back into the room wearing a gas mask.

[24:27] Was he being serious or just being funny?

[24:31] I think he was being funny but it was a real gas mask. I don't know if it worked or not.

[24:38] It was funny and it was really sort of neat to see how ideas got on paper because that was John Borg had sort of his first wide body sketch.

[24:53] Not even sure if it was an auto-can drawing at that point. They were transitioning into that tool then.

[25:01] But he brought in that play field and they sort of started laying out inserts and figuring out game features.

[25:11] It was really interesting and bringing out Joe's very famous tin of inserts and putting them on the paper and really sort of doing sort of that first layout of the play field.

[25:26] What's Joe's tin of inserts? Is that like some impamist there?

[25:31] I remember if it was like an old cookie tin or something that crackers came in or something like that but it was just this metal tin that was not bigger than a bread box that basically had a bunch of inserts of all different colors and shapes.

[25:52] That's how we would lay out the rules for a play field that he would just dump this out and we'd find the right shapes and colors or whatever we wanted and put them down on the paper and then maybe sketch around on the paper or write down what it was or whatever.

[26:07] The engineer would do whatever the designer for the game or the mechanic on the engineer would take that paper and go back and drop those inserts down on the play field and that's what we would start out with for our first white wood.

[26:21] So when your white wood was cut there were they using CNC or was this all done by hand?

[26:28] They were originally done by hand very early at the east but typically I think by that point what they would do is they would I think they transitioned into where they would take that drawing and they would send it out.

[26:46] So we would have made our play fields at that time and we would just go ahead and make a white wood for us.

[26:53] It was just no longer cost effective for us to have that whole group that we are doing the white woods.

[27:04] So did you but the first game that you actually worked on wasn't really guns and roses and what was it WWF?

[27:11] Well the first game that I contributed to was crypt because to sort of get familiar with their diagnostics and their stuff because I really hadn't been inside of their games all that much.

[27:29] So it was to go out in the factory and play a whole bunch of the games that were sort of through the QA stage and into the QC stage but not into the box, go out and play a bunch of crypt and learn about what they were doing and how things worked playing with the glass off stuff like that.

[27:56] And actually while I was out there found a few bugs and actually brought those back to Neofalkiner and John Carpenter who was one of the other dot programmers back then.

[28:11] So that was really the first game that I did any sort of quote unquote software support.

[28:18] Wait, wait, what kind of bugs did you find?

[28:22] Oh, there was a display bug that I found and I think there was a shot that when you made it at a particular time that the sound would go out.

[28:39] It would have a sound call that had some blank, there was a sound call that had too high of a priority and it would kill the music until you made another shot.

[28:48] And I think there was also a scoring bug where it gave you a certain number of points and it actually didn't.

[28:55] And it was like a decent number of points and it actually, you know, for a combo or something. It was like a three way combo and it showed the display effect and it didn't give you the points.

[29:07] So the only reason I really noticed that it was early in the game.

[29:13] And crypt had been on the line for quite a while so it wasn't like it was, you know, this, and it wasn't like it was the show stopping bug or anything like that.

[29:25] You know, maybe I found something minor in the diagnostics, but my job there was going to initially be, you know, helping out with rules and stuff like that.

[29:35] But the primary job was going to be programming dot matrix, which a lot of people, I think a lot of people understand it now.

[29:43] A lot of people didn't get it. You know, I said I was the dot matrix programmer. Oh, yeah, you draw all those dots.

[29:50] And I'm like, yeah, well, the software that I have draws them, but there's actually artists that actually create that artwork.

[29:59] And then, you know, I add the text and add the text and sort of, you know, do the nitty gritty layout. You know, they would generally say how things should move across the screen and stuff like that.

[30:13] Well, well, the artist would draw each frame in the animation. And then you would write the game glue that glued all that stuff together that made the animation actually play, set it up as a call so that because that was a separate CPU that ran unlike, like, say, Williams, where they had 168.09 that ran, you know, both the dot and the game code.

[30:39] On your system, you were actually using a 6809 to run the game code on the CPU board, but then you were using something else on the dot matrix controller or different computer.

[30:49] And so you had to call between these two computers, right?

[30:52] Yeah, that's right. So generally, I would generally in programming display, I would set up the, I would basically set up with the, you know, what the calling convention would be or the interface or whatever.

[31:04] You know, what the display effect number was going to be and what needed to be passed, you know, if it needed to be, if it needed to be, you know, a score value, if it needed to be the status of some lights on the play field or a row or a column of the matrix or something like that.

[31:23] That I would set that up and generally I would try and set it up so it was, it was something that the game programmer already had access to that they wouldn't have to create this custom, you know, fancy thing or whatever.

[31:34] That they would pass that and, you know, then I would render that appropriately, you know, like if it was, like, if it was one of those display effects where you had to complete targets on the play field to spell something.

[31:50] You know, the game programmer would, would need to pass what the status of those lights were so that I could know which, which, which targets had been completed and which still, which hadn't been completed so that, so that I could show the player what they were, what they were supposed to do.

[32:11] Now was that a, was that a 6809 running the code for the display to?

[32:16] Yeah, it sure was that it was, it was basically a separate modular system like, like you described that, that the display programmer could go and program display and the sound programmer who at that time was Brian Schmidt who was working from his house up in Wilmet,

[32:38] right by the, Evan some border he was right up by Northwestern University, that he'd been doing, he'd be doing the sound at home and, you know, I'd be doing the display upstairs that will bounce initially downstairs and then I moved upstairs at 1990 Janus building.

[32:55] And then the game programmer usually lawning or kneel would be, would be downstairs and, you know, I'd work on stuff and the artist would give me usually a floppy disk because we didn't really have, we didn't really use the network for them for that quite so much back then.

[33:16] The artist would, artist would give me a floppy disk and a sheet of paper that would basically describe how they wanted the art to get rendered and I would put together, you know, the art and do sort of a test thing and, you know, ask the artist, you know, is this timing good, is this what you had in mind.

[33:32] And then I add in all the fonts and text and the descriptions and stuff like that.

[33:37] And then I would make a paper sheet and take it down to take it down to the game programmer along with the ROM and say, you know, here's the, here's the new dots and, you know, here's these, here's these display effects and, you know, they would go ahead and put them in and then I'd come back later and, you know, we'd play the rule and see if it worked the way it was supposed to.

[33:58] So, like, how did this work to like the CPU programmer, he would set up like, you know, display effect numbers that would relate to the animations that you were doing and like, how did you to communicate like, you know, that display 47 would be, you know, the animation for, you know, extra ball or, you know, how did you guys actually coordinate all that stuff.

[34:23] Actually, usually the display programmer would be responsible for, would be responsible for, for setting it up. But one of the things that I did when I came in is that it seemed that sort of Lonnie had his preference of, you know, what the, what the dot effect should be, where, you know, where they should be in terms of, you know, numbered from numbered in, in hex from 0, 0 to ff.

[34:49] And sort of Neil sort of had his own sort of set Neil Falconer had his own sort of separate code and he was, you know, expecting that, you know, this might be here and this might be here.

[34:58] And one of the things that I did at some point, I think it was probably around the time when we switched back from the, from the, from the 192 by 64 display back to the 128 by 32.

[35:16] But I sort of standardized as much as I could those dot effects and said, you know, that jackpot, for example, is always going to be effect AC and super jackpot timer is always going to be effect AD and super jackpot is always going to be effect AE and extra ball is always going to be effect B and stuff like that.

[35:40] And I basically made a generic ROM that had sort of generic display effects that basically they could plug in and have sort of the simple rules and get a game going, you know, with those timers and those display effects and stuff like that.

[36:00] And they would be the, for the most part, the same as the previous game. So they'd be easy to, it would be easy for them to implement.

[36:06] Yeah, they could get rocking and rolling this way without having to, you know, get you, get the artist handing the stuff off to you, handing the stuff off to them.

[36:16] Yeah, and that, that became especially important after, after I think golden eye when John Carpenter, who was, I guess I should talk about the staff really.

[36:35] And then when I started, Kevin and I started, I guess I started on a Monday and Kevin started on a Friday. We both started the same week in sort of there right before, right before Christmas in in 93.

[36:51] And John Carpenter was there doing, doing display programming and Lyman Sheets was there also doing display programming.

[37:02] But he was, he was feeling sort of like he was ready to get a game. And then Lonnie Rock was there and Neopalkan was there. So we had that software staff.

[37:15] Then when I'm not sure if it was when Lyman left or not that we, that we brought in Brian Rudolph. And he was there and program Batman forever and then did a lot of novelty games.

[37:32] Of course, Kevin and John Carpenter got out sort of stepped out of the pinball loop and did the tattoo as fast as the video game, which I was sort of perfectly involved. And I did, I helped them do some art cleaning and edge cleaning and stuff like that.

[37:51] Not any, not any code writing for that. But I stepped in, stepped into that. And when tattoo was over, Kevin actually left. And he wanted to move to Pittsburgh for personal reasons and went and started pair.

[38:11] And John Carpenter's situation was he, he started out, after tattoo was over. He did some of the dots on some of the video modes on Baywatch and then did the majority of the dots for Batman forever.

[38:30] And was set to do Golden Eye and they, him and his wife decided to move down to Florida that they thought that they would benefit from a warmer climate.

[38:43] And at that point, Joe said, well, do we want to hire another display program? And I said, no, you know, I think I've pretty much got the hang of this now.

[38:51] It's not so bad now that we're doing the back to the, back to the smaller dot display that it was a little easier to code. And I think I could probably handle doing every game.

[39:02] And one of the, that was why it was really important to sort of have that generic round because if we were, if we had two games up and running at once, it was a little hard to work on both.

[39:13] But it seemed that in those days we typically didn't have, we never had two white woods, we never had two white woods up and running anyway that needed dots.

[39:26] And having those generic display effects made it a little bit easier for the game programmers too, that they did have these display effects and timers that they could call, that they could pass a bunch of text to.

[39:42] So that basically it would, you know, show two lines of text and have a timer or stuff like that. But it, it took time for them to set it up and it was sort of a pain in the butt.

[39:54] And, you know, it was, their time was better spent right in real code than, you know, hacking in these, hacking in these display things.

[40:03] So, you know, I generally be able to step off of one game and, you know, do a little bit of support stuff for them.

[40:09] Now, now, doing this kind of starting out with this generic display rom though, did that, I one thing that I've always noticed about the DADEs, the Sega, even current Stern games is that every game has, as far as display effects, a very similar look and feel.

[40:27] And, you know, I guess there's something to be said about familiarity. But on the other hand, if you compare it to Williams, you know, every one of their games is very much different as far as the display effects, how things scroll, the fonts, you know, how the start-up sequence, you know, press start, you know, insert coin.

[40:48] But all that stuff in the DADEs world is very, very generic. Did you feel that that was a detriment or you just were, you know, you had to do it this way just because there wasn't enough staff?

[40:59] Well, there were, it's interesting that there were, as far as the attract mode and, you know, things like insert coin and stuff like that, that we did want that to be standard from game to game to game.

[41:14] Now, sometimes we would change it like, you know, there's that press start display effect where it shows the-

[41:25] The big finger!

[41:27] ...and flashing and the words press start and then a hand comes out and it compresses press start, you know.

[41:31] Yeah, I call that the big finger.

[41:34] For Jurassic Park, I seem to recall that we used a Raptor Claw instead of the hand.

[41:40] Right. So we would do- we would do stuff like that, but there was- we did want to sort of have a uniformity across our games that, you know, we thought that it was good that that stuff looked the same.

[41:58] Now, I will say that when I did games, I used a lot of different fonts. When I did Frankenst- well, the first game I did was Guns and Roses.

[42:09] The second game I did was Frankenstein. I believe Frankenstein had 65 or 70 different fonts, which was a lot, but, you know, we did different things for different display effects.

[42:22] And I think it was a game that- I think it was a game that came out looking a lot different from Maverick, which- which Lyman programmed.

[42:32] And I think Baywatch looked a lot different from Frankenstein. And I think that Batman Forever looked a lot different from Baywatch.

[42:41] Now, as far as fonts, how would you, you know, implement a new font? I mean, you know, it's not like- I'm sure it isn't like, you know, like you need a new font and word, you download it off the internet and, you know, put it in a folder and away you go. I'm sure it wasn't that easy, right?

[42:58] Yeah, but, well, it wasn't. It wasn't. We sort of had two different ways that fonts might appear. That we would have fonts that artists would do that would be sort of specific to a game.

[43:17] You know, like they might have a Batman font or, you know, a spooky, spooky big Frankenstein letters font or, you know, for a particular display effect, they might have an animating score or something like that.

[43:32] And the way that we get the artist that they would give it- that they would- that they would give us those art files. We had a tool for them where they could turn.

[43:44] I believe they would save their individual frames as- I think it was TIFF files. I'm not absolutely sure of that. And then it would get turned- now they save it as- they save it as bitmaps.

[44:01] And then we had something that would turn the bitmaps actually into ASCII. That was- that was appropriate for the- appropriate for the assembler. And then we'd have to label each little ASCII drawing- they would label each ASCII drawing, you know, A, B, C, D, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever.

[44:22] And then we'd have a big long table that would basically map if it was a score font, it would just be 0 through 9 in a comma. That would map that into an object that if we gave it the appropriate offset, it would know what character to draw.

[44:45] Basically, basically we had a string drawing routine. And if you know you passed it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, it would be clever enough to figure out that- and you passed it that in a- and that it was supposed to be drawn in a score font. It would be clever enough to figure out that it should go and get the 1 and put that next to the 2 and then put in a comma and then draw 3, 4, 5. Well, I actually would be 3, 4, 0.

[45:11] And was this done all through like the- I imagine this was done through like a macro assembler or something?

[45:17] Yeah, there was- well, there was a- Lonnie Rob actually wrote the original Data East 128 by 32 display system. And without going into a whole lot of detail, I'm sure that the pin main people know it all pretty much anyway by heart.

[45:36] But it was a system that combined a lot of assembly language code with a lot of scripting. So that you wouldn't necessarily have- if you were going to draw a string, you would not have to- you would not have to really reinvent the wheel.

[45:57] The string would be out in some table or some bank of memory and you'd tell it to draw this string in this font, in this color scheme and it would just go do it.

[46:11] So initially if you were just sort of programming display, you might not have to know a lot of assembly language at all. And that was why- you know that was why it was sort of the entry level programming job for pinball.

[46:25] But there were also some people who tried to do it and didn't have a really good eye for it and really couldn't do layout very well themselves. And the stuff that they did just didn't- wasn't necessarily very visually appealing.

[46:42] Certainly I had a lot of learning to do but the nice thing was the first game I worked on, the first game I was sort of the lead display programmer on was working on guns and roses with Lonnie.

[46:53] And of course Lonnie had written the system and knew everything that it did and you know could really give me pointers but he could also give me pointers on what looked good and what didn't.

[47:02] Of course there was not always agreement on what looked good and what didn't in that group that some people would want as much reverse video and flashing and whatever that would be exciting for the player and it would attract other people to the game.

[47:22] And other people would say well you know you're flashing it so much that I can't even read my score. So we had that system that was done by Lonnie and then lineman sheets while lineman sheets was originally supposed to be the dot programmer for guns and roses.

[47:40] But and that was certainly certainly a lot of work for him because he had done the dots for Tommy and he ended up also doing the dots in the most part for WWF. I think I did a couple- I did like a week of work when he went off to Disney World, he went on vacation.

[48:03] And I think I you know programmed programed a couple things then but he was supposed to do guns too but he got he got moved over to reading the display system for the 192 by 64 which was actually a 68000 system.

[48:26] I think that was remember that was something that he if he had 68000 experience before or not but he stepped in and wrote a very nice system for that dot matrix display that actually had a lot of new features that we sort of ported back to the 128 by 32 standard sized dot display at the time of Apollo 13.

[48:53] So how hard was it to program the 192 versus the 128 you know you got this monster size big display with more levels of shading and and and and and it looked great. I mean the Baywatch stuff looked really really good. How you know how tough was that compared to the you know to the you know the medium size displays it maybe.

[49:16] It wasn't in some ways it was in some ways the loud and stuff was actually easier because you had a lot more space in fact in fact we had to be careful not to have too much not to have too much instruction on there you could fit a lot of stuff.

[49:31] But the actual programming was was very similar you just had to be a little bit you had to be a little bit more careful because it was because it was 16 bit instead of 8 bit in terms of the instructions and that you had to be careful that there were ways that you could there were ways in your scripts that you could you could make the thing get really confused and and messed up.

[50:01] But but I'm in an excellent job on that system it was it was I wouldn't say it was any any harder to program there were just there were just a couple tricks that that you had to that you had to be aware of and through some of the through some of the things that we that he did we could actually fit in even more art and more digitized stuff than we ever could before.

[50:28] It was nice that we that we had we had to I think we ended up with two four megabit ROMs to 270040s for that for that display so we we certainly did have a lot of space.

[50:45] Yeah you you doubled your ROM space basically right yeah exactly and you know the the code instructions were bigger because they were sick you know we're 16 bit but yeah you could certainly pack a lot more art in there.

[50:57] And it was yeah it was really a lot of fun to it was really a lot of fun to work with it but you know it was just it was just unfortunate that it didn't catch on and that's really the Williams guys took that display and did a lot of nice things a lot of nice things for it with slots.

[51:16] Right right that's right the Williams the WMS slots that's right they use that larger one ninety two display yeah like like X factor and and and some of those other games from that generation were I thought I thought had had had great play value whether they whether they made money or not I don't know but at least a couple years ago some of them were still going strong.

[51:41] And what was the decision that was a financial decision to go back to the smaller one twenty eight display yeah it it pretty much was of course we made that transition from average and somewhere in the middle of maverick was when was when sega fully took over they already had a stake.

[52:08] They already had a stake in the company in fact they had a stake in the company for a long time and that was when they and that was when they finally bought the rest of it and moved in and you know changes changes started to be made in terms of design.

[52:27] Because of because of their ownership and you know sort of a different financial model and sort of the pinball market falling apart in the bottom line.

[52:36] That you know we brought in this more expensive thing and you know unfortunately it didn't really it didn't really have a bump in sales that we really weren't we really weren't selling more games now of course we didn't necessarily we didn't necessarily have the greatest titles during that time.

[52:56] Either you know maverick really didn't have the nostalgia and it was sort of brought in as a as a game that France France wanted the France wanted the card game with the drop targets.

[53:11] That was the that was the real big sort of push for why that theme would be such a wonderful thing you know we're going to have we're going to have a drop target game again and you know that the French took one look at it and it said you know it was like they

[53:25] just like they wanted a godly game from from the 1970s you know where's our captain card and that that wasn't what it was that but you know maverick and then and then Baywatch you know we did we did Maverick because without the French would buy a whole bunch we didn't

[53:46] Baywatch because we thought the Germans would buy a whole bunch and they weren't they weren't so hot on half the off then I guess they were hot and cold on him or maybe the

[53:57] Germans like to have a lot of people who played pinball didn't but we didn't sell a whole lot of that and Frankenstein you know they had a pretty good cast and you know didn't turn out to be the

[54:12] the enormous blockbuster movie that we hoped it would be and by the time we were by the time we were a little bit deep into Batman forever we pretty much knew that the dots were going to be a lame duck that the operators wanted to be able to only stock one kind of display and I don't think I don't think the technical problems that we had with Baywatch helped us any

[54:40] that I don't know if you're familiar with that that mod yeah the we mean we're the five volts fails going to the controller board and then the whole display goes out and then you guys had a special cabling modification that you could plug in that would help that

[55:00] that's right that it was I think there was I think there was an issue of not enough amps getting there and I think there was also an issue of mechanical stability.

[55:10] Right right I just fixed a maverick for a guy and basically you know I didn't have that cable but you know I did essentially the same thing you double up the five volts you double up the ground going to you know going to that controller you used new three sided try for

[55:27] con pins instead of the original single sided pins and bingo you know it's it's all good to go yeah and it was funny we were we had that game at the trade show

[55:37] and this is a trade show on arena we had yesman belief who I think is she she came out for the show and for one day we brought her in and she was signing autographs and and you know doing all this stuff

[55:55] and you know really really dig in the game and the game is crashing in the video mode and it would crash like multiple times and we just could not figure out why.

[56:06] There was actually nothing wrong with the code other than the code was exercising the process or so much that it didn't have enough power and it would crash.

[56:15] That was the problem too many cycles. So what did you do fix that that was the the wiring.

[56:22] Oh really all you mean the power consumption was the issue. The you know would the video mode was just about the only place that would make it crash.

[56:32] So because the power consumption was so much because it was drawn so much current or whatever.

[56:36] Yeah it was pumping it was pumping so many frames through and so much artwork that it was just that it was just too much that the processor was really being exercised and drawing a lot of power.

[56:46] But the processor could handle it it just didn't it just the current limits couldn't.

[56:51] Yeah you know or the processor was pulling too many frames off the ROMs and you know it was too much power draw.

[56:59] Now when you did Baywatch did you get to deal with any of the stars on you got a hassle off stories you got a Pam Anderson stories anything like that.

[57:08] You know not really the I think the most of the time the people that we worked with in on the games were were very cooperative.

[57:26] That there were sort of there were sort of two issues that were there when it actually came down to the movie stars that it was it was the sound recording and the likeness.

[57:37] You know would they would they do custom speech for us and and you know what could we do is what could we do as far as the art was concerned.

[57:48] And we brought probably the first the first time I I found out that it maybe wasn't always such smooth sailing was when we were doing guns and roses that John Borg and Joe and Brian Schmidt went out to California to do a recording session.

[58:09] And they're at the recording studio and they they had slash there and was you know recording guitar lick and his speech and stuff that he was saying but of course of course you know the recognizable voice is is not slash but axel and they're going to record axel that same night.

[58:35] And he apparently got confused and his limo went to the wrong recording studio and you know he was late this was in this was in this was in 94 some of 94 so it wasn't you know it wasn't like everybody had a cell phone back then some people did but you know they have a trouble figuring out where he was supposed to be and he showed up two hours late and locked himself in the studio and was swearing in the studio.

[59:04] And he was swearing in there for like 90 minutes on tape and then you know erase the tape and then you know he would there were some things in the script that he just wouldn't say he would say jackpot but he wouldn't say extra ball and you know all this stuff that was so.

[59:24] And he say extra ball personality well why wouldn't he say extra ball don't know I mean it was just it was just axel he didn't want to say it so he wasn't going to say it and there was actually no way that that he could be convinced to change his mind.

[59:41] So that's why there's that's why there's no extra ball speech in the game that he wouldn't say mystery that's why slashes voices the one that says mystery for that for that shot even though axel is the one who's on the piece of plastic that always breaks that's up above that hole.

[01:00:04] Now did you get or there you know any of the other members of the band that you got speech from I don't think we did that they had they had gone through they gone through some transitions then and you know the other band members just weren't quite so recognizable that they sort of had a feature in the game.

[01:00:21] You know there was the guild the guild we motorcycle feature I guess he got into a bad motorcycle accident that's why that's why that got put in.

[01:00:30] But you know generally generally it was just it was just those two I'm I'm not sure if they got actually got individual sound samples from the individual sound samples from from everybody in the band or just for exactly what was done but I know that they got they certainly got a lot of stuff from slash and I don't know if they actually went back to master tapes and we're able to get you know.

[01:00:59] Axel singing axel's vocal track you know for some of those songs or not but the branch meant did a great job of putting that together that ended up being ended up being a really nice game in terms of sound package.

[01:01:12] Do you know what you know I know slash was into the whole the whole guns and roses pin and you know he was kind of the spearhead of the of the product I heard but I mean do you know what kind of compensation that that was given to these guys I mean what did the axel end up getting or

[01:01:28] you know what it's slash or just slash just do it because he just wanted to do it you know do you have any stories behind that I'm not sure you know slash was slash was big into pinball in fact in fact that haunted house game that I had that I had in Maryland when I moved back to Chicago I didn't think I was going to have space for a pinball game for a while I wasn't sure.

[01:01:51] So I actually gave gave the non working one to a friend of mine in hopes that he could he could eventually get it working and the other haunted house got sold a slash that he'd always wanted one.

[01:02:04] So you know he he wasn't a pinball and he just sort of want he just you know sort of saw it as a promotional thing right that it be a positive thing for the band.

[01:02:13] And you know they got I'm sure that they got some amount and you know that they got they got some games and you know they could take a game with them on tour something like that and that would be cool.

[01:02:25] So I don't think it was I don't think it was by any means a big money deal that they actually came to us it wasn't the other way around.

[01:02:31] Right. I think they also went to Williams and they like didn't know who they were or something and you know said no sorry we're not interested so they came over to us and of course the

[01:02:42] Jonah who they were right away and you know sort of got the got the motivation and it was it was a license that John Borg was very excited about very excited about doing a play field for and working with those guys.

[01:03:03] Now Apollo 13 how was you know to me that was really a cool game you know first white star system you know you kind of up the Annie and in the way of board system.

[01:03:15] Was there any and of course this went back to the smaller display you know the medium size 128 pixel wide display.

[01:03:25] You know any stories behind that or any of the personalities I you know I know we maybe we should talk about the Tom Hanks story and what you guys did with the with the back class.

[01:03:35] Yeah it was funny I had a I think Apollo was probably one of the games that I had that I had a larger role in that I was involved in that project very early on and that was probably the game where we sort of

[01:03:53] brought to bear a lot of the new a lot of the new technology in a lot of different ways.

[01:04:00] We took a we had a prototype a prototype Apollo 13 that we took down to downtown Chicago to Oprah studio when Tom Hanks and Tom Hanks and Gary Seneis

[01:04:22] and I believe Bill Paxton were on Oprah and we brought them the game so that so they could see it that I believe that Joe Joe and Neil actually were on that Oprah show.

[01:04:47] And this this probably would have been in in April or May of 90 I think 95 I think was it 95 when that movie came out or not exactly yeah.

[01:05:02] That they were down there and then Lonnie and I stood in this sort of back studio actually shooting baskets because they actually had a basketball court in there with the game just sitting there all by itself and waiting for him to come in and it was it was a very interesting very interesting version of Apollo 13.

[01:05:21] It had the big dot matrix display which there was which there was actually a score font and some digitized artwork for because at that point we didn't know we didn't know that the dot matrix display was going to go.

[01:05:37] It had cabinet art on the side that was sort of the side view of Cape Canaveral and sort of this light blue sort of sky blue color to it.

[01:05:53] It didn't have that it didn't have that black that black cabinet at all and it also had a play field that was also sort of in that light blue color too and did not have the four color process art.

[01:06:06] It had cut screens and it also had two spinning discs in the place where the moon and the earth were so and it also that outline gates too that would they would open up so when you had the 13 ball multi ball you would have spinning discs on the play field the outlines would be closed so that the balls would go back into the in lane so that you couldn't possibly drain.

[01:06:35] And those were those were features that we that we eventually took off of the game.

[01:06:40] Well you know those every one of those features sounds great where where is this prototype Apollo 13 so I can give my hands on it.

[01:06:51] Well the outline gates I don't think the code ever even got written for them. I don't think they were functional at the time of that at the time of that test.

[01:07:02] The first hundred games that were made the first hundred play fields had those discs cut out for the moon and the earth and we actually had some some four color process.

[01:07:17] Decals that went on those spinners that those were there and we decided that we weren't going to have it that it was too expensive and that we couldn't get good looking artwork that would be rough enough to actually move the ball.

[01:07:37] And the other problem was that those discs were so big that we saw with whitewoods and stuff like that that we'd either have to make them be out of really thick metal and they would be really loud like a washing machine or they would be sort of flimsy enough that it would be hard for a factory to get them spotted just right so that it wouldn't mess with the ball every time it went over it.

[01:08:04] So they took such a big part of the play field and we're also afraid of warped play fields at that point because it was going to be a game that was going to hit the line in September and October and we generally had problems with play fields that came in at that time of year.

[01:08:20] So I don't know if it was the conditions in the factory or that it was play fields that the actual plywood got manufactured in the summer when it was when it was more humid and then they were getting put into games when it was less humid.

[01:08:34] We had had all sorts of problems with that and the more inserts you put in the play field or the more holes you cut out of it the more likely it was going to be warped in a particular area.

[01:08:46] We didn't really want to really want to ship out warped games. In fact, I remember with Tommy and I think with Golden Eye maybe too.

[01:08:54] We actually had some play fields that we had to take off the wood side rails and put in metal rails to try and reduce that warping that it would actually sort of fix the bottom arch.

[01:09:09] It was sort of a bang for the buck thing but the first hundred games those play fields came in and we actually sent them back.

[01:09:22] They weren't screened. They weren't all screened play fields but we actually sent them back to the folks that were making the play fields and I don't know who it was.

[01:09:34] They actually plugged up those holes. They would would would circle to plug in those holes and glue them and sanded them again.

[01:09:41] But if you and you couldn't tell from the top but if you actually looked at the bottom of the play field you could tell that those two maybe you know five inch and three inch diameter holes had actually been plugged.

[01:09:55] So whatever did happen to that prototype?

[01:10:00] Well the play field, that one play field was there was only one that was screened that way and I think Kurt Anderson who was the artist had it at some point because he had done the artwork so we felt like he should have it.

[01:10:17] But it all got stripped out and I don't remember what happened to those.

[01:10:26] I don't remember what happened to those spinning disc assembly.

[01:10:30] It may have been that we wouldn't have used a version of it on Twister because it was only one spinning disc and of course it was modified to have the magnet in the middle.

[01:10:42] So the large dot matrix code that was written for Apollo 13 was that functional enough that I could put a large dot matrix in my Apollo 13 if I had this code?

[01:10:55] No, I didn't have any of the features at all. It had the score and maybe one jackpot and that was all.

[01:11:00] It was just enough to sort of give to give and let's see it wasn't actually I'm kind of think of who was there.

[01:11:12] It wasn't actually Bill Paxton because he was off making the Twister movie at that time.

[01:11:21] So it was actually Kevin Bacon and Gary Seneis who were on Oprah along with Tom Hanks.

[01:11:27] And what was the reaction to the game?

[01:11:30] I thought it was the coolest thing ever and they were just like yeah I can't wait until this is done.

[01:11:35] I'm going to love to be on a pinball game. I can't wait to have one of these for my kids.

[01:11:42] And what about even Hanks was saying this?

[01:11:45] Hanks didn't come.

[01:11:46] You know, out of the studio and Hanks had said that he didn't want to be part of licensing for Apollo 13.

[01:11:53] So it was basically, you know, Hanks go, you know, the thing is over and Hanks go left and Kevin Bacon and Gary Seneis go right and come in by us.

[01:12:07] And so we did the recording session right there in sort of this big open studio and it was actually okay.

[01:12:16] We actually had two things going for us on Apollo 13.

[01:12:21] The first thing was that we were going to be for much of it making the voices sound like the astronaut voices sound like they were in the cockpit or mission control,

[01:12:34] which basically sort of that radioizing was basically compressing those sound samples.

[01:12:41] So we could fit much, much, much more speech in there because it was sort of a low bid rate.

[01:12:46] It didn't take up as much space, you know, sort of like your MP3s, you know, people wanted RIP that, you know, 192 or, you know, whatever, 128.

[01:12:58] This was more like 16, maybe like 12, that we were able to fill those in.

[01:13:05] And the other thing was that that was the first game that we ever actually used, MAST ROMs, that we had enough lead time in between the, I guess, the October production and I guess we were doing this recording session in maybe May.

[01:13:24] And, you know, we had this prototype, we had a lot of the rules figured out and I spent a lot of time writing the speech scripts, actually wrote the speech scripts for that game myself, that we decided that we were going to sort of take advantage of, you know, here we are, we're Sega, we're Sega now.

[01:13:43] So we're going to save a little money and we're going to finalize these ROMs way early on, at least three of the four speech ROMs.

[01:13:54] And we're going to send those out to Japan or Taiwan or Korea or wherever they would do it.

[01:14:01] And instead of using E-Proms, we're going to have the MAST produce a bunch of special ROMs for this game, you know, that we're not going to change or whatever.

[01:14:10] And we're going to save a couple, we're going to save a couple dollars in game doing it that way.

[01:14:15] Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way because we didn't make as many Apollo 13s as we needed to.

[01:14:24] So we had a bunch of these leftover that we ended up throwing away. But as it was, we broke even.

[01:14:31] So now, you know, the big stories was back to Hank's and not wanting to be part of the licensing, like the big space helmet, the dark space helmet on the back glass, you know, was kind of implied that it's Hank's.

[01:14:44] Of course, you can't see it because it's got the dark cover on it because so he didn't want any part, he didn't want to do voice, he didn't want any visual, he didn't want any part of this.

[01:14:54] That was pretty much what it was and we were actually quite shocked by two things that happened towards the end of the project.

[01:15:02] The first thing was that Hank bought a bunch of the games.

[01:15:06] He went to whoever it was, whoever it was out in L.A., C.A. Robinson or whatever, and supposedly bought six games.

[01:15:15] And then the other thing was that he said he wasn't going to do any licensing, but then his image was along with some sort of Lego promotion with Apollo 13 and some kind of contest to build the best space Lego setup or whatever.

[01:15:33] We're kind of shocked that he did that, but we, there were all kinds of rules involving him in terms of promotional stuff that when his image did appear, it had to appear with at least one of the other astronauts, it could never be by itself.

[01:15:56] All kinds of crazy rules and we did have a version of that back glass where basically here's this flap and if you lift it up, hey, there's Tom Hanks underneath.

[01:16:13] That was the artwork as shot was like that. And we actually had three back glasses.

[01:16:22] There was one that looked just like the movie poster, just in a photographic back glass that just had Apollo 13 at the top, said, Houston, we have a problem and here's the space graph with the steam coming out of the side of it.

[01:16:39] Other than it was other than those, other than the words and the title and that thing, it was completely black.

[01:16:48] I thought it was pretty stunning, but it was stunning because it was different, but it wasn't necessarily attractive.

[01:16:57] There was a second back glass that had the rocket in the middle on a bunch of rainbow colors and then sort of some artwork with some little vignettes on either side.

[01:17:14] That was sort of a nice one too. I think that was painted, but I don't think it was ever shot. And then of course we had that third one.

[01:17:24] I thought that that back glass ended up bringing pretty nice, at least for my perspective, because when we went to Jim Lovell's house, the actual astronaut, and gave him a game, that was a perfect place for him to autograph the back glass right over the face where Tom Hanks wasn't.

[01:17:43] Now, did Bacon and the other guy did those guys get games by default?

[01:17:52] It sounds like Hanks didn't get one, but then he went out and bought them.

[01:17:56] Yeah, generally the studio, if it's a movie, the movie studio gets a certain number of games and they get some money.

[01:18:05] Certainly it's not the kind of money they would get if they sold 500,000 action figures.

[01:18:18] We're talking about some number of thousands of binball machines, and even if it was a run like Adam's family, to a movie studio, that's not a whole lot of money.

[01:18:34] Basically, when we did these games and did these licenses, it was sort of the ego trip before the director, the producer, whatever they were going to get to have their property on a pinball machine.

[01:18:47] It was a status symbol. They would have it in their office. You walk into a Dick Donner's office at Warner Brothers, and he's got his maverick, he's got his crypt, he's got his original Superman, he's got his lethal weapon.

[01:19:03] Here's living billboards of my work. You walked into Arnett Milchens office and he's got his own special customized game. Joel Silver had his game, he had it in the waiting room with his office at Warner.

[01:19:25] It was just a big thing to them. It was just like, okay, yeah, my license is one of the eight biggest licenses of the year. People want to license my thing.

[01:19:37] It was a real pain in the butt for the Consumer Licensing Division of Warner or Sony or whoever, because it wasn't going to be all that much in terms of income.

[01:19:53] It wasn't really a consumer product and it was a whole lot more difficult to approve how their license was being depicted than a t-shirt or a snow globe.

[01:20:11] It's a little bit harder to understand than a video game. You can send a video of the people playing the game, the pinball machine. There's all these different elements.

[01:20:29] You've got the box and the book that comes with it, the instructions. The pinball machine, you've got the back glass, you've got the play field. You're talking on the phone to somebody who doesn't even know what a play field is.

[01:20:43] I'm trying to put all this together. At some point, we even stopped working with Warner Brothers just because it was too hard to get stuff approved. But they would want to go back and change stuff.

[01:20:55] The fact that some code got changed midstream because we used stuff that was maybe not approved.

[01:21:09] One time, actually, when I was down here in North Carolina after I left the company, I got a phone call from somebody at University asking if so-and-so's voice was used in Apollo 13.

[01:21:27] This is like eight years later. With so-and-so's voice used in Apollo 13, they found out that they were in the game and now they're demanding compensation under their union contract.

[01:21:39] Was there voice in the game?

[01:21:43] I don't think it was. It was funny for that game that there was one quote from Hank's that we really wanted to use, which was a gentleman that's been a privilege flying with you.

[01:21:59] I actually did the recording for that as a sound alike. That was the only game that I ever did any sound for. The other one was me screaming blast off for the game.

[01:22:12] For the first starting the 13 ball multi-ball. I think it's been told before, but the 13 ball multi-ball is a story in and of itself.

[01:22:22] It was actually something that I came up with over dinner when we were at that Baywatch show. Originally Guns and Roses, they talked about having a 12 ball multi-ball.

[01:22:34] The original shooter lane, not the corrective shooter lane. There was the original shooter lane that was sort of the black powder coat.

[01:22:50] They would take the ball to the top lanes. There was the low level corrective shooter lane for when the ball got stuck in the-

[01:22:56] Right.

[01:22:58] I think the shooter would burn itself out.

[01:23:02] Before you tell that story, I always wondered this. Why didn't you guys just put a switch at the top of that shooter lane?

[01:23:12] Instead of the ball at the bottom of the shooter lane, that switch is closed. Shoot the ball. If that switch doesn't make up a top, don't put another ball in the shooter lane because it wouldn't make it up and then another ball would get in there.

[01:23:28] Then there would be two in the shooter lane. Those would never make it up. Then there would be three in the shooter lane. That would never make it up. Then the whole game is jammed up and it's a service call.

[01:23:37] The problem was that in some places in Europe or once the game had a lot of play, there were games that couldn't get one ball out.

[01:23:46] I would think having that switch.

[01:23:49] It couldn't even get the first ball out at all, especially when there was low line voltage. We had to change it.

[01:23:54] Right. Right. But I mean, did you guys see this coming?

[01:23:58] No, we never had a problem with it. But that thing was originally designed so that there was an additional six ball trough up above the top lanes.

[01:24:12] So you could hold six balls up there and then you'd have six more in the trough so you could have 12 at once.

[01:24:19] That was why it sort of had that sort of rise up and sort of that flat part there was going to be a stage.

[01:24:25] When you locked a ball, it may have been that there were just going to be six balls. I'm not sure.

[01:24:33] But when you locked a ball, what it was going to do was it was going to kick a ball up onto that stage and have pictures of all the band members up there and it would light up.

[01:24:43] So it was like trying to get the band on stage and of course the last one would be axled because he was always late.

[01:24:50] So that was why it sort of had that shape and after that thing went away, we just sort of left it.

[01:24:59] But we were sitting down at dinner and we were talking about a polythirteenth and a little on.

[01:25:04] I said, you know, Joe, since it's 13, since it's a polythirteenth, we should really have 13 ball, multi ball.

[01:25:10] And we sort of laughed about it. But then we came back and we designed it.

[01:25:16] And that ended up being a whole lot of fun.

[01:25:19] Yeah, no, I think that whole game I think is just, I mean, it's a lot of, it's novelty play but it's really cool and it's really well done.

[01:25:28] You know, my only criticism is that membrane switch in that trough that's in the upper left hand corner that loads the additional eight balls.

[01:25:39] You know, that membrane switch gets just beat the hell and, you know, I don't even know if they're still available.

[01:25:46] Yeah, I'm not sure if they are or not. I actually had a stack of them at some point.

[01:25:54] The first set of membrane switches that they came out with were wrong.

[01:26:00] That they, that the switch order in them was something like one, two, three, five, four, six, seven, eight or something like that.

[01:26:13] So when it was filling up, it would get confused or something like that or it didn't, you know, the in between switches weren't right.

[01:26:21] You know, and it would really probably only be an issue if there were like three or four balls missing to start with.

[01:26:29] But I think I kept a bunch of those just in case I ever got a game that I actually had one.

[01:26:35] I had a sample game and it didn't work very well. So I sold it to somebody.

[01:26:38] I actually sold it to the, to the same fellow who, the same fellow who has, who also has my guns and roses, I sold those two games at some point.

[01:26:49] Yeah, I don't think Apollo 13 lived up to, in some ways, lived up to what it should have been mechanically.

[01:26:57] That there were a lot of games where you would shoot it up into the rocket and it wouldn't stick.

[01:27:01] Of course, if the moon broke, that was just sort of eye candy.

[01:27:05] But, you know, for me, trying to get, trying to get multi-ball and keep on shooting that damn thing and having it not stick in there, that was, that was pretty lame.

[01:27:14] And that was pretty much the reason that I got rid of my game.

[01:27:17] Is that whatever I banter, fooled with or whatever, I just couldn't make it work right.

[01:27:25] Yeah, I've got one and it's, you know, every once in a while it kind of gets confused with loading the balls in that backdrop.

[01:27:33] And, you know, it's, yeah, you're right, mechanically it's probably not quite up to stuff.

[01:27:39] You know, it is a cool game and that 13 ball, multi-ball.

[01:27:42] Yeah, I mean, there's nothing like it.

[01:27:44] Yeah, it's a real eye opener.

[01:27:47] And I think that in that sort of era of games, we did pretty good visually in terms of making things that interacted with the ball or doing sort of different kind of toys.

[01:28:06] You know, it was sort of really, it was different from Guns and Roses, which was, you know, a very sort of straightforward in your face pinball.

[01:28:13] You know, it had a couple, you know, it had the side plunger and, you know, it had the magnets.

[01:28:19] But, it was, you know, the ball would never, ball would never disappear and reappear anywhere on Guns and Roses.

[01:28:27] It was really, really sort of, it was really very straightforward.

[01:28:31] And, you know, Apollo sort of was, Apollo sort of brought the, sort of brought the unexpected.

[01:28:40] And, you know, a lot of people saw it and they didn't believe that there were 13 balls.

[01:28:45] They saw the sign on the top.

[01:28:47] And, you know, they can't possibly be true and then they would play it and they would actually get it.

[01:28:52] And, I think that was pretty cool.

[01:28:55] Now, what about Golden Eye? How was, how was working on that product? Did you get to meet any of the personalities, you know, in the movie or anything?

[01:29:02] Well, Golden Eye was interesting.

[01:29:05] Golden Eye was most interesting is that was because that was the first game where the hammer really fell from the Japanese management at Sega that said,

[01:29:15] you have to make your games for less money or you will not be making games at all.

[01:29:21] We will shut you down.

[01:29:23] So, Golden Eye was designed by Ward Pemberton who had been at Valley.

[01:29:33] I believe he, if I'm right, I believe he designed Fabham.

[01:29:38] But, he'd been at Valley and he actually took over and designed Gilligan's Island.

[01:29:47] When the designer who was working on that project was killed died in an accident.

[01:29:56] Ward took over that and he was also a fireman.

[01:30:00] He was a Chicago fireman, he still is.

[01:30:04] And, was also doing pinball at the same time, which was sort of interesting.

[01:30:08] So, when he had to go on duty, we wouldn't see him for a little while.

[01:30:11] But, there were a lot of features on Golden Eye that got taken out.

[01:30:16] There was this skill shop thing where there was this big apparatus up at the top that had a window that was opening and closing this building.

[01:30:24] And, you had to time the shot so that it would go all the way up into the building and go through the window and not miss.

[01:30:32] And, there was some more complicated ramps and one-way gates and all this stuff.

[01:30:39] A lot of it got taken out.

[01:30:42] It really sort of hurt Ward's feelings and he didn't stick around after the project.

[01:30:50] Golden Eye was interesting because it was sort of my, I wouldn't say first experience with sort of this high-powered licensing.

[01:31:05] But, you know, I started to go on licensing trips with Joe and talk to some of these folks that were pitching a license or some of these movie directors.

[01:31:15] And, they were really busy getting white star and everything ready for a show.

[01:31:22] So, I actually got to make a solo licensing trip that they sent me over to London to watch a rough cut of Golden Eye.

[01:31:31] And, watch a rough cut of Golden Eye and to, you know, give them a scene list and negotiate about what sound clips we could get and what video stuff we could get.

[01:31:47] And, that was a really fun trip that they took me down to this special theater that they would only use for screenings.

[01:31:56] I don't remember exactly what the arrangement was, but the production company for Bond is right down across from Green Park.

[01:32:07] It's two doors down from the original Hard Rock FAA.

[01:32:11] And, they took me up to this, we hopped on the tube and went, I don't know about five or six stations away to this special screening theater that they took me down to.

[01:32:25] And, I think, the theater that they had for, I believe, MGM and I think MGM and Universal have a partnership where they co-distribute all their stuff to Britain, Britain, the rest of Europe and Africa and the Near East or something like that.

[01:32:45] And, so no other, there's this sort of plush, you know, 20-seat movie theater. And, of course, this is before, you know, sort of the fancy days of, you know, home theaters that are built like that.

[01:32:59] And, so I'm there and it was a licensing screening.

[01:33:04] So, there's like these executives from BMW, executives from Rolex, you know, executives from, you know, Tanker Age Inn or whoever else had the, and all these people had the product placement.

[01:33:17] So, they were here watching this rough cut of the movie that, you know, had, had basically all the movie, but it didn't really have very many sound effects and stuff like that.

[01:33:26] You know, they're watching it and, you know, they got their stopwatches out seeing how many seconds the Rolex is on screen and stuff like that. And here I am, you know, pinball guy.

[01:33:37] You know, frantically taking notes on, you know, exactly what made it into the movie from the script and what didn't of what, of what we think would be really cool.

[01:33:47] And, you know, trying to keep track of, you know, stuff, okay, you know, we've got this on the back glass, but it's not actually in the movie, maybe we need to take it out.

[01:33:57] Stuff like that, but the bond people were really great to work with. And, of course, Pierce wasn't there. Pierce actually lives out in California.

[01:34:05] And, it was funny, Joe and Joe Camico and Brian Schmidt actually flew out there to his house and did a sound recording there, but he had a cold.

[01:34:17] And that's why a lot of the stuff in that game does not sound like Pierce because he had a cold.

[01:34:23] So, even James Bond gets a cold.

[01:34:29] All right, we're going to take a little break at talking with Orin Day, programmer at D.D.E. Sega and Stern will be right back after this message.

[01:34:37] Deep in the forest of Eastern Canada, you will find something, well, ground breaking and something that's very, very pinball, but something that's really, really small.

[01:34:52] Presenting classic play field reproductions.

[01:34:55] Two guys in their basement.

[01:34:58] We've got the passion, we've got the gear, and we've got the quality.

[01:35:02] Doing our very best to remake classic and more modern pinball replacement parts.

[01:35:07] Classic play field reproduction.

[01:35:12] Play fields, back glasses, plastic sets.

[01:35:21] On the web at classicplayfields.com.

[01:35:25] This portion of Topcast is brought to you by Pin Game Journal covering the world of pinball.

[01:35:30] It's them online at www.pingamejournal.com.

[01:35:35] All right, we're back with Orin Day, programmer for D.D.E. Sega and Stern.

[01:35:40] The first game that we did that was really sort of the lesser or the, as we tried to put a good spin on it, doing less with more game was actually Twister.

[01:35:54] And, Golden Eye, like I started out with John Carpenter doing the dots and I sort of finished it up after he left.

[01:36:07] But it was almost like I wasn't going to be in an explicit programming role in that game and then sort of ended up getting thrown back into it.

[01:36:19] So I maybe did a little bit of the ideas for the rules, but Twister and Apollo 13 I really did a lot.

[01:36:29] And those were both games like Guns and quite a few others where I was working with Lonnie Rob.

[01:36:37] And Lonnie and I sort of really clicked in terms of doing a lot of the rules together and figuring stuff out and trying new stuff.

[01:36:49] And that was, I think we were a good team.

[01:36:54] You know, in Apollo 13 was there a lot of switch compensation code that you had to write to have to deal with these 13 balls or wasn't that big of a deal?

[01:37:05] Well, we couldn't use, of course we couldn't use switch compensation as Williams did because they had a patent.

[01:37:12] What do you mean? What was the patent on and what?

[01:37:15] That you couldn't do switch fill-in.

[01:37:22] Like if Williams determined that the ramp exit switch was bad after there are 50 games or whatever had not been hit, then they had a patent that they would maybe go ahead.

[01:37:40] And if you hit the target that was next to the ramp it would give you credit for it.

[01:37:47] And I think it was something that I came up with that I said, well, you know, we can do some compensation, but we can do it in a way that doesn't violate their patent.

[01:38:05] We have a ramp entrance switch and we have a ramp exit switch.

[01:38:12] And we also have an in-lane switch if the ramp comes back to the flipper.

[01:38:21] Why don't we put in our code that if you hit the ramp entrance switch and then you hit the in-lane and those two switches are consecutive,

[01:38:33] that it always gives you credit for a ramp.

[01:38:38] And then that way if the switch that's up on the ramp doesn't work then you still get credit for it.

[01:38:46] Of course it takes a little bit longer and if there's a lock or a device or a diverter or something up there then that's not going to work, but that would be one way that you could do it.

[01:39:01] But you know that was sort of the level of our fill-in that we sort of had to be a little bit clever that if you had a whole bunch of targets and you had to finish all the targets for something really important then you better spot a target somewhere else.

[01:39:18] But you know otherwise otherwise if one of those targets breaks like for example if you're trying to spell Frankenstein and you've got all those targets and one of them doesn't work then you're really going to be in trouble if you've got an important feature there and nobody can ever get it.

[01:39:38] They're not going to like your game but if one of the targets is busted and you can you give credit for a target from somewhere else.

[01:39:48] You know like even if it's making a combo or making a ramp shot or something like that just even do it silently then it might be that your game is broken and nobody's going to notice.

[01:40:00] So that thing were like on WPC games when you turn them on and they give you this test report of you know switches that you know haven't been hit in so many games or so many instances.

[01:40:10] That was patented and you guys could not do that.

[01:40:13] Well that wasn't necessarily patented because we did it too but it's just that we couldn't change the way that our we couldn't change the way that other switches behaved based on the brokenness of other particular switch.

[01:40:28] How could they ever prove that? How would they ever know without senior source code?

[01:40:34] Just anecdotally in the game.

[01:40:37] And they would actually bring to court something like that?

[01:40:41] Well they I wouldn't be surprised.

[01:40:45] Did you ever have to deal with any lawsuits brought in by Williams on Dene E. Sega?

[01:40:51] I did not but the big lawsuit over the word multi-ball was just sort of was wrapped up was wrapped up before I started.

[01:41:03] And you know everybody was everybody was sort of afraid of that happening again.

[01:41:09] And you know we were very sensitive to the we were very sensitive to the patents that we had a big book of printouts of all the you know all the Williams patents and all the got lead patents and all this.

[01:41:21] Like for example when when we did when we did Golden Q.

[01:41:29] Williams still had the in line drop target patent that they had gotten from Valley is good for 17 years.

[01:41:35] So we could not use we could not use in line drop targets with a single reset.

[01:41:41] But if we wanted to have in line drops we would have to have we would have to have each one would have to be a separate resetable target.

[01:41:53] Now let's let's talk about Twister. What was your involvement in that game?

[01:42:00] Pretty much pretty much a lot of the a lot of the rule stuff a lot of the rule stuff right from the get go.

[01:42:10] And that was another game where I wrote all the speech.

[01:42:14] And there's actually sort of a funny story about that that we actually had some silly speech that we'd hope to use for a homerom.

[01:42:22] And that actually that actually Helen Hunt didn't want to say.

[01:42:30] And the actually Yandobon who was the director of Twister actually was kind enough to direct our recording session that we were doing it over the phone.

[01:42:45] And he was actually in the studio and we you know he sort of had he had a real good idea what we wanted.

[01:42:50] So he was actually directing it along with along with Brian Schmidt.

[01:42:54] And she's like I don't want to say that. I wouldn't say that. My character would never even say that.

[01:43:00] So anyway you know we're obviously obviously inspired by you know some of the homeromps that the Williams guys have done.

[01:43:08] Now how come I've never seen a diddy say a homerom for any of these games?

[01:43:13] They really aren't any. Oh they really aren't none.

[01:43:17] You know Brian Schmidt was you know sort of against the idea and he was also really busy.

[01:43:24] And we also sort of you know recognize that you know we had we had enough to do and you know we really sort of needed to we really sort of needed to put all of our energy into

[01:43:37] put all of our energy into doing the production games especially when I was doing when I myself was doing four games a year.

[01:43:45] You know and did that for three years and also did novelties and did stuff like the mini Viper.

[01:43:53] You know I was I had no if I was going to go home and do anything that was pinball I should play pinball I shouldn't be programming more of it.

[01:44:02] Well let's talk about mini Viper. What was the deal with mini Viper and your involvement with that versus the regular full size Viper?

[01:44:11] Well we had talked about ways to we're always interested in ways that we could change the pinball market.

[01:44:23] We wanted to do things to make to make our games look new because face it you know you look at a game you look at a game today and other than the theme there's really nothing substantially different.

[01:44:40] From an Adams family to whatever's rolling off the line now.

[01:44:49] There's you know maybe there maybe there's internal differences that we know about that it's a better hardware system and you know and so forth but there's been really nothing to really change.

[01:44:59] Change the game so that if you took somebody who'd never seen a pinball machine and you know you put these two side by side I mean obviously if you put them next to a paragon they're going to say

[01:45:09] oh yeah that's old and this is new because this has a screen and this other one this has a monitor on it or a screen and the other one doesn't.

[01:45:21] But you know there was nothing there was nothing new so we were trying to make things that were new and different.

[01:45:26] We tried the big dot matrix display didn't work.

[01:45:30] We tried having sort of that that Sega showcase back box like was on space jam and and on starship troopers and and on the trilogy star wars trilogy.

[01:45:47] Didn't make didn't didn't make a whole lot of difference and one of the things that we thought was that you know with with you know places like seven eleven not having room for a pinball machine anymore and bar saying well you know the pinball machine takes up too much space blah blah blah.

[01:46:07] Let's go back and try and make a game that has sort of the same cabinet dimensions as a as like a 50s godly wood rail or you know a 70s wedge hit game like volley.

[01:46:28] You know that's good that's make something a little smaller that's very easy for that's lighter.

[01:46:35] I don't think we really achieve that but it's that's supposed to be lighter so that so that it's really easy for one person to break down and move all by themselves.

[01:46:45] You know it don't have to be a big hulk and guy and you know let's let's see if we can let's see if we can make this happen you know we took the course there was.

[01:46:56] I know that game has been has been pretty well documented by mark but it has you know has one single sheet of glass in the back instead of instead of having the glass and display in a separate mount you know stuff like that that might just make it be a little lighter.

[01:47:15] You know sort of I think it was sort of the same ideas when capcom did break shot but here's something that's a little bit here's something that's a little bit simpler.

[01:47:26] Yeah but didn't this come out at the same time as as William safe cracker I mean are you saying that this was designed independent of safe cracker you guys didn't see safe cracker you didn't know about safe cracker.

[01:47:39] I don't think it was related to safe cracker we've been talking the other thing that was interesting that we talked about is that in in 1995 or 96 we talked about and it may have been even earlier it may have been towards the end of towards the end of 94 95 I think it was around the time Baywatch was on the line talking about trying to make games in a generic cabinet.

[01:48:08] And and sell playfields and games as kits very much like the pinball 2000 model you know make something where you could where you could easily we get you'd have an attractive generic pinball cabinet or you could change the side art sort of go with that video game model so you could just drop something in.

[01:48:29] So you could drop something in and have a new game and we sort of figured out that we couldn't make the margin on it so we sort of dropped that idea there wasn't any there wasn't enough money to be made compared to making dedicated pinball machines even if we even if we sold more and you know maybe maybe carry maybe carry didn't recognize it at first or maybe it wasn't as big but we also knew that that would sort of that that would sort of drop the value of pinball machine because it would take away from the game.

[01:48:58] It would it would hurt the collector market because you wouldn't have you know these dedicated games that an operator could you know turn around and turn around and sell to a home to a home person and have that be have that be a big part of his return on the investment.

[01:49:17] Now on the mini Viper um did that ever get really get finished and how did the cool I end up with that I would have figured they were one of the guys you know at at you know your company would have kept that well it was.

[01:49:34] Remember exactly how that worked out.

[01:49:36] That I did all the programming on that game and had something in my contract that I was supposed to get one of each game that I that I program now of course it I don't know if it was if I don't think it ever said each production game or anything like that but I think we work I think we work something out but I didn't particularly want it and you know it came I think it you know it went it was.

[01:50:06] I went to the trade show it came back it's that I remember if we took that out to a one of herb silver shows out in the out in Las Vegas or not if it made that trip and back one time too but of course you know it was it did end up missing a bunch of parts and you know stuff broke and stuff like that and and Mark sort of put it back together but I viewed that game as having the code being finished.

[01:50:34] That you know it might have it might have gotten a couple more features in there but it was just supposed to be it was just supposed to be a simple game for the street that they would you know that would they would drop into a bar.

[01:50:46] That was that was basically sort of the idea of it and I actually programed it very quickly I worked from the I worked from the twister code and I did the I did the game software in the display software probably in about three weeks.

[01:51:02] Now why didn't you have any involvement with the you know with the regular the full size viper.

[01:51:08] Oh yeah I did oh you did okay I did dots on that too and did did some of the rules and some of the speech scripts and actually actually had quite a bit of involvement on the sort of interim viper the one that had the car on the spinning platform.

[01:51:28] That was actually a game that I'm sure you've seen the flyers for that game that there were there were actually three versions that was there was the mini viper there was a game that was a dodge viper and then the production game was viper night driving.

[01:51:45] The interim game which had sort of different artwork and didn't have any of the man come all our stuff.

[01:51:53] You know it was more sort of a straight ahead a straight ahead dodge viper game.

[01:52:01] I think we made like ten of them or something like that we made a bunch of flyers and we were trying to sell them to viper owners at the big viper convention there's an annual viper meat.

[01:52:14] I think I think that year it was in Florida the reason that we were interested in viper to start with is that Joe Camico had one and then eventually he had another one he had one of the original one of the original red viper and then I then he got one of the got one of the blue with white stripe GT's.

[01:52:38] So that was sort of his source of interest and of course Mark was in the auto industry with his job and everything else.

[01:52:50] I don't remember if he actually bought the game from Gary or exactly how that ended it worked out but I don't think anybody begrudged it to him.

[01:52:58] It seemed like a lot of the sort of prototype games sort of went out in a weird way and I don't remember exactly what they did to compensate me for that.

[01:53:08] I think I might have gotten a Star Wars trilogy whitewood or something like that.

[01:53:17] Now what about Independence Day? What was your thoughts about that game?

[01:53:21] That was a fun game. I think by then that was, well Twister was three games into the four color play field process. Independence Day was the fourth and I think we were really sort of starting to get that figured out and make it look better by that point.

[01:53:44] Independence Day was a lot of fun. I thought we had some real solid rules on that and I like doing display and it was probably the first one of our licenses in a long time that was a really successful movie.

[01:54:04] I'm not sure that Bond at that point was necessarily hitting our demographic. I'm not sure that Apollo 13 did but I think that Twister did either but Independence Day was pretty much a box office success all over the world and really hit sort of that 20 kind of person.

[01:54:29] And it was one that we were able to come with pretty much in a timely manner when the movie was released. That was a game that we had in the summer.

[01:54:41] That was the first game that Rob Hurtado did and of course he was at Williams for quite a while and worked with people like Steve Richie.

[01:54:54] I thought he did a really super mechanical design job on that game. I mean the one knock is that the alien heads, the alien heads sometimes get brittle and break.

[01:55:07] But man those ramp shots were good, those loop shots were good. It was a real smooth playing game and when you shot them it did interesting stuff.

[01:55:18] Now what about space jam? Did you have any interface with Jordan on doing that or with Warner Brothers or whatever?

[01:55:26] It was funny that of course Warner was the difficult company to work with. Whereas I categorized maybe Sony and Universal based on people that were there at the time as being a little bit easier to work with.

[01:55:46] And certainly the looney tunes are sort of their flagship property so they were very protective of that. But having Morgan Weisling out there doing the art and having him be such a super artist, he did a great job on that package.

[01:56:05] And we had some issues with the sound with getting a looney tune characters recorded that versus using our sound alike using Fred or using their sound alike or whatever I think there was some sort of controversy with that.

[01:56:23] But Jordan was really cool about it and of course there was sort of that pre-existing relationship because of the custom Jordan pinball machine.

[01:56:38] So that actually went pretty well and actually was one of the people who got to take the pinball machine over to his house which was cool.

[01:56:48] He wasn't there but got to meet his wife and she gave us the big tour and everything and we got it all set up for them.

[01:56:55] So it was a pretty fun project. Of course Launey and I both really liked basketball and Joe Kameco certainly liked basketball too.

[01:57:07] So the balls were I think that was the season that the balls won 72 games. It was a really fun time. I put a bunch of basketball trivia questions in that game that was kind of fine.

[01:57:22] There were a couple little digs in there of course since I went to Duke and he went to Carolina.

[01:57:28] They were little subtle questions and it was a fun game.

[01:57:37] Now did you want to enter a hole? I wish that center scoop wouldn't worry out so quickly.

[01:57:44] We tried some new decals on that game too. I think that was the first game that we sort of used the four color process bumpy decals like the ones that were on the back of the backboard.

[01:57:57] There were two backboards, the skill shot backboard and then the regular basket that you could shoot.

[01:58:05] I didn't think that those ended up being quite so great.

[01:58:11] It was an attractive game. I think we had a little bit of trouble with the registration right on the cabinet so it looked like a basketball and just not messed up.

[01:58:24] I don't know getting the orange and the black all lined up.

[01:58:29] We actually made one regular screen back box for that game because we didn't know if we were going to be able to get the Sega Showcase cabinets in or not.

[01:58:42] We had there were wood Sega Showcase cabinets, metal Sega Showcase cabinets, all kinds of different incarnations.

[01:58:52] I know we made some metal ones on there that were really heavy.

[01:58:58] It made the game absolutely way at tonne.

[01:59:05] That was fun. We did the first game. I think we did 3D back glasses for too.

[01:59:12] We had some sort of thing where we could make the back glass out of a lenticular lens so that it would appear to be 3D.

[01:59:21] I think we made maybe 100 or 150 of those. That was actually fun.

[01:59:28] I think it's something myatic. I actually do have that one screen wood back box.

[01:59:35] If I would have a space jam I would probably put that on there.

[01:59:40] You didn't weren't involved with the recording for the sound with Jordan or anything. I was wondering how that went.

[01:59:47] I don't even remember if we did anything special with Jordan in there. I think the looney tunes did most of the stuff.

[01:59:58] I think the Jordan stuff was all from the movie.

[02:00:02] How was Star Wars trilogy and working with that license?

[02:00:08] I recall that one being pretty easy.

[02:00:14] We had that spot on back glass which was just so perfect.

[02:00:21] There was no back and forth with that at all.

[02:00:28] The play field got approved quickly.

[02:00:31] They were cool that they weren't looking at every single detail on the dots or the rules or stuff like that.

[02:00:38] Typically I would do a lot.

[02:00:43] During a project I would do a decent amount of video recording of the dot matrix display.

[02:00:52] We didn't have Brian Schmidt in house.

[02:00:57] What I would do was I would make a video tape of all the dot matrix display effects that needed to have some kind of big sound go with it like a jack pot or something like that that needed its own special sound effect.

[02:01:11] I would go ahead and make a video tape of everything that I had done to a certain point.

[02:01:23] Then we would get a messenger and send a video tape up to him in Evanston and he would do the sounds.

[02:01:30] We would actually get him via modem or something like that.

[02:01:37] It was before email attachments were the thing that he would have an FTP server set up on his computer or something and we dial him up and download the new sound code.

[02:01:51] I remember making a lot of 321 go video tapes for him.

[02:01:58] We would generally at the end of a project or when we were getting ready to go to production do video tapes of most of the display effects or at least the art as it looked like on the dot matrix display and sent it out to hollywood or whoever.

[02:02:12] I think some of them would actually look at it probably others would just stick it in their desk drawer and say yes fine.

[02:02:22] A lot of them didn't even know what they were looking at.

[02:02:25] There was one person that I would always put a nice cover letter in there as one person that said why don't all the people orange?

[02:02:36] Well you know that's what color display is.

[02:02:43] We just wanted to check.

[02:02:47] Now what about the lost world Jurassic Park? How was that game?

[02:02:52] That was a good one to work on.

[02:02:57] We were working with the universal on that one and they were generally very cooperative.

[02:03:04] That one like Independence Day was good and we were able to reuse some of the toys that were made for the movie for that.

[02:03:18] The first Jurassic Park had those little plastic dinosaurs and those came from a scientific or classroom supply place and then everything else was custom made.

[02:03:30] The little light up dinosaur that was inside of the egg I think that was a licensed Jurassic product.

[02:03:37] I think we had a couple other licensed little action figures or dinosaurs and stuff like that that we put on the game.

[02:03:47] That probably wasn't our strongest game.

[02:03:54] But I think we did do a good job of incorporating some of the interesting elements that were in the first Jurassic into the game that we had the smartness all.

[02:04:07] We had some of the previous features like that, some of the old display effects I went and got back out of Jurassic or some of the art that people who had played the first Jurassic.

[02:04:23] We had a classic and we're really paying attention would probably notice.

[02:04:28] We also had a hidden video mode in there.

[02:04:33] There was a copy of the Space Jam video mode that actually had four velociraptors and a T-Rex shooting free throws that we actually had the basketball video mode hidden in there.

[02:04:46] How hard is it to get that mode?

[02:04:50] I don't even remember how you get it.

[02:04:57] I think you start the regular video mode and maybe you hold down a flipper button or something like that and it comes up.

[02:05:03] I went after research that.

[02:05:07] That was sort of a funny little easter egg.

[02:05:10] Did you do very many easter egg or hidden modes or anything in your games?

[02:05:17] Not a whole lot. There was a really funny one that we had set up in Baywatch and because we didn't do it at the very end and because we didn't do another code release it never actually got put into production.

[02:05:31] Of course the infamous Baywatch thing is the drowned Kevin Martin during multiple restart.

[02:05:42] For the five jackpots there's actually five swimmers that are swimming there and you save each one when you make a jackpot.

[02:05:52] If you get a multi ball restart and you press the start button then Kevin actually goes down into the water and will piece a text pops up that says you drowned Kevin and then the dolphin comes back up where he was.

[02:06:11] That's probably the most notable one.

[02:06:14] We did have the Velociraptors and T-Rex shooting baskets.

[02:06:20] I think we also had Intrillogy.

[02:06:23] We also had Darth Vader and four stormtroopers shooting baskets too.

[02:06:28] It was sort of an inside joke that we would have that video mode in all the games.

[02:06:34] Eventually we stopped doing it because it took up too much space. It was just sort of a funny thing that was in there that we knew about.

[02:06:42] How about X-Files? How was working with that and did you get to work with any of the personalities in that one?

[02:06:48] X-Files was an interesting license. We actually got the X-Files license and the show kept on getting more and more popular.

[02:07:00] For some reason that was the project that kept on getting put off and pushed back.

[02:07:07] By the time Fox was also growing as a network then.

[02:07:16] By the time we actually got around to doing that game, I think there was actually some resistance that we become too science fictiony too.

[02:07:28] We had done Independence Day and Trilogy and Space Jam which really wasn't about space but headspace in the name.

[02:07:40] Our licenses were too similar, which is one reason why Viper got stuck in there.

[02:07:47] There became so many layers of licensing people and management people and Fox people and whatever.

[02:07:58] We ended up with somebody who knew absolutely nothing about Pinball who wanted to tell us every single way that we could use every single sound quote.

[02:08:08] Every single display you can't just take sound bites and use them out of context. You can only use them in the same context that they were used in the episode.

[02:08:17] We really ended up making a bad game. That was we were not at all pleased about how that ended up turning out.

[02:08:29] They didn't really want to do any custom speech at all.

[02:08:32] We've got lots of weird, there's no extra ball or anything. Why would Agent Mulder ever say extra ball?

[02:08:41] What we wanted to say to this woman is because he's in a damn pinball machine. He's in perfect context for a pinball machine.

[02:08:49] They were very holy with him now with their license.

[02:08:52] It really ended up being a project that there were several times that if we had been a bigger company and we weren't the game equivalent of living paycheck to paycheck, each game is going to have to be successful or we'll go out of business.

[02:09:15] We couldn't just cancel a game. That would have been as much money as we'd spend on it to that point. It would have been financial suicide.

[02:09:25] We had meetings where they were just making this impossible. I wish we could just walk away and never have made this game.

[02:09:41] I think that really shows in the game. I don't think they had a lot of spirit.

[02:09:53] We had the mechanical problem where the magnet would actually work through the wood very, very quickly. We had to put that steel plate up over it.

[02:10:06] Lonnie had written code where it would do all sorts of ball throwing tricks. It would shoot up to the ball that was caught with another ball.

[02:10:22] It was really easy to hit that ball and knock it into the file cabinet and replace it with the first ball.

[02:10:32] Sort of like those swinging ball things that are sitting in the deck toy. That same inertia effect.

[02:10:42] Here's one ball. You hit it with another ball and guess what? Now this second ball stuck on the magnet and the first ball goes somewhere else. It was really cool. We messed with it and messed with it.

[02:10:56] Then when we had to put that steel plate on there it all went away.

[02:11:02] What about the Starship troopers? How did that game go? That was the most fun game to work on at all.

[02:11:14] I started working with Joe Balser and Joe Camico on getting that third flipper in there. I always wanted to have a third flipper at the bottom and do something interesting and have some kind of design that was like haunted house or Paragon or some of the old wide body games that had multiple flippers down there.

[02:11:38] What was the arrangement that we came up with with that one little flipper that had the separate buttons so if you didn't want to use it you didn't have to.

[02:11:45] But if you did use it you would get some kind of a bonus. The licensing people on that project were absolutely delightful to work with.

[02:11:55] We worked with one of the producers John Davidson who actually had before Starship Troopers produced Ghost. He really wanted to do science fiction.

[02:12:10] He actually I believe produced and directed some of the or had big involvement in some of the subsequent Starship Troopers projects that there was a direct to video movie that they did at Starship Troopers 2.

[02:12:24] Some of the animated Starship Troopers stuff he was just really into that license. We went out there and we saw just these amazing for the time wonderful CGI display effects.

[02:12:40] And or CGI not display effects but movie stuff where they've got this scene where it's like the ten commandments where there's all the people running into the frame except instead of 10,000 people it's 10,000 gigantic bugs.

[02:12:58] We're like wow this is really cool this is you know this is really going to hit our demographic and you know they were really cooperative they gave us everything we needed they gave us speech they gave us we had Paul Verhoeven coming in and directing the speech thing much like Yandupont did for Twister.

[02:13:20] And you know all the people that were in the movie doing you know all kind of speech for us and it maybe could have sounded a little bit better but I think I think we made a pretty good game there and the rules changed a little.

[02:13:40] It's not really the rules there aren't the original way that it was envisioned but I think all in all it was it was it was a pretty good project.

[02:13:56] I don't think I don't think the half targets in that game are quite so good those hard plastic half targets. In fact the Starship Troopers is a game that I have and I've actually got regular regular old targets that I'm ready to put into that game and get rid of those hard plastic targets because they just don't feel good and don't score well.

[02:14:20] Yeah I never liked those either. Now what about some lost in space how was that one? Well lost in space was an interesting project for me.

[02:14:33] During that during the time of during the time of lost in space it was becoming obvious that there are going to have to be more cuts at Sega if the place was if the place was going to survive.

[02:14:53] So it was interesting I was under contract then and had like probably another year on my contract but at that point I started dating Karen who is not my wife who lived down here in North Carolina and I was coming down and coming down and seeing her and of course I had to have basketball tickets so I needed to get down here and I was going to have a basketball ticket.

[02:15:23] November, December, January, February, March quite a bit anyway but at some point during lost in space they decided that they were going to need to have a head count reduction but they sort of had a way around it.

[02:15:42] It wasn't so much that they would that it was absolute money that they just needed to get people off of the books. So they said well Joe said to me well you know or we know you want to go go live down in North Carolina.

[02:15:54] Why don't we just give you a new contract as a contractor and you can just do games from there and you know come back a couple times a month and whatever fly back stay with your parents it won't cost us all that much money.

[02:16:11] I thought about it for a while and I said yeah I think I'm going to go ahead and try this I'm going to move down here.

[02:16:16] So lost in space was the first game where I actually did some programming from down here. It was a certain amount of time into the project so I was just sort of adding on display stuff but back then by that point it was a great deal.

[02:16:39] It was a little bit easier to email stuff or get stuff over the internet or something like that. So we were sort of emailing stuff back and forth and you know I would write display effects down here and then make e-pronged images and send them up along with the descriptive stuff and artists would send me email.

[02:17:04] And that actually worked very well. Of course lost in space the movie wasn't absolutely dog we walked out of that movie and we said oh my god I can't believe that we did this.

[02:17:13] We've got to try and make this game as much like the classic TV series as possible and they actually had actually for the for the trade show actually had the actor who played Dr. Smith on the original.

[02:17:30] TV show was actually in our booth at the trade show and you know it I don't think it was I don't think it was that bad of a game but I think it was a theme that a theme that nobody was really interested in.

[02:17:44] Yeah and it didn't sell very well speaking of which a lot of these themes you know Sega are in a date eastern they were really big on licensed like everything was licensed.

[02:17:56] What was your feeling about this you know opposed to Williams were Williams did some licenses but they also came out with you know their own original themes as it may be.

[02:18:06] What was your feeling on that well Joe was Joe it was and of course is very close friends with Larry tomorrow and I think I think you know we were dead east was big on the licensing maybe before Williams was.

[02:18:25] But remember Larry making a comment about you know the difference the difference in sales between fun house and atoms and how big of a part that the license was to that and you know about how you know he really thought that license games were the way to go and you know that was something that Joe was already convinced of.

[02:18:52] The thing that we maybe didn't see and it's something that Stern definitely sees now is that the best license to get is something that people know and not something that's going to be an overnight flash in the pan.

[02:19:12] That you know now if they're doing movies at Stern it's going to be the third movie of a trilogy or you know around around that you know like Spider-Man like Lord of the Rings you know that it's not going to be something that it's not going to be something that's so much of a one and done.

[02:19:33] I think we you know when we did something like X files I think there was even though it wasn't such a great pinball game I think there was some residents among the fans and that was sort of a popular thing.

[02:19:45] But you know it wasn't like you know you do this thing and it's and it's gone.

[02:19:52] But we felt like licenses got a foot in the door that it was something that we get a first point it was something that would that the operator would immediately know what it is.

[02:20:04] And that that was that that was a way that that was a way that we could sell games and it was also a way that we would have material that we could start off with and be able to work on that.

[02:20:20] Because we didn't we didn't have people who were going to spend nine months or 12 months or 15 months coming up with a game concept and taking it from start to finish.

[02:20:33] You know we just weren't staff that way you know we didn't have we didn't have eight or ten design teams you know there was there was rarely anybody on the bench at our place.

[02:20:47] That was you know that was one way that you know that we could that we could break even if we made a small number of games you know that we didn't have a threshold of you know so many thousand games like Williams did where they had to make at least as many games to break even our number was a lot lower because we were a lot leaner.

[02:21:10] Now golden queue that they only made ten of those what you know what was the deal with that game and and why did the you know the theme kind of get shifted over.

[02:21:21] Well that was that was an interesting time when when the company was sort of in transition.

[02:21:33] Now I wasn't maybe there to see all of it but I was you know sort of still part of it that I'm down here in North Carolina and you know I do the do the dots on lost in space do the dots on Godzilla you know do some novelty games from down here.

[02:21:53] And then and then do the dots on do the dots on South Park and then Joe Camicose is you know says I'm leaving.

[02:22:04] At any he takes off and golden queue was sort of you know we it was it was sort of an experiment you know was the eight ball deluxe play field.

[02:22:14] They you know tried that you know always trying new things trying that countdown countdown scoring system and that tournament scoring system you know trying to make trying to make pinball a little bit different and have it make more money you know that.

[02:22:30] Bowling is a game where if you're really good it's more it doesn't last as long than if you're really bad.

[02:22:40] It involves the game but if you're really good your games last longer and you win more free games so you know that was sort of a way that you know introduced a time

[02:22:52] element and if you're really good you could finish it more quickly and you could have a sense of satisfaction but the game during prime time would still would suddenly be ready to take another quarter.

[02:23:04] You know that you wouldn't be tying you wouldn't be tying it up from seven to ten p.m. on you know on a couple of bucks.

[02:23:13] That was how you know that was that was certainly something operators were sensitive to that if you get the one really good player in there then the game's not going to make any money.

[02:23:20] You could play but we'll make any money.

[02:23:25] Right. Looking for balance so.

[02:23:27] But that didn't work out that concept didn't work.

[02:23:30] I don't think it did that you know it came to expo and you know I don't think I wasn't there for that I wasn't there for that whole expo.

[02:23:39] I think that that was in I think that was November of 98 that that was there and you know so it basically got re-themed into sharky shoot out.

[02:23:57] I mean with you know with some mechanical changes and obviously some significant rule changes when when those guys came on board but yeah it was you know it was something we tried it didn't work you know we we tried a lot of things we we tried making that that irons and woods

[02:24:18] and ball game that was based on golf that if you did really well it would give would dispense a golf ball you know that didn't work you know just just trying new things.

[02:24:33] Now the next one that looks like you worked on was Godzilla.

[02:24:38] That was that was a completely from down here game or just about completely from down here actually moved down here full time on on I think July 1st of I think July 1st of of 98 was when I took the is when I actually started in my apartment down here I think I took a I took a 20 foot

[02:25:05] 20 foot truck of all my games down here I think around memorial day of that year that was that was an interesting drive with the I don't know how many been all machines and video games and

[02:25:20] I think I can go shuffle pool and all kinds of stuff and maybe there was a little bit of furniture in the truck too it was it was mostly games I think I got a trailer the next time down for the for the furniture but yeah Godzilla was another was a movie that was a big disappointment that it turned out to be not such a good license that the guys that were so easy to work with for independent stay became terrible to work with for Godzilla that they said we don't want anybody know what Godzilla is going to look like.

[02:25:49] So we're going to give five different pictures to five different licensers so they can make their toys and stuff and then all this to all the toys ended up looking not a lot like what Godzilla look like in the movie so they kept their secret but they basically ruined their license at least at least that's my take on it.

[02:26:09] You know it wasn't it wasn't a bad shooting game but you know I don't think you know I think the license wasn't there and I think the rules were the rules were maybe a little bit hokie I think it suffered from sort of the from some of the same stuff that that Jurassic did that there were some concepts in there that just didn't work that just sort of carry forward.

[02:26:35] You know and it was I think that was a game that also kind of suffered from you know trying to be trying to be like Williams and stacking up modes and collecting them all at once and stuff like that and you know keep on keep on shooting all this stuff but don't shoot this one collect all and stuff like that and you know I don't I think that rule was kind of shoehorned into that game and I don't think it fit very well.

[02:27:01] Now the next one you worked on was of course a really big hit for the company South Park and this was like extreme bragging rights for for Sega because this came out kind of the same time that pinball 2000 came out but you guys really felt that you did better in a lot of ways and pinball 2000 did what was your feeling on that game.

[02:27:24] So it was really funny that we wanted to do a South Park game for a long long time and it was funny that Joe canico was very close to Bob Gale who wrote the back to the future movies collaborated on that tattoo assassin video game and Bob actually sent us.

[02:27:48] He had actually received one of the original copies of Matt and Trace spirit of Christmas video you know that that was sort of the I guess the second thing that they ever did that was South Park that predated the predated the TV series that you know some Hollywood guy had had them do this do this video and he sent it to everybody is like a Christmas card and it just sort of was one of these viral things.

[02:28:18] Of course there was no internet video back then but you know people were copying making copies of copies of VHS and you know we got that and we watched it and we just thought that was so funny and then you know five or six months later the series comes on comes on Comedy Central and it pretty much became the thing that somebody would tape it the night that it was on I think it was on Thursday nights maybe originally that somebody would somebody would tape it and bring it to you.

[02:28:48] Joe would tape it or somebody would tape it and bring it in and the next morning or at lunchtime or something like that we'd all get together and watch it in Joe's office on Friday morning or something like that.

[02:29:00] You know it became sort of a thing at the office and that you know we wanted to we wanted to do the game and you know Gary was you know sort of against it and he didn't think that it would fit you know that there was sort of the stigma of doing a cartoon license.

[02:29:17] That went all the way back to Bugs Bunny and you know Space Jam you know we had cartoons on it and it wasn't you know the wasn't the greatest you know it did it did it did better than some of the other games but you know it wasn't like a real blockbuster and we finally

[02:29:37] finally there was enough momentum from that license to be able to go ahead and do it and I think we I think we made a game that was very accessible to novice players which is sort of the niche that we filled you know that we wanted we didn't want a game that was going to be so hard or so confusing that that somebody in a bar who comes up and puts a put 50 cents into it.

[02:30:06] You know we didn't want that person to walk away shaking their head after three balls and saying you know what did I just do you know for my 50 cents.

[02:30:17] I think we I think we pretty much nailed it we had we had good sound samples that was funny that they said they wanted the game to be more family oriented so we had to take out some of the bad words and then of course they came out with that and of course not too much later they come out with the movie with the game.

[02:30:35] Not with the movie which was you know just ridiculous in terms of in terms of what it did that I think that was I think it may have been more of their licensing people than them actually saying what we could do.

[02:30:49] Yeah now the Marvin that Marvin's marvelous mechanical museum got one of those I got an early South Park and it had a really early display you know I want to say the code was like 0.25 or something like that and it had you know like you know like you know you know you can get a game.

[02:31:04] And you know like the carpet scene in it and it had some stuff that ultimately added that had had came out what was the story behind that when the carpet scene turned turn into the kid race.

[02:31:17] Right.

[02:31:18] Right.

[02:31:19] Right.

[02:31:20] You know yeah that was that was the pre licensure approved approved stuff and they said that they didn't want it in there.

[02:31:30] Well Marvin ran that I remember he got a tube of roms in the mail please take your originals out and put these in and Marvin couldn't throw those out fast enough the you know the ones that came in the mail he kept the originals.

[02:31:42] Oh yeah yeah that you know we've had I can think of only I can think of only one one time when we've really had to do a a rom release because of the license.

[02:31:59] People not being happy and that was actually during Maverick that there was that there was a sound and somebody on the display that that they approved and then they later found out they didn't have permission that we didn't have permission to use or whatever so we had to we had to re record the sound and change the display and and release a new rom and send it to all of our customers.

[02:32:28] But I'm sure there's plenty of the old ones still out there today.

[02:32:33] So was there anything else since we couldn't take the guy off the play field that was tough luck they'd approved that so they had to pay him any money they they did it themselves.

[02:32:43] Now was there anything in South Park you know anything buried any you know anything interesting that you know is kind of hidden.

[02:32:51] I don't think there was I don't think there was there was really anything in there there was there was some sort of silly attract more display effect that was in there for me because that was actually that was actually supposed to be my last game or it turned into my last game that once Joe left they said well you know it your your thing is up at the end of February and and and we're going to let you go.

[02:33:14] I started out with like a like eight month contract or something like that and you know they said that they wanted to they said that they wanted to get somebody local you know that they wanted to get somebody who was just out of tech school or whatever and teach them how to do display that they needed to you know further cost cut of course that was before South Park was so successful.

[02:33:35] But you know I think South Park was you know it it it gained it gained momentum that there were all those you know sort of subsequent runs and you know and that at that time Gary was sort of in the position Gary was you know getting ready to buy the company.

[02:33:55] Or I don't know if he had at that point or not but you know Joe was wanting me to come out and work in slots and I was down here in North Carolina and actually discovered that it would be to my benefit as far as buying a house and everything else to have a regular job.

[02:34:11] But I was sort of a self employed contractor and since I don't only been doing it for for a short amount of time they didn't want to count they didn't want to count any of the income towards the qualifying for a mortgage or stuff like that and you know found out it in the middle of January whatever that I wasn't going to have a job as a March 1st and getting married at the end of April and you know we needed to needed to buy a house and I had to

[02:34:40] you know 15 or 20 pinball machines that were all farmed out to friends are in their storage areas or whatever I didn't have I didn't actually have a single game I didn't have a single game set up at my at my condo at that point I think I had one game there a challenger that I bought from her silver that was actually sitting up on its end in the corner of the place.

[02:35:07] I didn't really came set up at all.

[02:35:11] So you know needed to get a place to put all those games now when you are developing code remotely.

[02:35:18] How would you do that how would you test the code and everything I mean did you have like a test fixture or do you test it in another game how did you do that work well usually usually what I had set up down here was exactly the same as.

[02:35:34] As what I had back at my desk at at at the eastern Sega which was just a back box that had enough boards in it to to power the dot matrix display and then had the had the ROM socket had a doohickey in it using a technical term that yeah and in e-prom simulator as it may be I could just shoot code into.

[02:36:03] And then there was a program on the PC that would actually send the send over the parallel port the codes to the display just like just like the CPU of the pinball game would.

[02:36:20] So I could do all the testing from there I just pass the I just the dust prompt type whatever the command was and it would start this start this thing that would pass the that would pass these commands over to the display and I just type stuff just like I was the CPU.

[02:36:35] And it would work.

[02:36:37] So I would do that down here and then and then the you know basically the thing was I would when I was down here and that was you know over the period of like six or eight months I would I would go up there I think four days a month I'd come like the go up the first Monday fly back to fly back the next day and then go up the third Monday and fly back the next day.

[02:37:05] And you know I fly right into her I'd leave here at like leave here and like a 630 flight or 70 and flight land up there at like eight o'clock get a rental car and I would be in the office being the office like nine stay there till like nine go go back to my parents house and visit with them and then come in and work till like six on that Tuesday and then we were only about 15 minutes from home.

[02:37:34] And then about 15 minutes from home.

[02:37:35] Hair drive up drop off the rental car get on the 9 a.m. flight and 9 p.m. flight back to back to Raleigh and I'd be back home by midnight and that it ended up actually being very cheap to do that those round trip tickets back then.

[02:37:52] If you booked them in the right way we're about a hundred fifty bucks each the rental car was ridiculous.

[02:37:59] I don't know $14 a day and you know didn't didn't cost much for gas it was about a buck a gallon and then pay for my own food and you know they got a pretty cheap deal out of me.

[02:38:10] So I was I was a cheap date for them at that point.

[02:38:14] Now what was the reaction at at at Sega Stern to pinball 2000 and you know did you guys have any head wind on that that product coming out and what was you know what was your feeling of that?

[02:38:28] What was your feeling on it there at the company?

[02:38:31] Well you know we we pretty much knew that we couldn't we couldn't ever make a product like that even if they didn't have a patented patent this way and that because you know we didn't have the staff to we didn't have the staff to program a video game and it pinball machine at the same time.

[02:38:51] In fact we we pretty much proved with tattoo assassins that we were not the right group to make a video game ever again.

[02:38:59] That you know we played it and you know we we didn't think that it was going to hit the price point that the market needed that we we didn't think that it was going to that it was going to make that much more money that it would justify itself.

[02:39:16] And you know just just in terms of just in terms of the play field is personally I it didn't do much for me just even when I play it now it feels like it's short.

[02:39:28] It feels like it's a short game and you know when I shoot the ball to the top of that I don't get to see it.

[02:39:36] Just in just for me personally I didn't think it was I didn't think it was very very satisfying that you know if I had to choose between attack and revenge I would play attack every time.

[02:39:49] You know it was like they I don't know you know they they did a sequel to their they did the sequel to their own to their own non-licensed theme and I felt like the original was far superior.

[02:40:02] Of course we we tried really hard to get that to get that episode one license and you know Williams Williams spent a lot of money to get it and quite frankly it was probably a good it was probably a good thing that they got it because I don't know that I don't know that that would have turned out to be such a great game for Sega.

[02:40:27] Now you did also did striker extreme NF the NFL series which was based on striker extreme and in playboy while you were in rally right.

[02:40:38] Yeah and that's down here in Durham and that's an interesting story of how striker happened that they brought in this they brought in this guy who would who would graduated from I don't know DeVry or IIT Illinois Institute of Technology.

[02:40:55] With the computer science degree and he was a pretty solid guy you know young guy who did the who did the dots for Harley.

[02:41:05] I think Lonnie did did quite a bit of those dots to sort of work with them and sort of brought them up to speed and and stuff like that and the guy did it for you know the guy did it for one game and he said you know after doing it he said well you know I don't think there's really any future in this.

[02:41:22] I think I want to go work for a web company you know right in all this old assembly language code I just don't think I don't think there's any career in it so he walked away from it and so they brought me so Lonnie called me up and said hey do you want to do a game.

[02:41:39] You want to do another game and I said well you know I've got a I've got a real job now so you know I wouldn't be able to put as many hours into it but I'd be glad to write your proposal for how much you know how much you know how much you want to do.

[02:41:52] So I want to go ahead and do it so I had a regular you know 96 software job at that point and you know it was pretty busy with it you know just got married we're in a new house it's like well you know this would be a nice way to bring in a little money to support the hobby.

[02:42:16] So so I did that and I think the I think the situation with that game was that was that Williams had closed in ball and they had people they you know they grabbed people in I think they'd I think they'd hired Keith and and and why did that point which which I thought was was was really good for them to land that.

[02:42:45] But I'd known Keith from wrecking spin ball from the early 90s in fact he came up to Laurel at that at that tilt to play that Twilight zone when it first came out and actually got us kicked out of the place because we're trying to do death.

[02:43:01] But you know Keith Keith and Dwight had landed but but you know they didn't want to throw them into that into doing that system and trying to come up with the production game schedule so so so that was why they brought me in and then the NFL thing was was something that was was basically done to to get rid of the extra stuff that they had left over from striker week as nobody bought it sort of you know.

[02:43:31] Turn the turn the size here into a so purse by selling these NFL games for you know for $5,000 pop but they didn't want it to impact their impact their regular development schedule so that was why Lonnie and I worked on it that you know I was down here I wasn't working for them and I think Lonnie was sort of in between projects or maybe you know wasn't slated to do anything so.

[02:43:59] So that way that way they could do this thing and software wise it wouldn't hurt anything that was it wouldn't hurt anything that was going to be on the line.

[02:44:09] Did the NFL thing work did they sell those those unsold strikers?

[02:44:15] Yeah I think they I think they managed to use up some parts you know I personally had a lot of fun programming it I thought it was I thought it was a neat idea but I think the I think the art package that they had.

[02:44:28] Like the back glasses and stuff I didn't think it was I didn't think it was tremendously appealing and I didn't think that the sound was I didn't think the sound at least as I so I drafted was really customized enough I don't think it was customized enough for each team.

[02:44:48] That they you know that they needed to do more we talked about we talked about doing something like that before with space jam we talked about making customized college basketball games out of that place field for you know alumni of you know universities you know how many how many Michigan basketball games could you sell in you know could you sell a Michigan.

[02:45:16] How many cans of basketball games could you sell in Kansas if you had a customized right and had you know likenesses of former players on you could probably sell a bunch Kentucky you know those sort of big in North Carolina you know the big basketball schools with the big alumni base by one and by one and put it in there put it into a record room or something like that.

[02:45:40] I don't even play it but just had it now what was your involvement with with playboy with Stern's playboy well it was it was interesting that that I almost got involved with I almost got involved with Stern full time again at one point that around the time of PLD PLD coming along I was which was of course Pat Lawley.

[02:46:10] So I think that the players you know coming in and doing monopoly in those games.

[02:46:15] Yeah exactly that the original plan from monopoly was to have was to have at least some of the programming be done in house and so they they talked about hiring me back to do the dots for pets games.

[02:46:38] So the thing was that my friend Greg Dunlap became available and went to went to work for Pat right there and that was and that was good that was that was a better solution than me working from here.

[02:46:53] It was great that it was great that the Greg got to got to do some some dot programming because he was really and continues to to be in pinball.

[02:47:07] Greg is a Greg is a great person I talk to him every day and you know I think he had I think he had some good times there with some good times there with Lewis.

[02:47:21] There was actually around the time of playboy there was sort of a gap in terms of in terms of staff that they didn't have anybody available to to do dots for Dwight's game.

[02:47:38] I think that was a bit because Keith was becoming more involved in doing in doing game design for stuff like Simpson's that he was you know really really not just driving the not just driving the rules and the programming but also the layout too.

[02:47:55] You know really being really being a designer not you know obviously not drawing the mechanical parts but really sort of really sort of leading the project.

[02:48:06] And when you're doing that obviously you don't want to be taking time off to the program dots on somebody's game.

[02:48:13] So you know they asked if I could do playboy and I said hey you know I'm thinking about making a job change again.

[02:48:23] Are you thinking about bringing somebody else on and they said you know I don't know we need to we need to think about that we're going to get back to you but you want to do playboy regardless.

[02:48:35] And I said yeah I'd love to do it I have had never worked with Dwight and it sort of ended up morphing into a project where Lonnie and I were sort of tag teaming on the display Lonnie Roth that Lonnie would write code during the day and I would write code at night.

[02:48:52] So he'd write you know he'd he'd work on it as much as many hours as he had during the day and then when I got home from my regular job he would have you know sent me the latest changes or whatever.

[02:49:02] And then I would get on and I would program for a few hours that night you know three or five hours or whatever it was and I'd work on it over the weekend too.

[02:49:11] And we got that done pretty well and I think playboy looked pretty good. I think playboy had some I think playboy had some pretty good dots.

[02:49:19] I really sort of tried to get in there and sort of get rid of some of that generic stuff like the high score font that was in a lot of a stern games was one of those generic things.

[02:49:31] One of those generic display effects that actually put in after Golden Eye it was the Golden Eye font and somebody got it in their head that oh yeah that's the high score font it's like no it's just a small fun Golden Eye it's actually kind of ugly.

[02:49:43] But it sort of ended up in there but I was hoping that I was going to get on full time but there was at that time there was the great event of Lyman getting back into pinball.

[02:50:00] And they hired him full time and that and that was excellent that I think that's really been a strength of of starting to have Lyman on board all the stuff that he did for their new system and everything.

[02:50:15] So what was the thinking a lot of these games in the I don't know starting you know around Baywatch and up to South Park were set up as many as six players but then they went back to four players.

[02:50:31] What was the thinking with this six versus four player thing?

[02:50:34] I think the audience just showed that nobody ever used it.

[02:50:38] Wow okay.

[02:50:39] Yeah it just wasn't a feature that wasn't a feature that was popular and there was a move to do more stuff with the dot matrix display to make it more interesting.

[02:50:54] You know maybe you know some non-traditional layouts and I think they felt like they were sort of roped into some some things as far as score display if they did have the six players.

[02:51:12] Right so this wasn't you know it's hard enough to find one person to play pinball much less six.

[02:51:20] Right okay one you know wrapped us up a guy had John for a long time but one last question what is the deal with lobsters.

[02:51:32] Well that's a that's an interesting story that I was in the I was in the band at Duke for that played at the football games and the basketball games and we went out to the final four in Seattle in 1989 and we're in the hotel just hanging out talking about what we're going to do to try and get on TV.

[02:51:59] And you're by the gift shop and there was this big lobster puppet in there and I said oh you know that that looks kind of fun I think I should bring that to the game so I went and I bought it and brought it to the game and I put a Duke Blue Devil thing on the bottom of it and people thought it was really kind of funny it was just sort of a quirky thing.

[02:52:20] So for the next year I had that and I also made a hat that had a lobster on it and managed to to convince the band director that rock lobster would be a good song for the band to play and that later on that became my login back in the days that Duke when you could actually choose something rather than just have it be some derivative of your initials or something like that.

[02:52:49] That I had that be my email address and sort of stuck and it's funny that the band still plays rock lobster at all the games the cheerleaders do a dance to it that there was a basketball player Shane Badiay who plays in the NBA now who was here at Duke who actually did the cheerleaders rock lobster dance as part of a step show.

[02:53:18] On campus and it actually got shown on ESPN that they showed that as part of one of the lead ins to one of the one of the Duke basketball games that they showed so it's funny that lobster set that you know that sort of sort of spiraled from that one thing and had that effect but that was why that was why I had log in as my login was lobster and you know I sort of kept that and kept that through in various incarnations.

[02:53:48] I had a Duke basketball website called lobster devil which is where my email address is actually basically my big hobby now that sort of even surpassed pinball is that I do media coverage for Duke women's basketball have a website called dw hoops.com that I take pictures of games I've got a partner who's a writer and you know we covered NCAA tournament and ACC tournament.

[02:54:17] You know all sorts of stuff like that but so there's not a lot of lobsters on that website but I did I did manage to sneak quite a few lobsters into into the games when I was at the east and Sega there's of course the lobster pops in lobster bonus and Baywatch which I believe is when you get the when you get three of the same skill shot.

[02:54:47] It gives you the lobster bunch and shows the lobsters and I think there was I think the brain bug in in Starship troopers in the match when he's thinking about stuff he occasionally thinks of a lobster in addition to some other stuff I think there's actually a picture of me in there too that he thinks of when he's going.

[02:55:08] Before he blows up in the and the match number is inside of him but that was the that that was probably the funniest match sequence that we had but that that's sort of the backstory on that's sort of the backstory on lobster well of course or anything else that you'd like to add.

[02:55:26] I don't think so I think I can't tell you everything I'm thinking about because I'm supposed to talk at expo next.

[02:55:34] I'm supposed to talk at expo next October so I want to give give all the secrets away but I think that's I think we pretty much covered everything that and definitely some some good questions.

[02:55:47] Alright well I want to I want to thank you I really really appreciate you know or in day coming on top cast and talking to us I really do appreciate the time thanks again.
