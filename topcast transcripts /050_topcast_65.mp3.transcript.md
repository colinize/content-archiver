[00:00] Welcome to Topcast. Topcast is the this old pinball podcast for all things related to

[00:12] pinball. Our emphasis is on interviewing pinball personalities, particularly those that work

[00:17] in the coin-operated game industry. Define Topcast on the internet, just point your browser

[00:34] if you're using an iPod type MP3 device. Tonight on Topcast we're going to be talking

[00:44] to Dan Fordon who is the sound engineer for Balli and Williams and also for Stern on

[00:50] many games from 1989 up to 2003. So we're going to be giving Dan a call and talk to him

[00:57] about the games that he worked on. Okay so I've got Dan Fordon on the line. Dan tell

[01:06] me about your early days with pinball. You know you were obviously sound engineer but

[01:12] how did you come to this point where you were working in the pinball industry? I mean did

[01:17] you have a you know like an early memory of pinball or did it just kind of like trip into

[01:23] this business? Yeah I did kind of trip into it. It was sort of being in the right place

[01:30] at the right time. I actually grew up in Maryland and you know sort of take it way back.

[01:37] I remember during junior high and maybe high school going into Rockville and going to

[01:43] the little arcade they had in the mall there and playing Flash and Superman and I think

[01:50] Paragon, a bunch of games like that and then you know that's when space wars had just come

[01:57] out and I think probably space invaders was in there maybe Asteroid. So like this is back

[02:02] in the mid to late 70s and so I thought you know I thought that was pretty cool and then

[02:12] you know as I you know went through high school probably didn't go back that much but then

[02:16] during college you know played some video here and there but didn't really like make any sort of

[02:22] you know I wasn't obsessed by it I didn't you know do it all the time but you know once in a

[02:26] while in passing I would play arcade games and pinball if it was available. So fast four a couple

[02:32] years I ended up in in Evanston going to Northwestern University for a master's in computer music

[02:41] which I never actually got but I did all the coursework and I knew a number of people that

[02:49] were working for Williams that's what it was at the time and they were doing obviously pinball

[02:56] machines and arcade video games and then one of the people actually so I finished the coursework

[03:05] and then I was actually doing some apprenticing in a recording studio around the same time

[03:12] but needed to get a job and I actually interviewed with Valley over that summer and sort of the

[03:21] agreement we had I mean we sort of you know we hit it off they wanted they were very interested

[03:26] in having me come on as a sound engineer because I also had some programming experience too so I

[03:31] could presumably create sound as well as help out with some of the programming maybe do some

[03:37] tools for the sound department that kind of thing and so we were we sort of had an agreement

[03:42] in principle that once I finished my thesis from a master's degree that I would go work for Valley

[03:48] and I had an interview I think around the same time with Williams that for every incident just

[03:54] didn't go great it's like I don't think I hit it off with the people there as well and then of

[04:01] course Williams actually bought Valley so I wasn't sure what I was going to do at that point

[04:08] I went ahead and kept kind of pestering them and by this time I believe

[04:15] so I knew Chris Granner who had been working at Williams and a couple other people there

[04:21] and then Brian Schmidt came in as the head of the sound department and I guess I don't know if

[04:29] you guys remember he worked on Space Shuttle and a number of other games he did a lot of stuff with

[04:34] Black Knight 2000 I think he might have done Bond's I run as well so he was running so I knew him

[04:43] from the Northwestern computer music program and so I basically this one was kind of pestering

[04:50] them and so at one point I think I gave them a demo tape that I'd made and it was all my weird

[04:55] computer music stuff and I was in a band at the time and we did this kind of sort of aggressive

[05:01] funk rock stuff that just did not you know leave a good impression on the people that were

[05:08] you know that were designing the games and would you know make the decision on hiring me

[05:12] so finally Brian just said look just give me a demo of a rock tune a spy tune and a country tune

[05:19] and I kind of got it at that point it's like okay they want idioms like stuff that's familiar

[05:25] that's gonna you know bring up kind of familiar feelings and settings not this abstract stuff

[05:31] that I was doing on my own so I want to work and did that and submitted that and they really liked

[05:37] it and so that would eventually got me hired and so I started in you know figuring out the systems

[05:44] there playing a lot of games because they were games sitting around in the hall and you know the

[05:49] the latest game and development is sitting there I remember exactly which one it was and maybe the

[05:53] one that was just coming off the line that they were that they were finishing production on I

[05:59] remember I played a lot of taxi in the beginning there so just kind of learning by playing the games

[06:05] and you know learning you know what what what what did Chris do to make a pinball machine pinball

[06:11] machine sound good and what are other people you know what Brian do to make a pinball machine sound

[06:15] but just sort of learn by playing and and experiencing it that way and then starting to work with

[06:20] the designers you know what do you want for the game what kind of music and what kind of sounds you

[06:25] know what's the what's the theme of the game and so on and so on so I mean that's sort of kind of a

[06:30] meandering tale but that's pretty much how I ended up doing you know working for the for the pinball

[06:37] machine industry and working on video games as well. Where did you go to school for your undergraduate

[06:42] and what did you get your undergraduate in? I went to Oberlin College near near Cleveland at

[06:48] smaller liberal arts school also as a conservatory of music and I originally tried to get in there

[06:55] as a flute player to do performance and I didn't get in but I was able to continue studying flute

[07:01] with one of the faculty there and did that for a couple years I ended up with a music degree from

[07:08] the college in other words I could you could get a I got a bachelor of arts in music history and

[07:14] so I studied a lot of music at Oberlin but I also branched out study literature studied math

[07:21] study computer science and then got into computer music there for a small place they actually

[07:26] actually had and for the time they had a pretty advanced computer music department and so learned

[07:32] I learned a lot about you know what you can what you could do with computers and sound in that

[07:39] context and then I actually went on and and was it I got a sort of half scholarship to go to

[07:46] graduate school at MIT for one year and I went there for year and then eventually transferred

[07:51] back to or transferred over to Northwestern. Now when you were doing the computer work in college

[07:58] what type of computers were you using? It was all mainframe at that time I think Vax VMS

[08:05] were the computers we worked on at Oberlin at least it was all mainframe so you'd have like a

[08:11] room with a bunch of terminals in it and I think using the word star word processor I think and

[08:17] we also learned you know I learned Fortran I learned Pascal learned assembly language I think

[08:24] with Vax VMS assembler and then we did more sort of theoretical stuff it was a language called

[08:30] scheme which is a lot like Lisp which I guess it's not really object oriented but it's just a very

[08:39] different kind of programming language looks completely different than anything you know like C

[08:45] or anything like that then I kind of taught myself C which is very similar to Pascal when I was

[08:52] at MIT. Now but I mean when you were doing music on the computers what type of computers were

[09:00] using to do that? Yeah so in the beginning the instructor there had created basically sort of a

[09:08] virtual frequency modulation instrument and I need to go into details but frequency modulation is

[09:14] a sort of synthesis strategy for creating sound that's very efficient using only two you know

[09:24] using two you can use more but you can use two oscillators to create a very complex spectra and

[09:28] that's actually the basis of the DX7 which is the first digital synthesizer to come out on the

[09:33] market so this was actually right before that in any case so we had this this he had set up an

[09:40] environment where you could enter you could design you could design instruments using this sort of

[09:47] pre-fab algorithm and then you could generate scores basically matrixes of of you know note duration

[09:59] pitch data and things like that and you could you know write a piece that way the funny thing was

[10:03] that you would actually have to batch the job off and it would go on to like a tape somewhere and

[10:10] run overnight and like in the next day you come back and hear your two minute the music it was kind

[10:15] of funny and then after that I think my junior year this is when the Yamaha DX7 had come out the

[10:22] school bought a bunch of those and they also had a bunch of micro computers and so we were getting into

[10:30] programming the synthesizer in real time from the computer I don't remember what kind of computer

[10:37] was actually now when you went to when you went to Williams Valley how was the development environment

[10:46] there I mean you know you're using you're using a Yamaha sound chip on these sound boards and

[10:52] assembly language to drive it I mean how how was the environment on that compared it to the

[10:57] college thing it was I would say a lot more evolved and it was kind of home brew at the same time

[11:05] we had a language that I feel what it's called well there there was like a compiler that would take

[11:13] we would write scores in basically like a text file you know note c3 comma 4 is you know play

[11:22] c3 for 4 ticks or beats or whatever and you know you you would lay out your eight tracks sort of

[11:29] on top of each other and just program it that way by text you know you could create loops you

[11:36] would have rests and then that would get compiled into the assembler for the for the board that we

[11:44] used on the development systems which is basically what was in the games at that time and I had a pin

[11:50] ball machine cabinet and on the play field was all this this development hardware that kind of

[11:58] emulated the hardware that ultimately would get shipped in the game and so I'd have a PC I think

[12:04] I started out with a 286 and like a compact or HP or something like that that was hooked up to this

[12:13] you know the RS 232 to this development hardware and so the computer we know we'd run the

[12:20] compiler it would it would do its thing and then and then stuff the stuff that we made into some

[12:27] onboard RAM onto the development hardware and then I could basically talk to that through a program

[12:33] that communicated out the port to the hardware and I could make the sound calls happen

[12:40] so you you didn't have an actual pinball machine that had this kind of like RAM in your PC that

[12:46] was accessible by the pinball instead it was this developmental hardware and you could you could

[12:51] trigger each one of the sounds without having to like play the game right correct okay and and

[12:58] so you never really actually had a machine in your office you were always using this kind of

[13:03] developmental platform right okay okay now so according to the internet pinball database your

[13:09] first game was Atlantis how much of the sound did you do for Atlantis I did a number of sound

[13:16] effects for that I think Robin Seaver did the music and most of the sounds and I was helping out

[13:23] and that was like some of the first pinball sounds I did I think the actual first thing I worked

[13:27] on my got there was actually archribals the arcade basketball game oh and how was it working on

[13:35] arc you know like an arcade video game versus a pinball machine or didn't it matter um

[13:43] I don't know I think I like them both I thought it was harder I think it was definitely harder to

[13:49] create sound for pinball machines because it was a lot more abstract I mean you're trying you know

[13:56] I'm trying to make a sound well also because we're using a Yamaha chip to make all the sounds

[14:01] it's not like I could sample water and and that would be sort of a characteristic sound of the game

[14:07] I had to like you know try to make it work with with a Yamaha FM sound with a basketball game where

[14:15] you're seeing people go back and forth the connection between what you hear and see is a lot more

[14:21] explicit so they sort of automatically kind of work together and I remember having a hard time

[14:27] making stuff for Atlantis and people thinking that you know people saying you know those sounds

[14:30] aren't any good and I was like well okay I don't know what I'm doing so I just kept trying

[14:36] different things and you know playing other games and trying to figure out well what is you

[14:41] know what is cool about that that's not cool about the thing that I was doing now if you needed

[14:47] to sample or or get a digital you know version of a voice or something hot how did they do that I

[14:56] mean I understand how you were constructing your scores and playing your music and you had certain

[15:01] and with the Yamaha chip you had certain voices or certain instruments as they may call them but

[15:06] I mean how would you like to you know you know speech right so we had the first hardware that we

[15:15] used when I was there with the eight voice Yamaha chip an eight-bit DAC so you could play an eight-bit

[15:23] drum sample one at a time and actually I don't think even I don't think Atlantis even had that I know

[15:28] our rivals did not have it so like doing things like drums I had to do drums on you know take up one

[15:34] or two tracks on my on my on my FM track FM score to do the drums those were our rivals and I

[15:44] believe Atlantis is the same thing and so so you got the eight voice Yamaha chip you got the

[15:49] the eight-bit DAC and we had the CVSD chip which I don't know if people know about that but it

[15:55] it was a beast to work with and it was basically one let's see I think it was like an eight-to-one

[16:03] compression it had a frequency response of up to maybe 2500 hertz so S's and F's basically sounded

[16:11] the same and if you could get them to speak at all and the way it worked I think it was like sort of

[16:20] one bit per sample so if the incoming signal was higher than the previous sample then the bit

[16:29] would be a one if the incoming sample is lower than the previous one then the bit would be a zero

[16:35] and that's basically how it encoded it and I'm sure there's a lot more to it than that but that

[16:39] was my understanding of it and so that's what we had to work with and so we had to do all sorts of

[16:44] crazy EQ stuff before we converted it just to try to get anything that had high frequency to speak

[16:53] but I remember Chris Granner telling me about the Elvira game where she supposed to say let's party

[17:03] and you could never hear anything other than let party because the ass on the end of that just

[17:09] wouldn't speak no matter how hard you know and we try to turn up that part of the digital file as

[17:14] much as we could and still it just wouldn't convert so that was always very frustrating but challenging

[17:22] so after the Lannis you did Black Knight 2000 where you're a little more experienced that things

[17:30] go a little easier? Yes and no I mean I still had to make some demanding you know Steve's

[17:39] Steve's pretty demanding game designer so I had to make it you know make him happy and you're

[17:44] talking about Steve Richie of course right? Yes and Brian Schmidt was actually he was the lead on

[17:50] that game and he did most of it but what he asked me to do was see if I could come up with like

[17:57] electric guitar sound on the Yamaha and so I cranked away for a while eventually came up with

[18:04] something that I liked pretty well that I felt like was good both for doing for trying to do power

[18:09] chords and for doing you know screaming lead guitar type stuff and Steve actually wrote a riff

[18:18] for the multi-ball tune yeah I think that was the one and so he gave me that riff and so I took that

[18:27] and used my my electric guitar and you know tried to make like a cooking like heavy metal screaming

[18:36] lead guitar tune for multi-ball and that was that was a ton of fun to do and I was thinking the

[18:43] whole time it's like well what would I don't know Steve I was even around at the time but it was

[18:47] like what was something like that play what would I even have play over you know something like this

[18:52] and of course you know people like that can like come up with it in the moment I like spent you

[18:57] know a couple days writing you know going note for note and trying to do these all sorts of guitar

[19:03] like gestures with this kind of unwieldy Yamaha a voice chip but it was a ton of fun to try to make

[19:10] it work and I'm pretty happy with the way it came out yeah no I came out great but I guess how do

[19:17] you how do you develop these voices I mean like you know for me I've obviously never

[19:24] worked with this hardware I mean how do you get a particular sound or are the sounds pretty much

[19:29] already dictated by the chip no um Brian I believe Brian and maybe someone in Bill Parade one of

[19:37] them or both of them worked on an editor that was able to actually talk to the chip and it allowed

[19:43] to to manipulate the parameters of the chip so we could change um I don't know like

[19:51] modulator amounts and frequencies and you know LFO and and all the all the synth all all the

[19:59] internal synth parameters of that FBO1 chip we would we would have have control over and what was

[20:06] actually really cool was that not only just like oh so so I would go in and and to this editor

[20:14] and I would like play notes and tweak the the parameters until I got something that I'd liked

[20:20] but you could also in the score itself you had access to all the parameters of the voice so I

[20:28] could load in a voice and then as part of the music I could I could change parameters on the fly

[20:35] right so if I wanted to do like more of a feedback thing I could like change some modular

[20:41] so some modulator or carrier ratio in in the middle of the music and it would make it would affect

[20:48] a timbre change I did a ton of that in um Brian of Pinbuck and that was a lot of fun

[20:55] so you had eight tracks is that mean you had like eight separate instruments that you could play

[21:01] simultaneously right single note see oh you mean so it would play one instrument one note

[21:10] but it would do it so quickly that it would wouldn't sound that way right well like for example like

[21:16] maybe the let's say that multi-ball tune um for black night I would maybe have a bass line might

[21:26] take up two tracks because like we would often double a line to make it fatter right a little bit

[21:32] of coursing a little detune maybe tiny bit of delay and then maybe I'd have three voices for doing

[21:38] like a rhythm guitar um and maybe let's see like a symbol and then maybe the lead guitar would then

[21:47] be another two tracks doubled so you but it would be something like that so you had a full you had

[21:56] a full line of effects too with it with it too you had coursing and delay all available with the

[22:02] chip too no you had to you could you could simulate that but you'd use up like like one thing I

[22:10] like to do was um like on all eight tracks let's say I don't want to do like a hit um I would just

[22:18] like do the hit and then on each track um you know let let that note ring and then turn the volume down

[22:26] do it again turn the volume down again so it would be kind of like a fake echo fake reverb but no we

[22:31] had no we had no outboard effects or anything like that if we wanted to course something you had

[22:36] to use two voices and detune it and and was that easy to just play with two voices slightly detune

[22:44] and that's your coursing is it was that easy to do in the um in the text file out of there yeah I

[22:49] mean that's just like you know copy that entire track pasted and then at the top do like a pitch change

[22:57] oh interesting okay so now like let's take the next game that you did was bad cats so you've got

[23:05] these cats you know you know in some parts of the game you've got cat and cat noises that are

[23:09] really high pitched now how did you handle something like that um gosh I don't remember I think I

[23:17] just you know where it was appropriate for cats to to make their noises I think I I guess I

[23:22] must have recorded some cats I don't got I don't even remember that I do remember the music for that

[23:27] when that was a lot of fun also to try to do basically jazz and you know someone would

[23:34] based on the lead guitar sound that I that I made I made what was basically going to end up being

[23:40] my tenor saxophone sound and um yeah I'm just trying to do like you know lounge and

[23:49] or like let's let's call it pseudo lounge or pseudo big band jazz in that one

[23:55] and then like some of it kind of had like a hip hop group of not hip hop but like um

[24:01] I don't know what the groove is but like a very like kind of modern swinging sound

[24:09] I guess that's the best way I could describe it now when you need to actually get a to get a

[24:15] voice like you know you were talking about Elvira in the party monsters where she says let's party

[24:21] but you know like I I have that game and I and I I swear I can hear the S in Letz how did the how

[24:28] did you actually accomplish that or or was it it might just like you fake did enough that I think I

[24:33] hear it well I think it was you know with again that was Chris's game and he um I think maybe he

[24:41] had done it a couple times and people were amazing it just sounds like let party and so he just

[24:46] had to keep iterating on it and eventually got it to where it's like yeah and maybe depend on

[24:51] what part of the game like if there's something else loud playing and she says that you might not

[24:55] hear it I just don't I don't remember uh what the context of that is but that's that was just I

[25:00] just remember him talking about how frustrating it was like to not be able to get that to speak the

[25:05] way he wanted it to so was that traditional for you guys to use like almost like camouflage in

[25:11] the background to kind of like in order to make things you know not as noticeable um it depends

[25:19] right I mean if that was like a situation where it's like her voice is like the only thing there

[25:24] then you know there's no way you can camouflage you just have to like play it and that's you know

[25:30] that's what's going to sound um in fact the background background sounds made it hard a lot harder

[25:36] to understand um the speech because um there's so much frequency information missing from the speech

[25:44] from that chip that anything else playing at the same time is going to make it harder to understand

[25:50] all right now um uh you you also did mouse and around um in in a roller games was there was

[26:00] any interesting you know sound stories related to those games um those are both really fun to do

[26:10] although I got to say I thought the roller games was like probably the worst license ever it was a

[26:16] really fun game right now that was I thought that was just a ton of fun to play

[26:26] now did you do the theme for roller games yeah that was an interesting story actually that was the

[26:32] roller game theme that was sort of dictated to us and um and so that's that's one of those games

[26:40] like I think um black nine two thousand was the first one that actually did this that had singing

[26:45] in the game and how would you do that how do you get how do you get singing okay so you would

[26:53] have a track I assume it was like sort of double duty um instrument track and signal track

[27:04] and then the signal track was able to send something to the hardware to play the appropriate

[27:09] sample I mean they had worked out the communication where um you could send a a signal in one of the

[27:16] Yamaha tracks that would turn the CVSD chip on and play the right file so that's what they did in black

[27:23] nine two thousand the same thing we did for roller games and so I ended up with like a couple different

[27:30] um singing files that had the rock and uh you know the roller games little pieces of the roller

[27:39] games vocals and then I would trigger them at the right time did the same thing I believe with river

[27:45] boat gambler had Mark Richie singing river boat gambler now you talked about this CVSD chip before

[27:55] so I mean what is that what is CVSD what exactly is that chip it's it stands for a continuously

[28:03] variable slope detection and that it's just basically a standard part of the you know up until we

[28:13] up until Matt Booty created the DCS system that was how we well access not entirely true I think

[28:21] we used an okey chip for a couple of games that had an 80 pcm algorithm which was a ton better

[28:30] but up until that time the CVSD chip for a couple years was how we did it was basically the way

[28:38] we would handle speech in games and it was you know it was not just pinball it was the video games

[28:43] that we were doing and it was also the shuffle alley games that you know we do a couple of those

[28:47] every year too what would be the procedure like it you had Mark Richie singing in a river boat

[28:52] gambler so you you would start you go to the studio you record him and how would this ultimately

[28:58] get turned into this into this CVSD and ultimately you know get played back on the hardware

[29:04] give me the whole procedure so what I would do what I probably did is I got the music to a place

[29:10] where it was ready to for somebody to sing over and I assume I recorded that just into a wave

[29:15] file or whatever we were using at the time and then we had a little recording studio with a

[29:20] vocal booth and a control room and I probably gosh I don't even know if I did that I might have

[29:26] done it I'm like a tape recorder who knows but eventually I recorded his voice into and I think

[29:33] this might have been before pro tools I know we had some kind of digit design mac based digital audio

[29:42] recorder I believe we recorded it into that and then I maybe did a little bit of editing on it

[29:51] and then we had this basically a proprietary piece of hardware which was like the CVSD and

[29:57] coder and so you would take the equivalent of a wave file I don't even know if it was at that point

[30:03] we might have had the down sample or down degraded down into 8 bit maybe at some particular sample

[30:11] rate as well anyway then you would basically I think play this file into the CVSD box and it would

[30:18] record it as CVSD data I believe that's how we did it and it's going back away so I don't like my

[30:25] memory is a little bit sketchy on that but that sounds like what I ended up doing and then either

[30:32] I would like play like a vocal phrase and then that would become a file and then I'd play the next

[30:39] vocal phrase that would become a file a CVSD file and then I would bring that over to my computer

[30:44] and do whatever I had to do to compile it into the game naming it accordingly so that when I

[30:51] called for it either from a sound call or from my piece of music that it would play at the right time

[30:59] now that answer question yeah no that's great I was kind of wonder what the process is I know

[31:04] it's a little geeky of a question but you know it's kind of cool now how would so once you get all

[31:11] these sound calls all laid out what would you hand them out to the game programmer and then he

[31:17] would just call them as as as they so desired or did you have control over this within the game

[31:26] well you know it's a collaborative process right so I would go and I'd work in my office for a while

[31:31] and write it you know if you want to you know sort of the typical way I would start up on a game I

[31:37] mean we we would talk obviously you know me and the programmer and the and the game designer and

[31:42] the art lead you know whoever was whoever was interested or had a stake we would discuss you know

[31:48] with the approach we're going to take this is what it should sound like and everyone throws out

[31:54] their ideas and then I kind of go off and and come up with some music you know here's a shooter groove

[32:00] here's a main play tune here's a handful of basic effects like for bumpers for targets drop targets

[32:10] one of the things right by the flippers call it totally forgot slingshots right

[32:14] roll over things like that you know maybe a maybe a lane completion sound that kind of stuff

[32:21] so like your like you're a very basic menu of sounds that would go in the game and so I would

[32:27] come up with that then I would you know print out a thing for the programmer go up you know go to

[32:33] his office and talk about okay this is what you play here put this here put this here you know and

[32:39] you know sometimes they would say well I put this thing on here just because I liked it and that's

[32:43] like you know that was like fine if I you know if I didn't like it I'd probably say I don't like

[32:49] it let's try it something else you know and then I would you know I'd get a bunch of feedback on

[32:54] like what they liked and what they didn't and you know we'd talk about it and then you know

[32:58] it's kind of like at that point now we're kind of in the process of you know creating

[33:04] talking about arguing about it figuring out what's best figuring out what works what's fun you know

[33:10] and then it's just kind of a creative iterative process from then on well did you ever you know

[33:18] all that your sound programs were eventually stored on e-prom was there ever an issue of were you

[33:24] were you just ran out of e-prom space you know at ran out of space to store what you want it to do

[33:30] all the time all the time even today right and I'm doing games for ps3 and xp 360 you got a memory budget

[33:41] you got to make decisions about you know what's worth the memory what's worth the CPU crank

[33:47] you know what can I what can I degrade over here so I can fit this other thing in I mean all the time

[33:56] but I mean was it worse back then or is it worse today I don't know I think it's about the same

[34:01] probably I think it's probably it was probably worse back then I mean come on we're dealing with like

[34:06] I think archriols had like 250k I mean now we're like on you know some of the stuff we're doing now

[34:15] it's like well we've got like 16 megs of memory which doesn't yeah it doesn't even seem all that much

[34:23] today yeah but now we're like yeah but we also have to play you know we have to have room for 10

[34:31] thousand sounds because that's you know we've got all these characters we've got this music we've

[34:36] got all these you know every character has their own voice you know so I mean the expectations have

[34:42] gone up gone way up as well okay so now you did the sound for for Harley Davis in the

[34:49] Valley Harley Davidson too you know so you you know that's got some motorcycle sounds in that so

[34:55] what was the process to get you know like revving motors or whatever in into the game yeah that

[35:01] was insane someone I forget who designed that game they had no ramps right right it was a

[35:09] it was competing with the Gottlieb street level design which meant that it was kind of a more

[35:15] of a simplistic design game it was a single layer no no have a trails no ramps nothing like that

[35:21] it was a basic game yep so I don't I forget who did it might have been Ward Pemberton maybe or

[35:30] someone had arranged with a Harley dealer out in Palatine which is the suburb of Chicago that I'd

[35:37] go out there and be able to record some of their stuff so I went out there I think I had a

[35:42] may have may have had a dat recorder at that point something like that and so there was a guy

[35:49] who's a Harley guy and he was you know got a bike out and turned it you know turned it on

[35:54] rev to a couple times we did some drive-byes and then we wanted to get some you know steady state

[36:00] engine stuff and so I got on the back of his bike and he didn't wear a helmet and I was like well

[36:06] probably shouldn't wear a helmet either like that would be kind of wissie if I have to wear a helmet

[36:10] and so like holding on like the back with one hand and holding a microphone down by the

[36:17] pipe and he went like 90 miles an hour just like my it was like my land speed record up to that point

[36:25] and like really kind of dumb actually but it was fun it was just not regular streets

[36:32] yeah but were you getting wind noise too yeah we got a lot of wind noise but I was also holding

[36:39] the microphone back and those pipes are super loud I don't remember if I got anything completely

[36:44] useful from that particular part of it and and whether we would have needed that anyway I think

[36:49] the you know some of the best stuff was just the idle at the beginning of the game because that was

[36:56] I was able to get that pretty isolated and there were some drive-byes that were pretty cool that I

[37:01] think I used in like the jackpot or something like that that I thought worked out pretty well

[37:07] all right now the next game up was machine the bride of pinbott now you said you know like

[37:13] who was the woman that that that did the voice calls for that I don't remember her name I was

[37:21] playing in a in a sort of contemporary music ensemble around that time and we were playing

[37:29] this pretty ambitious piece that called for a couple of sopranos to sing along and it was she

[37:37] was one of them and so I just contacted her and had her come in I had written another like okay so

[37:45] there's this one part where she comes alive right I had written a little piece for that originally

[37:51] and brought someone else into sing it and that got that got the thumbs down I said try again so I

[37:58] re-wrote it a little bit made it more like operatic like a little faster notes basically

[38:05] and then got this other singer and that seemed to do the trick now when you got thumbs down was

[38:12] this python that that was given the thumbs down um might have been yeah I think definitely but

[38:20] I think that was probably other people too and it was python pretty demanding to work for

[38:26] compared to the other designers um you know he would be like he would fixate on a couple different

[38:35] things that like you know we're we're very important for him and for his you know for how he saw

[38:41] the game and the important moments but um well for one thing I think I only did music on that game

[38:48] I don't know if I did that many actual sound effects I forget I think John Haye did a bunch of

[38:52] the sound effects and Rich Carson's recorded a lot of the speech um that actually was one of the

[39:01] was actually Harley Davidson and that were some of the most fun I had writing music for games because

[39:07] I was kind of I mean I was kind of like left to my own devices just do whatever and they seem to like

[39:15] it and so I came up with a main play tune for the bright pinbott and and python really seemed to

[39:24] like it so I think at that point he just kind of let me go and do whatever I wanted to do

[39:29] typically who was the designer that was that let you have them you know the longest leash and who

[39:36] and who had you know who had you on this shortest leash the tough question they were like different

[39:42] at different times like for certain things it's like if it wasn't if it wasn't making it then

[39:47] didn't matter who it was they would let me know and so I'd need to you know rethink it or have a

[39:54] different strategy um Steve's pretty demanding no doubt Steve Richie yeah I mean I mostly work with him

[40:04] um mostly him actually I only did one game with Pat Lawler and that was safe cracker which is like

[40:13] you know sort of way late in the whole pinball thing um Brian Eddie he he could be very

[40:22] very specific and very um picky about certain things all right now you also did party zone and get

[40:30] away high speed um you know now party zone was was party zone a pretty you know interesting

[40:37] you know game to do yeah that was a lot of fun and I um I brought like the the captain b's

[40:45] our guy right he's actually someone that um went to my high school back in Maryland that ended up

[40:52] out in Illinois somehow and I sort of reconnected with him and he I just thought he was like the perfect

[40:59] guy to do that voice I think he did a great job now when you brought somebody in like you know

[41:03] the girl you were talking about that did this singing and um and and your buddy from from Maryland

[41:09] did Williams typically pay these people or did they just do it because wow I'm gonna be in a

[41:14] I'm gonna be in a pinball machine that's really cool um they got paid something they didn't get

[41:19] paid that much but it was there was a time when it was like that that it wasn't really cool to

[41:27] like bring someone in and pay them to do this it was sort of uh I don't know because we had

[41:35] done so much of just like oh just get you know whoever down the hall actually we had a lot of

[41:40] we had a number of people that worked there that were really talented like Ed Boone and Mark

[41:45] Richie both had gray voices for pinball stuff and they did a ton of stuff for our games so

[41:52] the thinking was like well we've got these people here that can do it why who we pay someone to come in

[42:00] but you know to get a wider variety and actually some real some sort of authentic acting skill

[42:09] you do need to do that and you're gonna raise the production levels of the games and then when we

[42:15] when we went into starting to do movie licenses and now we're getting like Patrick Stewart or you

[42:20] know people from characters from Indie Indiana Jones then you know then it became precedent to

[42:30] get people then that were that actually were really talented voice actors to come in and provide

[42:36] voices for the games now on getaway you know you've got um like a ZZ Top Song in it how how hard

[42:45] was it to create or recreate that using the Yamaha synthesizer voices um well it was you know

[42:55] it's not a super complicated song I remember having a hard time really nailing delete that comes

[43:02] in and I don't think I ever really did just because there's some nuances that they do on the guitar

[43:06] that I just couldn't like make work um I don't know I think it I think it went okay I always felt like

[43:17] I did better like writing my own stuff and trying to cop another tune and make it work in um in

[43:26] sort of pinball land because I did I did I did that tune I did um pinball wizard and

[43:38] rock and roll part three for the um super high impact game

[43:44] it's a song that they often play at half time with basketball games right um you know we

[43:49] licensed that for the super high impact uh football game and I mean they're possible

[43:58] but I don't know I felt more comfortable just writing my own stuff and and because then I could

[44:02] take then I could like write stuff that was I guess more tailored to what the the instruments could do

[44:11] right right yeah you could write stuff that the the hardware could take advantage of instead of

[44:16] kind of reverse engineering songs right and like for example I remember just kind of cringing

[44:24] at the pinball wizard thing because I needed to you know we didn't have singing for it so I had to

[44:30] do the vocal line with an instrument and I just never like I just never felt really comfortable

[44:35] with the way that sounded now you did uh start track next generation and this was a change in

[44:42] hardware you now had the DCS platform maybe we should talk about the development of the DCS

[44:48] platform and and and how big the changes were from um you know from you know a music engineers

[44:55] point of view um it was great um it was what any audio guy would have want would have been wanting

[45:03] for years and uh Matt Booty that was his brainchild and he and an engineer named Ed Keenan work

[45:11] together tirelessly to bring that to light um and it was not without its share of controversy

[45:19] because there are some people that didn't want to use it that didn't want to change and didn't

[45:23] want to take the risk because it was a risk um but you know they persevered and eventually it caught

[45:31] on and people you know who isn't going to want to be able to have orchestral music coming out of

[45:35] their pinball machine I mean that that that kind of thing you know with heart you couldn't hold

[45:41] that down forever um we could actually write what I call real music uh for a change you know with

[45:48] with you know using whatever is out there to make sound you know whether it's a sample library

[45:54] or like the latest synthesizer um all the sudden anything was possible as far as what kind of

[46:01] music you could bring in at the same time it brought a whole new set of challenges because

[46:11] now every piece of music is taking up a discrete chunk of memory whereas before you had

[46:19] an instrument that all you needed was some like really tiny bits of data to make it go

[46:25] now you're actually every piece of sound is using a sample memory and so you know we had to start

[46:31] using a lot more memory and of course the designers are always wanting to put more and more more

[46:37] stuff in the games I mean tons more speech more music you know the games the rules and the games

[46:42] themselves got a lot more complicated so you need just a lot more material so I mean yeah it was

[46:49] cool it was absolutely cool it never wanted to turn back but there was you know you still had the

[46:53] challenge of you know there's all this stuff that I need to get done and this is my finite amount

[46:59] of memory so how do I wedge it in there and so the solution for a lot of it was to

[47:07] start writing you kind of architect the music in a certain way so that you can repeat a section

[47:15] and then have an ending that moves you into the next section and so you write these little modules

[47:21] like little loops basically and then you can string them together in like a kind of like a playlist

[47:27] fashion now what when you said you said there was risks and you said there was some people that

[47:33] didn't want this hardware why you know what were the risks and why would some people not want this

[47:40] because my understanding is is now instead of having like you said having you know a limited

[47:45] number of voices or whatever everything was basically you know converted into like an MP3 format

[47:53] and just you know and basically the hardware hit playback right yeah well okay so I mean it sounds

[48:02] great right but then the realities were as it was being developed I think there was one I think it

[48:09] was I think Indy was the first game that actually used it in fact I think Twilight Zone was going

[48:17] to use it but then didn't so Indy was the first game to use it and so this is like the hardware

[48:21] is in beta the hardware and the software is in beta and it's not totally you know all the

[48:26] kinks aren't worked out and I think Brian Eddie is like sitting in there one night programming is

[48:30] game and the game is quiet nothing's having all the sudden this like you know 90 decibel shriek

[48:37] comes out of the sound system and just scares the pants off and and it's like a horrible like a horrible

[48:44] sound is just coming out of it it's like that kind of thing is like bad PR for trying to you know

[48:50] get your get a new sound system up and running and it's just one of the things that happens along

[48:54] the way obviously you know whatever bug it was was found and it went away but like that made people

[49:00] be like oh I don't want that in my game yeah well you but now you've got voice you know real voice

[49:09] samples I mean and things are really I mean you know you don't have that problem with the S's

[49:14] in the half's anymore at least not to a large degree so I you know I just I can't imagine

[49:20] anybody not wanting that yeah and it well but people right but people's priorities are often

[49:28] you know different and they're used to the way things work you might be introducing a cost

[49:35] element that they don't they don't want yeah I mean like some people have been like

[49:42] extremely successful successful with the old hardware so why you know they're they would be nice

[49:47] but that it's not absolutely necessary for them it just wasn't necessarily a priority and I'm

[49:51] sure there was some politics going on too so like for Star Trek the next generation they did you

[49:59] know you you had the actors actually I guess come in and record these parts I actually flew

[50:08] out to LA and recorded them at a recording session where they were you're familiar with ADR

[50:17] or looping that's the process by which actors will go back into the studio to record the lines

[50:23] that for whatever reason they couldn't use the live audio from the take okay so they'll go in

[50:31] and essentially lip sync their own dialogue so there there was a bunch you know this is in the

[50:38] middle of production for some one of the seasons of the show and so then they all live I'm sure

[50:45] they all live in LA close by and they had over this week of time scheduled them so you know they

[50:53] scheduled to come in and replace their dialogue and so I was able to tag along at the end of those

[51:00] sessions and get them to record the script that we had created for the game now Star Trek

[51:11] the next generation also had a home ROM with some custom speech in it did I mean were they doing

[51:17] this recording at the same time for that too yeah I think once I had recorded my the stuff I needed to

[51:25] get I told them hey you know because I think a lot of them were actually getting a machine out of it

[51:31] that's it hey you can record anything you want and we'll put it in your game

[51:36] until a bunch of them did that in was there different actual different sound robs for different actors

[51:43] I don't think so I think we maybe just made one that had all of it in there and maybe maybe

[51:51] Dwight Sullivan the program he might have programmed it to like just you know for the

[51:59] you know the Patrick Stewart game would play his stuff when you did whatever button combo at the

[52:05] beginning or hit the flipper buttons because I remember there's something simple where you could

[52:07] just cycle through them all right now when this was like a new thing for you to go out and record

[52:17] these these voices of the of the actors on on site I mean was this was this uh I mean was this

[52:23] more fun or was this kind of a track it was fun and scary because you know sort of meeting these

[52:32] extremely popular uh television and movie actors and I didn't want to make a mistake and I didn't

[52:41] want to look stupid so yeah it was kind of scary but it was it was cool it was definitely stressful

[52:46] but it was fun at the same time okay now the next game after Star Trek that you did was pinball circus

[52:55] with python tell me tell me about that game and tell me about the sounds for it um that game was

[53:03] was a lot of fun uh we never finished it um yeah it was it was it was insane I think

[53:13] there was some frustration because it was like I think we kept changing programmers and

[53:19] there was um I don't think there was clear design direction on like where some of the rules were

[53:25] going um but I managed to create you know pieces of music for each level because there are a bunch

[53:34] of different play fields that you would get to um yeah I mean it's just an incomplete right there

[53:41] was although one thing that was really fun about that was I did like a classical guitar piece for

[53:49] I guess it was a trap piece woman or something like that but yeah it just never it never really

[53:55] got out of like an alpha stage I don't think I mean just like it um it never it never really came

[54:03] together it was really cool though so this is a completely you know a non-licensed game a

[54:09] completely original game so you basically got to sit down and write all the music with with

[54:14] whatever instruments you're comfortable with with it was just a lot more work

[54:18] you know it's interesting I actually started that game with the Yamaha system and wrote some stuff

[54:27] and then once we moved over to dcs I re-wrote it with you know because I had you know at that time

[54:35] I was using a k2000 and I had a couple other synths and you know some kind of rudimentary

[54:42] orchestral libraries and things like that so I tried to do sort of orchestral stuff

[54:48] and then like there's a jazz piece for the elephant I think

[54:54] for the z-ry forget and then like this sort of punk rock or heavy metal rock thing for the crazy

[55:02] clown at the very top evil clown guy it was python really doing a nice job with this game in your

[55:08] opinion I don't know I don't it's it seemed like he wasn't completely focused on it and that

[55:16] and I don't really know what happened to it um because it could have been I mean maybe it was

[55:25] just something that was too hard to like really engineer I mean because I think there were there

[55:30] were definitely some issues with what can you actually do with a vertical like a vertically oriented

[55:39] pinball machine like it was I mean maybe there was something about like these really small play

[55:44] fields with small flippers hitting the ball and you can't really keep it in any one place for very

[55:52] long and then it goes I don't know I don't know what the problem was um but I think there were

[55:59] aspects of it this kind of became too difficult to maintain um design direction and probably

[56:05] engineering and hardware okay so now you do the game with with Brian Eddie the shadow um

[56:12] yeah once again did you have to go out and get um and get the actors to get to get their voices

[56:18] and get their voice calls yeah I went out to LA and recorded canelpie and miller and tim curry

[56:26] and john lone I think those were the three and um that was a pretty fun game to do and

[56:38] yeah you know I think he like I think Brian I mean Brian gets like you know he's pretty demanding

[56:44] and we'll like stick to his guns on a lot of stuff but but I felt like he liked you know

[56:52] unbalanced the the music that I wrote you know from the get go and then if there was stuff

[56:58] that he didn't like he would it would be like little aspects of stuff I don't think I ever had

[57:03] to throw anything out with him were you less intimidated by the actors in this movie then you

[57:09] were and say star track yeah I think I sort of I'd already done I don't kind of been there done

[57:15] at that point so it wasn't as that stressful a situation now with no fear how was you know that

[57:24] was a licensed theme but it was kind of like a loose license I mean you had you probably had a lot

[57:30] more space to roam sound wise right yeah um I collaborated with Vince Ponderelli on that game he

[57:38] wrote most of the music I think I wrote maybe main play and gosh maybe a couple of the tunes and

[57:45] then I focused on the speech and the sound effects for that I seemed to recall we recorded a friend

[57:53] of Steve Richie's dirt bike for that game for some of them dirt bike stuff and Greg Ferris to a lot

[58:03] of the voice for it too who did the skull talking that was Steve oh really it was Steve huh okay

[58:13] and then I processed it what to add some edge to it yeah yeah I think I pitched it down at

[58:21] it's some reverb and some probably some some coursing or something like that now when you're doing

[58:28] this this sound processing are you doing this in the in the in the William studio or ready your

[58:32] desk at that time I was working from home I was a contractor so I had a home studio you know with

[58:44] I forget what I was using at that point probably pro tools also probably sound maybe sound

[58:51] forward at that point I'm not sure and we were also in the early days of DCS we actually had

[58:57] a proprietary piece of software that we would record we I guess maybe we would process our files

[59:05] into it that it would because then it would spit it out of the very specific sample rate that we

[59:09] needed but then I think eventually we're able to just use sound for it to do that for attack from

[59:14] Mars um wait now who was doing the the the voices for for attack from Mars that was mostly people

[59:25] around the company Tim Kittsrow who did a lot of voice work for us over the years we hired him

[59:31] he was a couple I think probably a couple characters he was definitely the general

[59:36] um and he could do he could do a lot he could do a lot of different things with his voice

[59:42] so he probably played a number of characters but we had Vince I believe played the French guy

[59:48] um god I get that one confused with revenge from Mars

[59:53] um I believe Sal Davida did the Italian voice you know who he is no he's longtime video game guy

[01:00:04] he worked on I believe total carnage and B.A. Jam and a full blitz um longtime midway video game guy

[01:00:16] um most recently worked on TNA wrestling um anyway he did the Italian guy um gosh who else

[01:00:31] was what other countries did we uh stereotype in that in that game well the uh UK of Italy France

[01:00:39] okay so UK that was a woman that from the sales department I think it was Rachel I forget her

[01:00:44] last name USA was probably the general that would have been Tim so you're just again reaching around

[01:00:52] reaching around the midway Williams and Bally just picking people pretty much although

[01:00:58] again Tim we hired Tim Kittsrow he came in now what about unsafe cracker who did all who was the

[01:01:04] voices in that game we hired no see I'm thinking of maybe the German guy I don't even remember

[01:01:11] well like he liked the guard you know who was the guard I don't remember in the woman in the woman

[01:01:21] you know candy you know that that woman we probably hired someone to do that but again I don't

[01:01:27] remember who that was I've got to I wonder if I even have an archive of that somewhere I have to

[01:01:32] go listen to it and then maybe that would uh kick start my memory I remember the music writing

[01:01:40] the music for that was actually a lot of fun it's good music I like I like to save cracker stuff

[01:01:45] thank you it what uh how was it working for Pat um great I mean we got along fine I think he

[01:01:53] liked what I did I don't know if that game did very well well in the collector market after the

[01:02:01] fact I mean it's uh you know it game sells for a lot of money I mean it's it's in high demand but I

[01:02:08] think at the time you know at the time it being a pat lawler game you know there was high expectations

[01:02:15] and I and it didn't you know they only sold you know like 1200 copies or something like that

[01:02:21] yeah maybe you know it was kind of a novel idea and people weren't sure you know how to approach it

[01:02:26] right right okay so now you did the big game you didn't mean evil madness what what was your

[01:02:32] responsibility on that game all the music all the sound effects um and you know at least recording

[01:02:40] the speech that one's got a great story behind it though uh friend of mine um was producer at second

[01:02:47] city uh the comedy place in Chicago and she got my wife and I tickets to go see a show and we saw

[01:02:57] it was absolutely hilarious and you know we're starting a sort of production meetings or pre-production

[01:03:03] meetings on medieval madness and hey what if we got some like really genius comedy writers to come

[01:03:10] in and write some stuff for us and maybe they could do some of the voices too and they like that idea

[01:03:16] and so we hired um Scott Adcid and uh Kevin Dorf who are some of the main guys at the show that we

[01:03:25] saw um Scott Adcid has it's like I don't know if you know if you watch 30 Rock he's like the producer

[01:03:32] on the show the bald guy okay and he's been in a number of movies um and so he and Kevin Dorf

[01:03:41] um who I think has been a writer for Conan for a long time um they you know they met with us

[01:03:50] got the idea of the game like you got these damsels that get rescued by the dragon you've got the

[01:03:55] you've got the uh the evil king you've got all these barons and lords and stuff and and there's all

[01:04:01] this all this stuff going on and um you know what can you do with that so they went away and came

[01:04:08] back and wrote like a bunch of material a bunch of jokes did some character stuff Scott Adcid ended

[01:04:14] up doing like a bunch of voices um King of Pain he was like the evil guy right right right

[01:04:21] so he did him and he did a bunch of other voices and they could do a lot of a lot of vocal stuff

[01:04:27] and um Tina Fey was one of the people that was at second city at that time and she came in and we

[01:04:34] recorded her for some of the voices she was like you know I there was like the jousting competition

[01:04:40] she's like a bet followed chickens on the whole steam or something like that I mean some of those

[01:04:46] lines huh that was her before she was anyone right which is really cool and then there was a

[01:04:54] number of other people from second city that came in to do different voices and um I think they

[01:04:59] just wrote they wrote great material and their their voice acting is really good and I think it

[01:05:05] really helped make that game a ton of fun now why didn't they do that you know have you know

[01:05:11] professional comedy writers come in and do any any other you know uses methodology on any other

[01:05:15] games oh they did on think I think on no good gofers but I think that was um I think I was the

[01:05:27] only one aside from that like you've either got a like a licensed game that you know kind of comes

[01:05:35] pre-loaded with you know famous talent um I mean yeah no it was a great idea and I think it paid off

[01:05:44] in that in that one for sure yeah I mean it must be great to be associated with you know

[01:05:51] now I was some people would consider the best pinball of the last 20 years you know really wow

[01:05:59] yeah I mean there's yeah I mean a lot of people think medieval madness is is awesome you know I mean

[01:06:04] that that's definitely a great game yeah yeah all right now uh revenge from Mars again you got to

[01:06:11] you have a you've moved to pinball 2000 and it's a different hardware platform it did things change

[01:06:18] when you went to this platform um well I was still using the same hardware I think we managed to get

[01:06:25] a little bit more memory because there are a lot of modes yeah I think I had to you know it needed

[01:06:31] a lot more sound than a regular pinball machine because then you had stuff on screen that you had

[01:06:36] to represent but all pretty much a lot of the stuff that happened on screen for the most part

[01:06:42] was basically an outgrowth of what was happening on the play field so if you shoot ball up a ramp

[01:06:48] and you need a completion sound or a ramp entry sound for the ball going up the ramp that's the

[01:06:55] thing that's likely going to trigger something on the screen and so the sound is going to be related

[01:07:01] or it's going to be the same sound like if you shoot ball up a ramp and it blows up a spaceship

[01:07:07] then that's the sound of the ball going up the ramp it did give us the opportunity though to do

[01:07:14] like these kind of elaborate theatrical introductions to all the different gain all the different

[01:07:19] modes and so that was a chance to you know it was it was more stuff that we need to do a little

[01:07:24] musical intros or like sound effect things or like alien thing funny or stupid things I mean

[01:07:32] so yeah there was more probably more choreography possibilities if you hold the ball and then you can

[01:07:37] do you know I mean think of like what you used to do with a dot matrix display now you can do

[01:07:41] like a full video display and it's just a lot more elaborate and therefore you can do more detail

[01:07:47] and having audio support that is just going to make it that much more powerful and entertaining and

[01:07:52] engaging now so the development tools because this is running all running on physically on a PC the

[01:07:59] development tools weren't any easier to use or you know made life easier for you in any way

[01:08:06] you know for me that I was not as affected by that because I was still you know writing my music

[01:08:11] and you know creating and editing my sound effect and and that's the great thing about DCS I

[01:08:18] could use commercially available tools to do all my asset creation at some point I have to run

[01:08:23] that stuff through the proprietary data compression algorithms and then whatever I need to do to

[01:08:28] assemble them assemble all the stuff into the coherent files that get loaded into the game but

[01:08:35] then they get loaded in and the programmer and then the programmer can play them from the game

[01:08:42] now was the DCS compression was that pretty much like an MP3 compression I don't know

[01:08:52] that much about how that worked a lot of that was done by Matt Ed Keenan and a guy named Rich

[01:08:59] Carstens who helped a lot with optimizing from the performance I know that there was some

[01:09:06] Fourier analysis of the frequency spectrum and then some manipulation of the frequency bands to

[01:09:14] throw out unneeded data but it was not lawless it was lawsy compression and we had we we would play

[01:09:22] tricks like you could get away with compressing speech data a lot but you would never want that

[01:09:31] speech data to be played by itself because it had because by compressing it a lot you would create

[01:09:39] these artifacts that would sound like birds or something in there I mean it's like an audible artifact

[01:09:45] however if you were playing music at the same time music that would have been compressed at a lower

[01:09:51] rate because you don't want to degrade the quality of the music you wouldn't hear you wouldn't hear

[01:09:57] any of these artifacts so as long as as long as most of the speech is being played over other

[01:10:04] sounds you'd be fine and if there was ever a circumstance where you're playing a speech call

[01:10:12] you know in silence or over very little background then you would make sure that you would not

[01:10:17] compress that one very much because then you wouldn't because of so you wouldn't hear the artifacts

[01:10:21] and you had complete control over the compression of the individual tracks

[01:10:29] yes and it's not really track it's just individual sound files so we would do all our music in mono

[01:10:38] so it's just you know the music would be basically be comprised of you know maybe six to

[01:10:44] twelve individual wave files and then you would run I would build you know make a script file that

[01:10:52] would have you know the compression algorithm in a couple parameters and then the name of the file

[01:10:59] and then it would create the output from that now when when Valley Williams you know basically

[01:11:09] finished pinball they were done with with with pinball how did that affect you I mean how you

[01:11:15] know were you under contract or were you actually there when black Monday came I was not under

[01:11:23] let's see I guess I was under contract but I was working from home again and I was

[01:11:30] probably in the middle of working on a bunch of different video games so I mean it was sad

[01:11:39] and kind of surprising in a way just because of the success of revenge from Mars I guess we'd

[01:11:46] thought that you know we're still going but yeah it was very sudden now you shifted over to

[01:11:55] Stern and you did sound for Simpson's pinball party in 2003 how did you make that transition and

[01:12:03] how was the sound I mean it's not DCS it's it's maybe a step backwards or maybe it isn't you

[01:12:13] do you tell me it was definitely harder to work with and it was it's a sample it was a sample

[01:12:22] playback soundboard yeah it was a lot there was a lot more work in just sort of getting to square one

[01:12:30] than you would if you were using DCS where square one's already in front of you and that's just a

[01:12:36] manner like writing the music that you want to do now for that pinball machine all I did was the

[01:12:42] main play tune and I had to actually discontinue that project fortunately Chris Granger was available

[01:12:49] and interested in willing to take it over and so we worked something out between me him and

[01:12:54] Stern and so he basically took the ball around with it so are you saying for the Stern system you

[01:13:01] didn't like just sit down and write the songs on any available instruments that that you care to

[01:13:07] use and and and ran it through some processor to get it out into the soundboard no okay so the way

[01:13:14] that system worked it's a sample playback system so I created a library of sound samples that

[01:13:22] I thought I needed to do the Danny Elf version of the Simpson theme and I'm sure there was some

[01:13:31] requirements and I wanted to loop some of them and I had to do whatever technical requirements to

[01:13:36] make the samples sound good and then I believe I wrote a score probably very similar to the kind

[01:13:46] of score that we used to do for the Yamaha chip where you explicitly turn notes on and off

[01:13:54] and comply a pitch bend and loop sections and all that stuff in a in a text file basically

[01:14:02] that got compiled and then I could play on a development and I had a development actually

[01:14:07] you know I went over there and talked to them and they showed me the game and what I ended up

[01:14:11] doing was I did sort of a first I did like kind of a first pass of you know here's the main play

[01:14:17] tune here are a collection of sound effects that are going to that are going to be applied to very

[01:14:22] specific events in the game and so I kind of did like the first the foundation of the audio for

[01:14:28] that game and then Chris kind of took it over and you know used what he wanted and then created the

[01:14:34] rest of on his own so this was this was a lot a lot more work than the DCS thing

[01:14:41] um yes definitely yeah for again for square one you have to come out you have to do a bunch of

[01:14:48] work to create a bunch of samples that will work that that you then will trigger to make the music

[01:14:55] now the samples I mean how do you create the samples the samples weren't created the same way as

[01:14:59] DCS like you created you know sound files right so I would have you know I have a bunch of

[01:15:07] synthesizers and orchestral libraries and things like that so I would play a couple trumpet notes

[01:15:12] a couple trombone notes a bass you know bass notes and sample those into sound forage and then

[01:15:18] do whatever massaging I needed to in there whether I needed to make it loop well or not

[01:15:25] and then probably I'm sure there was a sort of assembly and compilation phase

[01:15:33] before I could then load it into the hardware and play it so you couldn't actually just record

[01:15:41] anything and end up sampling that into into the machine no no there'd be no way to do that

[01:15:50] no well I mean you could but um I think you would like run out of memory in like 10 seconds

[01:15:57] all okay so that's really what it came down to was was how all this stuff got compressed

[01:16:04] yeah um you know I remember the specs on how much memory it had but um clearly it was

[01:16:11] um because you had to you had to you know for all your sound effects you had to be able to

[01:16:17] save room for those as well as speech um and I don't remember you know how that was handled

[01:16:23] because you know I never did the speech for that game but uh I would guess you could probably

[01:16:29] down sample it and maybe that maybe there was some compression algorithms as well I just don't remember

[01:16:35] now you haven't done a pinball work since the census is that correct correct

[01:16:40] and are you still working in the gaming industry yeah I work for one or both this games and

[01:16:46] I'm working um working on the next mortal combat oh okay okay and how's that going

[01:16:54] very well it's gonna be really great and there's a ton of stuff in there I can't really talk

[01:17:00] much about it but um yeah I'm working on that and it's a lot of fun and and doing a lot of

[01:17:06] different things and new things that that I hadn't done before um as far as getting in and actually

[01:17:12] implementing a lot of the sound in into the game itself so that's pretty exciting now why

[01:17:17] didn't you do anymore pinball work for Stern at that point um I took I came uh in house to midway

[01:17:28] and ran the sound department and so that would have been a conflict interest right

[01:17:35] I guess but really it was a conflict of time at that point oh I didn't think that I could devote

[01:17:43] enough time to you know to give them what they needed right right I mean if if I hadn't if Chris

[01:17:52] hadn't been around I probably would have found a way to do it but um it just it just worked out

[01:17:58] better for everyone that he was able to take it over all right cool is there anything that I forgot

[01:18:04] to ask or anything I left out or anything you'd like to add um I don't know that's covered a lot

[01:18:11] of territory there yeah well cool well thank you Dan Fordon uh thank you very much uh for talking

[01:18:18] to us tonight on on top cast really appreciate it um uh yeah and oh well keep an eye out for mortal

[01:18:26] combat how much of the sound are you doing for that um we got at least one two three four five

[01:18:34] people working on it yeah and there's going to be more because we're going to have to we're

[01:18:41] going to have to ramp up in what platform is this on this will be for uh PS3 and Xbox 360

[01:18:50] oh cool well again thank you very much I really appreciate your time all right all right thank you

[01:18:56] I'd like to thank Dan Fordon sound engineer for Valley Williams and Stern pinball

[01:19:06] off coming on top cast with us tonight really appreciate his time and it was a great

[01:19:10] interview talking to him about uh development of sound in these all these pinball machines
