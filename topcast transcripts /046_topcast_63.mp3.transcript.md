[00:00] Hi there pinball fans, it's your favorite clown crusty and you're listening to Norman Shaggy on the Topcast.

[00:06] The greatest pinball show ever made.

[00:10] Can I get my money now? I'm such a whore.

[00:15] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinball's online radio.

[00:20] For more information visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com slash Topcast.

[00:30] Well welcome all you pinball fans, this is Topcast here, Shaggy running Topcast for you.

[00:42] Live today and we've got a very very special guest.

[00:47] Somebody that I've been trying to get on the show for quite some time and it had a hard time getting them on.

[00:54] Mostly because I think it's in the whole thing and he just couldn't do it.

[00:59] But do some circumstances, he has gotten his hands untied, sort of speak,

[01:05] and things have changed a little bit in the pinball world, at least for him and probably for a lot of us in the last week or so.

[01:12] And we hope to talk to him about that.

[01:15] So right now let's get running.

[01:20] Special guest.

[01:23] Special guest.

[01:26] Alright, I'd like to welcome Keith Johnson to Topcast today.

[01:31] We're going to be calling Keith up right now, but Keith has been first to actually work at Williams Valley in the late 1990s.

[01:39] And his name is business associated with Revenge from Mars.

[01:42] Though I'm sure he did some other work there and we're going to talk to him about that.

[01:46] But that's the most notable thing that comes up on the pinball database is his work on Revenge from Mars.

[01:51] And then of course the pinball division of Williams closed in 1999.

[01:57] And then he slid over to Stern pinball and started working on some games like Striker Extreme, Sharky Shootout, Hyrule or Casino, Austin Powers.

[02:07] Of course Simpsons pinball party, Lord of the Rings, Elvis, World Polk or Tour, Wheel of Fortune.

[02:16] And he's had a couple other games that they've been working on too that we'll talk about some newer games in that.

[02:22] But anyways we're going to give Keith a call right now.

[02:33] Hello.

[02:34] Keith it's Clay.

[02:35] Hey, how you doing?

[02:36] Can you hear me okay?

[02:37] Yep, I can hear you fine.

[02:39] Okay, so you're ready?

[02:41] I think so.

[02:43] All righty.

[02:44] So let's talk about how you got into pinball, like what your first memories of it and your whole, you know, how you came down this winding, strange path.

[02:54] Well, I always played pinball as a kid.

[02:58] I remember in the 70's going to the boardwalk during the summer on the east coast, I'm from DC.

[03:05] So we get a like, Reho with the Chosen City Maryland, that kind of stuff.

[03:11] Before there are too many video games out, you know, I'd always go up to pinball games and play them for a little bit.

[03:17] And that kind of changed once the video game started coming into Vogue.

[03:22] And I played a lot of video games for a long time, you know, Space Invaders, Blacks and all those kinds of things.

[03:28] So I was really more of a video game player for a long time.

[03:31] And then as a video game model started switching to more of a, just try to get the next quarter, you know, keep playing.

[03:39] And then I got a quarter, you know, keep the game going, that kind of thing.

[03:43] I kind of found myself going back to pinball around college.

[03:46] And college is when I started playing, like really seriously, and you know, eventually started going to tournaments and that kind of thing.

[03:52] Yeah, you're a pretty good player, right?

[03:55] Yeah, I'm one of the better ones probably, yeah.

[03:59] Okay, and so what school did you go to and what did you major in?

[04:03] Virginia Tech, guys, study computer science.

[04:06] Did you know Duncan Brown at the time?

[04:09] I didn't really know Duncan until later, not until, not until Williams.

[04:16] Okay.

[04:17] But I mean, I knew that, I knew he was originally from Charlottesville and stuff, yeah.

[04:21] And what, what was your first job out of college?

[04:25] I worked at a little company called Advanced Systems.

[04:28] They were, they were basically Microsoft shop, you know, do things like access and Excel.

[04:35] Custom solutions for, you know, various size businesses and that kind of thing.

[04:40] And what were a lot of Microsoft work and then from there, what your company called DataTell,

[04:47] which specializes in software for colleges, you know, running their, you know, like class scheduling or, you know, financial aid stuff and things like that.

[04:59] Basically anything that a college needs to work at, you know, that company did.

[05:04] And so how did you get, how did you get your foot in the door at Williams Valley?

[05:11] Um, honestly, you know, I'm sure a lot of it was, you know, I've been active on RGP for a long time, you know, over 16 years.

[05:20] Um, so, you know, I, at one time or another, I've had contact, you know, with all kinds of people, you know, that, you know, before they worked there,

[05:28] after they worked there, you know, whichever.

[05:31] Um, and then a lot of us, you know, we started hanging out on a, a NIRC channel, you know, a lot of pimbalded enthusiasts.

[05:38] And, um, at one point Larry made a comment on IRC that, um, about looking for people and I just asked him, you know, I don't say, you know, that might be interested.

[05:51] That was late 97.

[05:54] So I went over to Williams during expo 97 and met with a bunch of people and, you know, talked and said, yeah, okay, um, I'm definitely interested.

[06:05] It was mostly for slots because there weren't any pimbalded enthusiasts at the time.

[06:10] So you started, you know, all the kinds of slot machines that they're working on.

[06:14] I hadn't really been to Vegas or anywhere, gambling in quite a while so I didn't know with the state of slot machine development and that kind of thing.

[06:23] So it was very tricky to me, you know, they're, uh, it looked like it would be fun to, you know, develop slot machines the way they were doing them.

[06:32] You know, things that are just, you know, pull the lever and hope for symbols to come up.

[06:37] You know, the bonus game aspect, you know, really appealed to me.

[06:41] You were working on, you were working on this in the spinning real division, working on the dotation slots then.

[06:47] Yes, that's correct.

[06:49] Yeah, I, um, yeah, I didn't, I didn't do anything about the job until, uh, I told an idea.

[06:56] I wanted to see what the review of my current job would be and if they pay me more money and that kind of thing.

[07:01] And, uh, I was a really satisfied with what they offered me.

[07:04] So I eventually, um, talked to Larry again, it's like, you know, I'm a book, I'm interested in coming over to Williams.

[07:11] Um, so at the end of March, 1998, I was up there.

[07:16] And what, uh, what slots did you work on there?

[07:19] Um, neither of them were produced. I was only in slots for probably about six months.

[07:24] Um, I worked on the, uh, double winning streak slot machine, which is, uh, same as winning streak, but, um, the goal was to get the symbols both the same, the same in both the dot game and the base game.

[07:39] And also to have if winning streak, winning streak would be wild anywhere, but if they're on the line, they'd score a double.

[07:47] So, so, uh, basically did a math sheet for that and got it working.

[07:52] And, um, and then, uh, I was also working with Scott Somiani on five line mermaid gold.

[08:01] Now, did either of those games ever get released because I've never seen those two.

[08:06] No, neither of those were released to my knowledge.

[08:09] Yeah, because I, uh, double winning streak one was going to be for Delaware only because of, um,

[08:15] the settlement of the tell us patent with IGT back then.

[08:20] Right.

[08:21] So, basically we weren't allowed, Williams wasn't allowed to do anything virtual real wise except for Delaware.

[08:29] Does Delaware require a certain number?

[08:32] I like a cap on the percentage that any one company could, you know, penetrate the market or something like that.

[08:39] So, part of the deal's IGT was, okay, we can use, you know, the tell us patent in Delaware machines only.

[08:47] So, so double winning streak, you know, wouldn't have, wouldn't have made it anywhere else other than Delaware until, you know, the patent expired or whatever.

[08:56] It just for the sake of our listeners, the tell us patent it basically said if, if you had a real and it had 11 symbols on it,

[09:04] it basically meant that there was 22 stops between, you know, blanks and symbols.

[09:09] And you could divide the real into 22 pieces of pie essentially.

[09:14] But the tell us patent it said, okay, well, instead of 22 pieces of pie, even though there's only 11 symbols on there, maybe you could divide it into 72 stops.

[09:23] And then you could have much, much longer odds.

[09:28] But, but IGT had a patent on that.

[09:31] So, and there were actually the gaming commissions had problems with this whole thing because, you know, dividing, you know, the real into more slices than there were symbols was kind of, you know, intrinsically kind of wrong in a lot of ways.

[09:48] Well, yeah, Vegas has a lot of rules in terms of what players perceive and what, and what actually needs to happen.

[09:57] Like, for example, if you represent something as a deck of cards in Vegas, then it literally has to be a straight up deck of cards.

[10:04] If you represent something as a die or dice, then they have to be straight up, you know, one in six chances.

[10:13] That wasn't, you know, they got away with that with spinning real stuff in order to, you know, make better payouts and that kind of thing.

[10:22] But there were certain rules that the most, the rule I remember specifically is that one symbol could not appear more than six times as often as an adjacent symbol.

[10:37] So, like, if you, you know, if you see megabucks above or below the line, then, then if you see that like 12 times and two times, you have to see it on the line.

[10:48] You know, that kind of thing.

[10:51] So, when you were, you got over to the pinball division. Was this because of pinball 2000?

[11:00] Actually, what happened was that, you know, I got there and, you know, I saw everything that was going on with the division of pinball 2000.

[11:09] And, you know, got to be different to those guys, obviously. I knew a lot of people before, you know, I even started there, which kind of helped.

[11:18] I mean, I admit, Lewis, Lyman, Greg, I'm sure a bunch of other people before they had started in the pinball industry.

[11:31] Just to be clear, that's, just to be clear, that's Lewis, CozyR, Lyman Sheets and what Greg Dunlop.

[11:39] Greg, Greg Dunlop, yeah.

[11:41] Okay. Just want to be clear for people. Sorry, sorry, sorry to interrupt.

[11:45] No, no, no, no, no.

[11:47] So, what happened was that there was a big restructuring that summer of 98.

[11:56] You know, basically, the spinning real division wasn't going to be under Larry's purview anymore. He was going to solely oversee pinball.

[12:07] So, there was kind of a reorganization of people and Lyman asked Larry for me to be on a revenge from Mars team.

[12:18] And so, they offered me the position and, you know, it's like, you know, it's think of swim with pinball, you know, there's not really any, you know, there's probably not going any going back to promising if you choose this.

[12:31] And as I go, I want to do pinball stuff, you know, that guy who would take it.

[12:37] So, looking back on the revenge from Mars team and started my pinball career.

[12:42] Looking back on that decision, was that a good choice or a bad choice?

[12:46] There was a good choice. I mean, working on revenge from Mars and, you know, seeing what all the guys are working on and, you know, what was coming up down the line.

[12:56] I mean, I absolutely would have made that choice. I mean, I didn't go to Williams to work on some machines. I went there to work on pinball eventually.

[13:04] So, but I got the chance, you know, I was like, well, yeah, I'll take the chance.

[13:09] Now, what was your responsibilities on revenge from Mars?

[13:15] Well, first, you know, we're just kind of, everyone was messing around trying to figure out, you know, what was fun, what was doable, what we wanted to see in the game.

[13:25] I mean, we went through a lot of stuff, a lot of time when we were just playing around with stuff, trying to see, you know, what was compelling, what was, you know, what you could pull off at the ball or what you could pull off with, you know, the graphics and that kind of thing.

[13:42] So, we were playing around with stuff. Eventually, my responsibilities were, we had like nine modes in the game, three multi balls and we just did beat everything up equally among everyone.

[13:54] At first, there was just Lyman Dwight and myself and then eventually Grand West came out of a game team as well.

[14:01] So, I worked on two modes, Paris and Peril and Mars needs women. One of the bonus modes too, the Martian tank thing.

[14:13] And then I did the final mode in the game, the attack Mars bit.

[14:21] Now, what language were you programming in on Slot and then what language were you programming in on revenge?

[14:29] Most of those were C, C++. So, Slots was C, was C also then?

[14:35] Yeah, yeah. That's where they were making a lot of use of C++.

[14:42] So, was this a language that you were pretty familiar with before you came to Williams Valley?

[14:47] Yeah, yeah, I had done it in college and I had done it at my previous job data tell and to a lot of extent, my job before that advanced system.

[14:58] But, yeah, I was pretty familiar with it.

[15:03] Yeah.

[15:04] Now, about when you got done with revenge, what was your responsibilities were you on Star Wars or were you on Playboy or what were you on next?

[15:18] Now, we were assigned Playboy with Pete and Scott. So, Pete and Scott and Scott, for me, they were the designers of the game and Dwight and I were doing Star Wars 4.

[15:33] And so, hot at house game. And that was the route we were going down. We actually designed a hot at house and we're moving between rooms and stuff like that.

[15:44] And then later on in the process, I got switched over to a Playboy game. And so, we started changing stuff around.

[15:51] We basically restarted from scratch and you know, started trying to cover some rules for that game.

[15:58] And we hadn't gotten all that far with it. We were about to sign the contract with Playboy. I believe the week after Expo, when we shut down on Monday after that.

[16:12] So, so, Playboy was not never playable.

[16:16] There was never what?

[16:18] Playboy never became playable.

[16:21] I mean, there were some rules in it, but there really weren't that many. I mean, there was some stand-up targets that did some stuff and I just finished the start of a multi-ball right before you know, took a couple days off for Expo.

[16:39] And then that was that.

[16:42] Were any of the graphics done for Playboy?

[16:45] No, I mean, it's got to been messing around some stuff himself. And so, we got some things into the game.

[16:52] We kind of got like, we had this calendar rule where you hit targets and fill in letters of each, you know, month, you know, for the year, you know, January, February, March, all that stuff.

[17:04] You know, the goal being you light up the entire month and then eventually, you know, depending on how many you load off, you'd start, you know, kind of almost like a multi-ball band is kind of thing.

[17:13] I mean, that rule never really got flushed out, you know, but we did have things. We did, you know, spell the months and have lights light up and that kind of thing.

[17:21] Is there any version of the haunted house game that survived?

[17:26] Well, there is some code checked into the, you know, checking the version control, but it didn't it didn't do a whole lot.

[17:38] So I'm sure there's code around and you know, the way may even have it for all of you.

[17:44] But, you know, there wasn't a whole lot to it at the time.

[17:49] And did you feel that that was a pretty good theme that that was going to work well with the pinball 2000 platform?

[17:55] And what was looking forward to at least some game design was looking forward to the haunted house game.

[18:02] I mean, we just figured there's so much we could do, you know, having all these different rooms that you could go through and having different things happen in each room.

[18:13] And just, you know, having a spooky team in general, everyone was really looking forward to it.

[18:19] And then, and then interest weighing significantly after it became the Playboy game.

[18:24] Well, yeah, but I mean, there's a lot you could do with the Playboy theme too.

[18:28] No, sure, sure. We just, we just never got to the point where, you know, it had been fully flushed out so to speak, I guess.

[18:36] Yeah, there could be some great home roms for the Playboy one.

[18:40] Oh, no doubt.

[18:42] Well, anyway, so when, after the X-Po 1999, when, you know, when Monday rolled around, where you at work when that, yeah, I mean, I, I come in a little bit later.

[18:56] I usually get there around teniseau. And so I got there and, you know, I saw, I saw a Greg at work first and I mentioned something to him.

[19:07] And he's like, oh, you should be downstairs. And I was like, oh really? What's going on? You should be downstairs.

[19:16] So I started heading back and then everyone else was coming back from the meeting and, you know, I found out pretty quickly after that that Fimba was being shut down.

[19:23] And, you know, that was that.

[19:26] Well, when, I mean, did you see this train wreck coming at all?

[19:31] No, I didn't personally. I mean, there had always been gloom and doom talk around the office. But after, after Revenge and Star Wars seem to be doing pretty well.

[19:43] I was like, okay, we can definitely make something of this.

[19:47] So some people were still down, some people were still up. You know, I was one of the people that was looking forward to it.

[19:55] I think, I think Wizard Box would have been a pretty good game. And I think, and I think Playboy would have been, it wouldn't have probably wouldn't have been as good as Wizard Box.

[20:05] But it would be a game that those two games would have been more pinball than what the previous two games I think were.

[20:16] I like the biggest complaints of the previous two games were that, you know, all you had to do to do anything was, you know, shoot up the middle.

[20:23] But that was on purpose. And I think it was the right decision to get, you know, people that weren't very good at pinball, you know, further into the game and see things happen and stuff like that.

[20:34] The next two games probably would have gotten away from that, to some extent. And, you know, would have been, there would have been more pinballies than just shooting up the middle.

[20:45] But it was the right direction to go or not, you know, I'm not really sure. You know, we don't really know how they would have done comparatively.

[20:54] Now, were you, were you involved like in the initial meetings with, you know, how pinball 2000 was, had like two different limbs of the tree sort of speak where you had, you know, you had pat and gomes and then you had pop a duke.

[21:12] I mean, were you, did you come, were you in on any of those meetings? What was your feeling on that?

[21:17] Well, that stuff had pretty much been decided before I got there. After I got there, Pat and George had already demonstrated the hollow pin thing.

[21:29] And in fact, one of the first things I saw when I got there was Cameron messing around with the play field and hitting this thing, hitting this big, you know, basically hitting this spaceship in the middle of the screen.

[21:42] And, you know, I was, I was instantly blown away with, you know, all the possibilities, all the things that you could, you know, that you could do as a result.

[21:53] So, I was really excited when I thought, I mean, I didn't know anything like that was in the works and when I got there, it was just like, whoa, man, this is really cool.

[22:03] And were you like sworn to secrecy type thing?

[22:06] Sure, sure, yeah.

[22:09] Yeah. And did you production?

[22:11] Yes, I did.

[22:13] And what, you know, how did you feel that the crowd reacted to the whole game concept?

[22:18] I think everyone was really, I think everyone was really excited about it. Everyone was like, you know, everyone had a good time with it.

[22:27] No one had really seen anything like it, you know, you're playing a pinball and you're hitting these virtual Martians and stuff like that.

[22:35] I mean, I think that, you know, the game wasn't finished at the time.

[22:39] You know, I know that we had Paris and Paraldon, we probably had Alien Abduction done.

[22:46] I think we had the Barn Mode done.

[22:52] So, I mean, there were definitely a number of things that people could see and experience.

[22:58] And I think that I think people were pretty excited, which was what they saw for them as far.

[23:05] So then on that Monday morning of, you know, in October 1999, you know, after they closed, I mean, how did you get, you know, the pinball division was shut down essentially?

[23:19] How did you get over to Stern? I mean, how did that transition work?

[23:25] Well, again, you know, most of us were still hanging out on IRC and stuff like that.

[23:33] And Lonnie started showing up and I'd met Lonnie. I originally met Lonnie probably back in IFPA3 in 1993 the first time I met him.

[23:42] And it I'd seen him, you know, at X-Pose and stuff like that and you know, talk to him.

[23:49] So, you know, I just basically asked if there were any positions possibly available at Stern and probably the next week I was in his office.

[23:58] We talked for about three or four hours, I think.

[24:01] And I care about if I type a Gary that same day or if it was a later day, but basically, you know, I talked to Lonnie and Gary and, you know, probably had a job offer within a week or so.

[24:16] The same time I've been talking to Midway because everyone in pinball was talking with Midway and I had a job offer from them as well that I turned down and the go work at Stern.

[24:26] Were you the first Williams guy to go to Stern?

[24:31] I was probably the first person to interview to why it started about a week before I did because I went on the Williams trip to Disney World.

[24:42] You know, the celebration for getting revenge and star wars done. That had already been decided and planned and paid for before the shutdown.

[24:52] So, we went for the week, the last week and it was a week right after Thanksgiving as I recall.

[24:58] And so, I started at Stern, then to the Monday after we got back from that trip.

[25:03] And how was the, you know, the corporate environment different at Stern compared to Williams?

[25:11] You know, the culture as it may be.

[25:16] Well, it's Stern, everything.

[25:21] I think that the biggest joke that Dwight and I had for a long time was that every day we'd see something that made us shake our heads and wonder how there was still in business.

[25:32] It was just amazing that how things came together and got designed and how things were kind of like pushed in at the last minute.

[25:47] I don't know. It was just remarkable that the engineering that occurred at the last minute and actually made it into a finished game.

[26:00] I don't know. Things just weren't as structured and as planned out, I think, because they weren't Williams.

[26:08] Could you give me an example of what, you know, one of the things you shook your head at?

[26:14] Oh, man. It's such a long time ago. I don't, I don't even remember offhand. I'd have to think about it a little bit.

[26:20] It may be Dwight remembers better than I do.

[26:23] But I don't know. There was, right when you first got there and they were working on Striker Extreme, there was an upper foot bar on the game.

[26:36] But there was absolutely no feet to it. It's like if you remember that you shoot the goal and then it was popped up the middle that the goal set into and that you could shoot.

[26:47] It came all the way back to the lower left foot bar. And like, well, there's no feet on the upper foot bar. The ball should come from the goal or the popper up the middle to the upper foot bar.

[27:00] So it's something feeds it and you have an opportunity to actually make that side ramp shot that you put all this money in.

[27:11] So that change actually and you know, is what wound up shipping.

[27:17] If it didn't, there was definitely not as much thought put into some things, I think, as it was a term. But they didn't, as a willowance, but they didn't have as much time to think about certain things either because they were always getting the, they were always getting the next game.

[27:33] They were always getting the game done and they were always working on the next game. And it seems like that what happened most of the time, and one of my biggest complaints about the company was that mechanical department didn't get everything fully done until production.

[27:51] So we're like, you know, working with, you know, kind of half-assed hardware for the most part. And, you know, so we know how things are supposed to wind up and hopefully they wind up working correctly.

[28:04] But for the most part, you know, we just didn't have any time with the final product.

[28:12] Well, you know, that is ultimately one of the biggest problems the company has, I think.

[28:17] Well, why were the, why were the timescadels so much more compressed at Stern compared to Valley Williams?

[28:23] Not as many people for one thing. I mean, you didn't have all the different design teams or, you know, whatever. I mean, and when you have to get things done, when this fires would be put out, everyone has to kind of drop what they're doing and get the game to work, get the game.

[28:39] It's about to go into production to work and to, you know, be buildable and be fun. And then you can go back and do what you were working on and, you know, whether it's the next game or the game after that or whatever.

[28:55] You know, too many things happened where things had to be dropped and you had to get going on on the current project and then you could go back and work on, you know, what you're doing again.

[29:08] So it's just mostly a lack of resources is really what you're saying, just they didn't have as many people on, you know, or you couldn't throw as much money.

[29:17] So well, that's, you know, I guess that's the kind of part of the beauty of the whole thing, huh?

[29:25] I suppose.

[29:26] So what did you end up doing on Stryker Extreme?

[29:30] I finished up some dot work on that game. I believe it was, I believe Orrin did most of the dot work.

[29:38] He was doing a contract for, for, uh, Stern at the time. And I think his, uh, his number of hours have been used up and Dwight and I got hired.

[29:51] So I was, uh, I was putting in some additional display effects or tweaking some ones that lining you the tweaking and that kind of thing.

[30:01] So that's basically, that's basically my contribution to the Stryker Extreme was, you know, finishing up that work.

[30:09] So you went from programming and, and C++ at Williams Valley in both the slot in on revenge. But now you're doing 6809 assembly language, right?

[30:20] So was that a hard transition?

[30:22] Was that so you're doing basically a Valley Williams, you're doing C++ programming. Now you're doing 6809 assembly language. Was that a tough transition?

[30:34] It wasn't too bad. I mean, I had seen some code when I was at Williams.

[30:39] And I grew up with an Apple II personally. So, you know, I had a decent feel for 65 or two.

[30:48] So, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't horrible. You know, and I pick up stuff pretty quick. I mean, you know, I hadn't really written much 6809, you know, before I started at Stern.

[31:00] I pick it up pretty quick and got, you know, got a high roll or casino done within a year.

[31:07] I mean, I probably started six months after I started at Stern. And then the game went into production, the, you know, at the end of the year.

[31:19] Now, did you work on Sharky's shootout also?

[31:22] Yeah, again, that was mostly doing that work on that game.

[31:26] No.

[31:27] Dwight had been working on kind of like, Williamizing a bunch of the Stern operating system, you know, making it more like, making, basically making concepts of game development more like they, you know, we remembered it at Williams.

[31:44] So, he was doing a bunch of that stuff. And I did a couple things. I think I wrote the, the SoundRequest system, you know, while he was doing some other things.

[31:56] And, you know, so I helped out with the operating system a little bit and then started doing all the, started doing all the dot work for Sharky.

[32:11] Lonnie was helping a little bit when he needed to.

[32:17] And then, then after finished up with Sharky's, then, that I started working on High Roller.

[32:28] The Roller. So this was really the first game that you were at from the ground and got a large influence on?

[32:35] Yeah. That would say that, yeah.

[32:37] And how much, I mean, what were your responsibilities on High Roller, casino?

[32:42] Well, it was basically, you know, with some input from John Norris. I mean, I basically designed all the rules from the game.

[32:52] And, you know, it was responsible for programming all the rules, all the choreography, all the devices.

[33:01] I mean, that game, that game had three different devices on it that, you know, again, you know, it's kind of a 6809 semi-newbie.

[33:12] It was, it was a bit of a challenge to get everything going. You had the roulette wheel.

[33:18] You had the stepper motor ramp and you had the auxiliary display in the slot machine.

[33:27] And so it got all three of those things working and, you know, it just became together pretty well.

[33:34] There were a lot of problems with it. There wasn't any really debugging in the system at all.

[33:41] I mean, the only thing you could kind of do was maybe print something out to that matrix display, if you didn't fail in the wrong place.

[33:52] So, one of the things I did after I was done is I started rewriting a lot of the operating system to get rid of a bunch of inefficiencies and put in some actual, helpful debugging stuff.

[34:06] And game development was a lot smoother after that, I think.

[34:12] So, were you basically trying to William's eyes? These guys? I mean, it sounds like you guys were, that was kind of like, you know, I don't know, was it an underground strategy or in everybody who didn't mind this happening or was the resistance?

[34:29] I don't think there was really resistance. And the main stuff that the Dwight and I were doing really only affected software. So, you know, Lonnie was on board with that.

[34:40] So, our goal of making game development easier and basically, you know, making it easier to make better games, you know, I think everyone kind of had to get on board with that. How could you not?

[34:55] Right, right.

[34:57] So, were you happy with how high roller casino came out?

[35:01] Yeah, for them both part. I mean, originally when it came out, you know, there was a lot of stuff that seemed kind of slow and boggy about it.

[35:11] And that was really one of the main reasons why I decided to go through and try and optimize the operating system.

[35:17] Because, as we knew, everything could run a lot faster. I mean, the game was doing way too much work in interrupt, you know, basically using up all the real time.

[35:29] So, just kind of moved a bunch of stuff out of there. And, you know, freed up time and also added features like we started getting easy duty cycle of coils.

[35:43] And then we got the dim lights and, you know, a bunch of stuff like that. And so, the game's ran a lot faster, had more features. You know, it's kind of a win-win win, I guess, in terms of kind of getting everything.

[36:00] You know, just getting a better development environment, getting the games able to do more and eventually getting the games to be more fun.

[36:10] Now, when you said duty cycle in the coils, you mean they weren't doing that before?

[36:15] They could, like, one or two coils, the way they had it set up, but it wasn't, there was a very complex and strange way of doing it.

[36:27] So, you know, we just came up with a way of doing it kind of generically and, you know, could duty cycle any coil.

[36:34] You know, the thing you have to understand is that that system, you know, was basically...

[36:41] It had basically been written since the Asia War days, you know, that's when it started out.

[36:49] Yeah, that was their first game.

[36:51] It was in there that is basically, you know, original 6800 code. And as time goes on, you know, there was, you know, some 6809 stuff got added into it.

[37:02] But by and large, a lot of the code was the same from the initial days of the company.

[37:11] Right, laser war being the first game and actually it was really developed by incredible technologies not by anybody there at Dede East at the time.

[37:20] Yeah, that's correct. You know, Lonnie did most of the work on that game and eventually obviously came over to Dede East at the start.

[37:30] So now, your next game up was Austin Powers. What was your responsibilities on that game?

[37:36] Again, there was mostly dot programming on that game.

[37:40] Kind of had fun with it, you know, there was a lot of...

[37:45] It hadn't really had time or had, you know, had much opportunity to play around too much with display effects and doing different things with them.

[37:56] I think you'll see a big transformation if you go back and look at games is to what was done with the display on games prior to Austin Powers and then what was done on Austin Powers and with games after that.

[38:11] Really had time to play around and get things looking really good.

[38:17] And, you know, I got a better understanding of the scripting system and, you know, how to do more advanced effects and that kind of thing.

[38:26] So, I mean, this is stuff that, you know, that Sega or I did at Dede East and Sega were doing back when it first came out.

[38:35] But I think at some point a lot of the stuff got to be kind of a lost art as people left the company and there was a much time to work on games.

[38:45] So, we started, you know, basically resurrecting the game with the laser display system and I think Austin Powers is kind of a leap forward in what had been going on at the time at the company in terms of how that display looked.

[39:01] Now, were you would charge any of the rules or play field layout or anything of that sort on Austin Powers?

[39:08] The play field was all done by Lonnie and John Bord. You know, they wanted a, Lonnie's big thing was that, you know, they wanted to do a tack for Mars style play field.

[39:23] You know, I guess basically a fan where you had something interesting at the middle of the scene that, you know, you should have enough times and a modes would start and that kind of thing.

[39:33] So, that was all Lonnie and John. I probably wrote the final mode in that game, the Moon based multi-ball on his I recall. I haven't played that in so long that, you know, I don't remember it too well.

[39:47] But I do remember writing that. But for the most part, my responsibilities were just getting this play effects done. And taking them out when they weren't approved by Michael Myers or by Newliner, whoever.

[40:01] Yeah, how much of that game, I mean, there was a lot you could have really done with that game. Was there a lot that was not approved by Mike Myers for that game?

[40:11] There were definitely a bunch of quotes that got ripped out of the game at various points. The things that I remember the most were with the display effects.

[40:22] The bonus X thing was like a lot of a giant taking off her bra and kind of a silhouette and then the door open. So, you know, bonus 2X or whatever.

[40:36] The match animation was the scene in the tent where I think where the guy was moving stuff and Austin was on the ground, you know, kind of doggie style in there taking stuff.

[40:55] It looked like it was coming out of its rear end, I guess. And then eventually you fart and the match number comes up after that.

[41:04] And there was a couple of other things too. I think the other one was many me actually helping the laser. We had them doing that and back up.

[41:14] You know, I can't say I'm surprised that I'm mostly surprised at the bonus X thing. But the other stuff I'm not too surprised got the X.

[41:25] Is that stuff still in the ROMs or has it actually been removed?

[41:29] It was removed from production ROMs.

[41:32] Do you have like quote home? Do you have quote home ROMs for this game?

[41:38] They exist. I do not have them.

[41:41] They do exist though.

[41:43] Yes, they exist.

[41:45] They haven't surfaced though. So, I mean, somebody's keeping these pretty under tight wraps.

[41:50] That is correct.

[41:52] Any hints to who may have these so I can go bother them?

[41:57] Well, yeah, I mean, you're probably not going to get very far with them as my guests.

[42:04] But, you know, maybe someday they'll show up.

[42:07] I'm one of the few people that actually owns an Austin power, so that's why I was asking.

[42:12] Yeah, no, it's, I mean, I've had people ask me about them before, but, you know, I don't have them and, you know, I don't have an Austin.

[42:21] So, I don't have them.

[42:24] How common were quote home ROMs for, you know, for stern games?

[42:30] Not very often. I mean, there was a bunch of stuff that, you know, that I wanted to put into poker that I never really got around to doing an official home ROM for.

[42:42] But pretty much for the most part, there's almost no...

[42:47] I think Austin power is probably the only one that I remember having a specific home ROM for.

[42:55] All right, yeah, you know, the whole, you know, you were talking about how you're kind of ramping things into this Williams style of whatever development.

[43:05] I kind of look at stern games as like a bell curve.

[43:09] And, you know, the top of the bell curve is, of course, Simpson's pinball party in Lord of the Rings.

[43:16] And then on the left side of the bell curve, you know, that, you know, further down is Austin Powers and High Roller Casinos and Charkeys.

[43:24] And then on the other side, you know, you got Elvis and World Poker Tour, but you kind of got this apex, which brings us to, of course, the game that you're most famously associated with.

[43:37] And that's Simpson's pinball party.

[43:40] And so this game was like, you know, I mean, talk about getting stern put on the map and selling a crap load of games.

[43:49] And I guess, you know, you're largely the guy responsible for that, right?

[43:55] For the most part, I mean, you know, I was working with Joe Balser on a play field layout.

[44:03] And certainly, you know, I was responsible for getting, see me in the game and getting, you know, everything, you know, getting all the rules of the game, for your network characters to use that kind of thing.

[44:18] I was the most familiar with since I've been, I was a pretty big fan of it at the time.

[44:23] You know, it was certainly starting to wane for me personally, but, you know, there was a lot of, there's still a lot of fun characters that you can use.

[44:32] You know, and you could still use them today, to do it for that matter.

[44:35] You know, I wouldn't necessarily use some of the shows that, you know, that have been put out, but the characters are great.

[44:45] Now, this game did it take a lot more time for you to develop this game, then say, you know, Austin Powers, for example.

[44:52] I mean, was it, you know, because of the depth of the rules or whatever?

[44:56] Well, I'll tell you that, you know, a lot of the rules have been, you know, where they were mostly finished, probably about the time that Rollercoast, there was about to come in the line.

[45:14] In fact, for a long time, Christopher, I can.

[45:17] Then Joe Balcer about the company, and there was a bunch of mechanical work that had to be redesigned.

[45:27] So, you know, I'm not going to say that Simpson's didn't, you know, the rules and stuff, to really benefit it from that extra time.

[45:34] I mean, you know, I kept working on stuff as long as I had time to do it, and then eventually started getting all the dots and, you know, sounds and stuff like that.

[45:44] And, you know, we just kept going to town as long as we could.

[45:50] And I don't think, you know, it definitely was the game that I had the longest to work on, but most of it was done, probably.

[46:03] You know, it was mostly done in a little bit longer than the normal game time frame, I guess.

[46:10] And then we just kept tweaking the choreography and, you know, cleaning things up and that kind of thing.

[46:17] Now, there's no female voice characters in Simpson's.

[46:22] Was that just because you guys had a certain amount of money, and you could only get one of the voice actors? Or what was the reasoning behind that?

[46:32] The reason was, when we negotiated the contract, we had, we basically had a certain amount, like you said, of money to allocate towards voice talent.

[46:47] And the number, the number of people that we had was, you know, the magic number was three. That was the amount of people we could afford.

[46:56] We could have spent a lot more money to get four and possibly five.

[47:01] But it just wasn't viable in terms of what we had to pay per game in order to get the extra talent.

[47:09] And even as it was, you know, we've maxed out all the sound roms anyway, so I mean, anything else we put in the game would be at the expense of some other stuff that was already in there.

[47:22] So, the thinking was, well, you have to have homework and you have to have bark, so that's two of your three right there.

[47:28] You know, that's just not even a question. And all the other, you know, you also get all the other characters that those guys do.

[47:36] And so, the other choice was just, you know, food you use for the third person, is it peri-shir, is it Hank is area?

[47:47] Because both of those guys do a large number of characters that are fun.

[47:52] Our first choice was Hank because he does comic book guy, he does a poo, you know, I'm pretty sure he does cleat us.

[47:59] You know, he does a lot of the characters that, you know, were the most fun, you know, Lee felt.

[48:04] And then, you know, Harry does, you know, smithers and burns and, you know, another set of characters does auto.

[48:13] But, you couldn't, you know, we just, you know, we had to make a decision.

[48:20] And if the longest time we didn't even think we'd get Hank, he was, you just had a show, cancel from TV, and he didn't really want to do it.

[48:29] And then I think eventually, the other way, the other guy was convinced and he read the script for us and, you know, so we went ahead with the characters that we had.

[48:40] Was there anything in Simpsons that got left out or in the cutting room for that you were starting, you know, that was originally designed in the game that didn't make it production?

[48:52] There was only one thing that I remember, there was, that was, that we couldn't use and that was,

[49:07] that was, the comic book guy target, it was originally a kicking target.

[49:17] And, you know, kind of like, the godly views does quite a bit.

[49:21] I think there was one in Strike or Extreme 2, which is probably where the idea came from.

[49:25] But, basically, when you hit the comic book guy target, it would, you know, it kicked the ball back to the footburn.

[49:33] In fact, you could get a little volley going, you know, between, between the target and the footburn, you know, get like a bunch of shots, you know, back and forth.

[49:43] And, you know, it was a pretty cool dynamic, but eventually it was cost reduced out of the game.

[49:49] So basically, it was a slingshot kicker for that target.

[49:53] Basically, yeah.

[49:56] So, how, you know, in development time, how much extra time do you think you got for Simpsons compared to, you know, one of, you know, another game?

[50:08] I want to say it was probably an additional three or four months.

[50:14] Now, when you did Lord of the Rings, which was the next game, which again is extremely deep, did you have a lot of time for Lord of the Rings?

[50:22] No, in fact, I had probably half a time for Lord of the Rings that I had for Simpsons.

[50:29] In Lord of the Rings, I knew I didn't have as much time, so what I wanted to do, that's kind of how I came about with the, with the, the multi balls the way they were.

[50:44] I really liked the kind of style of multi ball where you could, and the two games were really big influence on me in this regard.

[50:54] World Cup soccer and the jackpot.

[50:57] Both had really great multi balls where you'd start them, you'd go for a while, and then you would, you know, you would drain out a multi ball and you could restart them.

[51:08] And continue where you left off and get further down on it, get further down on them and that kind of thing.

[51:15] So, those were pretty big influences in me in designing how those multi balls work in Lord of the Rings.

[51:22] I knew that I wouldn't have as much time to put as much stuff as there was in Simpsons, so I figured I could kind of add depth by making things, you know, fast a little bit longer, but, you know, be able to resume where you left off and that kind of thing.

[51:37] Now, was Stern using like a design team concept like Williams did, or was it just, you know, every man's working on the current game?

[51:47] It was eventually, yeah, I would say it was kind of a design team. I mean, the games that I was lead on, you know, I was, I was definitely in charge of, you know, the basic content, the team integration, and, you know, everything that the players thought.

[52:06] Basically, I, when I, my time at Stern, I worked with, I worked on five different games where I was lead, I worked with five different designers, and I don't think that, I'm not sure that anyone else has had quite that variety of people to work with, but, but it was interesting, you know, and it was definitely fun working with everybody.

[52:32] I mean, but you said that on Simpsons, it was just you and Joe Ball, so that were basically designed the whole game. So you had a lot more responsibility on Simpsons than you did on say some other games, right?

[52:44] Yeah, that's the right, true. I mean, George designed most of the playfield for Lord of the Rings on Zone. We played around with some stuff from the lab a couple of times in terms of what to do with the ring or what to do, you know, like, you know, we knew we wanted to be a magnet.

[53:01] At one point, we had it like kind of hovering over the playfield, and then, you know, eventually it got moved into the backboard with the jumper amp and that kind of thing.

[53:13] You know, so there were definitely a bunch of different things. You know, it wasn't, Lord was in the playfield that I would have liked to have seen, you know, I wanted, you know, I wanted you to be able to hit, you know, some black gates and have them open up and shooting the board or that kind of thing.

[53:30] You know, and they wound up being, you know, what it is now. So you were thinking more of a success the game has had, but even still I personally have more fun shooting Simpsons than I do have shooting board.

[53:48] So you were thinking of like almost like a medieval madness type thing.

[53:52] I'm like that, you know, not quite. I mean, it was never going to be that serious or that joky or anything like that. I mean, that's funny or that, you know, joky or anything like that is medieval, but we wanted more interactive devices, I guess.

[54:08] Yeah, now the that little mini playfield that's in the upper left side of Lord of the Rings, like that. Notice one thing like my game that's like real white and on other games, I see it. It's more greenish. Was there any, you know, what was up with that?

[54:24] Well, that got, you know, it got changed early on. It was originally kind of colorful and, you know, looked, it looked like the original source artwork we got for the, you know, the, the dead people.

[54:42] But, but, you know, when we found out later in the movie, they're going to be more kind of a, a ghoulish green time kind of thing. So that thing got, basically got, you know, saturated to green, you know, and color that way.

[54:59] It's possible that, you know, that they're putting differences, you know, from different runs could make it look a little different. But I don't think that very many exist with actual colorful paths of the dead people. And that's you actually have one, I don't know.

[55:14] Yeah, mine's a pretty early one. And yeah, it definitely looks different than the later ones. That's for sure. It's definitely the colors are more contrasted. I'll put it that way.

[55:24] Yeah. Now, so your simpses in Lord of the Rings were really, really deep rule sets. How was the reaction by, you know, management to use spending this much time on, on, on programming these?

[55:40] I mean, I don't think that they really cared one or the other, you know, as long as, as long as the person that just walks up the game gets entertained. And this is kind of my philosophy in general, as long as you can, you know, entertain, you know, the people who just play for a couple of minutes, who cares what else is on the rest of the game?

[56:03] I mean, you know, the game could, the game could take you three hours to finish and who cares if it does or not. I mean, as long, you know, the game needs pacing and needs, you know, for you to have achievable goals. And as you start to achieve those goals more and more regularly, then if you have more goals to achieve after that, it gives you something else to shoot for.

[56:24] And then if you have, you know, you start getting those more and more, then if you have something to shoot for after that, you know, I don't see the problem in having this stuff in there if people want to spend the time getting to it.

[56:35] You know, if it makes you feel like, if it makes you feel upset that you can't get to the end, you know, I guess I never really understood that thinking myself.

[56:45] I mean, it's more about are you entertained with what you're doing now, you know, and, and, you know, does the game entertain you at your skill level or, you know, does it not?

[56:55] Well, I meant more like from did did the word ever come down? Look, we need to do these things. We need to compress the time schedule. These games need to get out sooner.

[57:06] We don't need this depth of code, you know, lighten, you know, lighten it up a little bit. I mean, was that conversation that ever happened?

[57:15] Not really, because until we were fortunate, no game that I worked on really, no game that I worked on was really incomplete by time I went into production.

[57:27] I mean, since then has everything in it when it started production. There might have been some display effects and stuff like that added later, but, but the game, you know, was pretty much done.

[57:40] Lord of the Rings, you know, I think when the very first 1.0 code went out, you had everything in it except, I think, Valenor.

[57:48] And that was finished by a time 4.0 came out, which was the initial release to US production.

[57:55] Poker, you know, that game pretty, that game might have taken a couple of revisions before everything was in it.

[58:04] But, but we all is really the only game I think that was truly unfinished in terms of, you know, getting all the stuff into the game.

[58:18] And there are a number of reasons why that was the case.

[58:22] Well, well, do you mind talking about that?

[58:25] Sure, sure. I mean, we all had, we all had a lot of, you know, even though it doesn't seem like it,

[58:33] it had a lot of stuff in it that had to be dealt with.

[58:37] I had to write, you know, a stepper motor driver for the new system because there hadn't been any stepper motors yet.

[58:44] I had to write, you know, the thing to drive the little auxiliary display down at the bottom of the play field because that's driven differently than the one in poker.

[58:58] And, you know, so that required new code.

[59:03] The lights around the wheel had to be driven yet another way.

[59:10] So, you know, there's always time spent, you know, and just basically work.

[59:16] And then I had to do all the stuff at the puzzles.

[59:19] I mean, you know, I had to solve the puzzles generically so that, you know, no matter what puzzle you have, it would fit on the screen.

[59:27] And it would fill in properly and all that kind of thing.

[59:31] Then I had to make sure it supported all five different languages that the game supported.

[59:38] So, there was a lot of, of base work and wheel fortune that, you know, that needed to get done.

[59:48] And that was just to get the basic, you know, the basic game up and running.

[59:54] I mean, you know, it did set off kind of a storm, you know, especially after people perceive that Spiderman is not finished even though, you know, it's pretty finished.

[01:00:08] It doesn't have some display effects, then.

[01:00:13] People were telling me that, you know, we can't put as much stuff in the game. You know, got to get the game done.

[01:00:22] And my point was the game, you know, everything that's in the game is the basic, the base minimum amount of stuff you need in a game.

[01:00:32] I mean, there's no wizard modes of any kind in wheel fortune. There's not any higher end features in wheel fortune at all.

[01:00:40] It's all the, that they stopped. And I barely had enough time to get all of the base stuff done.

[01:00:46] Part of it was, I was promised additional resources that never wound up showing up to help me get the game done.

[01:00:57] So, you know, I kept thinking that I'm working on stuff and someone else was working on something else. And then that, you know, other things that were important to get done, didn't get done.

[01:01:06] So I had to go back and work on those and abandon what I was working on.

[01:01:10] It was just a big mess. And, you know, since the game's reception wasn't very good at all, interest, you know, waned on it pretty quick in terms of, you know, doing what was needed done to really shore off the status of the game.

[01:01:26] What, why do you think the interest was low on that game? Do you think it was the theme or do you think it was the play field layout?

[01:01:33] I think it was mostly the theme, although other people think it was the play field layout.

[01:01:40] Here you have, you know, although it's one of the most, you know, well known, well, the number one syndicated show in America.

[01:01:50] You know, so a lot of people know about it and watch it, obviously.

[01:01:56] You don't set the world on fire. I mean, it's like, you know, like, oh yeah, real fortune game. I really want to play that.

[01:02:05] It skews a lot older than what our demographic supposedly is, which is, you know, 20-somethings and bars or, you know, 40-plus-somethings and bars.

[01:02:16] At least that's what, you know, people would have me believe.

[01:02:21] So, I mean, people thought it would be a good theme because, well, I guess at least around the Chicago area that shows always on TV when people get off work and go into bars.

[01:02:34] So, I think one of the biggest problems that occurred in general was that, was that basically the South Side of Chicago, people thought were a microcosm of the rest of the nation in terms of what was going on in locations.

[01:02:52] And I don't know if that's not stereotypical.

[01:02:56] Yeah, it's kind of a cool game. I mean, it's kind of reminds me of, like, you know, like the lower part between the flippers and that kind of like an old got-leab, you know.

[01:03:08] I think I thought it was kind of cool myself and the Bobblehead thing was about the French in particular were really upset at the game.

[01:03:19] I think Gary said that, you know, one of them told him, you know, what are you doing? You know, you can't do this or something like that.

[01:03:27] You mean because it was different?

[01:03:30] Yeah, I mean, yeah, basically. You know, it was, you know, it didn't have a peel.

[01:03:37] I mean, even though it peels to a lot of, you know, it was different to appeal to a lot of, you know, pinball players.

[01:03:44] I think the perception was that for the casual player, it was too tough.

[01:03:49] And I will agree that the outlands on the game were absolutely horrible because basically had all the rubber on the sides of the flingshot, you know, shoving the ball out the outlands all the time.

[01:04:01] So it was a very brutal game, you know, for casual players because, you know, they would just lose the ball down the sides a lot.

[01:04:11] And you couldn't, there was no way to correct that with different posts or moving posts.

[01:04:16] No, not really. I mean, you really needed to, you really needed the inline outlane post to be a lot higher.

[01:04:26] So you didn't have all the exposed rubber shoving the ball to the outside wood, basically.

[01:04:33] I mean, you know, if you, if you have the post up higher, then there's a lot more play that, you know, you're going to get rather than, again, rather than having the rubber shoving the ball to the outlands.

[01:04:50] Now, we kind of skipped, skipped a couple of games here when we got talking on Wheel of Fortune.

[01:04:58] What about Elvis? What was your feeling about Elvis and your involvement in that game?

[01:05:03] Elvis was, that was a multi-headed beast. That was Lonnie and Dwight and myself working together trying to get the game done.

[01:05:17] It was, it is what it is. I mean, we definitely did the game wrong, I think.

[01:05:26] And, you know, I don't know that, at least we did the game wrong in terms of, you know, for the casual player, there wasn't enough, it wasn't easy enough, but what we had originally done to hear the different songs.

[01:05:41] And of course, you know, like in the game of the past, like Guns and Roses, you had one shot to start a mode and when you hit that shot, the music changed and, you know, all this other stuff happened.

[01:05:55] And Elvis, you had to do, there are five different songs that you could hear and you had to do all this stuff to start, you know, each different one of them.

[01:06:04] So, since the average person shoots each shot once a game, you know, chances are they're not going to do enough of what they need to do in order to start, you know, more than one different song.

[01:06:18] So, the game, the game got dumbed down really fast in terms of, you know, making it a lot easier for people to get to the different songs.

[01:06:30] So, I mean, it was basically, it basically was a poor design decision on our part to try and get the different songs to, you know, do it the way we did.

[01:06:43] I mean, there needed to be one shot where you would start a song and, you know, do the associated mode with the song and that kind of thing.

[01:06:51] Is this something that could be changed through software though pretty easily?

[01:06:55] Not at this point, certainly. I mean, I suppose you could like change the jailhouse to be like a mode start kind of thing.

[01:07:05] But then what are the other shots do when they're not, you know, advancing towards the modes like they do now, you know.

[01:07:14] You know, we started down a path and we're kind of committed to it and, you know, that's just kind of how it went.

[01:07:23] I mean, I tried to push very early on for Elvis kind of like, like the five job targets. I thought it should have been, they should have been kind of like up the middle.

[01:07:35] And it should have been a little trough behind them or something like that. So, you could break through the job targets and then, you know, shoot into the trough and then that would start one of the five songs, you know, all shook up or whatever.

[01:07:47] That would basically be where your different song starts to come in and then always to come out and start singing and all that.

[01:07:54] And you could see them singing dance and kick the ball out and do whatever you're going to do for the mode.

[01:08:01] But, you know, it was felt that, you know, it was too late to change from what the playfield already was.

[01:08:08] So, you know, you're just kind of stuck with what we had and you know, just continue going down the path you're going down.

[01:08:16] So, yeah, so there's, you know, in that regard, are there any of the games you work on at this point could, you know, now you maybe have a little, these things being, you know, have newer revisions released or is that just like no way?

[01:08:32] Well, I don't think so. I mean, it's, you know, sure, I could spend free time working on them if I had access to the code and started to support, you know, whatever changes were done.

[01:08:45] I don't know that I would spend my free time doing that at the moment and I don't know that that started once with you with it either. I would assume that they wouldn't. I wouldn't if I were them.

[01:08:55] You mean that a lot of these are too great and the benefits are too small?

[01:08:58] Yeah, basically. There's, there's so little to be gained that, you know, I mean, what is the last time we ran Elvis? I mean, it had to be, you know, two or three years ago at least.

[01:09:13] You know, what's the benefit to changing the way Elvis plays now? There is no benefit.

[01:09:19] Right. Same thing with Will, with Wheel of Fortune. Same thing with Wheel of Fortune too.

[01:09:26] That would be my guess. I don't know if they feel there's any good will that they get from changing it or not. My guess would be probably not.

[01:09:38] You know, I'm not really sure.

[01:09:41] So the game sales just weren't there and the chances of getting a rerun on that game are pretty low?

[01:09:47] Wheel of Fortune, I don't think it's going to be rerun now. So, yeah. I mean, sales weren't too good on it.

[01:09:56] Like I said, the French blame the flipper lay out. My guess is an excuse. I don't know. I don't know if anyone.

[01:10:05] I don't know if anyone really knows why any particular games do well or not.

[01:10:09] I mean, things that seem to work well are hot titles and cool toys. You know, and you know, that probably makes a lot of sense.

[01:10:21] If you, I mean, power is the primary example of that. You have a really hot title because, you know, the movies made so much money.

[01:10:32] You have a really cool toy, the ship. You have a semi-cool toy, the chest, and the mixed master.

[01:10:41] So, you know, I mean, power, it's primary selling point. It was definitely the ship and the chest, I think.

[01:10:49] Since, you know, most people couldn't really shoot the ramp enough times to get, you know, that toy going, I don't think.

[01:10:55] In terms of the casual player. So, I mean, you know, it's really the attack from ours and a medieval madness, you know.

[01:11:07] You know, really cool toy up the middle thing that, you know, that's of primary utmost importance for Pimbo, I think, is having cool things that people can interact with.

[01:11:17] And then, you know, if you have the hot title on top of that, then that's, you know, then you've got a A-plus game.

[01:11:26] And then anything that you can do to the rules or the code to make it, you know, more attractive to, you know, core Pimbo players than that, you know, that helps you there as well.

[01:11:44] I mean, I think it's very possible for games to appeal to, you know, all groups of people and the games that do that do very well.

[01:11:53] All right, well now, what about World Poker Tour? You worked on that game, right?

[01:11:58] Yeah, that was the first game of a new system. You know, well, the first, you know, really publicly released game.

[01:12:07] And, you know, it was a lot of work to just to get just to write a bunch of code like, you know, handling modes or, you know, just engineering rules for the first time.

[01:12:23] It took a long time to get everything to where it needed to be, you know, as games went on from there, it got easier and easier to write rules.

[01:12:36] And as Stern would have gone on, the more and more codes you have built up, then the easier and easier it will be to make games, you know, going down the line.

[01:12:49] But, you know, there's still a lot of stuff that needed to be done in terms of, you know, it's the first time on the new system we had a step-around, or the first time on the new system we had, you know, a motor that, you know, that did, you know, went from point A to point B like on Batman.

[01:13:06] You know, there are a lot of things that had to be re-engineered under, you know, C and C++ that, you know, that they would have been pretty easy to just, you know, drag and drop her a previous game under 68 and I.

[01:13:19] So, you know, there's a lot of additional work, especially on poker being the first game. And, it was, it was a challenge, you know, to get everything done and to get everything in there that I wanted to get in.

[01:13:33] It's been a lot of, you know, late hours and long nights trying to get everything done. But, for the most part, everything was pretty much done.

[01:13:45] You know, people talk about unfinished code on poker and I don't think it was really unfinished as much as the fact that there was a really bad bug for a while that we had no idea how the duplicate, or, you know, find what the problem was.

[01:14:00] And that certainly, that certainly hurt it quite a bit. But we also had hardware issues too. I mean, we had flash parts that were, if it got too hot, were, you know, sending back incorrect information, you know, basically executing bad code.

[01:14:19] So, you know, that was the problem we had as well. So, there are a number of challenges with poker in terms of, in terms of getting field acceptance and someone, someone eventually told us, I don't remember who it was, you know, that we missed the vote on World Poker Tour, which you probably did. It was past its peak or past its prime.

[01:14:42] In terms of, you know, being out there in the public eye, you know, we were probably a year or two late doing poker. And, you know, for it to have had, you know, its maximum visibility or its maximum interest, you know, for people wanting to buy the game.

[01:15:00] Now, how did you feel that that was our Richie design, right? Steve Richie design, right?

[01:15:06] How did you feel about the general play field layout that he did?

[01:15:10] I thought it was great. I mean, you know, 16 drop targets, I can you hate that, you know, that was great to play and to work with. You know, he was very careful in terms of getting, you know, cool rebounds, you know, from the flippers to, you know, different banks and that kind of thing.

[01:15:27] You know, what's all those drop targets, you know, really pushed the shots really back. So it was a different, it was a different feeling game in general. But, you know, it was, it was definitely different, you know, really wide open play field with a lot of drop targets. And, you know, it's still at shots you could shoot.

[01:15:44] I mean, I think, I think it was a great play field personally.

[01:15:48] So it was the development time on the new system using C++. I mean, was it, it was, it took you longer because it was the first game. But I mean, in general is working under the new, you know, Sam system is that better than the old 6809?

[01:16:03] Yeah, by far. I mean, at least now at this point we have, you know, integrated debuggers and stuff like that. You know, we don't have, you know, we're not, we're not trying to guess where the code is going wrong and that kind of thing.

[01:16:17] You know, we can set up breakpoints and, you know, debug code like, you know, people regularly debug code in terms of, you know, writing another PC's or, you know, whatever.

[01:16:29] It was, it was by far, far more professional environment and a far nicer one in terms of being able to just get stuff done.

[01:16:40] And was the hardware faster too and more memory?

[01:16:44] Oh, sure, absolutely. I mean, well, I needed a lot more memory because, you know, code's just a bloater if you're writing for C++ than it is for, if you're doing handcraft assembly.

[01:16:56] I mean, in 6809 you're talking about, it was like 8K or RAM or something like that. And, and 64K of bank switched ROM and, you know, out of 128K possible, you know, for code.

[01:17:16] I mean, it was, there was a lot of stuff you had to deal with in the old system in terms of, you know, making sure that the code banks switched properly was all, you know, you know, within the same region and that kind of thing so that you didn't do really bad things and, you know, have your game go off into Lala land.

[01:17:39] Interesting. So now, were you happy with, with the World Poker Tour and, you know, and ultimately how it turned out, even though that, that game didn't seem like it got a really good reception?

[01:17:51] No, it didn't. I mean, I'm, so I don't have any regrets with any game that I've worked on other than Wheel of Fortune not getting finished.

[01:18:01] I'm happy with how every single game that I've worked on has ultimately turned out. At least every game that I was lead on turned out.

[01:18:10] You know, I'm pretty happy for the most part with where a family guy is, do you know, if that matter, even though it wasn't really primary on that game, but, you know, I did do a lot of stuff for it.

[01:18:20] So I think family guy turned out okay and I certainly think the first four games I did came out really well. And, and Wheel of Fortune definitely was on the right track just, you know, just didn't get the extra resources that I needed to get the game done.

[01:18:39] What was there going to be another programmer that was going to help you or something?

[01:18:42] Yeah, basically. That was about the time that we hired an additional person, so we're trying to get him up the speed. And we're working on trying to get Shrek and Indiana Jones done at the same time.

[01:18:56] I mean, basically there's a lot of stuff going on all at once and it caused, it really caused Wheel of Fortune to fall, by the way, said.

[01:19:04] Now, how much involvement did you have in family guy?

[01:19:08] I was responsible for basically writing all the modes. I wrote the final modes in the game. I was trying to remember, oh, I did everything. How do we write a bunch of stuff for Stewie Pinball?

[01:19:25] And I basically baked Stewie Pinball the way it is right now. So, you know, a pretty fair amount of the game.

[01:19:34] I didn't have much to do with setting up the script and that kind of thing. That was mostly lines per view.

[01:19:43] No, you know, I'm starting to hear about family guy as basically being, I'm hearing this from a number of people. I was wondering if you agree or not, but family guy being basically the best pinball game ever made.

[01:19:57] I mean, you know, that's such a generic term and I hate to say that. But I'm really starting to hear this from people. What's your feeling?

[01:20:06] I think it's a good game. I think it has a lot of stuff that, I mean, certainly it's humor. If you're into that kind of humor is probably unparalleled.

[01:20:15] You know, there's just so much voice work in the game. You know, there's just a lot of stuff to hear. I mean, that's a lot of sorts of entertainment.

[01:20:24] It seems like there's, maybe there's something you haven't heard in a while or, you know, there's just stuff that you haven't.

[01:20:32] You may not have even heard yet. You know, there's a lot of variety in that game that, you know, that even though I may not have as many rules and some other games, the voices and sound sure make it seem, you know, sure make that last a lot longer, I think.

[01:20:48] Now, yeah, I don't mean to just say that with family guy. I'm also hearing this same thing about track, which means, you know, it's not so much the theme as it is, you know, the general feel, the general rules, the general toys of the game, you know, seem to be, people really seem to dig it.

[01:21:07] Yeah, well, I mean, it's a good playfield and, you know, the midi pinball is certainly an interesting toy. And I mean, there's a number of, there's a number of different things, you know, in the game.

[01:21:23] I mean, the more variety of stuff that you have to do, the more, you know, the more you're going to enjoy a game, I think. I mean, I think that's one of, like, Simpson's biggest draws, for example. I mean, there's just, there's a lot of stuff that, that you can do.

[01:21:40] I mean, you know, there's the, the alien invasion thing, there's the Springfield mysteries by with the reverse blupper thing. You know, there's all the modes, you know, although they're kind of the same structure, you know, they all have different goals and that kind of thing.

[01:21:53] You have, you know, the two different main multi balls. You know, I just, the more that you give people to do, and the more you don't tie them and doing something at any one time, you know, and just like, let stuff happen as it goes along.

[01:22:08] You know, the more people, the more fun people are going to have with games in general.

[01:22:13] You know, you must be pretty proud though that, you know, you, here, you've had your hand or been largely responsible for some of, certainly, you know, the best, some of the best pinball ever made. I mean, being with Lord of the Rings and Simpson's and, you know, family guy slash Shrek. I mean, you know, it must be pretty proud of this.

[01:22:33] Oh, I'm definitely proud of the work I've done. I, you know, I, like I said, I don't have too many regrets of, you know, things that, that I've done. I mean, if certain things haven't been as popular, you know, that's okay.

[01:22:47] You know, I enjoy playing all the games that I've worked on and that's certainly, you know, I, I guess, I like to try and design games that I like playing, you know, hopefully that, you know,

[01:23:02] so I've played so many games over the years. I mean, I'm, I probably know all there is to know about almost every single 90s game that, you know, that was produced.

[01:23:15] And, you know, going before that, you know, late 80s games, you know, my, as you start going back further, you know, I don't know as much about as many games, but I've played a lot of games over the years.

[01:23:30] And, you know, I just know what I think is fun and what I think sucks and, you know, so I just take all that knowledge and, you know, when, when I'm working on a game, I don't do the stuff I think sucks.

[01:23:44] And, I do the stuff that I think is fun. No, no, if you don't, if you don't have that, you know, that knowledge or that, you know, you just don't play that many games or whatever, it's, you know, it's going to be harder.

[01:23:58] I mean, you're going to, you're going to try more stuff and, you know, you'll find out that it's not fun or whatever, but if you know it is not fun because you play X-Speecher on Y-Game, you know, back in 1993 or something, then, then you'll know, you'll know, just try to do it.

[01:24:13] You'll know, just try to even go down that path.

[01:24:17] Now, the family guy was kind of a different design or different development change for, for Lawler in that he used to have Lewis Coziar as his in-house programmer and they would do everything and basically just hand you guys the game, you know, the monopoly and a lot of his games were done like that.

[01:24:37] But since Lewis has been gone, he basically just does the design and then hands the game over to you guys and you guys do all the programming at this point. Has this set up any in Stern and Lawler in this regard?

[01:24:51] I don't know if I can really speak to that or not. I mean, you know, all I know is that, I don't think that, you know, for whatever reason that was as into the scenes of CSI and the family guy.

[01:25:20] As he was into games that he's worked on in the past, so, you know, I think that, I think, you know, being forced to work on games that you don't necessarily agree with is going to wear on you.

[01:25:36] And I know it won't need to, so I don't think it was necessarily how games were developed as much as just not agreeing with what it is you're assigned to work on so much.

[01:25:58] So yeah, I heard that he was actually kind of mad with the final outcome of family guy in that, you know, because you guys took it in maybe a different direction than he envisioned.

[01:26:10] You know, I haven't really talked to him about it, so I don't know exactly what his feelings are towards it. I mean, that's, you know, that's certainly possible.

[01:26:23] I think the game came out pretty good, so I would be, you know, I'd be pretty happy with the way the game is at the moment myself.

[01:26:34] And you brought up CSI, which is kind of like the next game in the queue. It's stern. And you know, what, how much development did you do on that game?

[01:26:45] Not that much, honestly. I mean, there's one device on the game, the centrifuge that I probably wrote most of the code for.

[01:26:57] But that was about the extent of my involvement with that particular game. I mean, I sat in a planning means and, you know, throughout suggestions, you know, for some of the other stuff and that kind of thing.

[01:27:08] But in terms of, you know, writing rules and coming up with scripts and stuff like that, my involvement was mostly just the centrifuge toy.

[01:27:19] Now, you from Stern is recently kind of been through, you know, took the economic downturn, kind of kind of badly on the chin as it may be.

[01:27:31] And you've been laid off, is that correct?

[01:27:34] Yes.

[01:27:35] Who else? I mean, it was unemployed.

[01:27:37] Yeah, so it was, it was just you or was there a lot of other people involved in this?

[01:27:42] I would say slightly over 50% of the overhead staff was cut. And then the people that were here, the main took additional pay cuts well in order to, you know, keep their job.

[01:27:57] Is this just because sales have really gone down?

[01:28:01] Yeah, I mean, sales are definitely way down with the last couple of games. I mean, I'm not going to get the numbers or anything, but, you know, sort of a decent amount of Indiana Jones and then sold less of Batman and, you know, certainly not what what people are expecting, I think.

[01:28:24] And then, you know, things just start drying up after a while. I mean, summer is always a bad time anyway. So I think 10% pay cut in August, you know, pretty much everyone that worked there.

[01:28:37] And that was like, that was the day before Papa, I remember the app because, you know, I was getting ready to go to Papa.

[01:28:45] So I think that, you know, the feeling was that that was just going to be, you know, for the summer and then things, the business would pick up as Christmas sales started going up, you know, because you typically rerun a bunch of games right before Christmas.

[01:29:00] And, you know, they just got more volume, you know, going into Christmas because you have a lot more games you're working on.

[01:29:10] But with the economy going the way that it was, orders are just drying up in general. I mean, you know, that you're not going to get people buying $4,000 games or the game rooms when, you know, they're watching there for one case, you know, 20, 30%.

[01:29:29] Speaking of which, I mean, how much of the home market is really responsible for Stern's sales? I mean, if there was a percentage that you know of?

[01:29:39] Well, when Gary said his 50% in that New York Times article, I think he meant the 50% but at that time, you know, he meant a 50% of US sales.

[01:29:51] So like if US sales are two thirds of the market and overseas is one third, then that means homeownership could, you know, could account for maybe up to a third of the games.

[01:30:04] You know, certainly not 50% of all of production.

[01:30:10] But even though that is the case, you know, a large percentage of people that are buying for the home are still not, you know, hardcore RGP type people.

[01:30:24] You know, it's still casual players. I mean, you have your casual players that play pinballs on location and then you have casual players that buy games for the home.

[01:30:34] So I think the feeling is that the casual player is, you know, still, you know, even though they're buying for the home, they're still a casual player and they don't care about, you know, deep rule sets and that kind of thing.

[01:30:51] Now, I'm basically saying that, you know, the RGP enthusiasts type crowd, you know, can't say, you know, that people that care about deep rule sets account for 50% of sales.

[01:31:05] So in a bad economy, the home sales is obviously going to drop. Has the operator sales dropped to?

[01:31:14] I don't know the exact answer to that. I mean, I can only assume that it has.

[01:31:21] I mean, you know, part of the life cycle of pinball was always that we told operators you could buy a game and operate it for a year and then sell it into the home and, you know, then get the next game and put down on your location.

[01:31:42] So if you, you know, if you can do that then that's a great business plan.

[01:31:49] But if you have either, if you have people who aren't buying games for the base of the game anymore because the economy is tanking or you have themes that people don't want in their base of them, then, you know, that's another reason that people, you know, that's going to kill the life cycle of pinball because you can't unload your game into, you know,

[01:32:11] into the home market afterwards. I mean, you know, I don't know how many people would buy CSI for their basement. So I don't know how many people would buy CSI after it came off route, you know.

[01:32:27] You got to operate the game for a year, you know, arguing and be able to unload it into a basement. I'm not so sure. I don't know how many people care enough about CSI to have a CSI pinball in their basement in their game room.

[01:32:37] Yeah, CSI kind of seems like, you know, you, again, you guys are like a year too late on that whole thing.

[01:32:44] Well, I don't know if it's a year too late, but, you know, I don't know. I was never particularly in agreement with doing that theme as a game from day one.

[01:32:55] Is that just my personal opinion?

[01:33:00] It's far as I don't know how much games that are coming up, you know, I mean, my guess is that a lot of them are going to be in that same kind of boat.

[01:33:14] You mean that with 24 or whatever that follows?

[01:33:18] Yeah, basically.

[01:33:21] I mean, do you guys as far as themes do you guys have a hard time coming up with licenses that you can acquire? Is that the problem?

[01:33:30] That is a huge problem. I mean, you know, certainly you want to do games that people are excited about and that, you know, people are going to want to play the games of.

[01:33:46] But if you can't make the deal with a license or to acquire the rights to make the game, then there's not much you can do about that. I mean, you can't make the game.

[01:33:58] You know, if everyone in the world can say that, you know, oh, X and Y would make, you know, such a great team.

[01:34:06] But if the license or doesn't want you to, what doesn't want to let you make the game, you know, as is the case for a Harry Potter, for example, then it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I mean, you can't make the game.

[01:34:21] Why did you try and get the Harry Potter theme?

[01:34:24] It's been a couple of times that we've been turned down. So, I mean, yeah, it's, as far as I know, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.

[01:34:37] Now, how do you, I mean, it was stern. I guess who's left it stern if they laid off 50% of their staff? I mean, did they lay off all the programmers or was it just 50% straight across?

[01:34:50] No, that Lonnie Ropp and Leimann Sheets are still programming. Ray Tanzer and John Wathermell are still with the mechanical department.

[01:35:05] Trying to think, Pat Power is still in service. I think Chaz is too.

[01:35:14] But, you know, every department got hit. I mean, purchasing got hit, accounting got hit. You know, it was just basically a global reduction in staff.

[01:35:29] Is what happened to Dwight? They drive God laid off as well.

[01:35:34] So, it's basically the only programmers there is Lonnie who really isn't a programmer anymore in Leimann then.

[01:35:41] Well, Lonnie is still a programmer. I mean, he did a lot of the work on, maybe he did a lot of work on Family Guy. He did most of the work on Indiana Jones.

[01:35:52] And he's done a fair amount of the work on CSI. I mean, you know, he was director of the department, but he definitely still programs.

[01:36:00] Yeah, but I don't like Lonnie's games.

[01:36:04] I mean, you know, that's, that's, I don't know what to tell you about that. I mean, Lonnie's old school. I mean, he's old school data east. Shoot this ramp 47 times and then go to the next thing.

[01:36:18] I mean, I, you know, that was the kind of the big complaint with Indiana Jones is that it was, it was old school data east, not only with the programming, but also with the play field layout.

[01:36:29] And I think that's why I didn't get as good a reception, even though they got a great theme. Man, they just, I don't know, to me, it seemed like they, they could have done a lot more with it.

[01:36:39] Well, I won't argue with anything you just said. I mean, I certainly didn't like the game.

[01:36:46] No, I also was the direction that, you know, that I thought the game was going into first was, was better sounding, but just the way that it wound up being implemented.

[01:36:58] I don't think, I don't think was very fun at all. I mean, I can't, I can't argue with that. I don't like the game.

[01:37:06] Yeah, again, I'm back to this bell curve thing where, you know, Simpson's in Lord of the Rings is at the top of the bell curve. And, you know, you were working up to that point and now things are kind of sliding back down the other side of the bell curve.

[01:37:20] And, you know, it's, it doesn't make me quite as warm and friendly feeling about the whole thing.

[01:37:26] Well, that's probably, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but certainly from management's perspective, you know, they don't, I don't think they care about that so much.

[01:37:44] I mean, you probably saw the storm that happened on RGP when that guy posted about his conversation with Gary Stern. And, you know, I'm sure that what was posted was pretty much exactly how Gary feels or felt or whatever.

[01:38:06] Do you want to just, just for our listeners, do you want to just kind of summarize that a little bit?

[01:38:11] Well, I just said, you know, the RGP hardcore enthusiast is not a very significant amount of the market. And, you know, if they're not interested in the games, then that doesn't bother him too much.

[01:38:34] And, to his point, it's probably a strong argument because if you think about it, do you really want to support a guy that can put, you know, 75 cents in a game and then play a game for 30 minutes or an hour on one game?

[01:38:51] And, while he's playing that game for that long, that means nobody else can stick money in the game. So, you know, you kind of do want the more casual guys that are going to play a three minute or five minute or even an eight minute game opposed to somebody that's just going to, you know, take the thing down the street and around the block 47 times.

[01:39:10] You know, if people are lined up five deep to play pinball machines, then I might agree with you.

[01:39:15] But, it just at this point you're saying you'll take any quarters you can get people don't play pinballs. Pinballs don't earn. And, I don't think it's, I don't think it's because, you know, good players are playing on them too long. I just think that it's a fundamental lack of appeal.

[01:39:32] What do you see as the long term health of Stern? I mean, are they going to be able to keep doing what they're doing?

[01:39:39] I personally am not very optimistic about the long term health of Stern.

[01:39:46] You know, when we got the 10% pay cuts in August, I pretty much made up my mind that I was going to have to leave and it already started putting my resume out there.

[01:40:00] So, I don't think, you know, I had already come to the conclusion that I was not going to be able to continue at Stern myself.

[01:40:11] And, how was, I mean, is, you know, I know you don't speak for these guys, but I mean, how was the feeling with Dwight and Lyman in that?

[01:40:20] It's hard to say exactly. I mean, I think everyone knew that, you know, things are definitely on the downswing, but I don't think that, I don't think, I will say that I fully expected where offs of some kind to occur, but I, and I think most other people did not expect the amount of complete carnage that occurred last one of the day.

[01:40:49] I mean, I certainly was surprised by it. You know, like I said, I expected some people to get laid off. I didn't expect the amount of people to get laid off.

[01:41:01] You mean you thought the numbers were going to be much smaller?

[01:41:04] Yes, I did.

[01:41:06] So, do you, is there anything Stern can do in your opinion that could turn this around, or is it just solely linked to the economy?

[01:41:16] The economy is a huge portion of it, but, you know, ultimately gains need to earn money in order for them to, you know, continue their business.

[01:41:28] And, you know, figuring out how to make them all earn money so that it's a, you know, viable purchase for operators is probably their number one concern.

[01:41:41] I mean, you know, because if you go through bad times like this, obviously can't rely on the home market.

[01:41:47] So, you really have to rely on the operator. I mean, so, from that perspective, Gary is right to not want to carry to the home market, even though I think, you know, the home market was, was, and it needs to be, of utmost concern, because you still have to keep up that life cycle of games getting into the basement eventually.

[01:42:09] So, that, you know, operators can unload them for most of what they originally paid for them.

[01:42:14] So, you know, even though, you don't want to rely on sales into the basement upfront, you want to rely on sales into the basement, you know, a year from now or whatever.

[01:42:30] So, that's why you have to take scenes that, you know, appeal to people that, you know, want to put the games in their homes.

[01:42:39] Do you think that the, you know, like on Batman and Spider-Man, you know, when the games were really released with, you know, unfinished code, is it maybe?

[01:42:50] Do you think that, that hurt sales at all or had really no effect in the long run?

[01:42:55] My guess is that, the number of sales that affected was, was probably a pretty small blip, like my guess would be under 3%.

[01:43:09] And because most people just don't care or they just don't know better?

[01:43:13] Yeah, exactly. Most people don't know and won't, you know, won't see the further down results and that kind of thing.

[01:43:22] Okay, so do you mind taking a couple of collars or should out our phone number, see if we can get some people to call in? Do you mind taking some questions?

[01:43:30] That's fine.

[01:43:31] Okay, this may be tricky.

[01:43:33] We'll give it a, give it a, give it a world here. If you want to call in and ask Mr. Johnson some stuff, anything related to pinball?

[01:43:42] 248. So like, what is your favorite game that, that you like to play, that ones that you worked on or ones that, you know, that weren't, you weren't involved in?

[01:43:52] Since this is my favorite game, I think, just the amount of variety of stuff that there is to do in the game, I am pretty proud of it and I have a lot of fun playing it.

[01:44:02] Well, we got a call already. Okay, hold on a second. Let me see if I can do this right. Hold on.

[01:44:08] Hello, welcome to Topcash. You're on the air with, with, with, with, with, with, with, with, with, with, what kind of question you got?

[01:44:15] Uh, yes, uh, Keith, uh, I was, uh, wondering, uh, prior to, uh, the, uh, Simpson's pinball party and we'll have a ring.

[01:44:24] Roof sets were relatively short and you are pretty much set the bar of making these games

[01:44:34] to where they have very smooth sets.

[01:44:37] Was that something that you personally was disappointed with Tim Ball and Phil?

[01:44:43] Is that these games should have a little bit more depth.

[01:44:49] Exactly. Was your approach of turning things around to where these games all of a sudden

[01:44:56] now have deep growth?

[01:45:00] Yeah, I would say that there were definitely…

[01:45:04] There were definitely… I didn't enjoy just having…

[01:45:10] Just being able to do the same things over and over and over again.

[01:45:14] I felt like if I could add some other stuff to shoot for, why not do it?

[01:45:21] I mean, the whole goal of Simpsons, for example, was I knew I wanted to have all these different

[01:45:27] features and all the features to have their own ending.

[01:45:31] Then almost as kind of a cool joke, I made it that you had to win each of the different

[01:45:37] things in order to get to the final final mode.

[01:45:41] It was sort of a joke, but it was sort of serious.

[01:45:46] I wanted to make an impossible carrot out there so that people would feel like there

[01:45:52] was always something to do on the game.

[01:45:57] As it is now, games that appealed to me when I was starting off as a player, such as

[01:46:03] Adam's family and Twilight Zone, I just felt like…

[01:46:08] I guess I lost interest when I started being able to get multiple loss in the zones on

[01:46:17] the same ball and that kind of thing.

[01:46:20] I guess with… My goal was always to try and give players something new and different

[01:46:27] to do and something just out there for them to try and play and get to.

[01:46:38] You did a great job.

[01:46:39] I mean, I don't want to harp on this, but the Lonnie Rupp shoot the Star Wars ramp 47

[01:46:47] times to advance.

[01:46:50] It does get old really quick.

[01:46:53] This is the conversation that I've had with Lonnie multiple times and that's just that

[01:47:00] it's work.

[01:47:05] Work isn't fun.

[01:47:09] My personal experience with this was when I played…

[01:47:13] The one of the first experts I came up for must have been 96 or 95 or so.

[01:47:21] I was playing Skirt Stiff and I got to… I know I got to Skirt Stiff 6 times, I won

[01:47:27] it 5 times, I played 2 Spire Multiballs all in one game and it gets to the point where

[01:47:33] you have to shoot the ramp 6 times the light lock or 7 times the light lock and you have

[01:47:38] to shoot the crate 28 times to start creating multiple.

[01:47:41] I mean, it's just not fun.

[01:47:44] It's just stupid after a while.

[01:47:47] So I always tried to make things that weren't just pure flat out work.

[01:47:53] I tried to make things get harder and if it got to the point where it couldn't get any

[01:47:59] hard, I was like, well, that's it.

[01:48:02] That's the hardest it's going to be.

[01:48:05] I tried to make sure that nothing was just plain flat out work.

[01:48:11] I tried to make it as interesting as I could.

[01:48:15] In that regard, is there any easter eggs in games that you've worked on that maybe

[01:48:21] people haven't found or anything like that that we should be looking for?

[01:48:26] I don't know as much of anything.

[01:48:30] I'm Lord of the Rings or Poker necessarily.

[01:48:38] I think most of the features have been discovered and found out about and documented about

[01:48:44] all the games that have real sheets or have all the stuff detailed and written format.

[01:48:54] But I'm relatively sure that most people, all the features have been discovered at one

[01:49:03] point or another.

[01:49:05] Great.

[01:49:06] I'm going to let you go.

[01:49:07] Thanks for calling and appreciate it.

[01:49:09] Okay.

[01:49:10] Thank you.

[01:49:11] I want to call and ask a question 248.

[01:49:14] That was a pretty good question, right?

[01:49:17] Yes, sure.

[01:49:18] A little long-winded, but that's okay.

[01:49:20] We'll do it all.

[01:49:21] There's probably lots of things that I haven't talked about in terms of my philosophy of game

[01:49:27] design or what I feel is good or appropriate or whatever.

[01:49:36] Ultimately, games need to make you have while moments or they need to make you think,

[01:49:44] wow, that was really cool if they followed that and put it in there and that kind of thing.

[01:49:50] Games like that are kind of games that you're talking about.

[01:49:55] I was like, okay, I'll just do that.

[01:49:58] Okay, start a multi-ball again.

[01:50:00] Big deal.

[01:50:01] You know, those are the kinds of things that I want to give people to allow moments.

[01:50:08] I want people to have things that they, you know, I want people to have things to

[01:50:14] support and get to that kind of thing.

[01:50:17] All right, let's take this one.

[01:50:19] All right, welcome to Topcast.

[01:50:21] What's your first name?

[01:50:22] Eric.

[01:50:23] Eric, so what kind of question do you have for Mr. Johnson?

[01:50:26] Hey, Keith.

[01:50:27] Hey, Clay.

[01:50:28] I got a start-track next gen that got like, oodles of flipper codes in it.

[01:50:35] And I was wondering, you guys have stuff like that, messages for people like, hey, how

[01:50:39] you doing and stuff like that?

[01:50:40] Yes, I'm in there.

[01:50:41] I mean, most of them are to friends and family and that kind of thing.

[01:50:46] And so as a result, don't make much sense to really put out there.

[01:50:51] But yeah, you know, most games will have something like that for various relatives of

[01:50:58] you know, whoever, you know, whoever is important to you.

[01:51:03] Okay.

[01:51:04] I just remember the whole game code like Elvis and Lord the Rings that had a really cool

[01:51:11] light show.

[01:51:13] Just with that leftover time and stuff that you guys just put in there for fun or you

[01:51:17] all know.

[01:51:18] I mean, I did it because, you know, we never were allowed to like put our names on the

[01:51:25] play field or anything like that.

[01:51:27] I just wanted to make sure, you know, there's a way to get to it, you know, somehow.

[01:51:31] You both.

[01:51:32] Now, what was the thinking?

[01:51:33] It was a great fun.

[01:51:34] I got a Lord of the Rings and I don't want a family guy in there.

[01:51:38] They're never leaving.

[01:51:40] No thanks.

[01:51:41] See you guys.

[01:51:42] Thanks.

[01:51:43] Hello.

[01:51:44] Welcome to Topcast.

[01:51:45] What's your first name?

[01:51:46] Mark.

[01:51:47] Mark, go ahead, shoot a question.

[01:51:48] I just wanted to thank you for some great games Lord of the Rings and others just

[01:51:57] have enjoyed playing them for the years.

[01:51:58] I was just wondering if he thought maybe start with the cutback some of the new games each

[01:52:03] year and maybe focus on just rerun some of the more popular titles.

[01:52:08] Could cutback do games with us?

[01:52:11] I think what he said is run some of the more popular titles and you know, not maybe run

[01:52:16] three different new titles a year.

[01:52:18] Yeah.

[01:52:19] Cut back on the number of new titles and maybe, you know, rehash or re, you know, make,

[01:52:25] you know, family guy or Lord of the Rings or Simpsons or whatever, you know, to save

[01:52:29] on design costs.

[01:52:30] Well, I'm sure that, you know, titles will continue to be remade, but, you know, you

[01:52:38] can only get so many of those at a time and certainly there's so many, you know, pirates

[01:52:44] and so many Simpson.

[01:52:46] It just makes you wonder how much, how much, you know, how many more you can continue

[01:52:54] to produce those games.

[01:52:55] I mean, you're not going to make any more of Lord, you know, that's done and over with.

[01:53:01] So, you know, I mean, you can certainly continue to make games, but the volume that is available

[01:53:07] to be made for previous games is not going to sustain your business.

[01:53:12] I mean, you know, you really need those to fill in the gaps as it were, but I mean, you

[01:53:17] still need to make new games and you need to make new product to keep your business alive

[01:53:23] and sustainable.

[01:53:25] How Stern is going to manage to make so many new games with the crew that they have

[01:53:31] right now.

[01:53:32] Hi, welcome to Topcast, what's your first name and what is your question?

[01:53:36] My name is Michael and I keep a have a question for you.

[01:53:39] Now that Stern has fired all of their designers, who exactly is now going to be making games

[01:53:46] for Stern?

[01:53:47] Who is going to be designing games now for Stern?

[01:53:50] I don't honestly know.

[01:53:53] I mean, my guess is that at some point they'll start trying to contract design out again,

[01:54:00] but, you know, I don't know whether they'll use Dennis and John and Steve and, you know,

[01:54:06] and whatever, but that's, you know, my guess is that they may even use Pat again, you

[01:54:13] know, I don't know.

[01:54:16] You know, it's just, I don't have the answer for you.

[01:54:19] I assume that anything that comes down the line is going to be as a result of contract

[01:54:25] work.

[01:54:26] Okay, thank you.

[01:54:28] I brought it up.

[01:54:30] Yeah, you know, I was having this conversation with a friend of mine and saying that, you

[01:54:34] know, if you really want it to be cheap, I mean, really cheap, you could essentially design

[01:54:43] games for, I mean, you obviously can't.

[01:54:46] You know, Pat Lawler and Steve Richie, they obviously command a lot of money to design

[01:54:50] a game.

[01:54:51] But, you know, there's guys that would probably be willing to do it that could do really

[01:54:57] good games for like, they would probably do it for, I would think just next to nothing.

[01:55:03] Like, you know, the guy that comes to mind is I would think Trudeau would be happy to

[01:55:07] come in and design a game even though he may not, you know, maybe he only work on a percentage

[01:55:12] of bases and percentage of sales or something, you know.

[01:55:15] Yeah, I mean, I don't know enough about the decision and everything that needs to happen.

[01:55:21] I mean, you know, people need to be able to do a lot of, you know, a lot of work, you

[01:55:29] know, related to laying out a play field.

[01:55:32] You know, I just, you know, I don't know if or, you know, why or why not, you know, John

[01:55:43] Trudeau was ever contacted.

[01:55:47] You know, some people were contacted and just aren't interested.

[01:55:52] You know, for various reasons, I mean, you know, they have full-time jobs and, you know,

[01:55:56] they don't want to, you know, mess up time with their family and that kind of thing.

[01:56:00] But, you know, I can totally respect them and understand.

[01:56:03] So, you know, I mean, I'm sure there are people out there but you can't just hire anyone

[01:56:08] either.

[01:56:09] I mean, this has been a big problem for Stern for about a years, I think, you know, that

[01:56:13] they've always relied on, you know, people that have done it before.

[01:56:18] I mean, there hasn't been a new person, you know, laying out a play field and I can't even

[01:56:26] think of how long.

[01:56:27] And at some point, you know, assuming they'd business stay the same, you know, forever,

[01:56:33] you know, those people are going to be able to lay out games forever.

[01:56:36] At some point, you've got to get new people designing games.

[01:56:40] But, there's a lot of work and a lot of stuff that, you know, people don't understand

[01:56:47] what's involved either.

[01:56:49] You know, just how much work is really playing out of play field really takes.

[01:56:53] I mean, sure, you can throw a bunch of stuff on a game but, you know, is there enough

[01:56:58] money, is there enough space on the bottom of the play field to hold all the parts that

[01:57:03] you want to put on the game?

[01:57:04] I mean, these are things that people, when they talk about laying out games, they don't

[01:57:09] even cross their mind, you know, that, you know, like, flipper mechs out footprints.

[01:57:14] So, you can't put any lights where the flipper mechs are, you know, and it's just things like

[01:57:19] that that I think people don't get or don't think about, you know.

[01:57:24] Is there anything that Stern could be doing that they're not doing in your opinion that

[01:57:30] that would, would help sales or help the whole process?

[01:57:34] I have pushed for years to try and get people to do play fields where, where the ball is

[01:57:42] more bouncing around.

[01:57:44] It's not just shop-o-shop-o-shop-o-st, you know, getting ball spoon-fed, getting ball spoon-fed

[01:57:50] to the players all the time and things like that.

[01:57:53] I mean, I think you really need to go back to more open play field.

[01:57:56] I mean, you know, in a meeting maybe like half a year or two a year ago, you know, you

[01:58:03] know, people who were asking me, what were you talking about?

[01:58:05] I was like, well, Stargazer is a good example of a play field.

[01:58:08] It's open but has some interesting stuff on it and, you know, things you can't necessarily

[01:58:12] get to.

[01:58:13] I mean, the ball is just rolling around and, you know, it does interesting things.

[01:58:18] I don't know.

[01:58:21] I think that pinball needs to go back more towards pinball and less towards, you know, nothing

[01:58:28] but shop.

[01:58:29] Hi, welcome to Topcast, what's your first name and what's your question for Keith?

[01:58:34] My name is Jim and I have two questions for Keith.

[01:58:37] The first question, Keith, is your level as a programmer and not as an owner on games

[01:58:46] that you worked on?

[01:58:47] Did you have a lot more input than as a programmer for the rulesets?

[01:58:55] I apologize if this was already covered in the show but I haven't had the whole show

[01:58:59] yet.

[01:59:00] What are you talking about again?

[01:59:03] Sorry.

[01:59:04] I think what he was saying is, since you were more of a programmer and less of a designer,

[01:59:10] I mean, was your import, how was your import perceived by the design team and were you

[01:59:16] able to get what you wanted in the games, you know, as a programmer?

[01:59:21] Well, I mean, as far as the games that I was lead on pretty much every decision in

[01:59:29] terms of what the rules were mostly mine.

[01:59:34] You know, I was 100% responsible for the rules of all the games that I was lead on.

[01:59:42] You know, I'm certainly ahead of influence on various games.

[01:59:47] I mean, the math drafting and World Poker Tour, for example, I kind of came up with that

[01:59:55] for L.D.S.

[01:59:56] You know, I said, well, we should bake this jail where you can shoot a ball into it and,

[02:00:00] you know, all in the balls captured and you had to, so I eventually used that in World

[02:00:05] Poker Tour just because it was a fun device, you know.

[02:00:10] As far as other games, I mean, I certainly had influences on what things were where.

[02:00:20] Originally, where the auto loop was in Simpson's, for example, that was originally just like

[02:00:26] a dead end target, almost like a train wreck kind of thing.

[02:00:30] I was just making a loop so you can aim it at the stand-up target since you couldn't

[02:00:36] shoot them otherwise.

[02:00:39] And also, the whole reason there's an upper play field is kind of mine systems.

[02:00:44] I wanted there to be an upper play field at some kind so that you could have, you know,

[02:00:49] I wanted to design a multiple where you had balls going on both play fields at the same

[02:00:52] time and, you know, the goal was to, you know, get to the top of the play field while

[02:00:57] you still had balls going on lower play field.

[02:00:59] I mean, that was still, that was probably a big influence.

[02:01:01] And I got to.

[02:01:03] So, you know, I just like doing interesting things that, you know, I haven't been done

[02:01:11] before trying to push that in on every game that I work on.

[02:01:18] You had another question too?

[02:01:20] Yeah, the second question is, and thank you for your answer.

[02:01:24] The second question, I don't know if this was covered also, but has Stern ever thought

[02:01:28] of venturing down the road of single level games, like street level games or Capcom classics?

[02:01:36] I mean, a lot of people discuss it.

[02:01:38] I don't know if it would be profitable or if they would ever discuss it, talked about

[02:01:42] it, you know, especially with the way times are right now.

[02:01:44] I think you're ever going to see single level games.

[02:01:47] I think you'll always keep games that, you know, have at least one ramp on it, even if

[02:01:52] it's only one ramp.

[02:01:54] This makes the game seem fuller and seem bigger.

[02:01:58] You know, if you don't have like a ramp or other three-dimensional stuff on a game, then

[02:02:04] it's definitely less curb appeal.

[02:02:07] And, you know, you try and sell that into a basement or whatever.

[02:02:11] And people are going to say, oh, there's nothing on that game.

[02:02:13] I mean, why would I want this thing when I can have, you know, this over game, you know,

[02:02:17] from five or ten years ago that has like, you know, 80 ramps on it?

[02:02:22] So I don't think you're ever going to see, you know, my guess is that you're going to

[02:02:27] see a decided reduction in terms of the amount of stuff that's on playfield going, you

[02:02:35] know, going ahead.

[02:02:36] All right.

[02:02:37] Well, thank you for those questions.

[02:02:38] Let's see if I can get somebody else here.

[02:02:40] Hold on a second.

[02:02:42] Hi, welcome to TopCask.

[02:02:44] Can you hear me?

[02:02:45] Yes, I can.

[02:02:46] What's your question for Keith?

[02:02:48] Question is it just first off, thanks so much for the great design keys on these lovely

[02:02:51] games.

[02:02:52] I have many of them in my basement, you know, your Simpsons, or the Rings.

[02:02:57] I could go on forever on the great design.

[02:03:02] The question is, you know, I had to walk away for one second.

[02:03:04] You were just starting to talk about CSI.

[02:03:06] I was just curious about your latest game.

[02:03:08] The last thing I kind of heard was that you didn't like the theme.

[02:03:11] I kind of understand that part.

[02:03:14] I guess the question was a little more specific about, you know, the programming and designing

[02:03:18] it.

[02:03:19] You guys may have gotten into this if you did.

[02:03:20] I apologize if I had to walk away.

[02:03:22] Do you feel that you were able to finish this?

[02:03:25] Do you feel that the game in general is a fun and good game to play and has nice design?

[02:03:31] Well, again, my influence on the game was relatively limited.

[02:03:35] And I did a relatively small portion of the work compared to other people.

[02:03:39] So in terms of where the game is at, I mean, it's largely done.

[02:03:45] I don't know if it's 100% done or not yet.

[02:03:48] But I mean, you know, most of the features that were planned for the game are already in

[02:03:56] the game.

[02:03:58] But, you know, since I wasn't, you know, particularly, you know, important in the scope of this

[02:04:10] game, you know, I don't really have a feeling as far as whether or not I feel it's, you know,

[02:04:16] what I would have, I mean, no matter what, everyone would have done something different

[02:04:21] with each game, you know.

[02:04:24] So I, you know, the part that I did, you know, I think is fun and I'm relatively happy

[02:04:31] with, but in a good and skim thing is, you know, it's a relatively small part of the game,

[02:04:36] I think.

[02:04:37] Okay.

[02:04:38] Yeah, I was just curious because it had law learned your name, worth throwing up there

[02:04:41] on it a lot.

[02:04:42] It would be used to kind of clarify my involvement with, you know, how much involvement I actually

[02:04:48] had in the game.

[02:04:49] Okay.

[02:04:50] Okay, great.

[02:04:51] Thanks.

[02:04:52] Do you think that it is turned if they got involved in gaming, you know, making slots

[02:05:00] or packy slows or whatever, do you think that would help or hurt things?

[02:05:03] I don't know enough about what's involved in starting up a, you know, a whole new gaming

[02:05:12] company.

[02:05:13] I mean, you know, Williams was a publicly traded company that had a bunch of resources,

[02:05:17] you know, from, you know, the heyday of pinball success in the early 90s.

[02:05:22] Though they had a lot of money where they could, you know, start getting into that market.

[02:05:28] I mean, when you're talking about reducing your overhead cost just in terms of salaries

[02:05:34] by like 35%, you know, cutting it down to 35% of what originally was, you know, you're

[02:05:40] definitely not going to have, you know, any capital to start going down to different

[02:05:45] routes, you know, like, you know, starting to hold another line of games or anything like

[02:05:51] that.

[02:05:52] Yeah, I just, you know, it's, you know, important as an opportunity is it is.

[02:05:56] It's, you know, it worked for Williams.

[02:05:58] I mean, pinball finance, the Slap Division for many years, you know, when it started out

[02:06:03] in the early 90s and then, you know, basically over to come and, and, you know, more or less

[02:06:08] close pinball because the slots got so successful.

[02:06:12] And, you know, I just, you know, I just thrown an idea out of someone.

[02:06:15] To do that would have been in the mid 2000s around the time where Lord of the Rings was

[02:06:21] being produced originally.

[02:06:22] Right.

[02:06:23] And the company, you know, had a, you know, had a bunch of money they could have, you know,

[02:06:27] reinvested and, you know, if you really wanted to expand that would have been the time to

[02:06:31] do it.

[02:06:32] Even as it was, you know, the company probably should have spent more of an effort insuring

[02:06:39] up its, you know, for example, like it's prototyping ability.

[02:06:44] I mean, you know, when Stern starts off a new design, you know, everything that gets

[02:06:52] put into a game gets set off to a vendor.

[02:06:54] There's no, there's no lab or anything like that to get, you know, to get, to get a play

[02:07:03] field laid out and see how it shoots.

[02:07:05] I mean, you have to get, if you have a layout, you have to get everything designed, which

[02:07:10] is a three to four week process.

[02:07:12] Then you have to get it out to all your vendors and, you know, they have to prototype parts.

[02:07:17] So you're waiting another two to four weeks to get those parts back.

[02:07:21] Then you finally build up a play field that takes another week or two after that.

[02:07:26] And then then you're just shooting like flat rails and stuff, you know, you don't even,

[02:07:30] you haven't even bothered to, to a ramp or anything like that yet.

[02:07:34] So it's just a very trying process, trying to get new games developed over there.

[02:07:40] And the business probably could have really benefited from, you know, making an, making

[02:07:45] an effort to make it easier to prototype pieces so that software could actually get some

[02:07:52] time to work on a game instead of the mechanical department, you know, the mechanical department

[02:07:59] of treating their, their end of, treating their time to be done at game production start.

[02:08:07] Instead of, you know, six months before production, I suppose to start.

[02:08:10] So the weekend, you know, work on a play field that is what is going to be, you know, produced

[02:08:16] down the line, down the line.

[02:08:17] All right, we got another, we got another caller.

[02:08:19] Hi, what's your first name and, what's your question for Keith?

[02:08:22] Vince.

[02:08:23] And my question for Keith is, what were the best toys that were costed out of a game that

[02:08:29] you worked on?

[02:08:30] Hmm.

[02:08:31] That is a good question.

[02:08:39] You know, most, you know, they're generally treated as, it's pretty important and, you

[02:08:45] know, ultimately, I think most of them made it into the game.

[02:08:49] The only one that I can think of op-hand was the device on World Poker Tour, which we

[02:08:55] eventually, were on the calling the iceberg.

[02:08:59] There was kind of this thing that had four quadrants to it.

[02:09:05] And like one quadrant had a, it was, it was a, it was a spinning disc that had four quadrants

[02:09:11] and, and all the way down, the thing is flush the play field.

[02:09:15] And then the disc came up and revealed, you know, one of four quadrants, each quadrant

[02:09:19] did its own thing.

[02:09:21] One of them could lock a ball.

[02:09:22] One of them was some tires if you could shoot at.

[02:09:24] One of them, I think, was like a little loop or something.

[02:09:27] I don't even remember what the fourth one was.

[02:09:30] But that thing, it was a gigantic amic that probably cost $150 to $200 to put into a

[02:09:38] game, which is just an absolutely insane amount of cost.

[02:09:44] But, you know, it would have solved a problem of poker not really having something up the

[02:09:49] middle to advance the drop turn river, which I think the game really needed instead of

[02:09:56] having to do it by shooting in the ramps.

[02:10:01] One, one, one, one, one, toy that I've heard about, but I'm not sure if this is a bogus

[02:10:05] rumor or not, was that there was some sort of a tuning fork and family guy.

[02:10:09] So that actually, this or not, you know, were the captive, were the captive balls were.

[02:10:13] Never like that.

[02:10:14] I mean, the only thing that family guy had was that the captive balls originally had

[02:10:23] a piezo switches in them, which are basically vibration sensors.

[02:10:28] So there was, you know, each of the captive balls had one, so that the ball itself, the

[02:10:35] front ball, could register hits.

[02:10:38] And then there would be one captive ball behind it that would switch back and forth.

[02:10:43] Those were eventually determined to be too unrealliable, like literally the day of the game

[02:10:48] went into initial production.

[02:10:50] So those things got taken out of the game.

[02:10:55] And the post installed in between and a captive ball behind each of the two stationary balls.

[02:11:02] All right.

[02:11:06] Thank you.

[02:11:08] Yeah, I think the tuning fork was the piezo switches that you mentioned.

[02:11:14] That could be that.

[02:11:15] Yeah, it was like a tuning fork style switch to register.

[02:11:20] Yeah, like I said, the ball hits.

[02:11:23] So how often does that happen?

[02:11:24] Or something, it comes that close to being in production and then it's pulled out literally

[02:11:29] when the game is starting to run?

[02:11:32] That is pretty unusual.

[02:11:33] Usually you figure that out pretty well in advance.

[02:11:37] I mean, I will say that there have been significant changes made.

[02:11:45] The best recent example of this that I can remember is on Batman.

[02:11:52] The ramp up the middle of the game was really, really horrible.

[02:11:57] I mean, it was a completely terrible shot.

[02:12:01] It just was not any fun to make at all.

[02:12:04] It was not any good to shoot.

[02:12:06] And myself and especially Lyman, since he was the one programming the game, said multiple

[02:12:13] times that this shot is not any good and needs to be fixed.

[02:12:18] So nothing happens to it.

[02:12:20] Nothing happens to it.

[02:12:21] Nothing happens to it.

[02:12:22] Then about a week before it goes into production, Gary starts flipping the game.

[02:12:26] And says, hey, you can't shoot this ramp.

[02:12:31] And Lyman is like, yeah, I know.

[02:12:33] I've been saying something about it for two months.

[02:12:36] So all of a sudden, everyone gets their butts in gear and redesigns the ramp so that you

[02:12:42] can actually make it up to the upper play field and that kind of thing.

[02:12:46] How much involvement did Gary have in actual design or play field or anything really?

[02:12:53] I mean, when it comes right down to it?

[02:12:57] Up front, we would have meetings and make pitches and stuff like that.

[02:13:06] There might be something said there.

[02:13:09] Usually what happened is it came really late in the process after you spent anywhere from three to nine months working under game.

[02:13:18] And then all of a sudden it was determined, oh my god, this sucks.

[02:13:21] We got to change it.

[02:13:24] That happened on board quite a bit.

[02:13:26] It's really let me out of shape on the time I was working on that.

[02:13:31] Why, what was determined that sucked?

[02:13:34] So the main thing was the tower when you shot into it shook but didn't come down.

[02:13:40] Because I wanted it to come down at a certain time.

[02:13:44] So that was changed so that it came down like every so often when you shot it up in the upper tower up there.

[02:13:50] The ball rock coming out there, so called consolation ball rock.

[02:13:55] But there are a bunch of other things too.

[02:13:59] Like there are into the test game that we had to try and keep the ball up in the bumpers instead of having it loop around or something like that.

[02:14:10] And I don't know.

[02:14:14] There were about three or four different type field tweaks that occurred on that game that I said, you know, you don't want to do this because of this reason.

[02:14:24] You only do that because of this reason.

[02:14:27] And every single thing that they tried, they eventually came to the conclusion that I told them for the reason that I told them.

[02:14:34] So you know, it was just a very frustrating experience.

[02:14:39] One thing that happened a lot is that the two people there that had the most experience of in terms of playing pinball and knowing the history of pinball were linening to myself.

[02:14:54] And we, you know, our play and experience, we've just played a lot of pinball because we like it.

[02:15:01] And you know, that's what we did before we came to work in the industry.

[02:15:06] You know, if you had this vast information about why stuff is good or why stuff is bad, you know, and we tell you something is good or bad for a certain reason, then you should probably listen to us, you know, and not go ahead and design what you're going to design anyway and then wind up changing it because you find out it sucks.

[02:15:27] And we told you that like two months ago.

[02:15:30] You know, it's very frustrating from that perspective.

[02:15:33] You know, just not being listened to as much as we thought we should have probably been listened to.

[02:15:39] No, so Gary didn't really, I mean, it was Gary hard to work for?

[02:15:45] At times, at times not.

[02:15:48] I mean, you know, I think Gary plays the work for you, had your ups and downs and, you know, I, Lord, was actually a low point for me personally.

[02:15:59] In terms of, you know, the amount of fun I was having while working there.

[02:16:05] But, you know, everything else I was, you know, I was relatively, you know, not in two bad shape.

[02:16:14] All right, well cool. Is there anything there forgot to ask or anything you'd like to add?

[02:16:20] Not too much. I mean, you know, I wish during the best of luck.

[02:16:25] I, you know, I just don't know how successful they're going to wind up being.

[02:16:30] It's times are tough right now and, you know, I just don't know if the people that are there are going to be enough to get all the work done.

[02:16:40] They need to be done in order to, you know, the move games forward.

[02:16:45] Well, things will have to go slower, I guess.

[02:16:48] Well, you don't think so, but I mean, you know, really though, you need to move faster because you need, if you're only selling, you know, a few hundred or a few, you know, if you're selling like around a thousand of a game, then you need more different models in order to, in order to keep your volume up.

[02:17:11] I mean, you know, so you need, you need to hit four games a year, although I don't know how they can possibly do that in order to, you know, keep their business viable.

[02:17:23] You know, if they get back to the point where they're selling several thousand of a game at a time, then obviously you only need to do between, you know, two hundred a year.

[02:17:32] Since that's not the case right now, it probably won't be for a long time. I don't think that, I don't think they're going to have a whole lot of, I think they're going to, it's going to be some trying times, that's for sure.

[02:17:46] You think that, you know, it's just going to drive a line, and crazy, I mean, because basically he's the only program where they have now, right?

[02:17:54] Well, again, you know, a line is a program or two. Certainly, the one that is the one that is the company that has the most involved, playing experience.

[02:18:07] So, you know, it's good that he's still there, and you know, they definitely eat someone like him. You know, I just hope they listen to him enough.

[02:18:20] All right, well, thank you, Keith. I really do appreciate your time, and I appreciate you coming on TopCast. It's really, I've been trying to get you out for a while.

[02:18:27] Yeah, I know, I just couldn't do it before, so.

[02:18:30] Yeah, you mean, what, were your hands actually tied before where you couldn't do it?

[02:18:35] Yeah, I couldn't, I was basically told not to go on and not to, you know, say too much about, you know. It was just felt that I might, you know, go away to make secrets or something like that.

[02:18:48] You know, I don't know that I would have said too much different from what I said. Now, I mean, I'd have been as critical of, you know, the, you know, the state of the company or whatever, but I certainly, you know, like, you know, I'm not going to give away production numbers or, you know, how things are designed certain way, is that kind of thing?

[02:19:08] Yeah, speaking of which, why do they hold production numbers like as, you know, a big top secret thing?

[02:19:15] I'm not sure the exact reason for that. I guess partially, so you don't know how good or bad the company is doing. That might be one reason.

[02:19:27] You know, like, if it seems like that, that, hey, this company is selling, you know, thousands and thousands of games a year, you know, we could, we could get in on some of that action.

[02:19:40] You know, I think that was, you know, another part of it is you don't, you don't want to necessarily let people know when, you know, when times are really good or times are really bad.

[02:19:52] But, you know, when you have the layoff and the rumors start flying, like happened this past week, I mean, obviously, you know, words aren't going to get out that times are pretty bad right now.

[02:20:04] So, where are you going to go and do what line of work are you going to shoot for?

[02:20:12] I mean, I have several prospects and, you know, I'm really not worried about it. So, you know, I'll be in good shape, wherever I wind up landing at.

[02:20:27] So, you know, sad to be out of pinball certainly, but, you know, I certainly had fun for the most part, you know, doing what I was doing.

[02:20:36] I'm happy to have had the influence that I had of pinball and, you know, wherever I go next, I mean, I hope to, you know, I hope to have as much impact as I did there.

[02:20:51] Well, cool. I wish you the best of luck. I wish you the best of luck. And I'm, again, thank you for coming on. I really appreciate it.

[02:21:01] And I'm sure I speak for everybody in saying thank you for, you know, the work that you've done in the industry. You've done some, you know, some great games and, you know, some stuff that's, you know, that I own that.

[02:21:11] So, you know, I got a lot of, you know, I got a lot of your stuff. So, you know, it's it. So, I'm sure that resonates through a lot of people that have games.

[02:21:19] Thank you very much.

[02:21:20] All right. You take care. And, you know, I, again, keep in touch and let us know what, so what happens?

[02:21:27] Yeah, I feel and, you know, if it turns out I may come back on again sometime, I'm certainly willing to be able to do that.

[02:21:33] All right. You take care.
