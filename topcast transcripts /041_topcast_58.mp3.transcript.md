[00:00] You're listening to Topcast, this old pinballs online radio.

[00:04] For more information visit them anytime, www.marvin3m.com.

[00:10] Flash Topcast.

[00:23] Tonight at Topcast we're going to be talking to a gentleman that has a pretty diverse history

[00:29] in both video game and pinball development and operations.

[00:34] This guy was an operator down south in Virginia for a while.

[00:39] He also hacked a lot of his own games, video games and pinball games making and creating

[00:44] his own games.

[00:46] He then went and worked for Williams in their slot machine division and then went and

[00:52] worked as a programmer in the pinball division for pinball 2000 Star War episode.

[00:59] He now works for Larry DeMar, doing slot machine development.

[01:04] I like to welcome Duncan Brown to Topcast tonight.

[01:16] Duncan again he has a very diverse history in the coin op biz.

[01:21] He's basically done it all and done a lot more than most people have done.

[01:26] Now Duncan was not really willing to do much of a phone interview so he came to my

[01:31] house for another project he's working on a book of pinball back glasses and he wanted

[01:36] to take some pictures of some of the games that I had in my collection.

[01:41] So while he was snapping photos of my back glasses I interviewed him here.

[01:47] So we're going to talk to Duncan Brown right now.

[01:50] This is obviously previously recorded.

[01:52] So Duncan, tell me about how you started out in pinball what your first memories were,

[01:58] how all you got involved in this sick industry.

[02:02] My dad took me and my brother to play at R.K. when we were young.

[02:07] And were we growing up at the time?

[02:08] Well I was in Virginia but sometimes we play falling out of something but my distinct

[02:14] memories are going when we visit his parents in Tallahassee, Florida.

[02:20] We go down there and he knew where this really good arcade was.

[02:23] We go there and it was all he owns like we played fireball for a dime a game.

[02:27] Right.

[02:28] Three games per quarter.

[02:31] But the thing was his mom considered pinball machines the tool of the devil so he actually

[02:36] had to sneak out to play pinball even though he was in his 30s or whatever at the time.

[02:41] Really?

[02:42] And this was your dad.

[02:43] Yeah.

[02:44] And so your mom thought that pinball?

[02:45] No no no his mom.

[02:46] His mom.

[02:47] Okay.

[02:48] Okay.

[02:49] So he all grown up with kids and he still had him to sneak out to go play pinball which

[02:53] I assume he did when he was a kid too.

[02:55] Right.

[02:56] So we were all hooked on that and eventually like we joined bowling league so we were

[03:00] always around seeing wall and pinballs and all that stuff back in Virginia.

[03:06] You're talking about the early video games?

[03:09] No no the early mechanical.

[03:11] Oh the mechanical pinball from 59 from 1.

[03:14] No no no.

[03:15] Was it called the mechanical?

[03:16] It was a mechanical you know one of those half-selver mirrored arcade games.

[03:20] Oh yeah yeah see raider.

[03:21] See raider.

[03:22] Yeah sure.

[03:23] Yeah see raider.

[03:24] And then see wall later it was spinning over.

[03:25] See wall first.

[03:26] See wall first was the video.

[03:27] But see raider was the and then there was one called sea devil which came out a year later

[03:32] and then yeah.

[03:33] So we played all those you know from the earliest days.

[03:35] Yeah EM arcade games.

[03:37] Right.

[03:38] Right.

[03:39] So then when I was a teenager maybe not even much of a teenager like 12 or 13 I decided

[03:45] I wanted to get a pinball machine so I you know copy down the name and address of the

[03:51] route operator at the bowling alley and they had a stick on there and I drove over there

[03:55] it was a town over and I went in and asked if they had any pinball machines they'd sell

[03:58] me and they just laughed and laughed and laughed and shoot me away.

[04:04] So that didn't go too well.

[04:05] But eventually I saw one classified ad in the paper and somebody over in that same area

[04:10] had a 19 is it like 56 or 57 William Starfire.

[04:15] So I went and bought that and brought it home you know all the classic tricks have put

[04:18] it in the truck with its legs on and head on and oh really.

[04:21] Yeah.

[04:22] But I got it home safely and the flipper links were broken and you know what did I know

[04:28] where to get you know bake lighter whether that stuff is so right.

[04:32] You know I ended up carving down some plastic and making you flipper links and made it all

[04:36] work and you know I actually got it all running.

[04:38] Huh.

[04:39] And then later on while I was still.

[04:41] And nobody taught you you just figured this all out on your own.

[04:43] Yeah.

[04:44] And then I had new electronics told me I had a solder and stuff.

[04:47] Right.

[04:48] And he had done like the is it the Bellsaw electronics course or something it was it was

[04:55] something where you get like a heath kit TV to build a thing to the course.

[04:59] I already knew all this electronics stuff but he took this course because it was cheap

[05:03] way to get a TV and I got to build the whole TV and everything.

[05:07] Yeah.

[05:08] And how long did the TV last?

[05:10] Oh years.

[05:11] Really?

[05:12] Yeah.

[05:13] So I knew my way around electronics a little bit but you know I learned just taught myself

[05:17] how to read the schematics and all that figured it out.

[05:20] And then later on in high school a friend of mine oh you've got a pinball machine well

[05:24] we've got one in our basement and we hit the glass and it smashed and it's glass everywhere

[05:28] and it won't run do you want to just take it.

[05:31] And it's like heck yeah so I got my second pinball machine.

[05:34] What was it dear?

[05:35] It was a got leaps superstar.

[05:37] Oh.

[05:38] Well I was fun.

[05:39] Well you get to hear that.

[05:40] I think that was fun.

[05:41] No that's a good one.

[05:42] I'm not going to run any of this shit on tempered glass for it again because I didn't

[05:45] know any better.

[05:47] I think you know cleaned all the bits and pieces out and then eventually I don't know I just

[05:51] kept going from there but.

[05:53] So in high school you were accumulating games.

[05:56] Yeah.

[05:57] And they were all basically low end freebies or close school.

[06:01] I got paid like 200 for the Starfire.

[06:03] Oh really?

[06:04] Yeah.

[06:05] Wow.

[06:06] 200 is a lot back in whenever.

[06:08] Yeah.

[06:09] You know for a huge game that's a lot of money.

[06:10] You had $200?

[06:11] Sure.

[06:12] I did a couple of jobs.

[06:13] Did you?

[06:14] Yeah.

[06:15] Okay so what kind of jobs were you doing?

[06:16] Paper out of course.

[06:17] Classic.

[06:18] Back when kids delivered papers.

[06:19] Right.

[06:20] Back when people read papers.

[06:21] Right.

[06:22] And at the photography store in town I ran their dark room and stuff.

[06:26] Oh so you had like almost a real job.

[06:28] Yeah.

[06:29] Huh.

[06:30] Interesting.

[06:31] So eventually I ended up at UVA at college and by the way what's UVA?

[06:37] University of Virginia.

[06:38] That's a major.

[06:40] And by that time I had Valley Joules.

[06:45] So I brought that down and put it in the suite.

[06:47] There was like five rooms around a communal suite in these dorms.

[06:50] Right.

[06:51] Everybody had a great time with that.

[06:54] And what year was it?

[06:55] 79 to 80.

[06:57] Okay.

[06:58] And at one point one of the little things, there's this whole relay bank in that game.

[07:05] It was like these armature plates with tabs on them.

[07:08] I don't really remember what they do but it was something for the features of the game.

[07:12] And one of them just broke and have.

[07:14] You mean on the relay the activator plate, the part that actually activates, moves the switches

[07:20] that broke.

[07:21] Well it wasn't just the switches.

[07:22] It was, I don't remember the game but there was something more complicated than that.

[07:25] It was a big armature plate.

[07:27] Like you have on a gate assembly or something but it was a whole bank of them that did

[07:32] something for this game.

[07:34] And it just broke clean and half.

[07:36] And when I took it all apart and looked at it, it was just a flat piece of metal and it

[07:40] broke in and half.

[07:41] And I noticed several of the plates had two dimples in them to give it more strength so

[07:47] they wouldn't break in half.

[07:48] I was like, oh you know, Valley figured this out and you know, somebody's already replaced

[07:54] a few of them that broke.

[07:55] So I actually wrote Valley.

[07:57] This long hand letter and said, you know, I've got some of these plates broken.

[08:01] You know, how do I go about buying?

[08:02] I might see.

[08:03] I've got a new design.

[08:04] I prefer that one.

[08:05] And then you know, I never heard anything from them.

[08:07] Like four weeks later a little box shows up to my address with like 20 plates in it.

[08:11] Really?

[08:12] Yeah.

[08:13] So, do you know who sent it?

[08:15] No idea.

[08:16] No.

[08:17] Well, customer service.

[08:18] Yeah.

[08:19] So, you know, I replaced all my bad plates and that thing ran great.

[08:24] And what happened to all these games?

[08:26] You know, traded them and sold them over the years.

[08:28] I wish I had the Starfire back.

[08:29] I've never seen another one.

[08:30] In fact, from my back glass picture project, I could really use a picture of a Starfire

[08:34] at this point.

[08:35] You know, we should just mention that you're taking pinball back glass pictures on conventional

[08:41] film right?

[08:42] Right.

[08:43] That's right.

[08:44] And you're going to at some point publish a book on this or something or something.

[08:47] You don't even really know.

[08:48] No, the goal is to get one insanely high quality picture of every back glass ever.

[08:53] Right.

[08:54] And you're, you're touching them up in Photoshop.

[08:56] Right.

[08:57] Right.

[08:58] If the glass has any issues.

[08:59] Yeah.

[09:00] But you've gotten really good at this.

[09:01] But you're not doing play field pictures just glass.

[09:03] That's correct.

[09:04] And I, of course, blown you crap about this continually because if you're set up to do all

[09:09] the back glass, why wouldn't you just shoot the play field too?

[09:13] Because for whatever amount of time it takes me to shoot a back glass picture, it takes

[09:16] about 10 times as much time to do a play field picture, right?

[09:19] And I don't even like how you do the play field.

[09:21] Right.

[09:22] The telly.

[09:23] So there you go.

[09:24] You're doing too straight on.

[09:25] I needed more from a player's perspective.

[09:27] Right.

[09:28] You get it up.

[09:29] I'm going after the art.

[09:30] So straight on is what you need for that.

[09:32] Okay.

[09:33] Okay.

[09:34] And yes, if you want to do one more dig, back glasses are pretty much the only art form

[09:37] on the planet whose whole point is to be backlighted and I'm front lighting them for my pictures.

[09:42] So there you go.

[09:43] Just get it all out in the open.

[09:45] No, I wasn't even going to bring that up.

[09:47] But again, I'm trying to capture the art that's there and the only way to do that is to

[09:50] do it.

[09:51] And you're going is what is the time frame that you're trying to do this project through?

[09:56] I mean, you messed up my life.

[09:57] No, I mean, 1947.

[09:58] Oh, right.

[09:59] The original idea was flipper game.

[10:02] Right.

[10:03] Do you want me to say how it all started?

[10:05] Sure.

[10:06] When I came to work at Williams and realized that you'd go places and tell people where you

[10:14] worked and they'd say, oh, wow, pinball machines, they still make those.

[10:18] And you realize, wow, you know, we're in an industry where everybody knows what the product

[10:22] is.

[10:23] 100% recognition of the product and no one knows where out there.

[10:25] How can that be?

[10:26] And so Williams needs to somehow advertise that fact.

[10:30] You know, they're the leader in the industry.

[10:32] It's up to them to keep this industry alive.

[10:34] Let's just go out and tell people about pinball.

[10:38] And that just wasn't done.

[10:39] You know, that wasn't what they did.

[10:41] But I had this great idea.

[10:43] You know, like these Corvette posters or the doors of Dublin or whatever make this poster

[10:46] of every Williams pinball back glass ever.

[10:49] Right.

[10:50] About 400 of them make a great poster and just be this cool promo.

[10:53] People get excited about pinballing it.

[10:56] So I want to, you know, talk to my boss about it and who are your boss?

[11:00] Larry, well, Ted Estes and Larry Demarck.

[11:02] Okay.

[11:03] They thought it was a neat idea and said, go talk to marketing.

[11:05] So I went over to talk to marketing and explained all this and how, you know, I'd like, you

[11:10] know, copies of all the pictures they take and, you know, the PR photos over the years.

[11:15] And her only response to me was, you're new here, aren't you?

[11:21] She just laughed at me.

[11:22] This is the most preposterous thing she'd ever heard.

[11:24] And she said, oh, and we don't have those, you know, we don't have any of those pictures.

[11:29] So anyway, fast forward years later after pinball shut down and I hear from someone at Midway

[11:33] that in fact, when they finally let go of the PR company and they'd had for decades, they

[11:38] sent over all the pictures that they did have to this lady and she threw them all away.

[11:43] So, oh great.

[11:44] So, would have saved me a lot of trouble.

[11:47] But at that point, Larry and Ted said, look, you go get all the pictures and we'll make

[11:50] the poster.

[11:51] And then Larry and Kenna Ford, whatever it cost to make a run of posters, you know.

[11:54] Right.

[11:55] It sounds like a great idea.

[11:56] So I said about getting all those pictures.

[11:58] And while first I had to figure out what all the pinball's lambs ever made were and that

[12:02] was not easy, but I came up with a list of about 400 of them.

[12:06] But because there was no internet pinball database at that time.

[12:08] There was, but it wasn't complete and, you know, they didn't have everything.

[12:12] And I had a master list of every project number of lambs had ever assigned, but it didn't

[12:17] always say whether it was a pinball or whether it was even made or...

[12:22] Right.

[12:23] Right.

[12:24] So, and again, I decided to let myself to flip our games forward at that point.

[12:27] Right.

[12:28] So, I was missing some of William's history there.

[12:32] So that went on and I got, well, over half of them, I probably had maybe 250 of them by

[12:36] the time pinball shut down and then, like, then what?

[12:40] What do I care about a William's pinball poster at that point?

[12:42] So I decided well, I'll just get a picture of every back glass ever made.

[12:45] Because including Gottlieballey, Staucoin, whatever.

[12:48] Everything.

[12:49] Because along the way, when I'd see a really rare, interesting game, I'd go ahead and get

[12:52] a picture of that too.

[12:53] But I've been skipping an awful lot of non-Williams glasses in my travel.

[12:56] So I decided to just start getting everything.

[12:59] And how far along are you in this project?

[13:02] Well, part of my problem is the whole database of what I've got.

[13:05] But I bet I've got 12, 13, 14, 100 different back glasses.

[13:10] Already, you know, Photoshop.

[13:11] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[13:13] I'm way behind in that process.

[13:15] Well, how many Photoshopped and ready for print?

[13:19] Well, here's the thing.

[13:20] I had all the slide scanner I could afford at first and got several hundred pictures

[13:27] through the process with that.

[13:29] And then I got a much, much better slide scanner, including the fact that it gets

[13:33] rid of the dust on the fly.

[13:35] So you mean now you're going back?

[13:36] I'm going to go back and re-scan everything.

[13:38] Well, let me ask this, why aren't you using digital equipment?

[13:41] Why are you using old school film?

[13:43] A bunch of reasons.

[13:45] When I started and took the pictures on film, if I had used the best digital camera of the

[13:51] day, or more realistically, the best digital camera I could afford, it would be stuck at

[13:57] that resolution forever.

[13:59] Right.

[14:00] Whereas with film, all I have to do is buy a better slide scanner or rent a better slide

[14:04] scanner.

[14:05] Why not 35 millimeter print?

[14:08] Why slide?

[14:09] Oh, because it's much easier to scan slide.

[14:11] Oh, it is.

[14:12] You can throw them in a little feeder and they just go.

[14:15] Yeah.

[14:16] So in other words, I take five pictures of every glass.

[14:18] I bracket my exposures.

[14:20] And then I can pick the best one and chuck the other four in a box.

[14:24] And then I can just stack up all the best ones in a bin and scan them all.

[14:29] Whereas if you were doing negatives, they never print them right.

[14:33] I need to re-scan the negatives, not the print.

[14:35] So then they're all in these strips and you've got to figure out what the best exposure

[14:38] is.

[14:39] Right.

[14:40] Slides is way simpler.

[14:41] Huh.

[14:42] Interesting.

[14:43] Why anyway?

[14:44] So you were back at college.

[14:46] Did you graduate college?

[14:47] Well, no.

[14:48] There's a story about that.

[14:50] And what's the story behind that?

[14:52] Well, and you're still in Virginia, right?

[14:55] Oh, yeah.

[14:56] Okay.

[14:57] At UVA, spending an awful lot of my time at an arcade there in town, eventually to the point.

[15:02] What's the name of the arcade?

[15:03] No elves.

[15:04] No elves, okay.

[15:05] Eventually to the point where, you know, I'm complaining about their broken machines and

[15:10] the part-time mechanics never there and they say, well, you know, if you know how to

[15:14] fix them, why don't you do it?

[15:15] So I started doing that.

[15:16] And what year was this?

[15:18] 8081.

[15:19] So you're doing solid state and electro-mechanical?

[15:22] Well, all they had was solid state at that point.

[15:25] Okay.

[15:26] So yeah, I'm learning how to do that on the fly too.

[15:28] All right.

[15:29] And meanwhile, I'm becoming, you know, a world champion at asteroids and...

[15:33] Wait a minute, wait a minute.

[15:34] World champion for six months.

[15:36] I had the world record for score on asteroids.

[15:39] Really?

[15:40] If you look in the old play meter magazines where they started putting out those speed-up

[15:46] kits for asteroids to try to thwart people, the little...

[15:50] I think it was Sparky's Electronics or something.

[15:52] You know, their little barbs said, date line, Charlottesville, Virginia, you know, someone

[15:56] gets the zillion, you know, points plays for 15 hours or whatever.

[15:59] That was me.

[16:00] 15 hours?

[16:01] Yeah.

[16:02] You played asteroids for 15 hours.

[16:04] Yeah.

[16:05] And did you ever go to the bathroom for 15 hours?

[16:07] You know, it's really odd.

[16:08] I'm just going to tell you the first question everyone asked me is, how could you not go

[16:12] to the bathroom for 15 hours?

[16:14] Never mind that I battled flying saucers and rocks for 15 hours.

[16:17] How could you not go to the bathroom for 15 hours?

[16:20] That was the easy part.

[16:21] That was easy.

[16:22] It was the damn ship shooting at me.

[16:24] It was the hard part.

[16:26] 15 hours.

[16:27] And what I quit with 22 extra ships left.

[16:29] I started at 4am.

[16:31] Because I mean, I was there working on games.

[16:33] They closed at like 2am and then I started a game and was just going and going and going.

[16:37] And I hadn't slept before that.

[16:38] So I mean, I'd been up for whatever 40 hours is something at that point.

[16:44] And 22 extra ships.

[16:45] But I figured out, you know, I proved the point.

[16:47] I was staying, I was slowly climbing up in ships.

[16:49] I was not losing ground.

[16:51] The game wasn't getting any harder.

[16:52] I'd wrapped it over, you know, however many times it was like, I was like 7 and a half million

[16:57] or something was my score at that point.

[17:01] So I figured I'd proved the point and just finally ditched it.

[17:05] But I mean, the UVA newspaper got a picture of me playing it and having a little article about it.

[17:11] Yeah.

[17:12] And what classes were cut?

[17:15] You know, that's the question by Dad.

[17:17] He said, how is this?

[17:19] It was on a weekend, but still.

[17:20] He's like, how are you getting any homework done?

[17:22] Yeah.

[17:23] I called Atari and told them and they printed it in their little newsletter and sent me a t-shirt and everything.

[17:29] And it was, took about six months, but then eventually people just started playing, you know,

[17:32] forever, two days, four days, you know.

[17:35] Right.

[17:36] And if you go by the Guinness rules, you know, you can take breaks.

[17:39] And I guess I was scared to leave the machine.

[17:42] I figured, you know, if I broke my concentration, it was all over.

[17:44] I'd lose all my extra ships, you know.

[17:47] Clearly, I could have let a couple of ships die while I went to the bathroom or just sat down for a second.

[17:52] But, you know, I was too afraid.

[17:54] I'd never done that before.

[17:56] So.

[17:57] And what was the preparation to get to this point?

[18:00] I just played a lot of asteroids.

[18:01] I mean, I had a lot of really good games, but then I finally just put it all together one game and, you know, got in the zone and did it.

[18:09] Right.

[18:10] Where was this all leading?

[18:11] Oh, eventually, I don't, I think I actually dropped out of school to work at this place full time, but it wasn't too long after that.

[18:18] That's several of us that either worked their hat work there.

[18:21] The side of the guy wasn't, you know, he was basically stealing all the money out of the company for his own purposes.

[18:28] Oh, was this a company store basically was this?

[18:31] No, no, no, it was a one guy, but he started expanding.

[18:34] And he was, you know, playing shell games with the money that he's getting from the back for expansion building himself this insane new house.

[18:41] And I seem to keep ending up at companies where the CEO steals all the money for his own purposes.

[18:49] So anyway, we decided to go start our own place and just totally bootstrapped it.

[18:53] You know, borrowed all the money to open it and, you know, we all loved pinball and, you know, who's we now?

[19:00] Well, it was me, Greg Johnson, Dave Frenow and Hercules Capos.

[19:06] Yes, his name really was Hercules.

[19:08] Wow.

[19:09] So we were all basically at that point, UVA dropouts, you know, and why did you drop out because this was too interesting and too much fun?

[19:16] Yeah, I was learning more, you know, repairing games.

[19:19] After I beat asteroids, I decided I wanted to know how it ticked.

[19:23] So I started disassembling the code, you know, and were you an assembly language programmer at that point?

[19:28] Not until then, no.

[19:30] And I didn't have any way to read out the chips.

[19:32] So I've rigged up a thing with, I think it's like 11 toggle switches and 8 LEDs and a socket and toggled in binary through every location in each of the three chips.

[19:43] It's 6,000 bytes of code and data.

[19:48] Rotted all that long hand on legal pads, hand translated it to assembly, you know, hacks first and then assembly.

[19:56] I'm really good at sight reading binary to hacks now, and he listed it.

[20:00] Yeah.

[20:01] And, you know, he was starting to figure out what made it tick.

[20:05] Which year's later came and what was this in 8080?

[20:07] I know, 65 out of two.

[20:09] It was 65 out of two.

[20:10] Yeah.

[20:11] Years later ended up writing a thing for a researcher at the University of Denver who wanted to use asteroids for complex scale acquisition studies.

[20:22] So you mean you almost got a real job out of this?

[20:26] Yeah.

[20:27] Well, that was just a consulting job.

[20:29] But I mean all of this led to where I am today, obviously.

[20:32] Yeah.

[20:33] Yeah.

[20:34] Somewhere just one step above the gutter.

[20:36] And somewhere in there, just before we left and formed our own company, I created a pinball machine called Chief Bank of Flip Galactic Poker Dice.

[20:45] Right.

[20:46] I bought a time warp in the crate, close out for 700 bucks, stripped it, never played a game on it.

[20:52] It was brand new, brand new, and great.

[20:54] Used that as the basis for everything, ordered a bunch of balli and Williams parts out of their parts departments.

[21:00] Couldn't find the right plywood anywhere to make the play fields out of.

[21:05] And we were working with Brady Distributing Company at that point.

[21:08] And I called them and said, you know, what can I do?

[21:10] Well, they call ballet and ballet said, that's the weirdest request we've ever had.

[21:14] But we'll sell you 50 bucks a sheet.

[21:16] We'll sell you a blank play field.

[21:18] Really?

[21:19] So I got to.

[21:20] And fortunately they already had the little notch and the plunger route in there.

[21:24] Right.

[21:25] I would have a really hard time doing that.

[21:26] Yeah.

[21:27] But that was it.

[21:28] It was blank other than that.

[21:29] So I made one and you know, found out a bunch of things I didn't like how I'd done and then used the second one.

[21:34] And but how did you get it?

[21:35] It's a ballet play field fitting in a Williams cabinet that fit okay?

[21:39] Yeah, they're all the same size.

[21:40] They are.

[21:41] They were at that point.

[21:42] But I mean, even the cutouts and everything matched.

[21:43] There were no cutouts.

[21:44] I mean, it was just other than the plunger cutout.

[21:46] There was nothing.

[21:47] There was nothing.

[21:48] So I had to do all the other cutouts.

[21:49] Right.

[21:50] So the troughs and all that stuff.

[21:51] None of that stuff was there.

[21:52] Yeah.

[21:53] Huh.

[21:54] Interesting.

[21:55] And what was the feature of this game?

[21:56] The big feature was 25 drop targets in a five by five matrix.

[22:00] Like playing breakout with drop targets.

[22:02] Right.

[22:03] And you wrote the code for this using Williams system or ballet?

[22:07] It was Williams.

[22:08] I used the system six.

[22:09] You used system six in and again, I got that all out longhand on legal pads to figure out how the system worked and how the data chip for the game worked.

[22:18] And finally towards the end of that, I was borrowing an Apple 2 plus and could actually program my own chips.

[22:25] I bought a prom program or board.

[22:27] Right.

[22:28] Right.

[22:29] So I could poke all the data there in program chip and got it running.

[22:33] Yeah, because the Apple 2 was well, but the Apple 2 is 6502 and the Williams doesn't matter.

[22:37] It was just binary data.

[22:39] Oh, right.

[22:40] So you weren't assembling and testing it.

[22:42] Now, the game roms are mostly data in a Williams game.

[22:46] There's some code, which again, I had to hand right and just hope it worked or try to figure out why it wasn't.

[22:50] Yeah.

[22:51] And how did you debug stuff?

[22:52] I mean, you know, just sheer determination.

[22:56] I didn't have any tools.

[22:57] So it took you how long did this whole product take?

[23:00] Probably six months.

[23:01] Really?

[23:02] And were you satisfied with the results?

[23:04] Yeah.

[23:05] So you didn't use like, there were operating system, you know how long?

[23:08] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[23:09] It's just the data chip.

[23:11] You did okay, gotcha.

[23:12] Gotcha.

[23:13] And which chip was that?

[23:14] Is it an ICSAT 14 or something like that?

[23:16] So you were using the green flipper roms.

[23:19] Right.

[23:20] And a 2716 e-prone.

[23:21] Right.

[23:22] Right.

[23:23] So then ICSAT 14 is the actual data for the game, the personality chip.

[23:28] And which is like you said, a 2716.

[23:30] And that's where you were just changing all the code in there.

[23:32] And you were making all the calls.

[23:33] You figured out all the calls to the flipper roms to do, you know, update the scores and all that stuff.

[23:39] Yeah.

[23:40] That's pretty impressive.

[23:41] And nobody helped you from Williams or anybody.

[23:45] Okay, you didn't know Eugene Jarvis at the time.

[23:48] And you didn't know Larry DeMar.

[23:52] So you didn't know any of these people.

[23:54] No.

[23:55] Okay.

[23:56] It's funny years later when I was at Williams, John Poppiduk said, man, you know, if you'd drag that thing up to Chicago and shown it would have been Steve Kortek at the time, they would have hired you in the spot.

[24:04] Right.

[24:05] Yeah, they would have.

[24:06] Yeah, for sure.

[24:07] What did I know?

[24:08] Some Redneck and Virginia making his own pitmobile machine.

[24:10] Right.

[24:11] Right. It's pretty cool though.

[24:12] So you still have the, what was it called again?

[24:14] Chief Bank of Flip Galactic Poker Dice.

[24:16] Now the interesting thing is obviously leaving this company we were working at Noels to go start our own place.

[24:26] Wasn't going to make the owner of Noels very happy.

[24:30] And I had limited ability to move stuff.

[24:34] So even though I owned this thing, I had no way to move that game out of there before I left, but I could grab the play field.

[24:41] So you mean you left?

[24:42] Did you have the code I assumed to?

[24:44] That's one reason I haven't brought it to Expo yet is because I've got Apple 2 discs with the code, but none of it appears to be the right code that runs the game.

[24:53] So I kind of need to redo that.

[24:55] I hope you have good notes.

[24:58] Yeah, I have a lot of notes.

[24:59] So you didn't keep a master set of e-proms?

[25:02] Well, you know, they would have been sitting in the game when I, what I mean, keep a secondary set as a backup.

[25:07] If I did, I haven't run across them.

[25:09] Oh man.

[25:10] So all you have to playfields.

[25:12] Well, some years later, I bought a used time warp for good karma sake and dropped it in that.

[25:19] I've got it all in that.

[25:20] Right, right, right.

[25:23] And let's see.

[25:25] So we started our own arcade.

[25:27] And what was your arcade called?

[25:29] Professor Feathers.

[25:30] Why?

[25:31] Well, Edgar Allen Poe, who was a UVA student, by the way, so this all fits, wrote a story called The System of Dr. Tar and Professor Feathers.

[25:41] And there's also, there's an Edgar Allen Poe themed album by the Allen Parsons project that has a song with that name.

[25:52] Right.

[25:53] Kind of had that as our theme song.

[25:56] So we kind of spent the first year paying back all these loans and we bought like $70,000 worth of games and we had a restaurant in there too.

[26:07] Yeah.

[26:08] And I had a restaurant in there too.

[26:10] You know, so.

[26:11] Man, this is pretty impressive that it's just some colleges.

[26:14] You guys actually start with any of your own money?

[26:16] No, we had no money.

[26:18] And you know, again, the lawyer we got to help set up this business said you guys are morons.

[26:23] You don't start a business with no money.

[26:25] We can do it.

[26:27] So we did.

[26:28] I mean, we made a lot of money, but the problem was.

[26:30] You did make a lot of money?

[26:31] Well, we paid back all those loans and everything.

[26:33] You did.

[26:34] And the problem was at the end of the year, we got in all our big debts paid off, but then we're sitting there with year old games.

[26:41] Right.

[26:42] And then we had no money to buy new ones.

[26:43] So, you know, business started tailing off again.

[26:46] And so we had to borrow more money to get more games.

[26:48] It's a never ending cycle.

[26:49] Right.

[26:50] And especially, I mean, once you've got some debt going, then you start paying penalties and interest on the debt and you just never get out of debt.

[26:57] I mean, it's tough.

[26:58] Our biggest problem was we were all young and idealistic and we priced the games really cheap to bring in food customers and priced the food really cheap to bring in game customers and tried to make it up on volume.

[27:09] Never worked out of that.

[27:10] Somehow that doesn't work.

[27:11] So we were priced the games.

[27:13] I mean, you were running 10 cent games or something.

[27:16] Two games for quarter, five balls of games.

[27:18] Oh, wow.

[27:19] That was our, we were, we were insistent that that was the only way pinball should ever be priced.

[27:24] And then to bring in business on our slow days, Monday through Wednesday, we set all the video games at two games for quarter.

[27:33] Oh my gosh, really.

[27:34] And then we, but this is during Pac-Man AI, would think you'd be making money hand over fifths.

[27:39] Again, we made an awful lot of money, but we had really high expenses from borrowing all this money.

[27:45] Right.

[27:46] And let's see.

[27:49] To bring our original location was a real, you know, out of the way and we didn't have enough money for a sign.

[27:54] So that's kind of running joke.

[27:55] You had to look for the building without a sign to know where we were.

[28:00] And so to bring in food customers during lunch, we decided to run a special where you get a free drink with lunch.

[28:07] And our reasoning was it costs us almost nothing.

[28:11] I mean, a couple of pennies plus the cup cost more than the syrup.

[28:14] So we're giving way almost nothing and bringing in customers.

[28:17] But that's of course the wrong way to look at it.

[28:19] What we were giving away was the single highest profit item in our entire restaurant.

[28:23] Right.

[28:24] So just, you know, on and on, stuff like that.

[28:27] We all learned a lot at the school of hard knocks.

[28:29] And never applied any of it.

[28:31] Because I mean, once we'd started any of this, we didn't want to piss off our customers by taking away the drink special.

[28:36] They'd come to depend on.

[28:38] So we just continue that.

[28:39] So three and a half years of that.

[28:41] Three and a half years?

[28:42] Yeah.

[28:43] And I've heard what games were you running?

[28:45] Pinballs.

[28:46] You know, Black Knight, Lost Turns.

[28:49] We run the games we like.

[28:51] CWitch, Meteor, Stargazer, Nine Ball, Eight Ball Deluxe.

[28:57] We replaced our Playfield and Eight Ball Deluxe twice.

[29:00] Really?

[29:01] You just played Fields Flops?

[29:02] Yeah.

[29:03] Morning, New and Night.

[29:04] It was just played all the time.

[29:05] Of course, it's two games for quarter or five balls game.

[29:06] It got an awful lot of play.

[29:07] I mean, it was making like $100 on a good day.

[29:09] Even at that.

[29:10] $100 is a day.

[29:11] Yeah.

[29:12] You know, Pinball Machine.

[29:13] Right.

[29:14] It's insane.

[29:15] But again, with that kind of pricing, that meant a lot of plays.

[29:17] And so we ran through Playfields.

[29:19] But they were cheap.

[29:20] It just took a weekend to swap them in.

[29:22] Why, what did they do in charge of for a Playfield back then?

[29:25] That's like $100.

[29:26] Right.

[29:27] We had Spy Hunter.

[29:29] It would make $100 a day.

[29:30] We had the video or the Pinball video.

[29:32] Okay.

[29:33] I mean, we had some videos it made.

[29:34] It had a ton of money, too.

[29:35] Right.

[29:36] We had lean-in disks of Tron.

[29:41] You know, the environmental cat.

[29:42] Right.

[29:43] Right.

[29:44] Sit down Spy.

[29:45] Or sit down Star Wars.

[29:46] You know, we had a lot of cool games.

[29:48] Pac-Man, of course.

[29:49] And the whole place lasted, would you say, three and a half years?

[29:52] Yeah.

[29:53] Three and a half years.

[29:54] Basically, you know, it was just sheer will and determination on our part and willing us to work for no money, you know.

[30:02] And everything kept it up.

[30:03] And we finally just, you know, we got tired of it.

[30:05] We just couldn't take it anymore.

[30:07] And so all four of you just decided you just early on, one of us, a day for no, decided to go back to Louisiana and become an accountant or something.

[30:16] So, you know, we sort of bought him out.

[30:18] He was the smart one.

[30:19] He was the smart one, yeah.

[30:21] So, somewhere in the middle of all that, I designed my own video game.

[30:28] You designed your own video game.

[30:30] Yeah.

[30:31] I completely reverse engineered the Williams video game hardware, like Stargate, Robotron, era.

[30:36] And then bought a used Robotron and Stargate dirt cheap, one to use as a development platform in home and one to put the game in the store with.

[30:44] And it took about a year, but I wrote Alien Arena from scratch.

[30:48] And how did that go?

[30:49] It sucked.

[30:50] It was pretty bad.

[30:52] We had a couple customers loved it to death.

[30:54] But one of the biggest problems was I like developing code in the dark.

[31:00] I don't like ambient light on my screen.

[31:02] So, what looked really good to me in my little cave at home, you get it in the, you know, sun and overhead lights of the arcade and you can even see it.

[31:11] I mean, I just chosen all the wrong colors.

[31:13] And it's not just a matter of turning up the brightness.

[31:15] I mean, it needed a total redo on the colors.

[31:17] So, that was tough.

[31:19] And do you have the code for that game still?

[31:21] Yeah.

[31:22] Can we run it in main?

[31:23] Yeah, it's in main.

[31:24] Oh, it is.

[31:25] Yeah.

[31:26] At some point, I'm going to release the source for it.

[31:27] But it's, again, it's all kind of trapped on Apple II floppies.

[31:30] And I've got it, I've got it off textually, but I'm trying to get it to compile in a newer assembler before I release it.

[31:37] Huh.

[31:38] And it still had some issues too.

[31:40] Like what kind of issues?

[31:41] Well, it, it had a working high score table, but for some reason the code that's in the game now doesn't and I can't figure out why.

[31:50] And when you put this together, were you actually using an assembler at this time?

[31:55] Yeah, I did buy a 68 on assembler for the apple.

[31:59] Okay, so you were actually assembling it on the apple.

[32:01] Right.

[32:02] And, but again, I had to assemble it in chunks and loaded in chunks.

[32:05] And, you know, I felt hardwarded, downline loaded to RAM in the game.

[32:09] Really?

[32:10] Yeah.

[32:11] So you could program it on the apple and load it into your developmental machine.

[32:16] Yeah.

[32:17] And that they were somehow connected.

[32:18] Yeah.

[32:19] I built a card to go in the apple and a card to go on the machine.

[32:22] Where did you come up with all, you know, I mean to do that is obviously not that easy.

[32:26] Words your electronics background other than making that heat kit TV.

[32:29] Self-taught.

[32:30] Self-taught.

[32:31] Just bought, you know, books on logic chips and sorted out how it all worked.

[32:34] Huh.

[32:35] Okay.

[32:36] Man.

[32:37] You've had a lot of free time.

[32:39] I used to, you used to have a lot of free time.

[32:41] And then by the time I wanted to release Alien Arena to the world years later, you know, I had kids and stuff.

[32:49] I've just never had the time since.

[32:51] Although here I am taking back last pictures six hours from my house.

[32:55] Maybe I should be doing that instead.

[32:58] Oh, I know another problem.

[33:01] Years ago, just before I moved up to Chicago, I sent the code Rick Sheevey to program into ROMs and run a granite at one of his game nights.

[33:11] And discovered that I'd forgotten I had cut the watchdog circuit for development.

[33:20] Obviously you can't have the watchdog when you're halting the game and stuff.

[33:24] I had never written code to service the watchdog.

[33:27] It just had to occur to me.

[33:29] I hadn't done that.

[33:30] So he threw this game in a stock system and it's just resetting constantly.

[33:35] So he had to go cut the same little trace to make it work.

[33:38] Huh.

[33:39] So that's something I really need to add to it.

[33:41] That's a point.

[33:42] Alright.

[33:43] Alright.

[33:44] Interesting.

[33:45] Alright.

[33:46] So now what is this program?

[33:47] What year does this bring us up to when you close Professor Feathers?

[33:50] It was open from January of 82 to October of 85.

[33:54] Okay.

[33:55] So that was kind of a move this game.

[33:58] So you know, we just, we basically yes, caught one of the first big downturns in the video game industry.

[34:03] You did.

[34:04] And how did that go?

[34:05] Well, you know, you saw what happened.

[34:06] We were in this constant cycle of not having enough money to buy new games and having to borrow money to buy new games and so on and so on.

[34:13] You know, more of our perfect timing.

[34:15] Right.

[34:16] Oh, I, again, more of the young and idealistic stuff.

[34:19] The city of Schultzville instituted a Meals tax to pay for this Taj Mahal Convention Center that they all wanted and no one else did.

[34:29] And it's just a whole bunch of weird politics.

[34:32] It was just a complete scam and they're putting it all in the backs of the local hotels and restaurants, which is completely unfair.

[34:39] And all the people that decided this owned property near where this thing was that would all go up and value.

[34:45] So anyway, to protest that, we refused to charge Meals tax.

[34:48] It was a 3% Meals tax.

[34:51] Hmm.

[34:52] Wouldn't charge it.

[34:53] Well, eventually, you know, they got aftress, obviously.

[34:56] And then eventually we always had to pay it.

[34:58] But we just, we always made them take it down to the line.

[35:00] We basically met them in court each month.

[35:02] Right.

[35:03] To pay our, that, that month's Meals tax.

[35:05] But that means we were eating another 3% of our potential profit because we were very shortening it.

[35:11] But that was, that was just us.

[35:14] Okay, so it's 85 in the arcade closed because you guys weren't making enough money to really make this work or your job.

[35:21] Right.

[35:22] So we basically, you know, walked away from it for its debts or whatever.

[35:27] I mean, we got some Greek guy that basically take it over, he turned it into a pizza restaurant.

[35:33] Now, when you were selling food, who came up with a menu for the food and who was doing the cook and...

[35:38] Well, we all, we all did, it was subs.

[35:40] Yeah, and subs, subs and fast food.

[35:42] No fries because that would have involved expensive, you know, extinguisher hood and stuff.

[35:47] Right, right.

[35:48] So yeah, it was just, you know, and it was great.

[35:50] I mean, we encouraged people to eat while they play.

[35:52] We had a huge lunch crowd.

[35:53] Businessmen would come in.

[35:54] We had tables, you know, that set at a nice height out by the machines.

[35:58] And then, you know, four of them would play a four player game and all eat while the one guy is playing.

[36:02] And it was great.

[36:04] They loved it.

[36:05] They were very, very sad when we closed.

[36:07] And that wouldn't be.

[36:09] Yeah.

[36:10] So, or was I, oh yeah, so he turned it into a pizza restaurant when we walked away and that lasted a couple more years.

[36:15] And did he buy all the games from you too?

[36:17] No, no.

[36:18] The IRS got all the games from us.

[36:21] The IRS did?

[36:22] Well, right.

[36:23] I mean, we were perpetually behind, you know, when you don't have enough money to pay all your bills.

[36:29] Right?

[36:30] One of those bills you might not pay is the IRS that withholding.

[36:34] You're right.

[36:35] You're right.

[36:36] And you don't pay that because you never had it.

[36:38] But the IRS says, no, you had it and you took it away from your employees.

[36:42] And we're like, no, really, we never had it.

[36:44] We don't care.

[36:45] You know, you, you always have that money.

[36:46] That's very evil of you not to have given us that money.

[36:48] So, we were, you know, in a constant state with them, always paying off stuff.

[36:52] So, when we closed, they were real keen on, you know, recovering that as much as they could with assets.

[36:58] And then once we closed, they were the nicest people in the world.

[37:03] You know, we were the IRS.

[37:04] I mean, they worked out a payment plan.

[37:05] I mean, once it was this.

[37:06] How long were you paying off this thing after a couple years?

[37:09] Were you really?

[37:10] Yeah.

[37:11] And were all of you were just you?

[37:12] Well, some of us more than others, yeah.

[37:14] I took a lot of it.

[37:15] So, you know, they got real nice.

[37:17] At that point, we're obviously not some ongoing scam trying to take money from them.

[37:24] We're just some guys that owe them some money and they were real nice.

[37:29] So, where was I again?

[37:32] Oh, yeah, the machines went there.

[37:33] So, he got some route operator to put in games and everything.

[37:35] So, we all went our separate ways.

[37:37] Dave, for now, had already become an accountant, I think, down in Louisiana that that was years ago.

[37:43] Greg went and became the manager of a food line grocery store in the N Charlesville.

[37:50] Hercules eventually became manager of Bodo's bagels in Charlottesville.

[37:56] And then eventually started his own bagel restaurant down in the Norfolk Virginia area.

[38:02] So, he's still in the food industry, I guess.

[38:06] You still talk to these people?

[38:07] Yeah.

[38:08] Herk had this weird brain fungus a bunch of years ago.

[38:13] Yeah, he caught some weird disease.

[38:15] And he was in the hospital for a while and has weird missing parts of his memory.

[38:20] He doesn't remember Dunkin' Brown?

[38:21] Well, he does.

[38:22] But then eventually his email address stopped working and his stores either disappeared or moved.

[38:28] I mean, no one's been able to find him.

[38:31] Find him.

[38:32] It's not like we've driven down to Norfolk to look.

[38:35] But he just kind of, I mean, I'll track him down again.

[38:39] So, I think he's going to be able to find him.

[38:42] I'll track him down again.

[38:45] So, I went to work at Comdyle of telephone manufacturer there in Charlottesville.

[38:53] In their, basically repair facility.

[38:56] But one thing they needed, they had just come out with this new key system product,

[39:00] you know, a system that runs a whole bunch of phones.

[39:02] It's like a PBX but smaller.

[39:05] And they were having a whole bunch of field returns, failures, warranty problems.

[39:08] And they really needed someone to troubleshoot what the heck was going on.

[39:11] And they tasked the repair facility with doing that.

[39:14] Right at the same time, I'm applying for a job there because a friend of mine works there.

[39:18] And I'm obviously this great troubleshooter and they're like,

[39:21] you know, you can get him for nothing and you know, he'll do all this work.

[39:24] So, I did that and you know, I went to the meetings every week where they were trying to decide all this stuff.

[39:28] You know, I'm the representative from the repair department.

[39:31] And I'm in the meeting with like the heads of all these other departments.

[39:34] And I'm just, I'm literally like this solder gun jockey from the repair department

[39:39] who's also keeping track of the warranty stuff and going to the meeting.

[39:42] And they had no idea.

[39:44] I mean, they like one time I was talking about, you know, this connector

[39:47] that was always getting mangled and what a pain it was to replace it.

[39:51] You know, it's like 40 pins worth of desiring and soldering.

[39:54] And I was like, don't you have a girl that do that?

[39:57] You know, they thought I was just some, you know, manager engineer back there

[40:01] who had little people to do all the actual soldering and desiring.

[40:04] No, I'm not only doing this but I'm repairing 300 other phones a week

[40:08] and I'm going to keep my quotas up here.

[40:10] They just had no idea.

[40:11] But so eventually I actually warmed my way into the engineering department there

[40:15] and was helping design and prototype all these phone systems.

[40:19] And how long did you do that?

[40:22] I must have been, I don't know, these years aren't going to all add up.

[40:27] But it must have been at least three years.

[40:31] And then an old friend of mine who was actually my RA at college

[40:36] was running a bunch of the computer systems and stuff

[40:41] at this little startup data processing company there in Charlottesville.

[40:45] And actually my wife, by that point, she was already my wife,

[40:48] was working there doing various things.

[40:51] And you know, he said they, now that they're expanding,

[40:54] they really needed someone to take over all the computer management.

[40:57] They had a VACX 11785 in the basement of this house, you know,

[41:00] this little startup company, but they were expanding.

[41:03] So I went there and became, you know, eventually,

[41:06] I don't remember what my title eventually was,

[41:08] but I mean they got fairly big and I was like, you know,

[41:11] manager of worldwide operations or something.

[41:14] And you know, we bought computers and all these sites and expanded all this stuff.

[41:18] And I did that for seven years.

[41:23] And eventually, you know, they were getting big, which was fine.

[41:27] I mean, when I started there, you know, I was like employee 15 or something.

[41:31] And it was, everybody was all pitching in and making this company work.

[41:35] And as they got bigger, we were still, you know, kind of had that whole, you know,

[41:39] camaraderie going, but they got in a guy in there and XG,

[41:41] a guy who, you know, wanted to take the thing public and, you know,

[41:45] just make lots of money that way.

[41:47] It was no longer about the job.

[41:49] It's all about making the balance sheet look right and stuff.

[41:52] And just he was, you know, all kinds of reasons it was getting very unpleasant to work there.

[41:57] So I, you know, other places that ran back to around town,

[42:02] BMS, you know, I started asking around to them and a place called GE Fanick.

[42:06] It's a joint venture between GE and a Japanese company called Fanick.

[42:10] They really needed someone to run their, some of their computer systems,

[42:15] but also their phone system.

[42:17] And we had, by that time, gotten a big phone system at the place I was

[42:20] and same kind they were about to buy.

[42:22] So I knew all about that.

[42:24] So they hired me on there to do that.

[42:26] And I ended up, you know, lots and lots of systems, installations there

[42:30] as they got bigger and stuff.

[42:31] And when I eventually left there, it actually took three people to replace me.

[42:35] But, you know, but so I was very happy there and doing quite well.

[42:39] But then I had gone to Wild West Pinball Fest in 1996 out in Arizona with my wife.

[42:45] So these are the 90s where up to now.

[42:47] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[42:48] Okay.

[42:49] You know, I got out there to Arizona, dangerous Dan, you know,

[42:52] great time, you know, wrists or by the end.

[42:55] But this whole time you were still playing Pinball.

[42:58] Oh yeah.

[42:59] Did you own any?

[43:00] Well, there was a period after Professor Feathers where I was really dirt poor

[43:04] and scrambling to even survive.

[43:06] When you own a business that's not paying you any money,

[43:11] but it's a restaurant.

[43:13] Hey, you eat for free.

[43:15] Yeah, you eat for free.

[43:16] Now don't tell the IRS that.

[43:17] They probably want to account for all that.

[43:19] But again, you're never going to actually starve and die in that.

[43:21] Right.

[43:22] We could look at this.

[43:23] But then once I stopped doing that, then there was always, you know,

[43:25] the fear of starving and dying.

[43:26] I mean, it was tough.

[43:27] So it was tough.

[43:28] I mean, so yeah, the idea of having enough money and room and time to own a Pinball machine

[43:33] didn't happen again for several years, but probably into the early 90s.

[43:37] Right.

[43:38] And then I started collecting video games and Pinballs again.

[43:42] So anyway, I'm quite happy at GE, but I go out to Wild West Pinball Fest.

[43:46] And there had been this whole thing where a safe cracker had recently come out.

[43:50] And you know, I've been posting the wreck games pinball at that point and everything.

[43:53] And they had, when did you start on the wreck games pinball thing early 90s, right?

[43:56] Yeah.

[43:57] You could probably find out.

[43:58] Yeah.

[43:59] Google my first post there somewhere.

[44:01] But I actually started out on RGBAC and then eventually on the video game side.

[44:07] Yeah.

[44:08] Right.

[44:09] So there had been this thing where they had all the speech calls from safe cracker or a lot of them on their website.

[44:16] But they had paid some company to do this whole website.

[44:19] And so there was a speech call that said tokens the Stuff Dreams or Mata.

[44:24] But the link for it, the company that had done this, had listened to the speech call and written a link as Duncan's the Stuff Dreams or Mata.

[44:32] Which I thought was, you know, appropriate of course.

[44:35] Of course on the Stuff Dreams or Mata, but it seemed really awesome.

[44:37] When they posted this, I posted to the Pinball News Group.

[44:39] You know, what is that supposed to say?

[44:41] I didn't know what it was supposed to be tokens.

[44:43] And I guess, you know, Larry DeMar had seen that and laughed and everything.

[44:48] So when he saw my name tag out of Wild West Pinball Fest, he introduced himself.

[44:52] Oh, hi.

[44:53] And by the way, just Larry DeMar was head of Pinball at Williams.

[44:57] Right.

[44:58] Right.

[44:59] Right.

[45:00] And he had seen, I guess, posts over the years where I had, you know, reverse engineered the very code he had been writing years before in Stargate and Robicon.

[45:07] So I guess they had kind of noticed me that way.

[45:10] Unbeknownst to you.

[45:11] Unbeknownst to me.

[45:12] And so, you know, I talked him there and we got along real great and everything.

[45:16] And then I don't know what it was.

[45:18] I guess it was maybe six or eight months later.

[45:21] I had posted something to the Pinball News Group looking for a ROM that I didn't have.

[45:25] And Ted Estee's actually emailed me the binary I needed.

[45:29] It was some sound ROM.

[45:30] And at the end of his email, he said, oh, by the way, if you're ever looking for a job,

[45:34] let me know.

[45:35] And Ted Estee's actually took over Larry's position.

[45:37] Right.

[45:38] So now Ted is head of Pinball, he's head of the Pinball programmers at Williams.

[45:42] Right.

[45:43] And also slot machines.

[45:44] And slot machines, right.

[45:45] The simultaneous, the mechanical slot machines.

[45:48] Not the video slots.

[45:49] Right.

[45:50] Because they were trying to infuse some creativity into this new product they were coming out with.

[45:55] And they thought, oh, let's throw them in with the Pinball programmers.

[45:58] Right.

[45:59] Which actually created all kinds of friction between the people that came from the slot department.

[46:05] It was an interesting scenario.

[46:09] So I wrote him back and said, man, if you'd asked me that 15 years ago, I'd already been your doorstep before the electrons had dried on my screen.

[46:16] But I got mortgage and mortgage.

[46:18] But I said, it's not that I'm not interested.

[46:20] But it's just way more complicated.

[46:22] So we kept talking.

[46:23] And eventually they had me up there for an interview.

[46:26] And my wife really, she'd been in Charlottesville for 20 years and really liked everything.

[46:31] And had moved from the office to the office.

[46:34] And she was like, oh, I'm sorry.

[46:36] I'm sorry.

[46:37] I'm sorry.

[46:38] I'm sorry.

[46:39] I'm sorry.

[46:40] I'm sorry.

[46:41] I'm sorry.

[46:42] I'm sorry.

[46:43] I'm sorry.

[46:44] I'm sorry.

[46:45] I'm sorry.

[46:46] That it worked...

[46:49] Because I wanted to have funny pictures over there.

[46:52] She said, oh, I really ended up being her roommate open.

[46:56] And yeah.

[46:58] But within many months, together almost frequently we cried together and my dad was great.

[47:03] We also keeled out

[47:09] and had beautiful children.

[47:10] And Sharks decided to apologize for big greets.

[47:13] maybe they could offer me a little more money and you know we eventually worked it out

[47:17] I was like yeah you know I really got to do this I mean it just seemed like destiny

[47:21] every all these weird things I've done through my life that had just been yeah no reason at all

[47:27] designing my own pinball machine design my own game at all it's obviously pointing towards this

[47:32] my destiny right I went up there and did that and the way they stuck me in they didn't have any

[47:36] pinball openings but they had an opening for a slot programmer and they especially needed someone

[47:42] reverse engineering skills because you're looking at IGT code or something well a machine

[47:48] that should prove that IGT's patent was invalid as long as how they thought it worked really

[47:54] was how it worked but they needed someone who could figure out how it worked and did you I did

[47:58] and it was but it was kind of by the time they thought of that the judge was so pissed at them

[48:03] that he wasn't willing to listen to any more of his words yeah why was he pissed at William

[48:07] because he thought they were just had were obviously ripping off his patent this judge

[48:12] well wait you should back up what the IGT was suing Williams over mechanical slots right

[48:17] correct right because it was it was infringing on what was that and the teleness patent

[48:22] which telness basically a way of mapping a large number of numbers so that you can get

[48:28] fine gradiation of the odds to a smaller number of physical stops on the wheels so in other words

[48:36] you have say 22 stops on the wheels and to normally it's one out of 22 shot I mean

[48:41] historically each symbol has an equal probability but telness you know had this amazing idea

[48:49] you know what if we simply said you know you have 500 numbers to choose from and we'll put in

[48:56] you know a couple of one symbol so that's a one out of two 50 shot and a whole bunch of another

[49:02] and we just once we decide what symbol based on that big huge set of numbers and we just map it

[49:08] to the equivalent physical thing on the wheel so it's a way to get really long odds on wheels

[49:14] and Williams did rip this off from IGT no basically when telness invented that patent it was telling

[49:21] this just some guy okay his name is his last name's telness right when he does thought of that it

[49:29] was not legal I mean if you had 22 stops there had to be a one out of 22 shot this idea of

[49:35] there being different odds was kind of considered cheating I mean right in other words if you made a

[49:40] real with 500 stops on it the cabinet would be you know two stories tall and you'd go oh my god

[49:47] look at that huge real right you know way I'm ever going to get that jackpot so yeah so this

[49:52] this was kind of this misdirection that but anyway the the idea of creating odds like that

[50:00] long odds for things was incredibly well known I mean it was not unique in the idea of

[50:06] probabilities or math or anything but somehow I got a patent on it and basically you know this

[50:14] this very well known idea as applied to slot machine right becomes this patentable idea so

[50:19] one thing Williams was looking at is this old you know well not even gray market it was like

[50:25] illegal slot machine where they got around the laws that said you can't have a game with reels

[50:30] by using those little elevator things where you rear project a symbol oh right right um

[50:38] that's what they were doing this this other company back in the 60s in winter or 70s um it must

[50:43] been 70s yeah they would they use three of those to project some you know they replaced the one two

[50:48] three four strip inside this thing with the you know cherries and or something so it was you

[50:55] know it was this quasi legal game but you know looking at the pay table they had to be doing something

[51:00] like that for the odds and which I proved they actually were but it was too late so anyway

[51:04] Williams came up with a completely different way to do long odds you know wasn't this look up in a

[51:11] table thing tell us was doing um but in their wisdom they decided they wanted to hold you know

[51:17] they they got the venue change to Chicago figuring they'd have a friendly judge instead of Nevada

[51:22] where they understand slot machines right so they got a judge who didn't understand slot machines

[51:27] didn't really understand how patents worked because his line of thinking was if somebody does

[51:33] gets a result and somebody else gets the same result they must be violating the patent

[51:40] you know regardless of how they got there it's like how they got there's the whole point of the

[51:45] patent you're right it's like driving to Chicago through Detroit or driving to Chicago through

[51:51] St. Louis you know you're both getting to Chicago but two different ways right and he's saying no

[51:56] you and it basically he's like you know you guys with your slick lawyers are trying to pull a fast

[52:01] one on me here you know they brought slot machines to court and charts and you know it just none of

[52:06] had any impression on him he was convinced so by the time they came up with this just irrefutable

[52:10] evidence of prior art in a slot machine for this idea that wasn't patented because it was illegal

[52:17] you know it was too late and what was the outcome and what Williams have to do Williams basically

[52:22] had to stop doing slot machines with long odds I mean they had to do you know however many

[52:28] stops that's their odds and you can't give big jackpots that way so their machines are as exciting

[52:32] ironically that forced Williams to concentrate more on video slot machines where igt wasn't

[52:40] doing anything right where they could do long odds because the patent was written to talk about

[52:45] reals physical reals right and they added in the dash of Williams humor and creativity and stuff

[52:51] you know with filthy rich and what was that they had won a fishing game it was real real man

[53:02] real real pocket and just started eating igt's lunch I mean eventually you're right because of that

[53:09] so it's just interesting that yeah igt forced them into another into another corner which they excel

[53:14] yes and to which they could actually compete very well right as the industry was in any of that

[53:19] moving from physical reals to video right never it'll never happen completely but right you know

[53:25] so that was just interesting so anyway i got in there working on the spending reals did a bunch of

[53:29] stuff but also you know were you there during their operating system dilemma here in Detroit

[53:36] the some guy found a way right now it's after that was after okay okay do you know anything about

[53:42] the history of that just the the operating system they had was not very well written i mean it was

[53:46] one of these things were wrote it i don't even know but it was one of these things where some engineers

[53:52] had kind of thrown this together so that you get to a trade show and show off this proof of concept

[53:59] and it was a huge hit the trade show and the marketing people all came back and said okay let's

[54:03] start shipping it you know and so it just it got worse from there it had kind of a bad not

[54:09] completely thought out history by the time i got there they'd actually taken the original same

[54:14] source code and split it into video and spending real and they were going off down their separate

[54:19] paths all right so i was doing the spending real stuff and other people were doing the video stuff

[54:26] and i don't even know which i think was the video that had those issues in Detroit it was the

[54:30] double up thing right i don't remember the exact thing i think if you somehow you could put a bill

[54:34] in and hit some sequence and all that was different yeah that was another thing that was another

[54:37] thing yeah that they had several things all really now did you know anything about that one no

[54:42] again that was all after after after you were out what i did know was while i was fixing code in

[54:47] the spinning real slots for Delaware who has these really weird online system restrictions where

[54:53] all the machines are controlled by a master central system so for instance the casinos have to close

[54:59] it i don't know 1am or 2am or something and by golly they do they're not going to depend on each

[55:05] you know race track manager coming in and shutting down the central system kills it

[55:09] caches it out right right at the time so there were always all these weird you know you got to keep

[55:14] track of time things and they always had weird bugs with daylight savings time and stuff so i got

[55:19] in there to fix the daylight saving stuff because Williams kept fixing it in spring only to have it

[55:24] break and fall right right right so i fixed all that i looked at that i was like yeah you know there's

[55:29] you got this horrible problem coming up on year 2000 and it's totally not going to handle that right

[55:34] this thing totally blows up on the year 2000 because they're only doing two digits and weren't handling

[55:39] it and it's just going to go completely wrong and in fact the the system we had to test with

[55:45] was it didn't even handle it correctly but i had to kind of dope out that this is what it would do

[55:49] if i had a system that did work it's not going to work so i fixed that and told you know we had

[55:54] these weekly conference calls with Delaware i told him yeah you know it's you need to fix your

[55:59] tools and i fixed our code and everybody else probably i'll look at this too you know igt's in on

[56:03] the conference call everybody who's there so i fixed that and as far as i knew it was in but come

[56:08] to find out they had fixed it and sent it to Delaware and made all the chips but had never kind of

[56:13] gotten around putting them in the slot machine this was two years i mean this was quite a while

[56:19] before i left Williams yeah because i was still doing slots it was over two years they've been

[56:23] sitting there and never done anything so after pinball shut down and i at the time i just started

[56:28] working at lad i hear on the radio yeah only seven things in the whole u.s actually failed in

[56:33] y2k and one of them was William slot machines in Delaware they all croaked right at the stroke of

[56:38] midnight and they had to rush out there and get all these chips in which in Delaware is really

[56:43] you know you got to have a cop stand in there when you change chips right right right so from the

[56:47] gaming commission has to see right and they they have a thing called a cobatron that matches what

[56:51] it's way more involved than a checksum but it's basically checksumming the chip right so for every

[56:56] machine this whole squad of people has to go yeah so it was a huge fiasco so while i'm doing all this

[57:03] slot stuff i'm tally around with all the pinball guys because you're really trying to get in at

[57:08] Williams into the pinball division right and not the slot machine right so i'm doing my job and

[57:12] i'm also you know learning everything i can about pinball and and just you know immersing myself in

[57:17] that so then when pinball 2000 starts you know they start working on that and they're going to

[57:27] rearrange things and maybe hire a couple people i'm like yeah you're raising your hand yeah and then

[57:34] you know there was also some re-shopping going on with the slot departments again need the lights

[57:38] again yeah i'll probably need them on and off between each machine um basically they were taking slots

[57:47] back away from pinball again okay because at the time just to give it pinball was financing the

[57:53] slot machine development right oh yeah i mean slot machines were losing money big time and pinball

[57:58] was the company making money and there's the whole thing with spinning off midway too which

[58:04] happened in that time well what was the spinning off of midway what do you mean by that they

[58:08] decided it was Williams Valley midway they did video games spin machine slot machines they did

[58:13] everything and they decided they wanted to make midway a separate company why um well frankly to

[58:23] make people money you know what do you mean by spinning midway off as a separate company people

[58:32] in positions of power at Williams Valley midway could make lots of money the stock split and the

[58:39] buyouts of contracts and you know maybe there was some reason they gave the shareholders that

[58:46] even made sense or might even been real about why that would be a good thing i mean historically

[58:51] Williams had always done all these different things you know if pinball was down maybe bumper pulls

[58:56] where they made their money but i mean they were always very diversified and making different stuff

[59:00] so that no matter which industry goes up or down they'd always stay open and start splitting that

[59:04] apart kind of lose that so for some reason pinball and slot machines stayed together in midway

[59:12] went off on its own separate company um and this is about the time you know the video slots are

[59:17] starting to make some money and so the slot machine division is actually starting to make money

[59:21] whereas pinball is starting to not make money and then what year is this about eighty ninety eight ninety

[59:26] seven is when i came there so you know ninety eight yeah um so you know pinball is going to try to

[59:31] reverse its fortunes with pinball two thousand everybody's really excited about it and were you

[59:36] in pinball two thousand right from the get go not the early early stuff that was kind of being

[59:42] developed as a side project no but then about the time they decided to midway had been spun off

[59:48] and they decided to take slots and pinball and totally separate them again you know i was going

[59:54] to have to go with slot people over the slot building and not be able to sit with all my pinball

[59:59] friends anymore you know you're going to California Avenue right well they're both well ones on

[01:00:05] whatever that side street is kids here something but um so i mean they're just right across the street

[01:00:12] from each other or even beside each other but yeah i mean i wouldn't be sitting in with all the pinball

[01:00:17] guys right um so i'm very eager to get one of the couple of slots open on uh

[01:00:25] for jobs on pinball two thousand and so i mean you know the running joke was i was telling Larry

[01:00:30] you know like waxes car every day and they you know they just had some other people as much as

[01:00:36] they liked me some other people they thought would be a better fit we're going to hire them but

[01:00:40] fortunately for me that all didn't work out and i like it the last minute before i was going to have

[01:00:45] to go to my doom in the slot department um they ended up taking me and i got on the

[01:00:53] star wars episode one team with Cameron and John pop it up well and in some machines what

[01:00:57] what what what environment were you programming it it was 80 80 you know sorry 81 80 80 or 81

[01:01:05] eight seven right yeah and then um one thing i did they had that dot matrix assembly in the top

[01:01:11] of their slot machines that that ran on a seven slot nation is like dot nation dot nation sorry

[01:01:16] dot nation slot machine would have been a much cooler word yeah they should have used that um

[01:01:22] so that was running on like a 68 hc 12 or something so i was doing all that to a rewrite of that

[01:01:28] for the new version of the hardware so i was doing a lot of stuff um but then uh so i started

[01:01:35] you know i got my chance at pinball two thousand and then at the same time they were trying to

[01:01:40] bring this whole system up in addition to the games and time you've been really needed someone

[01:01:46] weird bits and bytes to be able to get the thing to boot off a pc motherboard without the things

[01:01:52] like complaining about lack of keyboard or showing a bios screen right right so you know they looked

[01:01:58] at buying a bios that they could have and you know the licensing costs for that are extreme stuff so

[01:02:05] i sat down and figured out how to make boot runs that would make all that happen now how come in

[01:02:10] pinball two thousand though you don't i mean you're using the the boot runs i assume we're in

[01:02:15] the prison part right but so they're not actually on the motherboard right in other words how do

[01:02:19] you take a motherboard that has standard off the shelf bios right is trying very hard to boot into

[01:02:26] windows because that's what it does what it does yeah and make it not do that and do everything we

[01:02:33] want it to do and also make it not look ugly while it's doing it i mean i don't know if you've

[01:02:37] seen games out there i think even i'm not sure if they're still doing it but some early

[01:02:41] Williams slot machines where they switched the Linux i mean you get this ugly bios screen up there

[01:02:46] for a couple of seconds but you got rid of all that we made all that not happen and that was all

[01:02:50] you're doing yeah i mean time you've been help get me down the path but then he had other stuff to do

[01:02:55] so he left me alone to get me that and then we worked together to put it all integrated with

[01:02:59] the rest of the stuff that had to go into prison runs but yeah so i had in one language was that all

[01:03:05] that was in basically 8088 assembly because i mean that early in the bios you have to be basically

[01:03:10] stuff and bytes in in no places in known orders you can't you see or anything right really had to be

[01:03:17] all the hand coded right that really early stuff and then we jumped in to see if the

[01:03:21] early stuff opportunity but that i just that's my favorite error of all time on pc's keyboard error

[01:03:30] press f1 to continue because you can keyboard it's the stupidest error message

[01:03:37] yep we got around all that and then i had to keep doing that every time we change motherboards

[01:03:44] i had to just tweak that code to be able to also work with the new motherboard right um well now

[01:03:50] have you heard about the guys that have now come up with a pinball 2000 emulation package i've

[01:03:56] heard about that they're like showing it on a regular pc like out of prism card right and you know

[01:04:03] and and you know they're they got it all working too right you know so is that a plus more power

[01:04:09] to it i'm very impressed you are impressed yeah okay okay i mean it wasn't like Williams wanted to

[01:04:15] make sure collectors in the future couldn't have motherboards i mean we yeah idea was as each new

[01:04:21] motherboard would come out we took the code and it would work on all the motherboards right you just

[01:04:26] know you'd buy whatever the latest one wasn't we'd have already adapted it to work and they shut us down

[01:04:31] after two games we never got a chance to do that i was working on the next motherboard when we shut down

[01:04:36] right right right right well anyway so what and and you get and you're like king of the conspiracy

[01:04:42] theory guy right that one that went okay you're king of the conspiracy theories and Williams

[01:04:47] well i used to be you have calm down a little bit you've calmed down a little bit can't you talk about

[01:04:52] anymore you know you have to ask yourself why the absolute leader in the pinball industry just

[01:05:01] run away leader in the pinball industry who had all the talent all the patents all the creativity

[01:05:08] would just turn off the switch right you know they thought they weren't making enough money

[01:05:15] at pinball and they were making more in slots and you know forget 50 years of Harry Williams

[01:05:21] history that you know it's hard cold business they just you know right they don't want to be in that

[01:05:26] position but there was some serious value to what they were sitting on and they literally threw it

[01:05:32] away i mean they just turned off the switch and threw it all in the dumpster and they eventually got

[01:05:36] you know troops and drabs of money from various people but nothing you know selling that

[01:05:42] out you know perceived loss at a fire sale price as a running operation would have made

[01:05:48] them so much more money than they ended up making plus kept some people employed kept you know

[01:05:54] vendors in business a lot of vendors went under right people that stamped metal and made plastics and

[01:06:00] rubber ring all these people just all of a sudden they're you know their main buyer was gone

[01:06:07] so it just it was it was not a well-plot out decision so you have to ask yourself what was the

[01:06:13] thinking behind it well wasn't well no one knows that's where all this conspiracy theories come

[01:06:17] from right but what were some of the conspiracies that you know the ones that you liked

[01:06:25] you know one has to imagine that perhaps they were just humoring us when they said sure it will

[01:06:31] give pinball 2000 a shot that they just had this plan to shut it down and then one behold pinball

[01:06:37] 2000 was successful at the first profitable quarter in a couple of years this is huge hit and

[01:06:44] well well too bad you know we had planned to shut it down we're going to shut it down so it

[01:06:48] it just made a lot less sense under those circumstances why are you shutting us down when we succeeded

[01:06:54] yeah that was what really hurt in the thing in like with your game with Star Wars

[01:06:59] where they kind of raised the they had all those pre-orders from overseas right and then they

[01:07:04] raised the price and do the exchange they had all these orders canceled right the they they decided

[01:07:10] they had underpriced revenge from Mars yeah I don't know if that's true or not but they had decided

[01:07:16] they made a mistake in pricing so they were going to fix that mistake twice on Star Wars Episode 1

[01:07:23] they would put the price where it ought to be and get back all that money they felt they were

[01:07:28] for all the revenge from Mars by you know I need Star Wars Episode 1 well people were pretty

[01:07:34] price sensitive in general and they were really price sensitive on pinball 2000 because there's a lot

[01:07:38] more money I mean it was a more expensive game right but we sat there and said look here's why you

[01:07:42] know look at all these cool things we've done plus it's a kit you know kitable and all right you

[01:07:47] know it's all this great stuff it's it's really worth more money it's an investment in a platform

[01:07:51] you know and everyone bought it they're like okay you know we'll spend a little more and they bought

[01:07:55] you know thousand but it was like seven thousand more revenge from Mars they didn't sold that

[01:07:59] many of the game it forever right and they were all set you know Star Wars was going to do 10,000

[01:08:04] easing yeah because the pre-orders ran as this big movie was going to be big now obviously the

[01:08:10] movie sucking didn't help either did you know the movie sucked before you saw it no so you guys

[01:08:16] didn't get to see any of that no we got to read the scripts that's it yeah so you didn't know

[01:08:21] Jar Jar was a big bag of nothing now so oh so you had the the price being raised to the point

[01:08:35] where people screamed and took away orders right you also had the fact that they were releasing it

[01:08:42] in the wrong order they always released Europe first always right well the movie was releasing

[01:08:48] in the US first and then Europe so to try to catch the waves of fan excitement right had to

[01:08:54] release it in the other order and they wouldn't they would not do it why so it's just not how they did

[01:08:59] it right so you have all these people in the US excited about Star Wars for about two weeks

[01:09:07] meanwhile the games are shipping over to Europe where no one's ever heard of thing you're seeing

[01:09:11] it and then by the time they released it over here you know the fan excitement's gone I mean

[01:09:17] everybody was thinking oh it's going to be the next Titanic I mean this movie will play for a year

[01:09:21] you know it just didn't happen right there was some excitement and it was you know the movie was okay

[01:09:26] right we're in trouble but it wasn't what it could have been so we just you know missed all the

[01:09:34] opportunities for sale that way right but that isn't really part of the conspiracy is it well no

[01:09:41] just that you know by doing basically everything they did whether intentionally or not

[01:09:47] search to decimate the sales of Star Wars and you think this was potentially on purpose why

[01:09:53] and who knows I mean raising the price to the point it hurt and people cancelling orders and not

[01:09:58] backing down what's the sense of that right you know at some point when they take the orders away

[01:10:05] you gotta say oh well maybe I made a mistake not well screw you you know pay at or you can't have it

[01:10:10] right you know the the line of reasoning was well if we can't sell it for that it's not worth

[01:10:17] being in business but that's a lie we make money under a bit I'm just a price at sold at right

[01:10:24] you know you sure it's not worth selling a product at the loss just to stay in business

[01:10:28] although professor feathers did that but you know at some point

[01:10:35] you know it's you're cutting off your nose despite your face there so who knows

[01:10:40] nobody quite knows so in pinball 2000 in Star Wars I mean were you having fun working there

[01:10:47] yeah you put in like incredible hours yeah yeah it was great I mean best best job I ever had

[01:10:52] oh it was yeah I mean in camera and I you know in offices next to each other it kind of sucked

[01:10:57] um because of all the secret silver yeah right because of the secrecy about the film and we're

[01:11:02] developing this way yeah you're behind a door right so you know we missed out on the camaraderie

[01:11:07] with all our other filmmakers you know we'd only seen them launch or whatever but right and you

[01:11:12] guys really couldn't talk about it I mean they have to sign contracts that basically said if word

[01:11:18] gets out about this movie and it negatively affects what we thought were going to be the take of

[01:11:24] the movie and it was you that let the word out we are going to suit you for the money we think we

[01:11:30] lost so if we think the movie is going to make a hundred million and word leaks out and only makes

[01:11:35] 70 million we're coming after you personally for the 30 million and that's what we sign all right

[01:11:40] to to keep a secret but you know so we got to go to Skywalker Ranch and sit on the porch and read

[01:11:46] the script we couldn't take it with us but we could make notes and stuff and we got you know all the

[01:11:51] the still pictures they take of people and costumes and little snippets of the movie and stuff we

[01:11:55] got access to all that right um I mean we had a lot to work with it I think I think we did a really

[01:12:01] good game I know the the pinball nuts all hate it I mean it's just they don't like the game at all

[01:12:06] but the fact is when we took it to a big Star Wars convention just before the movie opened

[01:12:12] we represented the movie well and the Star Wars people probably they gave it up again it was one

[01:12:18] of those they still make pinball machines and then it's pinball 2000 they hadn't heard of this these

[01:12:23] aren't pinball people they loved it and that movie I was sorry that uh that pinball machine stayed

[01:12:31] at or near the top of the play meter equipment pole for like three years I mean that that earned

[01:12:37] money for operators just again and again again people loved that machine their average player

[01:12:42] loved that machine and that's who we were making it for we were we were not making it for the pros

[01:12:47] right I mean the idea a lot of people's complain about it is all you have to do is keep hitting it

[01:12:52] out the middle just you know keep hitting the ball up the middle it's all you have to do in the game

[01:12:56] where's the fun and that and they're missing the point we made it so that if all you did was hit

[01:13:01] the ball at the middle which is what we saw Cluellis newbies doing right the game would progress and do

[01:13:07] something you've got all you knew how to do is flip the flippers together which sends the ball more

[01:13:11] less up the middle you'd have fun we tried to add stuff you know beyond that which a lot of people

[01:13:17] missed or didn't care enough about but I mean we we tried to make it so that if you knew nothing about

[01:13:22] pinball but like Star Wars you'd have a blast playing the game and I think we were very successful

[01:13:27] so now what about George Gomez George Gomez's complaint about it was you know it was just

[01:13:34] the big movie projector and that Papadouc didn't really you know you're supposed to leave

[01:13:40] black on the edges and Papadouc put colors right to the edge so you could it looked like a TV set

[01:13:47] inside the game what is your absolutely true if yes he's got a complete point now let's look at

[01:13:53] the play meter equipment poles on revenge from Mars versus Star Wars in which one plummeted and

[01:13:58] dropped off the face of the earth that per year and was never seen again earning money for

[01:14:02] operators in which one tickerning money I mean that's that's what we were making right but now

[01:14:09] did was Papadouc I mean proud of this of this game when it all got done and we were all very proud

[01:14:14] the Star Wars people who came to play it you know before we even took it to Denver yeah loved it

[01:14:21] I mean they were just a god of earth they all came to see it at Denver and they all brought all

[01:14:25] their spouses and friends right right right they were just blown away and you know did you get

[01:14:31] to keep a Star Wars yes you did now when you were in the slot machine department you get to keep

[01:14:35] it a slot machine for some odd reason no they don't let it it's not how to war that so you would

[01:14:41] get an engineering copy of the you know of the pinball but they wouldn't give you an engineering

[01:14:47] copy of any slot machine yeah now the way the engineering copy for it just as a yeah point of

[01:14:54] trivia yeah so anyway before we turn on the machines so you know they wanted the people the main

[01:15:02] people that worked on a game to have you know the ability to get one of the games they worked on

[01:15:07] because it's cool which reminds me they knew what made me tick part of hiring me they gave me as

[01:15:13] a signing bonus they gave me a game what'd you get for a signing moment they gave me a couple of

[01:15:18] choices and the one I picked oddly enough was junkyard why oh you gave it away to somebody yeah

[01:15:25] there's a guy I worked with a G.E. Fanick you know his son was just recovering from leukemia bone

[01:15:31] marrow transplants and everything and I thought you know I don't I don't like any of the games

[01:15:35] they're offering me but this one looks like it'd be the most fun for a kid to play so I got that

[01:15:39] and brought it back to Charlottesville gave it back to me it's pretty nice yeah well anyway so you

[01:15:44] didn't get a slot machine huh no no but with the games like the main people that worked on a game

[01:15:50] that would usually get one of the games they worked on then people that worked on a lot of games

[01:15:53] would just basically be in a pool to eventually get a game you know like the dot guys right

[01:15:58] um but if they just gave him a game then the IRS is gonna want you know three thousand

[01:16:04] dollars of income taxable so instead they'd sell you a game right but but if they sold it at a

[01:16:11] huge discount again the IRS is gonna sell all right but so what they did was they take the sample

[01:16:16] games the early route games and stuffy the test games and sell those and just call it engineering

[01:16:21] scrap for like a hundred or two right so then you know you had to pay a little bit of money but

[01:16:26] yeah but you've got a medieval madness for a honor bought right you know or whatever right

[01:16:31] right right right right and how you get you get a lot of games that way well I only worked in one game

[01:16:37] yeah but I it's you to me like I bought what didn't I but okay so wait maybe

[01:16:43] should back up tell you what the last day of work at will you well we've got the the expo I

[01:16:48] remember seeing you an expo you're a real jubilant right when you had Star Wars we had rushed in

[01:16:53] the last week and come out with a swipe card system for the tournaments it was all automated

[01:16:58] you know look at the cool things you can do they're hooked together with eprint right now that

[01:17:01] it's a PC motherboard look at all the stuff we can do you know right we can set this up other people

[01:17:05] can run it you know just be an optional thing you know everybody's having fun expo's great um we

[01:17:12] were done with Star Wars we could move back into the real world now out from behind the closed

[01:17:16] doors so right in the days before ex-boy packed at my whole office and on Monday you know I was

[01:17:21] going to move back to real office and be with everybody else so that Monday or sorry it George

[01:17:27] Gomez an expo he's saying you know doom and gloom we're all like what the hell yeah

[01:17:32] this and well these guys were clueless totally out of left field okay but you know what we're

[01:17:38] Williams you know you got Gary Stern has just bought Stern and you know how could that possibly

[01:17:43] work it's you know they also ran pinball company versus the big he-mith you know what do you

[01:17:47] mean we're gonna go to business right so we get in Monday and they're all these rumors

[01:17:51] flying around you know and Jim Patlow who's now managing a lot of stuff there it's like you know

[01:17:56] don't listen to all this crap you know that he doesn't know where these rumors are coming from as

[01:18:02] long he said that about yeah I really think he didn't I mean no one would do you hear that there

[01:18:06] was a phone call mage Rob Burke at the front desk Williams is closing on Monday you need to know

[01:18:13] this goodbye wow no I hadn't heard that yes yes Burke what was that you believe that this old

[01:18:20] the rumors somebody knew and somebody was trying to spread the word obviously you know you know George

[01:18:27] knew right well now as it turns out talking to him later I guess you know he has friends in various

[01:18:33] parts of the industry you know vendors and things and and Williams is shopping around you know

[01:18:40] mildly shopping around how you want to buy a pinball company to these people right they didn't go

[01:18:44] to any he again part of the conspiracy theory they didn't go to anybody that would actually want

[01:18:48] or be capable of buying the company they just went to bit players so they could say and try to sell

[01:18:54] the company right so George's here from all these friends hey they're trying to sell your company so

[01:18:58] to him the writing's on wall oh none of these people are gonna buy it so they're just gonna shut it

[01:19:03] down that's so that's where that came from but again none of us knew me that that's why he knew

[01:19:07] and we didn't got you so Monday rumors flying around you know there's a meeting at 1030 you know

[01:19:12] there's not you know what there's all these strange rumors and then I was back in the art

[01:19:18] department and this was the day they were gonna go out to like this is tag the silk screening place

[01:19:26] yeah it made playfields right and start talking about what colors they're gonna use for wizard blocks

[01:19:32] right you know y'all see some sketches they're gonna take those out there and you know get their

[01:19:38] pantone charts out and they're like so they're all scheduled to go out there and you know tag

[01:19:45] I guess they talked to tago you know once we come out and the people tags at all you know

[01:19:51] Williams purchasing or somebody called us and said we're not supposed to talk to you till after your

[01:19:55] meeting we're like what meeting you know nobody has told us about any meeting but now our vendors

[01:20:01] notice something's up and we've done and sure enough at 10 our access card stop working our computer

[01:20:07] network access went away and still nothing still nobody's told us about any meeting they got the

[01:20:12] timing wrong I mean that I asked department was told it was 10 that they had decided it would be

[01:20:17] 10 30 and the people are actually holding the meeting so it's just you know typical Williams can't get

[01:20:22] anything right so eventually at 10 30 we all trip down to the cafeteria and they basically say see

[01:20:28] okay as a who said see uh kempathasna and

[01:20:33] who else was there i think Ken was the highest one in charge who's like the

[01:20:39] it'll air he was long gone at this point well a month or two yeah oh okay because did he see

[01:20:44] the writing on the wall well basically he didn't like the way things were going and went to

[01:20:49] management there and said look you know your treatness like crap you're not you know there's none

[01:20:56] of this is making any sense you you gotta start you know giving us the resources and this and that

[01:21:02] you know and don't price the games wrong just all this stuff and if you don't i'm out of here

[01:21:07] and they're like you see yeah and he couldn't believe that but he's like okay whatever you know

[01:21:11] so he left and started led well now he left and just like playing with his kids for a couple

[01:21:17] months he didn't know what he was going to do i mean he had enough money he wasn't going to starve if

[01:21:21] he didn't you know we're having a job the next day but but he did of course miss out on 20 years

[01:21:26] severance pay no not being there really when they finally close down but oh man that had a dirt yeah

[01:21:35] so and it was really weird the way they handled it so you've got like the pinball division is

[01:21:40] shutting down but the same company is the slot division so they could just hire us I mean we

[01:21:47] could just keep our seniority and vacation days and all that we just you know get jobs doing

[01:21:51] the slot stuff if we wanted and they don't want and here's all these talented people they don't

[01:21:55] want to let them go but then you have midway who theoretically is a completely separate company at

[01:22:01] this point has nothing to do with it but they kind of want all these talented people too all right

[01:22:05] and they're mad that you know if they stick with slots you know they just nothing changes they

[01:22:11] just go sit at a different desk and that puts midway at a disadvantage they have to start over

[01:22:16] with seniority and all this stuff vacation days all this stuff so they basically said you're fired

[01:22:22] you are out on the street and now everybody has the same bad you know deal with either company

[01:22:30] right and I think it floored them that everybody is like okay I'll go somewhere else I mean I

[01:22:34] think they thought they had leveled the playing field and people would just choose which of their two

[01:22:38] options well most people chose options C none of the above right you know not that many people

[01:22:44] went to work for either place right away some more of them have come back since but you know they're

[01:22:49] just you know so I wasn't interviewed with the slot people and then you know it was basically it

[01:22:53] was just kind of this sham you know yeah whatever you never thought if you want it you know they

[01:22:59] they were trying to make it painless for everybody but it really made them seem disinterested

[01:23:04] all right you know and went to midway and they're a little more excited that is basically yeah

[01:23:08] if you want a job you know we know you're creative we love Star Wars we'll find somewhere to fit you in

[01:23:12] huh you know when I just know that was really exciting meanwhile Larry had had this idea when he quit

[01:23:19] that what he'd really like to do is start up a little slot development company kind of I was Larry

[01:23:24] all was interested in slots well no but he had been in charge of this slot thing at Williams and

[01:23:28] had gotten really interested in it totally understood the industry knew there was obviously more money

[01:23:32] in that industry than in pinball and thought you know that would be kind of cool it'd be kind of

[01:23:38] like the vid kids of slot machines you know it's kind of early in this creative phase and he could

[01:23:43] be this little independent developer and cell content make money that way but of course everybody

[01:23:49] he'd want to hire was still working at Williams so we just kind of sat on that plan well he went

[01:23:53] up one day and found everybody out on the street in a veil right you know so he very quickly put

[01:24:00] together kind of this idea and called a bunch of us in and you know we had lunch down in Chicago

[01:24:08] explain this whole idea and you know I was kind of cool with the idea because I had done the whole

[01:24:14] you know slot machines well no especially the whole little bootstrap company trying to make

[01:24:20] it go a bit bang and I didn't think my wife was gonna be real keen on that idea

[01:24:26] so you know I at the meeting I was like yeah that's kind of it sounds interesting but I

[01:24:30] and he left with the impression that we all hated the idea you know including me because we

[01:24:35] were all going yeah I really that'd be great you know and I and I explained in one or this is

[01:24:39] why I think it's a great idea but my wife you know at this point she never wanted to leave Virginia

[01:24:44] right she's probably gonna want to go right back to Virginia in fact the very same day when shut

[01:24:48] down gee fan it called me hi want to come back you know we hear you don't have a job now now

[01:24:54] you're ready to now you've had your little fun making pinballs you're ready to come back and work

[01:24:58] for us again but as it turned out my wife had gotten real used to the area you know kind of settled

[01:25:04] in there and you know so she wasn't all that keen believe and and we talked about it and you know

[01:25:10] Larry wasn't starting a professor feathers I mean he was gonna actually fund the thing and it was

[01:25:14] gonna be real company and have paychecks and we weren't gonna have to eat the product to stay alive

[01:25:21] so so I got back and said yeah sure you know and two of us did Scott's for me on the end

[01:25:27] and I said sure we'll do that and so on the last few days of 1999 he started that company

[01:25:34] and we've been doing slowly but surely real well ever since then you have it it took a little while

[01:25:39] right yeah I took a long time to get going I mean there for a long time the the running joke was

[01:25:44] if Larry had taken the money that he was pouring into this company and we were working with IGT you

[01:25:49] know with our slot designs if he'd simply taken that much money and bought IGT stock with it instead

[01:25:54] and just sat home and had fun you know playing with his kids for the longest time that would have

[01:25:59] been a much more lucrative path you know if he'd just done that instead of trying to make this

[01:26:03] company but in the end I think it's gonna work out for him so and basically what you're making

[01:26:10] you're doing slot machine designs and more some sort of macro media type thing right we basically

[01:26:15] cobbled together a demo on the PC and director he's to be macro media now Adobe you right so it's

[01:26:23] basically a fully playable design just like it'll be in the casino and but you guys don't actually

[01:26:29] write the code though I mean you write the code for for you know the flash code for director right

[01:26:34] but IGT buys the concept right and they reprogramme hold right we do the math which is a big part of

[01:26:42] any of these games we do the art sometimes we do the sounds and we get this whole demo going so I

[01:26:48] guess a lot of ideas are sold as napkin sketches right right but we actually have a fully playable

[01:26:53] gaming sit down play for hours and get a feel for how the math is running and whether it's fun or

[01:26:58] volatile and all that right so I mean that's part of our gimmick is that we do such a good job

[01:27:03] prototyping now but yeah but then they take the concept and we work with them and they implement it

[01:27:07] on their own proprietary hardware right and the interesting thing is is while you guys were doing

[01:27:13] this the guy you were working with is Joe canico right right and where and IGT and Joe being who

[01:27:21] did work at Stern Data East Sega left the IGT and now Williams is out and here you guys are

[01:27:28] basically working with the other pinball guy right actually he worked at Williams yeah right

[01:27:34] early so he and Larry were good friends I mean even one thing the same ball and team right

[01:27:39] well even once they were you know arch enemies you know at the two pinball companies they were

[01:27:43] still friends well that was the big rumors that Larry was passing stuff to Joe under the table

[01:27:50] hardly oh that was a big room hardly there's a big room did Joe had his ways of getting stuff and

[01:27:55] copying it even before Williams came out with it but it wasn't really it wasn't Larry like

[01:28:01] checkpoint for instance okay it wasn't no accident their first dot matrix game

[01:28:05] well what do you know it was no accident they didn't just independently think of dot matrix

[01:28:11] as applied to pinball and just happened to come out with it a couple of weeks before T2 or

[01:28:15] whatever the first Williams one was oh they they knew about that they however how do they know

[01:28:19] a vendor you know you know some vendors as who Williams is buying these weird dot matrix displays

[01:28:25] from us I don't know how it happened but that kind of stuff right over the industry well then I

[01:28:30] mean why did they come up with the small one that was half the size of yours who knows who knows

[01:28:34] cost or they had only heard dot matrix and hadn't heard which one right right well is there any

[01:28:40] other good conspiracy thoughts with you know data east and now because you were always telling me

[01:28:45] that the DDS was always copying Williams designs you know well that's not my independent thought I

[01:28:52] mean that I'm not long before I get into the industry right right right but that that was what

[01:28:58] they were very good at yeah yeah stilling down the essence of what made a Williams game good and

[01:29:03] repackaging it with a licensed theme you know the Joe is really good at getting licenses and really

[01:29:08] good at distilling the essence of what made games good and kind of repackage and then you know

[01:29:13] or power to I mean they some very successful games appreciate wait one thing that was what a

[01:29:17] bigger death now for pinball 2000 than anyone appreciates is farting kids and turds south part I mean

[01:29:25] that that game I don't think was a very good pinball game but the theme was perfect and perfectly

[01:29:32] timed yeah and so an operator sitting here going you know I'm paying X thousand for this south

[01:29:37] park and making a ton of money and I'm paying a bunch for venture Mars and not making the

[01:29:42] appreciably more money what's the point right you know just through sheer random chance a a

[01:29:48] standard boring old technology pinball came out with a theme that people gravitated towards right

[01:29:55] at the exact same time you know that pinball 2000 came out and was supposed to convince everyone

[01:30:00] that the technology was where it was at well yeah and Joe's real proud of the south park thing

[01:30:05] and the fact that you know I he claims it outsold revenge for Mars I don't think it did but well

[01:30:10] like now probably has with all the rear ones but but it didn't outsell him doesn't matter out earning

[01:30:16] that was the key an operator has a revenge in the south park and they're earning the same money

[01:30:21] and look how much more he paid for the revenge right yeah all of a sudden he's got a bad

[01:30:25] taste in his mouth for pinball through that and then by the time he gets any star wars all those

[01:30:30] fanboys are bored none to the next thing you know right when it released in the US so

[01:30:37] um you know now what about were you when you were working at the Williams were you responsible for

[01:30:44] or helped concept any of the you know like now you've got flipper assemblies the right in the left

[01:30:49] are this you know the right and left paw are the same mechanical assembly the interchangeable play

[01:30:54] fields you know all that kind of stuff where did you help with any of that kind of stuff I certainly

[01:31:00] gave them my opinions as an ex operator when we were discussing a lot of that stuff but no no

[01:31:04] no specific no like okay like for instance the uh putting the circuit board in the bottom

[01:31:12] I don't get to hurry pinball machines and I knew a horrible idea that was right going to just

[01:31:16] awful but especially because crap falls off the play field shorts on the right and especially a

[01:31:21] tari where the crap's always fallen off the play field I mean the mechanical assembly's breaking

[01:31:26] into and screw's sharing off I mean it was even worse with the tari's so I mean but they ended up

[01:31:32] doing that and and putting that cover on it no but they put a covers on a tari had a cover

[01:31:39] or everybody had a sheet of plexiglass on forced standoffs okay that thing came off and got thrown

[01:31:44] away it was never seen again right pinball 2000 cover was hinged couldn't be left up when the

[01:31:49] play field went down it was sprung right I mean but I've seen those break and I've seen them come

[01:31:55] off and I but again at least I and whether it was directly because of what I was yelling about

[01:32:00] or because everybody knew it they addressed that concern there was nowhere else to put it

[01:32:05] why there wasn't enough room in the head no so they addressed that concern

[01:32:09] well well so well what else what what else so now you know you're working for Larry yeah and um oh

[01:32:17] so you know we yeah it was kind of nice to know someone there I think people at IGT thought

[01:32:22] out here's Joe's buddy Larry you know selling games but I mean we we actually had to earn our

[01:32:28] way in there with good games right and how many years did it take before you guys were actually

[01:32:32] making money quite a few right yeah I mean we had some games that went out there and were popular

[01:32:38] ish but you know they weren't run away hits and it was finally with multi strike poker has been

[01:32:42] real popular and a whole bunch of variations of that right that was finally a game that put us on

[01:32:49] in whose working at led now the original three were Larry and me and Scott slameonny

[01:32:56] right on this Scott matrix right to pinball play field credit at fishy notters and we've since

[01:33:03] added Mark Molotaur who's not a pinball guy he's an artist and Bill grew up actually we just hired

[01:33:10] he had done a bunch of pinball and slot stuff in in Dave Conn by I said hmm what was Bill responsible

[01:33:16] for in the pinball world you know it's before my time when I got there he had moved completely

[01:33:23] to slots but I think he did Congo I mean I know everyone's gonna laugh but he did several games

[01:33:32] I mean like as a designer or something no program programmer programmer and then like in

[01:33:40] slot machines he did the piggyback and then big bang piggyback and he was yeah now that was a

[01:33:46] real popular machine and Scott actually did that big bang piggyback and together it was actually

[01:33:50] in the office right behind mine so I got to hear that theme song a lot right and then they did one

[01:33:56] of the first monopoly slots to those real popular things to portable which I can still sing theme

[01:34:02] song too but I won't yeah good good we don't really need you to okay so you weren't there for any

[01:34:12] of the true you didn't see like that the pinball 2000 pop-up Duke versus George meetings right

[01:34:20] not the meetings I was looking at what Cameron and John were doing with a swoopy cabinet with a

[01:34:27] monitor facing forward okay and all there you know kind of proof of concept where you hit a rubber

[01:34:32] band and something on the screen explodes you know kind of things and score sweeps and stuff

[01:34:38] but then the day George Gomez and Pat Law are brought in their hold-open idea with the reflected screen

[01:34:48] you know we want to actually have it in a room at midway for some reason and we went over there

[01:34:54] these are the separate companies are we right we went over there to look at it and we were all

[01:34:59] just blowing away I mean I'm like anyone else you tell me video and pinball and I'm picking

[01:35:04] Chicago clean super flipper yeah caveman mr. and Mrs. Pacman right you need baby Pacman baby Pacman

[01:35:12] granny and the gator you know right like yeah ha ha ha why are you destroying my mechanical pinball

[01:35:17] machine but we all saw and we're just blown away like oh wow you know that actually kind of works

[01:35:24] you know that's kind of cool um and then so like within a day or two John and Cameron had

[01:35:32] flipped their monitor and put in a mirror and everything and done a thing where literally

[01:35:38] the ball hits a rubber band and something right there explodes and it was some star wars thing

[01:35:44] because they were still trying to get the star wars license so they were kind of you know going

[01:35:47] over that path and brought everyone in and just totally blown away I mean like Neil came in and

[01:35:52] was like you know oh my god I've seen the future of pinball you know I just I heard that the

[01:35:56] Neil was pissed though when he saw it well you know he's trying to kill pinball this conspiracy theory

[01:36:04] again well at least to those of us in the room he did not express pissiveness he was he was just

[01:36:10] blown away and giddy and like oh my god you know this is right you know because you explain it and

[01:36:18] it doesn't make too much sense but you see it that a ball hits something on the screen and makes

[01:36:24] it blow up I mean that's just that was an amazing thing to see all right and John and Cameron

[01:36:29] had managed to make it you know George's thing was real he was being run by an amiga and it was kind

[01:36:35] of right kind of hokey you could say okay I kind of kind of get it right but I mean

[01:36:40] John and Cameron made it real just all it literally just a ball hitting rubber band and something

[01:36:45] exploding and it just like you know I'm like out I can't believe we just saw that you know that's

[01:36:50] all right that's just I mean what do they do what were they doing when you guys went to you know

[01:36:54] the in the pop-a-duke model you know the pre pinball 2000 model where those guys were

[01:37:00] writing everything in C yeah I mean it was it was the same system that became pinball 2000 it was

[01:37:04] Tommy Evans you know architecture oh so you mean you guys were actually working on pinball 2000

[01:37:09] before you know before it was the the Gomez model well yeah absolutely I mean it was going to be

[01:37:16] PC motherboard based and have a monitor right had like this 25 inch monitor as the whole back box

[01:37:22] right right and he had this really swoopy I mean he's real into industrial design he had a

[01:37:26] really swoopy cabinet that was going to fold up and be really easy for an operator to move and

[01:37:31] so unlike pinball 2000 yes yeah now why did that happen like that various reasons I mean just

[01:37:36] that's there's no way to fold it the way that was done and the dimensions got down

[01:37:43] size because of shipping crate concerns you know how many can you fit in a container right I

[01:37:48] mean the first pinball 2000 even in the Gomez design had the normal like quite right but then they

[01:37:54] started calculating that they were going to get you know six less in a shipping container to Europe

[01:37:59] and we can have that so they downsized it until it fit they just kept knocking it back so they

[01:38:04] could get the same number in a shipping container huh interesting um which kind of fits your real

[01:38:12] so even though the size of the pinball 2000 was bigger than say a Williams high speed it wasn't

[01:38:18] as big as like a terminator two right right I don't know high speed however far you have to go back

[01:38:23] the standard pinball size you know EM early solid state it actually was about exactly that size

[01:38:28] right but the problem is the way the cabinets designed it looks really stubby I mean you look at that

[01:38:33] right god that thing's like half as long as a WPC point you know right right so it

[01:38:38] but while you know it wasn't really that short it sure looked like it was yeah right um so

[01:38:48] well what I did management do anything else to you guys that that made you know your

[01:38:54] lives more difficult or easier or anything no I mean I guess a lot of people have been

[01:39:02] looking at what John Cameron were doing and going so what you know a monitor and a PC motherboard

[01:39:10] and you know whatever who cares why is this going to excite people in fact I think that's

[01:39:15] you know specifically what George and Pat were saying which is why they ran off to Pat's garage

[01:39:20] it just finds something better right so you know no one thought it was bad but no one could

[01:39:25] quite see why everyone would rush to it you know what what was it other than making pinball more

[01:39:30] expensive yeah and you know you could do some cool stuff with the monitor but it wasn't fundamentally

[01:39:35] a different game and and there were some people who thought you know pinball ought to be you know

[01:39:40] there ought to be a sea change and pinball to really drive this point home and you know there's a

[01:39:46] lot of politics back and forth of you know who's right who's wrong and all that but but again once

[01:39:51] they brought their thing in everybody could see oh wow you know wow that that is something

[01:39:58] drastically different and it isn't Chicago coin superflip room I mean that's yeah that's still

[01:40:03] pinball as we know it but with you know basically instead of hot stamping a drop target you can put

[01:40:09] whatever you want on the drop target and it can change throughout the game you know all right they

[01:40:13] didn't use drop targets but um but they could have could have yeah but again it was funny um

[01:40:20] you know John in the early days of the Star Wars game had all kinds of weird stuff going on up

[01:40:26] the center with you know what you what the ball interacted with to make stuff happen and you

[01:40:32] know I finally looked at it went you know nothing nothing we're doing feels better than that day you

[01:40:37] just stretched a rubber band between two posts gonna put a switch behind it and made something blow

[01:40:41] up on the screen and that's so he ended up designing which was basically that rubber band stretched

[01:40:47] across two posts but it could go up and down so you could get the ball behind it and that you know

[01:40:51] that became the center thing in Star Wars just because that alone felt so good a ball

[01:40:56] sinks into a rubber band just the right way that interacting with something on the screen blowing

[01:41:00] up it just feels perfect I mean that that was where that all came from.

[01:41:06] So you were to state at Williams forever doing this stuff yeah and did you see Wizard Box?

[01:41:12] Oh yeah in fact um that that was more once once you pull back half the orders for Star Wars

[01:41:20] now the sudden you got to pull back your production schedule right now you thought you're

[01:41:24] going to be making Star Wars music for the next year now the sudden you're making them for another

[01:41:28] three weeks you know when you can't ever have the factory shut down rule number one at Williams is

[01:41:33] the factory always has something to make no matter what else has to happen the factory always has

[01:41:37] something to make and what was the reason for that they just didn't want to lay off anybody.

[01:41:41] Yeah I mean that's the the whole business was driven by the factory and it's all it's a very

[01:41:46] manufacturing based business right I'll get into it aside on that later but um so now the

[01:41:54] sudden the next game in line better be ready you know it better be ready when Star Wars finishes

[01:42:00] running which isn't too far from now so all hands on deck right so they actually put me on

[01:42:04] Wizard Box in the week or two before Expo I was actually going to code for Wizard Box and how did

[01:42:09] you feel about that game um it was actually coming along quite well um you know it's kind of a

[01:42:15] strange theme yeah um and what came up with the theme was that Pat I assume so yeah I'm not sure

[01:42:21] anybody really got that at first but I mean once you played it it was kind of fun right and he was

[01:42:26] doing some really interesting thing with the light and the interaction and again kind of a breakout

[01:42:31] thing where you don't just make up a box blow up on the screen the next box on top actually falls

[01:42:38] in you know that's cool you know it's we were having a lot of fun with that game we would actually

[01:42:45] in the afternoons in the game in Lewis's office he was the main programmer we'd all go in and

[01:42:52] kind of play a four player tournament on you know whatever the code stated he'd gotten to for that day

[01:42:56] and we were having a blast I mean it was basically at that point only one mode um but it was

[01:43:03] it was a lot of fun and it had great potential now you know I guess Gene has still tried to

[01:43:09] somehow make Wizard Box which to any of us that worked on that seems like nonsense because the game

[01:43:16] you know it was just uh had one mode and some switches work and stuff it's not even remotely a

[01:43:22] complete game I don't think it would be very fun to play long term but I guess he's trying to

[01:43:28] yeah so I'll figure it out now you said that you had a manufacturing aside what were you talking

[01:43:33] oh okay so the the um the line can never stop right so looking way out on pinball 2000 how long

[01:43:42] it was going to take to develop and the Star Wars movie you know that game couldn't release before

[01:43:47] May 19th and just all this stuff there was going to be this gap between the end of the last

[01:43:54] WPC game which was Captain Scanion and the first pinball 2000 game which was revenge from Mars

[01:44:01] so what are we going to do to fill that gap I mean you can't have a gap um so big thing bar

[01:44:08] somebody came up with the idea of engineering is all done we'll just drop that in there and make it

[01:44:13] so the engineering is not really all done of course because it's made with Capcom hardware

[01:44:18] so right so we got two of them from Capcom one to sit around and play as kind of a reference

[01:44:25] version and then one to William's eyes you mean you're actually bottom well as part of this whole

[01:44:31] deal to make the game we were going to sub license the design from they gave us and they were willing

[01:44:36] to do that yeah well they weren't in the business anymore right yeah that was going to be free

[01:44:40] money to them um so we we had one that uh Jim Shirt and the boys in the prototype lab swapped out

[01:44:48] all the coils for William's coils um and all the assemblies put in William's stuff yeah and he

[01:44:56] I mean a lot of assemblies you can just swap the coil in it's good enough to get you an idea

[01:45:00] because Capcom drove their coils differently like their flippers were really strong they were like

[01:45:06] duty cycle or something so you know there was an issue of whether William's coil can actually get

[01:45:12] the balls up the ramps and stuff and then uh um Graham sat down and you know with

[01:45:20] put WPC hardware in the back Graham who's Graham he's British

[01:45:25] Graham West Graham West so Graham West sat down with you know they put the WPC hardware in it

[01:45:31] and he had his development system and he said about rewriting the Big Bang Barcode did you guys

[01:45:36] have source code you know by uh even if we did it wouldn't it matter okay well there's

[01:45:41] a lot of rules and we make sure that's why we got the second game okay the reference game we could

[01:45:45] go play and you know and also for people to play and say what they liked and didn't like

[01:45:49] we could compare them maybe improve the design a little bit right right so we were well along that

[01:45:55] path when we actually had the exact opposite thing in the end I I don't remember which it was I

[01:46:00] think revenge got moved up a little bit because they wanted to release it at the show at E.I.

[01:46:06] in London so that got moved up something else had run a little longer you know had been slightly

[01:46:11] more successful than they expected so all the sudden what ended up happening was Keck just

[01:46:15] Canyon got cut short so instead of having a gap they actually took a game that before it

[01:46:20] ever even got running they cut it off of the knees and stop making all right so so then that was

[01:46:26] big bang bar never went any well you did have big bang bar then running under WPC hardware yes I

[01:46:32] was not a hundred percent complete but it was really close and how did it compare to the catcom

[01:46:36] version I one of the biggest problems was the flow first right it really was hard to get this balls

[01:46:41] up this really steep ramps but but all in all he gramma done a great job I mean I had all the

[01:46:46] dot matrix animation and everything because then you have to redo the art yeah again it wasn't a

[01:46:51] hundred percent but they had an awful lot of it huh where are these roms well I want to know now

[01:46:58] here's the thing of course once the deal falls through they had to put it back you couldn't hand

[01:47:06] back this thing to capcom oh with all the Williams stuff in it yeah okay so what happened why I

[01:47:12] don't really know I know I know I never got put back it didn't because pay second it up with it

[01:47:17] right he's got it up with it and then pay Zach paid somebody to put all the capcom stuff back in

[01:47:23] the game okay so the kids can put back but not by Williams but not by Williams so I was

[01:47:28] afraid to pay capcom anything for posing you know I didn't heard that they never ended up paying

[01:47:34] capcom anything anyways that there was a big dilemma about that don't like off yeah I heard

[01:47:41] them some kind of big dilemma about yeah yeah by the time Williams shuts down they're not

[01:47:47] caring much about anything so I don't know what happened again that was by definition after I was

[01:47:53] going so then that whole fiasco of trying to make big bang bar or a Williams game it just didn't

[01:48:01] really work out right I mean the the thinking being all the engineering is done we can get this

[01:48:06] done much quicker than coming up with our own game from scratch well that you know might have

[01:48:11] been slightly true but more or less that was that was incorrect it did not uh what about

[01:48:17] salt turnout that way because we had to do so much reengineering what about the rounds where are

[01:48:23] those well they never got made into roms of course it was a development system oh so you mean

[01:48:28] there was never really a set of rounds so we couldn't play this in Maine and compare the two or

[01:48:33] some sick puppy put all the parts in their game it's always you see boards and see what happens

[01:48:38] yeah no no so I never actually got to that you know somewhere on a server somewhere must be the

[01:48:44] files gram was working on but no that's a surprise so when you guys were all got thrown out you know

[01:48:51] you told me a story about there was some company that was gonna buy all Williams and you guys

[01:48:58] were like trying to get oh okay well so that was a really weird week so we come in Monday and I

[01:49:03] move all my stuff to my new office remember yeah the kohuna zone is what we called it that we

[01:49:08] needed a code name for the Star Wars project that wouldn't let anyone know it's Star Wars right so

[01:49:13] someone came up with the name kohuna right so with all the vendors when we're getting stuff made it's

[01:49:17] just this is our game kohuna everyone thinks it's like a surfing game or something right right so

[01:49:22] that we called the uh the place we were all locked in the kohuna zone and that had been dismantled

[01:49:27] and we were all moving into losses so I hadn't even really unpacked when we had our meeting and

[01:49:33] lo and behold were all at work so basically I had to unpack a little bit to sort out the William

[01:49:39] stuff versus my personal stuff but I was pretty much ready to go I can just haul all my stuff home

[01:49:43] right but over the next week they let people come in and you know take their stuff home they all

[01:49:48] you know people that had gotten games you know the sample games or whatever hadn't always taken

[01:49:53] them home a lot of people had them in their office to play and stuff so there's a lot of crap to take

[01:49:58] so and they let you in even though they cut your cards in your server yeah but but basically they

[01:50:03] were trying to be me you know it was we're shutting down the company we're sorry we know you're all

[01:50:08] in mourning but come in clean up your stuff and you know basically they were right in gate passes

[01:50:13] so just about anything you wanted to take home I mean they weren't trying to right you know no one

[01:50:19] was trying to rip waves off and Williams wasn't trying to make sure you didn't take a pencil home

[01:50:23] that belonged to Williams there's right so I was also hauling a lot of stuff for other people

[01:50:31] you know I got out of the truck and so you know I was hauling people's Star Wars elements stuff

[01:50:36] and then we got this idea that you know what it would be really nice for historical reasons if

[01:50:43] wizard blocks didn't stay there didn't stay there you know they were for your four belt plate

[01:50:50] fields you know we really ought to take one home so you know the world can someday see what that

[01:50:55] was right um and you know again nothing's ever going to happen any of this stuff they've turned

[01:51:01] it off it's it's just all gonna go in the dumpster someday so you know we basically had that all

[01:51:08] wrapped up and I had it on a hand truck in the freight elevator with a whole bunch of other stuff

[01:51:13] that Pat was taking home and it was heading out to my truck and you know Pat comes running

[01:51:18] another haul way way you know Williams is trying to sell the company I there were a couple of times

[01:51:23] that happened I think this may have been the the German distributor no this no yes or Nova or

[01:51:30] Nova yeah or whatever right I think some of them had come in to look to look shopping window shopping

[01:51:37] well they were forward you know why didn't you ask us why did you shut this company down you know

[01:51:43] fully 50% of our business is Williams pin vaults and you just pulled the rug out from under us you

[01:51:49] and you didn't even ask us all right we wanted to buy the company so they flew over there this is like

[01:51:53] Tuesday or Wednesday that week and so Pat comes running out of the hallway you know they they want to buy

[01:51:59] the company you know and so show them we got some wizard now you just you know the play field we

[01:52:04] happened to take was the one that was out of the game that was most ready to show so we hustled

[01:52:08] it all back and put it together and showed them and then yeah and then we couldn't get the game

[01:52:13] back out and I was done I wasn't calling anymore stuff nice so I don't know so then Jean ended up

[01:52:20] with it right now what about the other playfields you said that there was more playfield he has all

[01:52:24] oh Jean has them all yeah they're in various states of you know difference and completions

[01:52:29] right there was there would have been one in the game I was working on and the one in the game was

[01:52:34] this working on and there may have been one other complete one but that was like an earlier rev

[01:52:39] right right right so he could significantly have more than one wizard box Jean yeah well now that

[01:52:47] he's made Big Bang Bar I could just make wizard blocks right we know he can make the

[01:52:50] machine that only takes six or seven years wow let's know that compared to the Australian guys

[01:52:56] and and speaking of that that's more conspiracy theory the fact that they sold it to to to Jean

[01:53:02] in to Miss Ra Australia is that you know they were selling the company to people they knew Dan

[01:53:09] Well probably couldn't do that good of a job with the company right if you were going to shut

[01:53:15] down a company despite it seeming like maybe that wasn't such a good idea the last thing you'd

[01:53:21] want is something proving you wrong right so okay that's where that conspiracy theory comes from

[01:53:26] whether it's true or not I mean that because that's all based on the previous conspiracy theory

[01:53:31] but but yes you certainly wouldn't want to sell it to a bunch of ex-loans and employees who

[01:53:35] might make a go of it because then your shareholders ago what the hell you shut down this company

[01:53:40] and they're making millions that's not necessarily what happened but yeah you've let me run it I

[01:53:47] would have given the games away cheap to bring in yeah okay professor feathers yeah all right well

[01:53:54] I'd like to thank you Duncan for doing this and Duncan was very reluctant I had to really draw

[01:53:59] I've been bothering for how many about two years now at least to do this and and you just didn't

[01:54:05] want to do this at all you had to bribe me with back glass pictures yeah I had to bribe you I had to

[01:54:09] get you here and do this you wouldn't do it over the phone it's had to be a face to face and I

[01:54:15] just better hope that the tape I'm recording this on I don't have any problems with because that'll

[01:54:20] be really be a problem so okay well hey thanks Duncan was it that bad no okay you sure let's do it

[01:54:27] again sometimes yeah okay so it turns out that I did forget to ask Duncan something so I

[01:54:34] actually have to calm on the phone I hope he talks to us let's try it

[01:54:47] all right Duncan Duncan it's click can you hear me yeah okay so I forgot to ask you about

[01:54:53] tempest tubes tell me about tempest tubes and what brought that on well you know I was had already

[01:54:59] been reverse engineering asteroids by that time having lots of fun with that and once we open

[01:55:06] professor feathers and we could all play tempest three all night long what else was we all got very

[01:55:13] good at it so we wanted to make it harder and I figured one way would be to make stranger tube shape

[01:55:21] just be trickier to play and how much work was it to to come up with this well you know I was

[01:55:29] pretty familiar with how with tarry put together their hardware and their software and stuff

[01:55:35] and I didn't really want to go through the whole process again of you know trying to disassemble

[01:55:41] the whole program although I did dump it out again by this time I had the ability to borrow an

[01:55:45] apple too I didn't own my own yet so I did dump the whole program out but then I thought you know

[01:55:53] if I were a tarry programmer what I do is make like a big data table with all the tube shape

[01:56:00] you know somewhere there's just going to be a bunch of data that defines the shapes of those tube

[01:56:05] instead of really trying to figure out how the program worked all I got to do is figure out

[01:56:08] where that data is and how to put together so I just started you know I go through the program and

[01:56:14] you could tell anywhere it didn't disassemble in the clean code it was a data table so I just

[01:56:18] started stomping on all those you know I just like program them with all zeros each set I'd find

[01:56:24] and see what got whacked in the game and you know the text that disappear here or something else

[01:56:30] weird would happen there but then finally I found one that just made all the tube shapes go

[01:56:35] completely whacky like okay you know I've at least found the right spot so then I just kept you

[01:56:42] stomping on the data in logical ways and seeing the results and refining it till I doked out how it

[01:56:47] was all put together is um to a lot of e-proms that's I I didn't have a good e-promaracer

[01:56:56] though I went to the local lighting supply store and I you know I had the right wavelength

[01:57:00] of light I needed and they had some sort of grow lamp that would do but it was like a four-foot tube

[01:57:07] I bought a four-foot for SM fixture in this tube and put it all in a big box so I got to race you

[01:57:12] know a couple hundred e-prombs at a time and that came in handy because I went through a lot of them

[01:57:15] doing them so you're saying that you couldn't you had no emulator to run this on the Apple too you

[01:57:20] could only disassemble it there reassemble it and then burn it to an e-promm yeah heavens no I had no

[01:57:27] development system no I what I couldn't even reassemble it at that point well I guess it was

[01:57:31] a 502 I could have but again it was just data so all I was doing you know once I found the chip

[01:57:37] where the data was located I could load the original chip into memory in the Apple and then just

[01:57:42] you know manually change bytes and write it back to a new e-promm um but did that you know

[01:57:48] a lot of notes and figured out how it all worked you know there was there were data bytes that

[01:57:53] specified the endpoint you know of each of the joints and then different ones that specified

[01:57:59] you know which side of the resulting line your guy was playing on another one that determined

[01:58:05] whether the loop closed back on itself or not um and I just again figured it all out there's

[01:58:12] 16 shapes so there were groups of 16 bytes that did each of these different things then I sat down

[01:58:18] and you know on graph paper designed new tubes and uh program them up and they worked you know

[01:58:25] what I expected it to do um and you know I just tried a whole bunch up until I came up with a set

[01:58:30] I like my head more and I actually did like um tube shapes for each of the letters of tempest like

[01:58:37] in the logo on the header panel um but those weren't really fun to play so I didn't use those

[01:58:46] so we got a second tempest at professor feathers and ran both of them we had the stock one and

[01:58:50] one with tempest tube um how did it earn oh real well I mean there were a lot of people that

[01:58:56] had gotten really good at tempest and they were good to have a challenge again and of course

[01:59:00] since it was a challenge they were put a lot more quarters in it but they liked it you know

[01:59:05] like that idea how did you disseminate this well I for years I wouldn't there was a guy another

[01:59:11] operator in town I knew and he eventually talked me into giving him two copies of it for his two

[01:59:16] tempest you know I assumed they did okay with that and you know people knew about this a little bit

[01:59:27] but um you know there was no internet back then so just kind of people locally and Virginia

[01:59:34] knew about it but then eventually you know when I was on wreck games video arcade collecting

[01:59:40] rgvac I told some people about it and eventually um posted a copy of it to Jess ask East

[01:59:48] site remember the name of it anymore um and you know eventually people used it but I was just

[01:59:57] concerned of course with Atari coming after me that was a real key you know to have that happen

[02:00:04] well why did you think they would care well you know I was distributing code that was

[02:00:10] all of theirs except for you know 80 bytes you know you know what they would want to do

[02:00:18] um so again Jess put it on his site with no attribution to me although you know some people knew

[02:00:24] I don't know how widely known it was but and then eventually while I was working at Williams the

[02:00:31] guys from digital eclipse were doing a you know an old Atari game emulator thing for the

[02:00:40] PC and they had tempest in there and they somehow figured out it was me and gotten touch with me and

[02:00:47] wanted permission to use the tempest tube in the uh their compilation for the PC which I thought

[02:00:56] was pretty funny I was scared about Atari being mad now they were asking my permission

[02:01:00] um and at that point since I was working for Williams who was combined with midway who owned

[02:01:06] it Atari I figured out what the heck you know they're not going to come after me now right

[02:01:10] so yeah I was like fine you can tell the world I did it and put it in there um and they actually

[02:01:15] paid me a thousand bucks for that which I thought was pretty funny all you know 20 years earlier I

[02:01:20] had wasted an entire weekend locked in my house doping all this out just for my own amusement

[02:01:25] and now it finally paid off so you do the whole thing in a weekend huh yeah I took one of our tempest

[02:01:31] from professor feathers bar at the apple two for the entire weekend and just didn't come out again

[02:01:37] till I finished it man so when you disassembled the um uh the asteroids thing did you ever do anything

[02:01:47] with that well yeah there was a guy um that played with us there he went to UVA um and you know he

[02:01:57] was real good at asteroids and he eventually went off and became a researcher at the university of

[02:02:02] Denver and he was trying to do like complex skill acquisition studies you know how do people learn

[02:02:10] how to do these things and it's it's really tough you know try to study that and weed out all the

[02:02:16] other factors and you know they have really expensive machines but nobody has a budget to buy those

[02:02:23] that can try to help this or you know he could pay someone a whole bunch of money to design him

[02:02:27] something real custom and everybody's using pdp 11s and all these expensive simulators and stuff

[02:02:32] and he said hey you know there was that guy at professor feathers where I used to play that was

[02:02:37] kind of figure out what made asteroids tick I wonder what he ever did with that because you know

[02:02:42] in it in this little game that I'm real familiar with I know there's a lot of really complex

[02:02:47] skills going on there but it's just a few of them and maybe I'd be able to study them and that

[02:02:51] it's real cheap hardware you get asteroids for a couple hundred bucks so he rang me up and said you

[02:02:56] know can you do all this can you you make it do anything I want it to do and I said yeah at this

[02:03:01] point I probably can you know I've basically had back created an entire source for the game I could

[02:03:07] actually recompile reassemble you know source after changing it without having to poke bites them

[02:03:14] so you know he he then went to Atari and said you know I'm doing this project I got to use

[02:03:21] asteroids I'd love to you know pay you some money out of my budget to make asteroids do anything I

[02:03:27] want it to do but if you don't want to do that I've got this guy who says he can do it you know

[02:03:33] and they said yeah whatever go for it you know we have no interest at all but we don't care what

[02:03:37] you do to your own machine so he came back to me and you know I guess in the scheme of what

[02:03:44] it was really worth he paid me nothing but you know I made a couple thousand dollars year in there

[02:03:48] just basically kept track my time and charge him an hourly rate and ended up doing a whole bunch

[02:03:55] of different things with it is it anything that gaming people would find interesting probably not

[02:04:04] I don't know I mean I I did a couple of other variations just along the way that were humorous like

[02:04:11] you know enormously big rocks put them across the screen or eat-e-e-dee-e little spaceship you know

[02:04:22] just beard variations like that or the flying saucer would come out and actually you know chase you

[02:04:29] they would always be seeking your position that was a little one or

[02:04:32] And again, on the app, you could have really long file names.

[02:04:38] I always had humorous file names, these variations.

[02:04:40] That last one was you can run, but you can't hide or roe.

[02:04:43] It's a geek joke, I guess.

[02:04:47] So we made variations like we made Square Rock.

[02:04:55] You know, what we're trying to do, you know, these, like the ship would be pointed straight up and you couldn't turn it.

[02:05:03] And this rock would come in from the left to the right and you just simply have to intercept it.

[02:05:08] I mean, that's a very complex skill but a very narrow thing you can study.

[02:05:14] It's how quickly the people learn to do intercept across the distance with known speed.

[02:05:20] But again, to make it more obvious what was going on and to be a little more precise, we had to use Square Rock.

[02:05:26] So that was none of this, you know, did it really hit that little jaggy edge or whatever.

[02:05:32] And then, I guess at one point we were doing basically the full game, but he wanted to do eye track.

[02:05:41] Like to see where people were looking, are they looking ahead of the rocks or, you know, what's going on when they're playing.

[02:05:48] So I helped him figure out that he could take his eye tracking rig and he got an asteroid still lucks cabinet.

[02:05:55] And we ran, you know, the regular asteroids board in it.

[02:05:58] He could pop the mirror up like half an inch and sneak his camera through there pointing at people's eyes.

[02:06:06] Because the asteroid still lucks the monitors down low and then bounces up in a mirror.

[02:06:11] So that way he could get everything lined up and actually track where they were looking at the time.

[02:06:16] And I had in addition to rigging up the whole system to allow me to download code in the game, which of course allowed him to download these various variations on the fly.

[02:06:26] He didn't have to program e-proms and prime in and out.

[02:06:30] Then I also came up with something going the other direction that would grab 60 times a second all the interesting data out of the game.

[02:06:40] So that he could study, you know, when the shot was released versus where the rock was and everything.

[02:06:46] And the only thing at the time that was fast enough and had enough memory to capture that was a PCXT because it had extended memory.

[02:06:54] And he got it like a zenith version of that.

[02:06:57] So I created hardware to go the other direction to it. Basically, he had a shadow copy of the RAM in asteroids and grabbed it 60 times a second up to the PC.

[02:07:08] And then, of course, once you've got all that data and the eye tracking data, you have to merge them somehow.

[02:07:14] And we figured out the best way to do it was visually.

[02:07:17] So I created another version of asteroids that would take data back from the PC at 60 frames a second and just replay the game on the screen.

[02:07:25] But then we'd add like a little target that corresponded to where the people were looking.

[02:07:31] So you could actually watch their game and see where they were looking at the time.

[02:07:38] Because originally, he'd been kind of like video taping them to try to figure out, you know, to go back and figure out what was going on.

[02:07:45] The screen would just allow them to just run subjects all day long and not even care.

[02:07:50] And then they could go back later and study the data, you know, step it frame by frame and study it in real detail and do statistical analysis on it.

[02:07:58] Did anything ever come of this research?

[02:08:00] He wrote several papers, one of them, even a co-author on despite having never finished college.

[02:08:05] I'm a published author on a scientific research paper.

[02:08:12] You know, he kept doing that.

[02:08:14] I guess eventually, you know, even that got too hokey for him and he went on to figure in better things.

[02:08:23] And then actually, it's funny because that led to a friend of mine in Charlottesville knew all that history.

[02:08:31] And he had a friend who was in the psychology research department at UVA who had somehow wrangled a deal where Atari worked with him with a race driving panorama, the three screen driving game.

[02:08:48] You know, full real time 3D and everything.

[02:08:50] He actually convinced them that they should be selling these as really cheap driving simulators to police department, research department.

[02:08:59] And they kind of, you know, they started down that path because, you know, the real driving simulators are millions of dollars in this thing.

[02:09:06] Or the nearly that.

[02:09:08] So he had kind of worked with them and they had written a special version of the code and a way for him to program in little script for how all the things worked.

[02:09:17] But to just, you know, it wasn't work.

[02:09:21] And he wanted it to do things and they didn't know what he wanted.

[02:09:24] And so basically what you had was a research geek and a bunch of game geeks that just didn't speak the same language.

[02:09:32] But, you know, I knew both languages.

[02:09:34] And my friend said, you really ought to help this guy.

[02:09:36] So I came in there and got on calls with him and the Atari guys and translated back and forth and we finally doped out and they got it picked up to mostly do what he needed.

[02:09:46] But about the time I was really getting going on it, they were kind of starting to lose interest in it, you know.

[02:09:52] I think probably they were worried about midway buying them.

[02:09:55] You know, I don't remember the exact timing.

[02:09:57] But so at some point they finally said, okay, you know, it is what it is.

[02:10:02] You know, this is the final version and you're welcome to use it.

[02:10:06] But we're not going to make any more changes.

[02:10:08] So for a couple more years I basically programmed up the game for this guy in Atari's little script language and had to find ways around a few remaining bugs.

[02:10:19] And then did all that quite successfully.

[02:10:21] And I helped.

[02:10:23] There were several research groups at this point that were using this and he held a little conference of all of them at UVA.

[02:10:29] And I gave a little presentation on, you know, here's how to work around those bugs and make everything work.

[02:10:36] So it was actually kind of cool.

[02:10:37] And he was doing like drunk driving research and diabetic insulin problem research and old people driving research.

[02:10:48] So he'd get all these groups in and they could set up these driving scenarios and gauge their reaction under various conditions.

[02:10:56] And it was all, yeah, it was pretty cool.

[02:11:01] They ran into interesting problems like old people.

[02:11:05] You set them down in a kind of cartoony 3D driving simulator and they drive and they just immediately throw up.

[02:11:13] They could only get car sickness.

[02:11:15] And normally in, you know, one classic way to get car sickness is you're moving and your inner ears and everything tell you you're moving but you're like reading a book or something, which isn't moving.

[02:11:26] So your eyes and your, you know, your motion sensors in your head are corresponding and you get car sickness.

[02:11:33] This was completely the opposite.

[02:11:35] Their eyes were telling them they're moving but their body is telling them they're not and they got car sickness.

[02:11:39] It was really strange.

[02:11:41] But just don't have to give them like drama mean before they ran it.

[02:11:44] But whereas kids who played video games before had no problem at all, they just drove.

[02:11:49] So people that didn't have the video game experience were the ones throwing up.

[02:11:55] Right, exactly.

[02:11:57] Their body couldn't handle the mismatch between the visual motion and the lack of actual motion, which is the opposite of normal car sickness.

[02:12:07] Basically, there was this, it was the basic race driving track that kind of limited it and it was kind of turned into this giant circuit.

[02:12:15] You could go around and around and there were a couple of little five roads you could go on.

[02:12:19] But everything else was kind of blocked off.

[02:12:21] But they'd added in objects for like stoplights and stop signs and stop lines on the road and stuff.

[02:12:27] So we could set up these intersections and have cross traffic and stuff and see how they handled it.

[02:12:35] And, you know, I set up, again, I just did what they told me to but I set up some kind of mean scenarios.

[02:12:41] You'd be coming up to a green light and, you know, there'd be a guy waiting to your right at his red light and right as you get to the intersection.

[02:12:48] He just pull out in front of him.

[02:12:50] And, you know, they'd see how people would react because it had brakes and everything.

[02:12:56] And that was actually freaking people out too much because they didn't veryably hit the car and like start weeping.

[02:13:03] You know, they just, they couldn't handle having just killed someone.

[02:13:07] You know, they just p-boned someone.

[02:13:09] You know, it's just a video game.

[02:13:11] But some people, you know, who hadn't played video games.

[02:13:14] So we had to like back off in that little bit, not make it so mean.

[02:13:17] So this was all way before, like, you know, you know, cruising USA and rush the rock and all that kind of stuff.

[02:13:24] Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, race driving, I guess hard driving was the original and then race driving was just way before everything else in terms of real time 3D driving game.

[02:13:34] Right.

[02:13:36] And it was tricky. I mean, I had a real job, obviously.

[02:13:39] I was doing this at night and on weekends stuff.

[02:13:42] So I'd go in there and work for hours and hours and hours and come out there in the dark and hop in my car after doing, you know, loop the loop and stuff on this thing for hours.

[02:13:52] And just, you know, I'd want to drive like a madman going home and tricky to get myself to, no, no, okay.

[02:13:59] We're back on a road of being the real laws of physics now.

[02:14:03] But also, you know, I could take my kids out there on the weekends and play race driving panorama for free eternally.

[02:14:09] They had a lot of fun because you could all see you could switch the game back into normal game to just play the normal game.

[02:14:15] Oh, in now what language was this written in?

[02:14:19] I don't know. I think the game was 60809 or something, but Atari had this little scripting language that they used.

[02:14:25] You could basically, I mean, it was just this script that created and they had a little compiler for it.

[02:14:33] You download it into the game and it would just run.

[02:14:37] But, you know, it's basic commands to like move objects around the world and give them feeds and directions.

[02:14:44] Right. And you like create them and destroy them.

[02:14:47] And that was part of the problem. The Creighton destroy thing didn't work right.

[02:14:51] So at the beginning of the game, there was also, despite them saying there wasn't, there was actually a hard limit of the number items you could create.

[02:14:57] It's like 28 or something.

[02:15:00] So basically, for any of these scenarios, I had to create every object we were ever going to use and we were fairly limited in that number.

[02:15:09] You know, every stop sign, every street light, everything.

[02:15:13] Create them all and hide them somewhere else in the world where you couldn't see them.

[02:15:18] And then just move them in front of you as you were going around.

[02:15:22] So instead of creating all the stop signs at every intersection, I had four stop signs and just, you know, as a big shell game to move them around ahead of the person driving.

[02:15:34] You know, after they got past an intersection, the stop signs would then, you know, disappear out of there and move on to the next intersection.

[02:15:41] Crazy world.

[02:15:44] Right. Right.

[02:15:46] Well, pretty cool. You know, that's some kind of interesting work. I mean, that kept it busy for a while.

[02:15:51] Yeah, I mean, it was weird. Like, there was probably only one person on the planet that could have done that and that was me and I just happened to be there at the right time.

[02:16:01] I spoke geek. I spoke game geek and...

[02:16:05] Is it researchers, psychology researcher geek?

[02:16:08] Clinical geek and game geek.

[02:16:11] Right. Sure.

[02:16:13] And I spoke both of those and got the two sides together and worked out most of their issues until a cary gave up on it.

[02:16:19] And, you know, I have no idea if they ever figured out I was the guy that that other researcher had been talking about years ago.

[02:16:26] And then, you know, once I went to work for Williams, I actually met, you know, some of these guys at Trace's.

[02:16:32] That's kind of interesting.

[02:16:34] Oh, yeah, we remember that guy.

[02:16:37] Do they have, you know, disdain for you or what?

[02:16:40] No, no, no. They just, you know, they just knew they'd kind of, you know, gone out there and done that whole project and then abandoned it and they kind of wanted to forget about it.

[02:16:52] I mean, they'd really, they created like this whole division to sell simulators and then decided not to after all.

[02:17:00] Well, cool. Anything else we should talk about?

[02:17:04] You can think of it.

[02:17:05] Okay.

[02:17:06] All right, Duncan, you take care. Thanks a lot for letting me call you.

[02:17:08] I really like to thank Duncan Brown for joining us tonight on Topcast.

[02:17:12] I greatly appreciate him allowing me to interview him while he was shooting all these back glass pictures at my house.

[02:17:19] It was great having him here.

[02:17:22] And I hope you all can come back and hear us again on another episode of Topcast.
