[00:00] The Pinball Network is online. Launching. Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:16] Welcome back! Are you ready to hear my blood-curdling pinball stories?

[00:21] I know I am.

[00:30] Hello everyone, I'm the man with two first names, David Dennis. This is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:37] With me this month, like every month is Ron. Where's the pinbar? How it? Oh god, where's the pinbar? I'm never going to look that line down. Is the pinbar here? Will we be talking about the pinbar today?

[00:40] We will not be talking about the pinbar today.

[00:45] We will not be talking about the pinbar today.

[00:50] We will not be talking about the pinbar today.

[00:54] We will not be talking about the pinbar today.

[00:58] We will not be talking about the pinbar today.

[01:01] I will say from our last podcast where we pontificated on either a successful launch or a crash and burn of DeepBruit,

[01:11] we certainly know today that it was the latter.

[01:15] So what's up fellow, what have you been up to?

[01:18] Well, because of COVID, I haven't got to play any of the latest and greatest new games. No Avengers for me, no Guns and Roses, no...

[01:30] There's another one. Or Rick and Morty, that was the other one I'll say.

[01:34] I haven't done anything really.

[01:36] Yeah, because during show season, I would have got to play all those already.

[01:41] I was looking forward to show season, all that fun stuff, but of course as always, we are crushed by the world in which we live,

[01:49] but I'll tell you what, to freshen things up here in the Dennis Hosehold.

[01:53] I've gone and I swapped out my tron.

[01:56] So I put my tron in my league, downtown here, and my buddy swapped me out his black knight, his original 1980 black knight.

[02:06] It's been a lot of fun having that in the house and just hitting that start button over and over and over again.

[02:11] You're right man, that is a great game.

[02:13] It's the best black knight. You can hear Steve Richie and his whatever effects they did in his voice there.

[02:18] I am the black knight.

[02:20] It gets me every time where he laughs when you hit the Magna Save and you miss it and it hits that switch,

[02:27] and goes down the left to right out lane and he laughs at you.

[02:30] I think he's left it more people than any other pinball voice in history.

[02:37] Yeah, exactly.

[02:39] There's been lots of updates in the hobby.

[02:42] Of course, there's millions of podcasts that we have out there with their opinions on how things are going,

[02:47] but the biggest news here is your Star Wars comic pro with the R2-D2 topper.

[02:53] Yeah, I needed to keep up with you getting that Steve Richie game in your house and doing multiple parts Steve Richie episodes.

[02:59] I had to get me a Steve Richie game.

[03:02] You had the craving.

[03:03] Oh yeah.

[03:04] And you figured why not get a game where you can not play?

[03:08] You know, I love Star Wars, but man, it is really art.

[03:12] It's awesome.

[03:13] Awesome.

[03:14] Zero regret.

[03:15] I literally love it more and more if I'm more I play it.

[03:17] You know, because I'm newer to the hobby and because I have a small collection,

[03:22] if I brought something in like that, that's staying for a long, long, long time, right?

[03:26] And I don't know if I want to have friends come over and be like, oh, pinball.

[03:30] And then immediately just have their soul crushed and never want to play every single one.

[03:34] Oh yeah, I wouldn't have played that one.

[03:35] That wouldn't be because it's so hard.

[03:38] Yeah, but I'll tell you, when you come out of a multi-ball and you hit a lockable for hyperspace

[03:44] and you see that one lit multiplier is on the wrong ramp and you move it over like right before you hit it at 20X

[03:51] and you get like a 560 million shot that you just hit.

[03:56] That's what I'm talking about.

[03:57] I have no idea what that means.

[03:59] Exactly.

[04:00] Exactly.

[04:01] I didn't know what that meant either.

[04:03] But now I own the game.

[04:04] Now I know exactly what that means.

[04:05] So watch out.

[04:06] All you IFPA players, Ron's coming for you.

[04:10] Well, and he's picking Star Wars.

[04:11] I don't know if you picked that in a tournament because you could get.

[04:14] Especially if they have no ball saver on, you're going to get screwed.

[04:17] You're going to just not even be able to plunge.

[04:20] You're going to spend the whole time trying to plunge without drain.

[04:23] We've had a lot of engagement on our Facebook page.

[04:26] Swing on over to facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles to chat with us and some comments and joy and musings.

[04:32] We've had a lot of engagement over there and I'm going to read some of those comments as we go through today's podcast.

[04:37] Also, of course, this week in pinball.com has their twip pinball promoters database.

[04:42] That's where you can find all kinds of pinball content, including podcasts, twitch streams and YouTube channels.

[04:48] So you can go there, see it all in one place and leave some comments.

[04:53] So please continue to jump over there, leave us a five star review so others can find us.

[04:58] That way we can keep creating all this awesome pinball content and know that people out there are actually listening.

[05:04] So we got some great feedback from the pinball promoters database this month, Ron.

[05:10] And actually, there's so much I only took a couple of comments just because we did get quite a few reviews this month.

[05:17] And I don't want to drag this on forever.

[05:20] I love the user name here.

[05:23] This is Carl your mama says, I love the richie episode so much.

[05:28] These guys balanced humor and stories and kept it funny and fresh.

[05:32] Yeah, he's spelled humor wrong.

[05:34] I know he spelled it right.

[05:35] Are you sure?

[05:36] He spelled it right.

[05:37] Yes, you're spelling it the incorrect Canadian way and European way.

[05:40] The Queen's English.

[05:41] Yep, there's only the American way.

[05:43] That they're American English.

[05:44] They're only one way.

[05:45] They're American way.

[05:46] Where do you think these pinball machines are made?

[05:48] Your major cargo, USI, baby.

[05:51] In addition to that, you can't spell and you can't count because you're still counting down there and it's been like a month.

[05:58] Very nice.

[06:00] You know if someone listens to this like five years from now, they'll have no idea what that meant.

[06:05] Yeah, they could just go ahead and Google, you know, like October 2020 and they could figure it out.

[06:10] Or the 2000 election where I think it took a month to count them all up.

[06:14] No one brings that up at all.

[06:17] It's just like this one.

[06:18] You can always go back.

[06:19] He mentioned the Steve Richie episode.

[06:21] You can always go back in the Silver Ball Chronicles direct feed.

[06:24] So if you search for Silver Ball Chronicles on Apple podcasts or Google Play or in your pod catcher of your choice, you can search and bring up all the old archived episodes without searching through the TPN feed itself.

[06:39] With all of the other podcasts.

[06:41] I mean, no, clearly you would want to listen to all the other shows on TPN also because they are absolutely amazing.

[06:48] So much talent in one place.

[06:51] You've heard puppet pals, right?

[06:53] I have heard puppet pals.

[06:55] I don't know what I'm hearing when I hear it, but yes, I've heard puppet pals.

[06:58] Ben, Ben's a little bit like me.

[07:00] He left a comment on the Twit promoter's database and he said being younger in the hobby, I enjoy learning the stories and the history of the good old days.

[07:08] Silver Ball Chronicles is an instant listen and a great show.

[07:11] So thank you so much, Ben.

[07:13] We also want to say thank you to Ryan Russell P who also wrote some great reviews on there.

[07:18] There's just a bit long.

[07:19] I just want to keep chugging along here on the intro because I'm sure most people have already skipped ahead 10 minutes.

[07:25] T shirts, of course.

[07:26] You can still get our T shirts over at swelverballswag.com.

[07:30] And you can choose the design of your choice of a mug or a shirt or hoodie or whatever.

[07:36] If you look to support us, you don't want to send us a couple of dollars in an envelope or you just like to say thank you.

[07:43] You can do that by purchasing a shirt because Ron needs that ego boost because he just feels down.

[07:50] Well, I have one question.

[07:51] Do we have stickers?

[07:52] We do have stickers.

[07:53] We do have stickers there.

[07:54] You can stick them all over your laptops.

[07:57] All over your games.

[07:58] Put them right on the back glass.

[08:00] Cover up the the art with our stickers.

[08:02] Yeah, well, I mean, if it were like Game of Thrones, that would work out really well.

[08:06] Or mostever she games after a third year.

[08:09] So one thing that we always do like to do is get corrections and comments on our previous episode or episodes.

[08:18] You can send that over to silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[08:21] So send those in.

[08:23] We read every single one.

[08:24] We usually end up responding and we'll write back.

[08:28] We'll bring it back up.

[08:30] So we actually got a message from a fellow named Bruce from slam tilt podcast.

[08:39] He had a correction or actually not a correction.

[08:43] I guess he had a help us understand one of the things that we were very confused about.

[08:48] And it was the switching from the 44 bulbs to the triple five bulbs.

[08:54] I know if this is your first silver ball chronicles episode, you are just you are so excited to find out the answer.

[08:59] Yeah, Bruce is so happy to give such technical information.

[09:03] People have fallen asleep already.

[09:05] Do you know the 1981 eight ball deluxe had only 44 bulbs?

[09:10] Basically that means just the type of it's a bayonet socket is what he's saying.

[09:15] And the 1982 eight bucks eight eight bucks at it.

[09:19] The 1982 eight ball deluxe LE, which is the one in the smaller rapid fire cabinet, has both styles.

[09:27] So it has bayonet sockets and it has 555, which are those twist sockets that all those 90s Williams games used.

[09:35] In 1984 the second run of eight ball deluxe, not the LE, but the second run of the regular eight ball deluxe, had three quarters 555 bulbs and one quarter for 44 bulbs.

[09:47] I'm glad he sees all fit to let us know all this wonderful information.

[09:52] There and now the world is whole.

[09:55] Yes, here's a question. Why do they switch from 44s to triple fives?

[10:00] There it's easy because it's on a board.

[10:03] It's just like a light board.

[10:05] Okay, you have a light board and a connector and they're a way easier to change.

[10:10] Rather than bending the thing down and screwing it in.

[10:13] Yeah, well you're used to tron so it had the stern one.

[10:16] But if you had any 90s Williams game, how easy does it change a light bulb?

[10:21] Yes, you just twist, pull it out, put the new one in, twist it in, you're done.

[10:26] Yeah, it's even easier nowadays with modern sterns. You just don't replace them.

[10:31] Yeah, unless the whole board goes back and then you got to replace the no board.

[10:35] Yeah.

[10:36] Then you just sell it on and move on to the next one.

[10:39] So Doug.

[10:41] Oh, I love this one. It's Doug.

[10:44] Doug emails us and says, whenever I see a podcast that shows it's two hours and 20 minutes

[10:48] when it pops up in my feed, there is no way I'm clicking the play button on that.

[10:52] Maybe I have a short attention span, but I don't think I'm alone here.

[10:55] See, the sad thing is he won't get to hear our answer.

[10:58] Oh, I know. See, the thing is so I wrote Doug back and I said, Doug, what is the perfect length for a pinball podcast?

[11:05] And he said about 45 minutes or an hour.

[11:08] So what we're going to do here, Ron, this month, and 45 minutes to an hour, what we're going to do is we're going to say you can pause the podcast.

[11:18] Okay. Then seven days later, you can go back in and press play and then finish the rest of the podcast.

[11:27] Does that make sense?

[11:28] Yeah, but I think he wants some separate files.

[11:30] Ooh, that's tough.

[11:33] Well, you're **** out of luck here, Doug. You're going to have to find another podcast.

[11:37] And a lot of different podcasts too, because I think most of them are usually over an hour now.

[11:42] Man, what a life we live.

[11:46] Gene X, he had some great comments about our last podcast as well that he wrote into SilverBall Chronicles of Gmail.com.

[11:53] Yes, I totally remember Xenon the same way since I was kind of scared to play it as a little kid.

[11:58] At the laundry mat I played at, I kept to Cheetah instead and I still like it better.

[12:03] That's good. That's that's why I decision and have one.

[12:06] Also, David is wrong about Flash Gordon. That game is awesome.

[12:09] Nope, it's trash Gordon.

[12:11] No, it's it's it's good game. It's a good game.

[12:13] Grant King says I absolutely love the last episode. This was my era, which of course was the bali 81 class of 81 we covered.

[12:22] I grew up with every machine that we discussed.

[12:24] I love the informative detail of each machine.

[12:26] You guys are great and I appreciate the effort you put into all the research.

[12:30] Well, maybe not Ron.

[12:32] Oh, I just remember everything.

[12:35] That's about it. I'm not really researching.

[12:38] Yeah.

[12:39] So that was great. We love those comments.

[12:41] Send those into SilverBall Chronicles of Gmail.com.

[12:44] If it's a question, comment, concern, you know, something you'd like us to add, please go through.

[12:49] If you've got topics you'd like us to cover as well.

[12:51] You know, I'm always sort of topping up the topics that we have filling out some research in here or there.

[12:57] If you've got something you'd like to toss in, please let us know.

[13:00] And we love to we love to hear from everybody.

[13:03] It makes us feel like, you know, we're not sitting alone at home in our offices with a microphone talking to a person I've never met.

[13:15] That's right. We've never met. It's probably better that way.

[13:18] We have seen each other at least through a Zoom call.

[13:21] That's true.

[13:22] That's actually no, you saw me.

[13:24] I didn't see you.

[13:26] Oh, was I not using the camera? I thought no, I was using the camera.

[13:29] When you finished in the top six at the Expo trivia, I know I had my camera.

[13:33] Oh, that's right. Yes.

[13:34] By the way, finished top six in Expo trivia.

[13:37] Yeah. I finished second.

[13:38] Yeah. Well, screw you.

[13:40] Well, I'm just saying this is an informative history.

[13:44] Just doing my podcast is showing we have real credentials here.

[13:48] That's right. We are actually a big deal.

[13:51] Now, Zach A.J., Zach from Slamtilt, he finished first.

[13:56] He always finishes first.

[13:57] It's amazing.

[13:58] So what are we talking about today?

[14:01] Well, let's jump into today's topic.

[14:04] This is a good one. This is one that I thought since we were kind of in the 80s, we've been in the 70s for a little while.

[14:10] It's time to bring it back, bring it into the 90s again.

[14:14] Let's get a little more sort in the stale Joe.

[14:16] More grungeier.

[14:18] Yeah, let's take off our shirts and tie them around our waist and be sad about our middle class lifestyle.

[14:24] And have a lot of really depressing songs. We usually wear one-work titles.

[14:28] The 90s. That's my era, baby.

[14:31] But yes, please continue.

[14:33] That was pretty good.

[14:35] John Borg, or as he's affectionately known in the industry, Borgie, entered the industry as a mechanical engineer building ramps.

[14:42] He then ended up being a designer on some of the best-remembered nostalgia pins of the 1990s.

[14:49] Borgie got every awesome license in the 1990s.

[14:53] In fact, the other designers at all of the other companies at the time likely described him as the annoying neighborhood kid

[15:01] who was the first to have a Tamagachi, a super Nintendo, who hung outside a blockbuster, after renting Mrs. Doutfire,

[15:09] chatting on a really big brick cell phone and showing off his snap bracelet.

[15:14] He probably was the envy of everyone.

[15:17] Borgie got to hang out with rock stars and movie stars.

[15:21] He was attacked by a cougar. Like the animal, Ron.

[15:24] He had access to movie scripts for unreleased films, which would later become generation defining blockbusters.

[15:31] Yeah, that's actually an important little factoid.

[15:34] Then they would actually get the scripts, like while the movie was being made, and the games would come out at the same time as the movie.

[15:42] Now it's like the movie's got to be out, or maybe the first movie's out and was huge and then the sequel's coming out before a game will come out.

[15:50] This month's topic, Borgie, live in the 90s licensing dream.

[15:55] There's a couple quotes if you want to read those.

[15:57] Do I have to? I know he's our boss and all.

[16:00] If we don't read this.

[16:02] Alright, Zach Manning says,

[16:04] Daddy East Jurassic Park was my first pinball machine in the beginning of my life for Borg designs.

[16:10] That title still holds a special place in my heart.

[16:13] Did that game have a topper?

[16:15] It did.

[16:16] Yeah, that explains it.

[16:17] Listener, Billy Y.J. says got into the hobby in July 2018 and now have four machines, but I haven't played any of these.

[16:25] Well, thanks for the comment, Billy Y.J.

[16:28] He's one of them, one of them poor man pinball podcast followers.

[16:33] So that doesn't quite surprise me.

[16:36] Okay, I don't get it.

[16:38] He hasn't played any of what games like the ones we're talking about to talk about.

[16:42] Talk about, okay.

[16:43] Wow, okay.

[16:45] Let's go all the way back kind of where he starts, kind of in the industry.

[16:49] And like everybody who's in the pinball industry, he played a bunch of pinball.

[16:54] Yes, John says I was hooked on the old Stern game flight 2000.

[16:58] As a teenager, I was going to the archives for Pac-Man and Space Invaders.

[17:02] I moved to pinball and played a lot of Genesis fun house and cyclone.

[17:06] The one that sticks out there, Ron.

[17:09] Genesis.

[17:10] One of these things is not like the other.

[17:14] Genesis is okay.

[17:16] Genesis is a fun game, but it's one of those got leaves system eight years.

[17:20] Yeah, but I refuse to bash got leave.

[17:23] I love those pink ramps.

[17:25] Yeah, you can get them clear too on the internet.

[17:27] Which makes the game better.

[17:28] John moved to college with a focus on manufacturer of things like drafting, engineering, plastics, etc.

[17:35] Yeah, well, you can certainly see where plastics, engineering, drafting, drawing, all of that stuff would come in handy in the pinball industry.

[17:46] Because it's still heavily mechanical.

[17:48] It's still very pen and paper at the time when it comes to designs and moldings and things very, very cool.

[17:55] John wanted to design injection mold machines and materials processing.

[18:01] So what does that sound like?

[18:02] He's making ramps.

[18:03] Sounds like he's making ramps.

[18:05] Now, I don't think he meant to make ramps, but that's more or less what he did.

[18:09] So 1987, while he was in college, he was looking for a job as a draftsman.

[18:14] Or as we call it in 2020, a drafts person.

[18:17] The ad.

[18:18] Wow.

[18:20] The ad in the paper for a company that was looking for some manufacturing support.

[18:27] John says, I ended up in industry by accident.

[18:30] I discovered I was at premiere technology when I arrived.

[18:33] I dropped my other job application in the hydraulics business.

[18:36] Hydraulics is dead.

[18:38] Right?

[18:39] So he just shows up and he's at premiere.

[18:41] So they're like, oh, why don't you come over here and do this job interview.

[18:46] And you walk in and you're in like a pinball factory.

[18:49] Isn't that be weird?

[18:50] It's like just snuck up on you.

[18:52] Wow.

[18:53] That happened to, who did that happen to?

[18:57] Steve Kordek.

[18:58] I don't know if he'll ever get to point where he, because his career was like 60 years.

[19:02] But he literally went in looking for a job, just ran into a random building and it happened to be Genco.

[19:08] And it's like, uh, we're looking, oh, you hear for the position?

[19:13] Yeah, sure.

[19:14] Can you solder?

[19:15] He couldn't solder.

[19:16] Yeah, sure.

[19:17] And there you go.

[19:18] Fake it till you make it, my friend.

[19:19] Yep.

[19:20] So that's when he entered, you know, basically the 1980s God-label, right?

[19:24] So he mentioned he played a lot of Genesis.

[19:25] Well, this is the company that made Genesis.

[19:27] So working as a draftsman under Ray Tanzer and his design team.

[19:32] He also spent a little bit of time learning the ropes with John Trudeau, making victory and, uh,

[19:37] sort of watching it as it was on the line.

[19:40] And of course, you need to learn the ropes somehow.

[19:43] Borgie would say, the first game I had experienced with was Diamond Lady, with John Norris.

[19:49] John was making unique and different types of designs with fun ideas.

[19:54] Yes, Diamond Lady had a ball saver between the flippers that was a drop target.

[19:58] The whole industry kind of at this time was all like trying to make crazy ramps and weirder designs

[20:05] because they were trying to sort of boost creativity somehow to come up with the next great idea.

[20:11] Borg had good timing as the pinball was kind of in its mid-late 80s resurgence.

[20:16] So you had a lot of this creativity and more stuff on the games, if you will.

[20:21] Yeah, he kind of missed out on the downturn and he was kind of getting in at the upswing.

[20:26] John, Borg was laying ramps, switches and subassemblies on the playfield for Diamond Lady, with John Norris.

[20:34] And as we mentioned before, John Norris, you know, fantastic designer, fantastic jack of all trades.

[20:40] I think a lot of those premier guys were very good mechanically with the engineering as well as the design and the code.

[20:46] They weren't siloed maybe as much as like the Williams teams were where each person was kind of the expert in their field.

[20:53] They had to be kind of good at everything.

[20:55] And if you're going to learn the ropes right out of the gate when you're sort of the most impressionable,

[21:00] John Norris is likely the person you want to or time with.

[21:04] You want to talk about some ramps? We're all about ramps.

[21:07] Well, ramps were a much bigger item now than in pinball before by now, we mean the 80s.

[21:12] Borg had a bunch of experience in college with plastics manipulations and manufacturing, which was a big asset for Gottlieb.

[21:19] So he's building ramps.

[21:21] Yeah, John would say that the designer would say, I'd like the ramp to go from point A to point B and give it to the mechanical engineer.

[21:28] I'd use draft paper to design it out.

[21:32] Give it to the molder who would then make the template for the three molds on the machine.

[21:38] John worked of course at premiere for about three years and really enjoyed his time there, but spent a lot of his time being the support person to the teams.

[21:48] And of course, because of his molding experience in the background, he actually added, I would say, probably a lot of value.

[21:55] Now patent fights in the industry, this is pretty common, do you think? Was it run?

[21:59] Very common.

[22:00] Yeah, do you think that they just filed patent lawsuits for fun or were they always poking at each other? It was very weird.

[22:07] There was an understanding and most of the people, the companies all knew each other.

[22:11] I mean, it never looked like it turned out into an all-war of patents.

[22:15] Usually something would be agreed upon.

[22:17] We talked about things like in our stern episode, how they just copied the balli system.

[22:22] I mean, Dad and East just copied the William system, 11 system.

[22:26] So there obviously could have been huge wall suits if they wanted to take it that far.

[22:31] It's like a small pool, right? You don't want to pee in the pool.

[22:34] Okay.

[22:37] Certainly not. Certainly not.

[22:39] While he was at premiere, Borgay actually patented a play field section that would flip and deliver a ball to the other side of the play field.

[22:48] Now, it's difficult in an auditory medium to describe that.

[22:53] But it's basically like the bride of pinbots face where it would flip and the ball would kind of move from the top to the bottom.

[23:00] So Borgay, along with premiere, actually patented that.

[23:04] And of course, Williams would use that in bride of pinbot.

[23:09] I wonder if that was Lyce camera action because it has that feature.

[23:12] There's a mini play field that flips.

[23:15] But I think you're right because he would have worked as a support person around that time.

[23:19] I'm looking up the lights camera action.

[23:24] I'm just curious myself now.

[23:27] So I think that was late 80s, 89.

[23:30] Yeah. And that would have been about the same time or right before.

[23:34] So it could have been, yeah.

[23:36] Yeah. So we're thinking we're thinking that's probably right.

[23:38] If somebody knows if that's right, shoot us an email, silverballcronacles.gmail.com, or our Facebook page,

[23:43] facebook.com slash silverballcronacles.

[23:46] So Gilbert Pollock, who was part of the management group at premiere technologies,

[23:51] well, he called it Williams for the bride of pinbot patent infringement.

[23:54] So what did Williams get or what did premiere get from Williams?

[23:58] Williams let him use the auto-percentaging patent.

[24:01] That sounds pretty good.

[24:03] That's a good tradeoff right there.

[24:04] You know, that's a pretty good tradeoff, right?

[24:06] Like obviously Williams was totally on the wrong side of that patent.

[24:10] And of course they knew that they could get in trouble.

[24:13] And premier saw, you know, hey, there's something we could use, right?

[24:16] Because auto-percentaging, that's a big deal.

[24:19] For everybody, Ron, refreshes again what auto-percentaging was.

[24:22] First use in high speed, it's easier to describe what it was like before auto-replay

[24:27] percentages existed, which is this you set a high score in the settings on the game.

[24:32] That if you went over the high score, you got a free game.

[24:35] Well, the problem is if you put it in a location where a bunch of awesome players

[24:38] and you just get free games all day, or you set it too high

[24:41] and no one ever gets a free game and they get upset.

[24:44] So with high speed, Williams came up with a system where it would move the score

[24:49] required for a replay up or down depending on how many times it was hit.

[24:54] Auto-replay percentageing.

[24:56] Operators loved that.

[24:58] Yeah, and I'm just, and something like that is a big, big deal and likely

[25:02] because all of the manufacturers were using them.

[25:05] They had to pay Williams for that.

[25:07] But still in use to this day.

[25:09] Yeah.

[25:10] Ron, you love, we mentioned this in our GotLeab System 3,

[25:14] Zombie Pinball podcast, back in the archives.

[25:19] You love those GotLeab System 3 flippers.

[25:22] By love, if you mean hate with a passion, yes, that's correct.

[25:25] Yes, that's what I meant.

[25:28] So GotLeab, of course, in the System 80, 80B, 80C era,

[25:32] we're running these like 40 volt flippers.

[25:36] I kind of like them.

[25:38] I like the way that they felt.

[25:39] They were really easy to, to, you know, clean and update and fix if they became issues.

[25:44] Mostly everybody else was using like 50 volt.

[25:47] These 40 volt sort of flippers didn't really have a lot of power.

[25:51] So they couldn't make any of these really cool fancy ramps like they had it,

[25:55] Williams and Bally, is that right?

[25:57] It depended on the game and the condition of the game.

[25:59] But I have been to a lot of shows where you play things like Hollywood,

[26:03] Hollywood, he, or gets with those those steep plastic ramps and you can never make them.

[26:08] But you'll also notice in a lot of those sort of late 80s GotLeabs

[26:13] that the ramps are sort of like it goes up the ramp and then just kind of drops.

[26:18] Like there's no like return fan layout stuff.

[26:21] There's no, you know, loop de loops or anything.

[26:24] Like Genesis, you go up the ramp and it just falls in a pole.

[26:27] It's very anticlimactic.

[26:29] It's just like, oh, but I like it.

[26:31] You get body parts.

[26:33] We keep going back to Genesis.

[26:34] It's going to be like the all Genesis episode.

[26:36] Poor Borg.

[26:37] We're sorry.

[26:38] Borgie actually designed these damn flippers with the 50 volt.

[26:44] Oh my goodness.

[26:45] I mean, calling it the system three flippers,

[26:47] a bit of a misnomer, which Dennis Creasle called me out on

[26:50] because they actually used them before just system three.

[26:54] Yeah, they used them like a one or two games.

[26:56] So, yeah.

[26:57] So, so as a bit of a catch all, but those pointy ass GotLeab flippers

[27:02] that you could trap everything and everybody hates them.

[27:05] And the patron saint of pinball himself, John Norris, emailed us

[27:11] after our system three episode and said,

[27:13] you have his blessing to switch them to the Valley Williams flippers

[27:17] if there's room under the plate.

[27:19] So you have the blessing of the designer.

[27:21] When everybody, oh, GotLeab is the worst.

[27:24] Well, you know what?

[27:25] You can blame John Borg for these freaking flippers.

[27:28] It's all his fault.

[27:29] Wow, there's something new every day.

[27:31] So he wanted to make the flippers more like Dad at East in Williams,

[27:37] but he didn't want to infringe on the patents,

[27:40] which of course was a bit of an issue in the time.

[27:42] So you kind of kind of have to come up with his own design.

[27:44] And that design ends up being what became these end of stroke flippers.

[27:50] I don't know why they couldn't have just changed the bats

[27:54] and just made the coils stronger.

[27:57] The actual max underneath there are really solid.

[28:00] I don't know why they had to change everything.

[28:02] You know, there's another thing, right?

[28:04] John Borg was a great mechanical engineer.

[28:06] You can see that in his designs and we will continue to see that sort of through the podcast

[28:10] that his focus on designing things a certain way.

[28:14] Everything ends up being very solid and smart and well engineered

[28:18] and that comes from his mind around this time.

[28:22] Borgie starts to have a wandering eye in the industry, right?

[28:27] He's three years in, he's working at Premiere, which is, you know,

[28:31] the Walmart or the Dollar Tree of Pinball.

[28:36] Number three.

[28:37] Third number three.

[28:38] Williams is number one.

[28:40] Dad at East at this point is probably number two and Gottlieb is number three.

[28:44] So he starts having this wandering eye.

[28:46] So he applied for various positions at Williams.

[28:50] Williams never called him back.

[28:53] Oh, that's sad.

[28:56] Dad at East, Dad at East Cawd Borgie, he would say their designs were cool.

[29:01] I applied to Dad at East.

[29:02] Gottlieb was more conservative.

[29:04] They had an idea on what a pinball machine was and that was it.

[29:07] Joe and the guys were more daring and loose.

[29:10] I went to talk to Joe Kamenka who hired me.

[29:13] So John was start at Dad at East, the same job he had at Gottlieb.

[29:16] He was a drafts person and of course did a lot of planning, a lot of ramp work and mechanical engineering.

[29:22] Dad at East of course didn't have enough room because they were run on a shoestring budget.

[29:27] So he actually shared office space with Mr. Kamenkao.

[29:31] He was in the same office on the other side of the desk.

[29:35] Sort of like a like a buddy cop movie.

[29:39] I thought you were mentioning lethal weapon three.

[29:41] Borg and Kaskow.

[29:43] That's not like they could totally could be like buddy cop movie.

[29:47] Joe Kamenkao was going to license a secret dinosaur game.

[29:51] Joe wanted John to design a dinosaur that would eat a ball.

[29:55] Give you a guess on what game that was.

[29:57] On his desk he started working on this mech.

[30:00] John would say, I put a magnet in its mouth and it would move over and it would deposit it in another area.

[30:07] It also had arms that could grab and move.

[30:11] Those arms that of course grabbed the ball were eventually used in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

[30:17] Yes, you hear a story about that.

[30:20] They had the arms and it worked great.

[30:23] Then they put the play field glass on it real ice that it just hit the glass every time.

[30:28] Because they had never tested it with the glass in the game.

[30:31] Whoops.

[30:32] Details.

[30:33] Just details.

[30:34] Don't worry guys, it'll get costed out anyway.

[30:38] It didn't.

[30:39] While working on the dinosaur game, John learned that Joe took the hook license to ensure he could get the upcoming Jurassic Park license.

[30:47] Of course they wouldn't get the license for Robin Williams himself because you know Robin Williams is awesome and expensive.

[30:53] They ended up using just a generic Peter Pan.

[30:57] Borg would actually say that he was surprised that it turned out as well as it did.

[31:01] It doesn't often in that I think he's in it.

[31:04] What do they get the actual the DDS game whether he made it in the game?

[31:07] I think he's in there.

[31:08] He's in water world, was he?

[31:09] Dustin.

[31:10] No, Dustin Hoffman.

[31:11] Dustin Hoffman, water world.

[31:12] Oh, you think of Kevin Costner.

[31:13] Who was the bad guy in water world?

[31:15] Dennis Hopper.

[31:16] Oh, sorry.

[31:17] Got some mixed up.

[31:19] But I'm just saying in the actual game, I think he's actually in the game like the artwork.

[31:26] He's working on all this stuff on his desk, but that's not his first game.

[31:29] As the mechanical engineer, when you go into IPDB, you got to be careful at John Borg, especially in his early career.

[31:35] Because he's attached to a lot of these data east games, even though he was not the designer.

[31:40] Like he might have designed one of the mechs.

[31:42] And IPDB has attached him as a designer.

[31:45] So you got to be a little careful.

[31:46] But the first machine that was 100% his was...

[31:50] Start war.

[31:51] Wow.

[31:52] Talk about hitting the ground running.

[31:54] You're the best licenses you could possibly get.

[31:56] Sci-fi theme, of course.

[31:58] October 1992.

[32:00] This was a data east MPU 004.

[32:03] So 10,400 units were talking like the level here of a Steve Richie on his first game.

[32:11] Design, of course, John Borg.

[32:14] Marcus Rothkins, which was his first art package, Sound in Music by Brian Schmidt,

[32:21] and software by Neil Faulkner and Lonnie Robb.

[32:26] Think about this.

[32:27] I think it's the highest production game the data east ever did.

[32:30] Someone can correct me on that, but I thought it was number one.

[32:33] So let's start with Star Wars in general.

[32:35] Okay.

[32:36] So this is early 90s.

[32:38] This is before your prequel trilogy.

[32:40] Yes.

[32:41] That's the trilogy of my childhood.

[32:43] Thank you for that.

[32:44] Yeah.

[32:45] Now, George Lucas.

[32:46] Before all the things that ruined Star Wars occurred.

[32:48] All the Disney stuff, the original trilogy.

[32:53] So let's focus on that.

[32:54] Let's just bring in a little context here of how big this license is at the time.

[32:58] It's, of course, it's huge now, but at the time the original trilogy drew $1.8 billion box office, collective box office.

[33:06] It was a massive franchise at the time for data east.

[33:09] Of course, in 2020, this is the fifth grossing media franchise of all time.

[33:15] It's huge.

[33:16] But at the time, $1.8 billion box office collectively is astronomical at the early 90s.

[33:23] It's rotten tomato scores.

[33:25] So the original Star Wars episode four is a 92% Empire Strikes Back 94% totally agree with that.

[33:32] Return of the Jedi 82%.

[33:34] Yeah.

[33:35] So these are like, I agree with all those actually in exactly that order.

[33:41] He actually, for the design of this machine, he repurposed what was his Jurassic Park play field.

[33:49] So while working on the T. Rex, John started working on Star Wars.

[33:53] John says when I started my first game Star Wars, it was actually Jurassic Park, where the death star was where the dinosaur was.

[34:01] Yeah.

[34:02] That seems very dad-eased, right?

[34:06] Where I feel like they've got all these play fields just in a bin.

[34:10] And then they just sort of like print the artwork on the play field.

[34:14] Like you can just switch everything.

[34:16] Yep.

[34:17] Oh, nope.

[34:18] That's not Ninja Turtles now.

[34:19] It's a vendor.

[34:20] I thought the artwork on this Star Wars is actually pretty good.

[34:23] Yeah, it's not too bad.

[34:24] It's not too shabby.

[34:25] Yeah.

[34:26] Borgui would say that he's most proud of Star Wars.

[34:28] And then it's his favorite game back in the day.

[34:31] The, of course, iconic Jurassic Park arch, which is on the later Jurassic Park game, that was turned into where R2D2 is sitting.

[34:40] One thing that I find pretty neat about that R2D2 toy is that it actually moved left and right, as well as up and down.

[34:47] But of course, that was costed out to use only one coil.

[34:52] Now, this is the second time I've brought up the term costed out.

[34:57] So what's cost-cutting when it comes to building pinball machines, Ron?

[35:01] Well, you have a BOM, a bomb, which is known as a bill of materials that you would need to build your game to.

[35:08] You can't go over the bill of materials.

[35:10] If you do, you're going to get stuff cut.

[35:13] And the bill of materials is per game.

[35:15] It takes into account things like licensing.

[35:17] And that's why it tends to be when you have a huge license that might cost a ton.

[35:23] There might be less on the game because of it, because it costs more for the license per game, etc.

[35:28] Stern's Star Wars.

[35:29] Okay.

[35:30] Ah, such wrong opinions on a history-based show.

[35:34] But Bork says, at Daddy's, we were always costed.

[35:37] We build the machine and try to make it fit the budget.

[35:40] Usually $50 would make all the difference.

[35:43] Imagine that, it'd be $50 off.

[35:45] And you'd have to take it like three coils, and then you'd be back on budget.

[35:49] But the impact is sort of the gameplay.

[35:52] How cool would it be to see R2D2 under the glass turning left and right, and kind of like moving his little legs going,

[35:56] like that's just awesome.

[35:58] Yeah, overall though, it's still going up and down the way it did.

[36:03] It looked pretty darn cool.

[36:05] Yeah, I mean, I would play to Daddy's Star Wars.

[36:09] They tend to be those kind of machine where they are bought and kept in a basement forever.

[36:16] And nobody ever sees it and stuff, because it's Star Wars, right?

[36:19] Yeah, but it has a Death Star, has your moving R2D2, it has the launcher.

[36:26] It's one of those, you reach down and you shift it.

[36:29] It's got a button on the side to fire.

[36:32] They weren't messing around.

[36:34] Right, now Lucasfilm, of course, run at the time by George Lucas.

[36:38] Lucasfilm now is owned by Disney.

[36:40] They actually got to meet George Lucas, which is pretty cool considering.

[36:45] Especially for nerdy folk.

[36:48] George Lucas is one of these icons.

[36:51] Especially when it's called Skywalker Ranch, his house.

[36:54] Yeah, it doesn't get any cooler than that.

[36:56] And I think when you go in through the gates, the first thing you see is a Yoda statue.

[37:01] What more can I say?

[37:04] George Lucas is like a nerd god.

[37:08] Right, you're at the Skywalker Ranch.

[37:10] What do you think that guy's like when he's getting pitched all this stuff?

[37:14] Uh, George Lucas, just with interviews I've seen with him, he's probably bored.

[37:19] Do you think he's wearing that really itchy lumberjack shirt that he's always wearing?

[37:24] Oh, he's wearing. I wonder if his dog Indiana was there.

[37:27] He's like, he's like Steve Richie's always wearing like the black turtle neck.

[37:32] I can see that. Well, George Lucas, I mean, he's got the beard.

[37:36] Love that beard.

[37:37] Yes, I wish I could have a beard like that.

[37:41] But sadly, I'm that Anglo-Saxon European descent where I was clean, shave and all the time because we were gentlemen.

[37:50] Hmm, I'm a tie-in so no, definitely not a gentleman.

[37:55] So John Borg would say that George Lucas was very easy going about it.

[38:01] He wasn't jumping up or down.

[38:03] When he left, his people told us he had a great reaction.

[38:06] George really liked the game.

[38:09] It's like, oh, he wasn't super excited, but you can tell like the people in the room were like, oh my god.

[38:14] Did you see how excited he was?

[38:17] Probably if he didn't like it, he would have been pissed.

[38:20] That's how they know he wasn't pissed. So he must love it.

[38:22] Another cool bit about Star Wars with Daddy East is a gentleman named Fred Young.

[38:27] And we'll get into him a little more down the line here on this podcast.

[38:31] But this was one of the, I would say, best jobs that Fred Young did when it came to voice work.

[38:38] Shoot the death star.

[38:40] Jurassic Park was the next one up, wasn't it?

[38:43] So this is a fantasy dinosaur theme.

[38:45] This is April 93.

[38:47] So you can see the turnovers pretty quick here with machines.

[38:49] This is the Daddy East and what we know is the saga version three.

[38:55] 9,08 units designed by John Borg, Joe Kamenkao and Ed Cubella, who was originally from Gameplan.

[39:03] So there's like a bit of a collaboration here on this machine.

[39:07] Once again, art by Marcus Roth.

[39:11] Yeah.

[39:13] Roth Kranz.

[39:15] I'm thinking it's Ed Cubella, not Cubella.

[39:18] I could be wrong there.

[39:19] And I know it's definitely not, definitely Sega, not saga.

[39:23] Sound and music by Brian Schmidt, which is not brain Schmidt is written here.

[39:29] X Williams employee.

[39:30] Yes. And John Williams did the music on this machine as well,

[39:34] which is a big get for Daddy East.

[39:36] Wow, that John Williams would come in and do the sound.

[39:39] I'm guessing that it's probably just the music they lifted.

[39:43] Yeah.

[39:44] But you can dream.

[39:46] I can dream.

[39:47] And Neil Faulkner, Lonnie Robb and John Carpenter, who I don't think is the director, did the software.

[39:55] No, no.

[39:56] The thing is, so he got Star Wars and his next game is Jurassic Park.

[40:00] Like, wow.

[40:01] That is crazy.

[40:02] That is crazy.

[40:03] I could tell you, you know, that is, and this is, this is like his first three, like all

[40:09] in designs, too, right?

[40:10] Like he's not getting diamond lady or he's not getting black night.

[40:14] He's getting like the biggest movie franchises probably of my childhood.

[40:21] Daddy East, they had it going on.

[40:23] I mean, Williams, you get Congo and, and shadow here at Daddy East, we get Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Batman.

[40:32] Stuff is getting weird.

[40:34] It's getting weird in the industry now.

[40:37] Branding and licensing is way ahead of where it was really in the, in the early 80s from a

[40:43] previous podcast.

[40:44] It's still branding is still, but now we're getting into like some serious stuff here.

[40:49] This is the 1993 film based on the novel of the same name by Michael Criten.

[40:55] Steven Spielberg had learned about this novel somewhere around 1989, and he purchased the rights for the

[41:01] movie for $1.5 million, regardless of if they made the movie or not.

[41:06] And Criten also was able to finagle his way into getting a percentage of the movie's gross

[41:13] earnings.

[41:14] Good move.

[41:15] Such a good move.

[41:17] I mean, my goodness.

[41:18] This is when Spielberg was like everything he touched just turned to gold.

[41:23] Now, the film had a budget of $63 million back in 1993.

[41:28] So what I've done is I've thrown that into an inflation calculator.

[41:31] That's about $100 million adjusted per inflation.

[41:34] So that's a healthy budget when it comes to movies around that time, you know, like a $20 million

[41:40] budget was a big deal.

[41:42] The box office was $1 billion in 1993 dollars.

[41:46] That's $1.6 billion adjusted for inflation.

[41:49] That is, that is astronomically huge.

[41:52] It's so funny.

[41:55] At this time, Ron, it seems like the big hits were like the biggest just smashes ever

[42:01] where sort of every other movie was just kind of a regular movie.

[42:05] Fun fact, I still have never seen it.

[42:07] You've never seen Jurassic Park.

[42:09] I've never seen Jurassic Park.

[42:11] Wow.

[42:12] So in our previous podcast, I said I didn't see Flash Gordon and you were upset about that.

[42:17] Yeah, it was.

[42:18] And you haven't seen Jurassic Park, probably one of the f***ing greatest movies of my childhood.

[42:24] I'm sorry.

[42:25] Why do you hate my childhood, Ron?

[42:26] I'm just not really into the dinosaur thing.

[42:29] Raptors?

[42:30] No, I'm more of a Godzilla type guy.

[42:33] So I think I will be satisfied soon.

[42:35] Going with like Australian hunter guys with like folksy accents that hunt things.

[42:41] I'm good.

[42:42] Ron Tomatoes likes it though.

[42:43] 91% on Ron Tomatoes.

[42:45] 91% on Ron Tomatoes.

[42:47] So we're talking like movies that are actually not just good, but are

[42:53] astronomically high on the scale, right?

[42:56] Anything over 90 in my opinion is probably a pretty friggin awesome movie.

[43:00] If you know of any movies that are at 90 plus on Ron Tomatoes, it's actually very bad.

[43:04] I would love to know.

[43:05] Shoot us an email.

[43:06] SilverBalk Chronicles at gmail.com.

[43:08] So the movie scripts, you talked about this a little bit in our introduction.

[43:13] Basically, you would get a script, you'd get a presentation or some rough cup clips from the movie.

[43:20] And then you would then sort of design your pin around that.

[43:24] That's a pretty crazy thing to think that you're getting a pinball company at a Chicago

[43:31] that's assigned part of the data East Empire.

[43:35] And you're getting scripts to Steven Spielberg movies before they're released.

[43:40] And you don't even know if the movie's going to be a hit.

[43:43] But as you said, at that point, if Spielberg is directing, it's probably going to be a hit.

[43:47] Thank God they didn't get AI, right?

[43:49] Well, that was pretty good movie.

[43:55] Yeah, the Schindler's list pin, not so much.

[43:58] No.

[43:59] Do you remember that T-Rex toy we talked about earlier?

[44:02] Yeah, the one with the arms and the magnet mouth.

[44:06] That sounds familiar.

[44:08] The magnet mouth.

[44:10] So Borg was behind with trying to get the T-Rex toy fully working.

[44:15] It broke switches in the beginning.

[44:18] And so they ended up having an external company actually redesigned the production T-Rex.

[44:23] Yeah, so they had to get it finished.

[44:25] They had to get it in the box.

[44:27] And I'm sure that the guts of it was there sort of everything they needed.

[44:32] They just needed somebody to actually finish and refine it.

[44:35] And yeah, so that came from one of Borg's interviews, which I found pretty interesting,

[44:39] that they didn't do it in-house.

[44:41] The other thing about Jurassic Park, it had the smart missile.

[44:45] Oh yeah, it's got the gun down on the bottom with the little button.

[44:48] Little bunks.

[44:49] So the smart missile was your kamikaze idea.

[44:51] And it scores all the play field features when you hit it.

[44:54] So it's-

[44:55] So, okay, I've played Jurassic Park a few times.

[44:59] I played it sort of earlier in my pinball endeavors.

[45:04] And I didn't quite get how the smart missile worked.

[45:08] So it takes all the shots, not just one shot, right?

[45:12] It takes whatever you need.

[45:14] And mostly it's usually used, if you start multi-ball on that,

[45:17] during multi-ball you want to spell chaos.

[45:21] So if you start multi-ball and you still have your smart missile,

[45:25] you have a guaranteed chaos.

[45:27] Because once the ball drains you're out of multi-ball, like before it registers,

[45:30] before it goes into the trough, you hit smart missile,

[45:34] and it'll give you all the chaos letters and starts chaos, multi-ball.

[45:38] Ah, yes, okay, I see, that's very good.

[45:41] So it's usually disabled internaments for that reason.

[45:44] Oh, okay.

[45:45] It was a neat little feature, and they did use it in the sequel.

[45:48] I think Lost World has it also.

[45:50] Very cool, very cool.

[45:52] And that ties in, of course, to Keith L. Wynne's stern redesign as well, right?

[45:55] So it has the smart missile feature, although it's not the same.

[45:59] You actually shoot the ball, that one.

[46:01] And it does have chaos letters, just like the original.

[46:04] Now, IPDB would also say that apparently the smart missile was a homage

[46:08] to the Defender video game.

[46:10] Okay.

[46:11] Interesting.

[46:12] One thing that here is that this game has what I would like to call the World Wind Controversy.

[46:19] Are you familiar with what I'm talking about here?

[46:22] That looks a little like whirlwind.

[46:24] It looks a lot like whirlwind.

[46:26] That it's got those two scoops in front of the pop bumpers on the left side.

[46:31] It's got an upper flipper kind of going in.

[46:34] Instead of a ramp, it's more to an orbit.

[46:38] Some similarities there.

[46:40] I wouldn't say that it's identical, but there is some similarities.

[46:43] What do you think of the art?

[46:45] So we talked about Marcus in the first, his first pin, which was actually pretty good with Star Wars.

[46:54] It fits very well.

[46:55] This looks very, very similar.

[46:57] It's got that kind of lines drawn in there.

[47:00] I think the art is okay.

[47:02] I know there's the issue with, was it Nedry?

[47:05] What's the guy's name?

[47:07] What show is he in?

[47:08] Was it Thurrock from the Sun?

[47:09] Silent Felt.

[47:10] Oh my god.

[47:11] Was it any Thurrock from the Sun, too, though?

[47:13] That was a long time ago.

[47:15] I'm sorry.

[47:16] I didn't watch either show, actually.

[47:18] I guess his fingers were messed up.

[47:21] He's got nubs.

[47:23] He looks like he was eating some candy bars and he just went too deep.

[47:28] Oh, he ate his own fingers.

[47:29] That's what it looks like.

[47:31] That is not a fat joke, by the way.

[47:34] I would say it's okay.

[47:35] The dinosaurs are okay.

[47:39] The style is strange, in my opinion, on the play field.

[47:44] It's got these, like, instead of shading or dots,

[47:48] or it's got, like, these weird lines instead.

[47:52] It's very, very much his style.

[47:56] And as you, I think, move through his list,

[48:02] of games at Data East, they all look very samey.

[48:08] Well, we were talking about patents before.

[48:11] Yes.

[48:12] And I know back in the day when they had Jurassic Park on test,

[48:16] they actually had Williams went in there and covertly filmed it.

[48:20] Because they believed it was using their ball-sensing technology,

[48:25] that, like, fun house use.

[48:27] When Rudy his eyes follow the ball around.

[48:30] Oh, yes.

[48:31] Yep.

[48:32] If you watch the dinosaur, he kind of follows it around a little bit,

[48:35] and they were looking at that.

[48:37] Speaking of other bits and pieces here,

[48:39] this game has a thing called Tribal.

[48:42] And what is Tribal, Ron?

[48:44] It's basically multi-ball, but they call it Tribal.

[48:47] Because you can't use the name.

[48:49] Yes, that's because of a game called LithoWeapon 3,

[48:52] one of my favorite data East games.

[48:54] Oh, ruined it for everybody, didn't it?

[48:56] Well, they called it multi-ball in that game,

[48:58] but then they also had little digs at Williams,

[49:01] like, if you were in the video mode,

[49:03] where you got to shoot different characters,

[49:05] like, you shoot the bad guys, but don't shoot the innocence.

[49:08] But one of the things that would pop up would be a cow,

[49:10] and if you shot that, you got points,

[49:12] little, little digs like that.

[49:14] Mmm.

[49:15] Williams didn't really appreciate that, so...

[49:17] That was the...

[49:18] We don't want to get sued, so we're going to change the name.

[49:20] Little bit of...

[49:21] Little rivalry there.

[49:23] You know, little back and forth.

[49:25] IPDB, we list last action hero as a game

[49:29] that John Borg was involved in,

[49:31] and I just want to point out that he did the crane, basically.

[49:37] When you dig a little bit deeper in IPDB,

[49:40] there are some of the time things like this pop up,

[49:43] and in an interview,

[49:44] John said that he didn't really want any credit for this game.

[49:48] Even though he designed the coolest thing in it.

[49:50] The crane, he is...

[49:51] What's the crane?

[49:52] So awesome.

[49:54] Very, very cool.

[49:55] You shoot up a ramp,

[49:56] it goes around the orbit,

[49:57] it goes into a vertical upkicker,

[49:59] up onto the crane,

[50:00] the crane will then move it and drop it over into a lock.

[50:03] Very cool.

[50:04] You notice very rarely are cranes used in pinball

[50:07] where they're not cool.

[50:08] Yeah.

[50:09] Can't think of a bad one.

[50:10] Well, it's chunk yard, a crane,

[50:13] kind of.

[50:14] It's got a wrecking ball.

[50:15] But even that's cool.

[50:16] I think it is.

[50:17] Yeah, it's kind of cool.

[50:18] So the next game he did was another license.

[50:21] Tales from the crypt.

[50:23] I mean, Tales from the crypt.

[50:25] When I was a kid, you know, in 1993,

[50:28] I'm like, what, six, seven, eight?

[50:31] Wow, I'm feeling old.

[50:32] Geez, yeah.

[50:34] I just remember the crypt keeper,

[50:36] and I just thought he was the coolest thing.

[50:39] It was so cool.

[50:40] It was so creepy.

[50:41] So this is like a fantasy horror license theme.

[50:43] This is November of 93.

[50:45] So we had one game earlier in 93.

[50:47] He's got a second game later in 93,

[50:49] which is, we're talking like Gottlieb cycles here.

[50:53] This is a data east in what we've come Sega,

[50:56] version three, board set.

[50:59] It's 4,500 units.

[51:00] So we've slipped considerably here.

[51:03] We've got Marcus Rothkrantz and Kurt Anderson on art.

[51:09] Sound and music by Brian Schmidt.

[51:11] And software by Neil Faulkner.

[51:14] Christina Doe-Nofrio.

[51:17] The Nofrio, I'm guessing.

[51:19] Just being Italian, I would think the Nofrio is just a bad one.

[51:23] Hey, that was a bad, I had to sound that outfidinetically

[51:26] and it was still really wrong.

[51:28] And John Carpenter, of course,

[51:30] taking a time off of directing.

[51:33] Now, Dion LeBlanc would say on her Facebook page

[51:36] that I love tales from the crypt.

[51:39] I agree.

[51:40] And I agree as well.

[51:41] Next to Lito Up and Three,

[51:43] it's probably my favorite data east.

[51:45] It's very similar playfield.

[51:47] And it's got a lot of stuff going on.

[51:49] I like that.

[51:50] And it's a similar playfield to Tommy.

[51:53] It's like Tommy reversed.

[51:55] And instead of the mirror, it's the tombstone.

[51:59] But it has the cryptkeeper.

[52:02] Oh, you know, I am the cryptkeeper.

[52:04] Welcome to the crypt.

[52:06] I am a bone to be with you.

[52:08] That's very good.

[52:10] How can you not like that?

[52:11] Love tales from the crypt.

[52:12] Now, the HBO TV series.

[52:14] So in Canada, we didn't have HBO.

[52:17] But I had one of these CBAN satellite dish systems

[52:21] when I was younger that would literally move

[52:23] and point into the sky.

[52:25] And these things were great.

[52:27] And we got HBO because that was a big deal.

[52:30] Now, this is based on the EC Comics series of the same name.

[52:35] And each episode was sort of a self-contained kind of

[52:39] tongue-in-cheek, pun-filled horror, like adventure, I guess.

[52:44] But R rated.

[52:45] It was on HBO.

[52:47] So that meant that it was free from all censorship.

[52:49] It had more creative freedom.

[52:51] You could have graphic violence and sexual activity

[52:53] and nudity and drugs and the whole thing.

[52:56] And man, they went for it, didn't they?

[53:00] They had all kinds of guest stars too.

[53:03] Like I remember, I remember the one with,

[53:06] oh, what's his name?

[53:08] Don Rickles in it where he's like, oh, what is he?

[53:11] He's like a puppeteer but he has to retire.

[53:13] And it turns out the puppets actually his can join twin.

[53:16] It's part of his hand.

[53:18] Oh my god.

[53:19] I think it is Bob Goldwhite in it too.

[53:21] Yeah, yeah.

[53:23] I just remember that one.

[53:25] If you check out the Wikipedia, like, there's people like Brad Pitt

[53:29] and Acroid, Iggy Pop Slash, who's very topical at the moment

[53:32] in pinball, Michael J. Fox, Tom Hanks.

[53:35] He's talking like B-list, like, actions, right?

[53:38] We're talking like some proper actors and entertainers on here.

[53:42] So, I mean, how was the show?

[53:44] I mean, I saw a couple episodes but I mean,

[53:46] we're talking like 25, 30 years ago, right?

[53:48] Oh, it depends on the episode.

[53:50] It's all episodic.

[53:51] Okay, it's kind of hit and miss.

[53:52] Yeah.

[53:53] It's episodic.

[53:56] So, like, I remember the one Don Rickles won,

[53:59] I just said because I thought it was awesome.

[54:01] But I'm sure there's ones that maybe weren't as awesome

[54:03] as I were even better.

[54:04] Yeah.

[54:05] Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 82%.

[54:06] Oh, that's respectable.

[54:07] It's your TV series.

[54:08] Yeah.

[54:09] The design.

[54:10] There's some really cool design elements on this machine.

[54:14] And I wanted to bring out a couple of them.

[54:16] One of them is the 180 ramp.

[54:18] So, if you've seen Jurassic Park by Stern,

[54:21] it's got two of these ramps that you shoot up

[54:23] and it flips over backwards.

[54:25] Very similar to the one on the monsters as well, also by John Borg.

[54:28] He put a 180 ramp in this thing.

[54:30] And that's kind of like the first time that's been done.

[54:32] And it works so well.

[54:33] I like the targets that are eyeballs.

[54:36] So, instead of just stand up targets with like a circle,

[54:39] they're like a half a sphere.

[54:42] So, they look like little eyeballs.

[54:44] So cool.

[54:46] So fun.

[54:47] Yeah.

[54:48] And then they repurpose the mirror mech from Tommy

[54:51] and made it a tombstone.

[54:52] And it has a lot of modes.

[54:54] It's got like seven or eight modes of things to do,

[54:57] which is really, really cool.

[55:00] And you had mentioned the Cripkeeper callouts.

[55:04] So, that's John Casser.

[55:06] He, the actual Cripkeeper guy.

[55:09] Yeah.

[55:10] He came in and it is something else.

[55:13] That was Borg said.

[55:14] He took our speech list and took it to another level.

[55:17] What are the other bits?

[55:19] It's pretty cool.

[55:20] It's like the, in this era of pinball,

[55:24] you couldn't just have a plunger anymore, right?

[55:27] Oh no.

[55:28] I have a gimmick.

[55:29] In the first two Borg games, we have, we have the Star Wars

[55:33] with the handle.

[55:34] Like you could, you could move the thing up and down.

[55:36] It's got a little trigger on the side.

[55:38] With Jurassic Park, you had a trigger,

[55:41] but with the smart missile button on top.

[55:43] And then on this game,

[55:44] Tales from the Crypt, you have a door knocker.

[55:46] Yeah.

[55:47] It's like, it's like a big,

[55:48] it's like a big handle you would see on like,

[55:51] like a mansion.

[55:52] And it's got, it's so cool.

[55:54] So, this is, this is pretty weird.

[55:56] I heard John Borg talk about this in one of his interviews.

[55:59] I think it was a top cast interview.

[56:02] And that'll be in the show notes along with all the other stuff

[56:04] we've got here.

[56:05] And the handle itself was actually a quick set,

[56:10] like branded handle.

[56:13] Like you would have in the door of an actual home.

[56:16] And they got it from Home Depot.

[56:18] And so, if the handle, John says,

[56:21] if the handle breaks,

[56:22] you could literally go down to a hardware store

[56:24] and fix it.

[56:26] The tongue mechanism that's there.

[56:29] So, they ended up using those handles

[56:31] and then made the outside sculpture

[56:34] and of like a objection mold.

[56:37] And then they sort of stuck it on the mechanism.

[56:39] Yeah, John Borg said we were buying quick set locks

[56:42] and tossing the door handles into the dumpster our back.

[56:44] The dumpster was full of genuine quick set handles.

[56:47] I feel like Gary Stern missed an opportunity there.

[56:50] Like, if Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace

[56:54] were like a thing,

[56:55] I feel like nowadays Stern would probably put those online

[56:58] to try to sell them.

[56:59] Well, it seems like back then they had stuff on the game

[57:02] that would be considered a mod now.

[57:04] Yeah, yeah.

[57:05] It's like, check out my door knocker mod on my

[57:07] tail sum the crypt.

[57:08] It's like, oh, no, that was actually factory.

[57:10] Really?

[57:11] John also mentioned in this interview

[57:13] that he wanted to do a mystery door feature

[57:15] where you use the flippers to choose a door

[57:18] and then you use the door handle to actually open the door.

[57:21] But they just didn't code it in,

[57:23] which was super, super cool.

[57:24] So there's like a, there's a bit of a mini thing in there

[57:27] where you, where you choose a door,

[57:29] but it just goes through automatically, right?

[57:31] Yeah, it's, I think that if I remember,

[57:34] or I might be thinking of the skill shot

[57:36] because they have guillotines,

[57:38] like, like, and they rotate,

[57:39] and you hit the right one and the guy's head gets cut off.

[57:42] There was a back box, a topper with lights.

[57:45] So in the original production machine,

[57:47] so if you've got an earlier production machine

[57:50] of Tails from the crypt,

[57:52] there are five green inserts on the top of the back box,

[57:56] and originally there were supposed to be some GI

[57:59] and flasher lights in the head of the pin machine,

[58:02] in the pinball machine,

[58:04] that would then flash on a topper that was on the top.

[58:07] But...

[58:08] Cost it out.

[58:09] At the end of the game, it says in loving memory,

[58:11] in loving memory of William Gaines.

[58:14] He was a publisher of the Tails on the crypt comic series.

[58:18] He also, it was Tails from the crypt,

[58:19] and it was another one.

[58:20] It was another big one, I can't remember.

[58:21] There was another big one.

[58:22] It was like a couple of them with the comic series,

[58:24] and he's also might be known as the founder of Mad Magazine.

[58:28] Oh, yeah, that's right.

[58:30] And he died June 1993 at the age of 70.

[58:33] Yeah, just before this pin was released,

[58:35] so there's a little bit of him in every one of those games.

[58:39] And the artworks here.

[58:42] Right? Like, the lines, the things,

[58:45] it works really well here.

[58:47] It's got these creepy ladies,

[58:49] which I think are, they just, they're hilarious.

[58:52] On the play field,

[58:54] there's like these bikini ladies,

[58:56] but they've got the crypt keepers face,

[58:59] which, you know, works really well for pinball, right?

[59:02] There's a workout guy,

[59:04] so there's a guy who's all like buff,

[59:06] and, you know, working out, and hard body,

[59:09] but he's got the crypt keepers face.

[59:13] The spinner run has a guy laying on a stretching table.

[59:18] And as you flip him,

[59:20] it sort of looks like he's getting stretched a little bit.

[59:22] The rack.

[59:23] That's right, the rack.

[59:25] Oh, yeah.

[59:26] It is, it is just really cool.

[59:28] It's kind of fun.

[59:29] It fits that stock,

[59:31] because it's this morbid kind of horror face melting thing.

[59:35] So if you've got somebody with nubby fingers,

[59:38] like Newman, you know,

[59:40] it'll work more in this bin,

[59:41] because it's, that's the way it is.

[59:45] We're just going through our show notes here, folks,

[59:47] and here's something that's quite topical.

[59:49] Yeah, that sounds familiar.

[59:51] Guns and roses.

[59:52] The original GNR.

[59:54] This is the music licensed theme from June of 94,

[59:59] Data East Sega version three board set,

[01:00:04] 3000 units, so we're still slipping a bit more here.

[01:00:07] The design, this is a very collaborative game

[01:00:10] with John Borg, Joe Kamenkao,

[01:00:12] Lyman Sheets, Jr.

[01:00:13] That's an interesting name.

[01:00:15] And of course, Slash.

[01:00:18] Marcus Rothkran's, again, on art,

[01:00:23] Sound and Music, Brian Schmidt,

[01:00:25] and Guns and roses.

[01:00:27] And software by your favorite coder,

[01:00:31] Lonnie Robb, Orin Day, and Lyman Sheets, Jr.

[01:00:34] Slash's involvement.

[01:00:37] Very much like today's Jersey Jackpin.

[01:00:40] Slash was very much involved in licensing this game

[01:00:44] to Data East.

[01:00:46] Yeah, according to the story,

[01:00:49] he wanted, he wanted a Guns and roses game.

[01:00:52] So Joe Kamenkao decided to humor him,

[01:00:56] like he'd listened to his pitch,

[01:00:58] but he had no intentions of making a Gun and roses.

[01:01:00] Pinball machine.

[01:01:01] And then when Slash arrived,

[01:01:04] he had to walk through the factory

[01:01:06] to get to where their offices were.

[01:01:08] So when he walked through the factory,

[01:01:10] people did what they probably usually do around Slash.

[01:01:12] Like, holy shit, Slash.

[01:01:14] So you can have your own, you have an autographs,

[01:01:17] and the commotion that was caused,

[01:01:19] Joe Kamenkao just completely changed his mind at that point.

[01:01:22] There's no way we can't make a Gun and roses pinball machine.

[01:01:25] Yeah, and at that time,

[01:01:26] we're talking like peak, peak, peak, right?

[01:01:29] Like, I mean, they're big now.

[01:01:31] In 93, they were, yeah,

[01:01:33] they were still more, I would say,

[01:01:35] in the relevant phase of their career.

[01:01:36] Yeah, they're not in that sort of dad rock faded.

[01:01:39] No.

[01:01:40] You know, maybe some new people find us thing.

[01:01:42] This is the, you know, this is big deal, big, big time.

[01:01:46] One thing, apparently, that Slash really, really, really,

[01:01:49] really, really wanted was some sort of snake pit,

[01:01:52] because he's a thing that way.

[01:01:54] And he wanted a little bit of help

[01:01:56] with the artistic direction.

[01:01:57] So we spent a couple of weeks with the design team working with them.

[01:02:00] By the sounds of it,

[01:02:02] he had some involvement,

[01:02:04] but he wasn't greatly involved.

[01:02:06] I think the involvement that he's probably head with Eric Minier,

[01:02:09] in Jersey Jack is probably much bigger

[01:02:13] than what he actually did with Daddy East.

[01:02:15] Yeah, he would attend,

[01:02:17] they would have the meetings,

[01:02:19] the regular meetings for the game,

[01:02:21] and he would attend those.

[01:02:23] And as Lyman Sheet said,

[01:02:25] that was one of his jobs.

[01:02:27] He had to go out and get the booze for Slash,

[01:02:29] so be ready for him when he arrived.

[01:02:31] Nice.

[01:02:32] Yeah.

[01:02:33] See, the crazy thing is now,

[01:02:35] when you see, like,

[01:02:37] could you imagine these guys working with Slash at the peak?

[01:02:40] And then you got Eric Minier dealing with him now,

[01:02:42] and he's like older.

[01:02:44] You know, he's still cool.

[01:02:46] Like, I don't like guns and roses at all.

[01:02:49] Oh my.

[01:02:50] I really, really don't.

[01:02:52] But Slash is something else, right?

[01:02:54] Like he is his own, you know, phenomenon.

[01:02:58] And he might not be drinking the jack, you know,

[01:03:01] on a Tuesday anymore.

[01:03:03] He's still very cool.

[01:03:05] There's a secret song in this game

[01:03:07] that is only available on this game.

[01:03:09] It's called Ain't Going Down.

[01:03:11] And it's heard on the Daddy East Pinball machine.

[01:03:14] It is an unreleased song by Guns and Roses.

[01:03:18] So that's crazy.

[01:03:20] What's even crazier is they got Axel to do actual speech for it.

[01:03:23] Yeah.

[01:03:24] He's in there.

[01:03:25] And this is before at Cheeseburger Axel.

[01:03:27] Very nice.

[01:03:28] Yes, this is thin, thin Axel.

[01:03:30] And the other thing is the snake pit.

[01:03:33] That was the name of Slash's group.

[01:03:35] Slash's snake pit.

[01:03:37] Oh, I get it.

[01:03:38] I get it.

[01:03:40] So John Bork says the second time we met with Slash,

[01:03:43] we went to his house in LA.

[01:03:44] It was right after the earthquake in 1993.

[01:03:46] Slash had a pet cougar,

[01:03:48] the size of a German shepherd.

[01:03:50] It was walking like a house cat around the house.

[01:03:53] It rubbed me and wanted to be pet.

[01:03:55] It laid down and I rubbed its belly.

[01:03:57] Don't rub a cougar's belly.

[01:03:59] It grabbed me, flipped me over, and has jaws right on my neck.

[01:04:02] Joe yells and slashed yelled at the cat.

[01:04:04] Get off.

[01:04:05] Like he would do a dog, and the cat just got off of me.

[01:04:07] I wasn't a little bit of shock at the time.

[01:04:09] That's insane.

[01:04:10] I've never been attacked by a real cougar like the animal.

[01:04:14] And, you know, that's great.

[01:04:17] First of all, of course a rock star has a cougar, right?

[01:04:22] Like it is mansion.

[01:04:24] You can have a normal pet.

[01:04:26] Right.

[01:04:27] Now, something tells me that Eric Minier probably didn't see Slash.

[01:04:31] He probably saw Slash with like a lady cougar,

[01:04:35] not like an animal cougar.

[01:04:38] Things have totally changed.

[01:04:40] I think nowadays compared to the way they were back then

[01:04:43] it's crazy sort of early 90s, late 80s rock stars.

[01:04:47] That's a pretty nuts story.

[01:04:49] That's an awesome story.

[01:04:50] Here's John Borg, a guy who kind of went to drafting college,

[01:04:54] knows how to do injection molding machines and stuff like that.

[01:04:58] All of a sudden he's at friggin' Axles house.

[01:05:01] I'm sorry.

[01:05:02] He's at Slash's house being attacked by a cougar.

[01:05:05] That's an awesome story.

[01:05:06] I mean, yeah, you didn't run the police in a, you know, a Porsche.

[01:05:11] But got attacked by a f***ing cougar in Slash's house.

[01:05:16] That's so much cooler than just calling him on Skype when he's on tour.

[01:05:20] So this is a wide body of daddy's.

[01:05:22] They didn't do many of them.

[01:05:23] They did not.

[01:05:24] John says it was a narrow game and we made it a wide body.

[01:05:27] Williams had come out with Twilight Zone and we wanted to try a wide body.

[01:05:30] We followed the competition.

[01:05:31] So we added the snake ramp and extra lanes.

[01:05:34] Now, we spoke about building materials.

[01:05:37] The build of materials did not increase with the size of the machine.

[01:05:42] So you're spending more on the size of the machine.

[01:05:44] What they did is they just made sure their money went a little further.

[01:05:47] Which basically meant they just put less in it.

[01:05:50] Some of the machines in the production run actually had a headphone jack

[01:05:53] located in the front of the cabinet, which I didn't even know until I started researching that.

[01:05:57] It actually had two two shooters had the regular shooter on the right and it had the rose shooter on the left side.

[01:06:06] Yeah, sort of like a fun house.

[01:06:08] Fun house.

[01:06:09] Yeah, exactly.

[01:06:10] Yeah, two different coils were used for the auto launch.

[01:06:12] Apparently in the first production runs, the first part of the production run,

[01:06:17] the auto launcher wouldn't get the ball up the launch ramp.

[01:06:21] And sometimes it would have to give it a good couple of kicks before it made it all the way up.

[01:06:26] Let me correct myself before someone corrects me.

[01:06:32] Yes, it didn't have two shooters.

[01:06:34] It had the rose shooter on the left on the right was actually a gun.

[01:06:39] Because someone's going to get me on that one.

[01:06:42] So I have to correct myself.

[01:06:43] That's right.

[01:06:45] That's crazy.

[01:06:46] Are we 45 minutes in yet?

[01:06:48] Why?

[01:06:49] Because we got to tell everybody to pause this and then restart it next next next.

[01:06:54] Oh, we passed that a long time ago.

[01:06:56] Oh, man, we screwed that up.

[01:06:59] If no one could tell that we're actually we had a five hour delay.

[01:07:03] Because my power got knocked out right in the middle of Star Wars.

[01:07:07] I think someone knocked someone knocked out the shield generator on indoor knocked out my power.

[01:07:12] So we had to get that repaired.

[01:07:15] Yeah, I'm so sorry, Doug.

[01:07:18] We really let you down again two weeks in a row.

[01:07:21] So there's always next month.

[01:07:23] Now there was going to be a shot specific to the band members,

[01:07:28] which then would lock a ball on a wire form.

[01:07:32] But that was cost to do, which is interesting because on the newer guns and roses,

[01:07:35] there was a shot for each band member.

[01:07:37] Oh, and there's a lock at the top.

[01:07:40] An interesting thing.

[01:07:41] According to Slash, the thing he liked about the game was you had to assemble the band to get them on stage,

[01:07:48] which knowing how notorious guns and roses was for being late and having trouble getting everyone on stage,

[01:07:53] he thought that was quite funny.

[01:07:56] And the other interesting thing is this game ended up in litigation.

[01:08:01] What?

[01:08:02] Yes, Gilby Clark, who was the guitarist for guns and roses,

[01:08:05] well, he got fired, I don't remember, fired, quit, whatever.

[01:08:10] Around the time when this game was made, he's in the game.

[01:08:13] So he sued because he didn't get his consent to be in the game.

[01:08:17] So every time you lock a ball and it says, Gilby, like, oh, Gilby didn't approve of that.

[01:08:23] I'm silly.

[01:08:24] So you should feel bad about yourself when you play the game.

[01:08:27] He didn't get his cut.

[01:08:29] Now, G&R was done in four months.

[01:08:31] Usually it's four to six months, which is still really short.

[01:08:35] So this thing was like slapped together and out the door pretty quick.

[01:08:39] Can you tell I haven't played a guns and roses.

[01:08:42] That's got a ton of stuff on it.

[01:08:44] It's got the guns in it.

[01:08:45] The G&R ramps.

[01:08:46] They're kind of cool.

[01:08:47] It's kind of gimmicky.

[01:08:48] I don't really like it, but it's cool.

[01:08:51] It's a one shot thing, getting all the band members together,

[01:08:54] but the multi-ball is cool.

[01:08:55] It's another one of those data east, multi-stage, multi-ball.

[01:08:59] Where you start the regular multi-ball, then if you hit, I think if you can hit both ramps,

[01:09:05] it becomes paradise city multi-ball, where all the balls come out.

[01:09:09] Is that like a Lonnie Rob thing, do you think?

[01:09:12] I'm sure it was Lyman.

[01:09:13] I think Lyman probably came in at the end and he made all the good parts.

[01:09:17] No comment.

[01:09:19] You know, one day we're going to have to do an episode on Lonnie Rob.

[01:09:22] You're going to have to take all these insults back.

[01:09:24] That's right.

[01:09:25] Actually, I have nothing against Lonnie.

[01:09:29] Richie Rich was the next machine that he worked on,

[01:09:32] and this was actually just a movie prop for the movie Richie Rich with McCulley Culkin.

[01:09:39] It was used in the movie where they played it.

[01:09:42] It was actually just Tommy that had been re-skinned to Richie Rich,

[01:09:47] but it actually played.

[01:09:48] It had some rules.

[01:09:49] It had a multi-ball.

[01:09:50] It was a pinball machine.

[01:09:52] You can see pictures of that on IPDB if you really care.

[01:09:55] Daddys did a few of those.

[01:09:57] They had the air and spelling game.

[01:10:00] They had the Michael Jordan game, which I think were both lethal weapon three,

[01:10:05] re-themed.

[01:10:06] Yeah.

[01:10:07] Because they just had a lot of those parts laying around because lethal weapon three wasn't very good.

[01:10:11] No, the opposite.

[01:10:12] They made a ton of them.

[01:10:14] The next game.

[01:10:15] The next game that Borg spent a lot of time working with everybody else

[01:10:26] and working on a lot of their projects.

[01:10:30] But the next full game that he worked on was Frankenstein.

[01:10:35] It's a Monsters Horror Movie License theme.

[01:10:40] It's January of 95.

[01:10:42] It's a Data East Second Sega version 3B.

[01:10:46] 3000 units.

[01:10:47] So, man, we're really...

[01:10:49] Each machine is selling less and less as we move deeper into the 90s here.

[01:10:55] Art by Paul Ferris.

[01:10:58] There's a new artist, Brian Schmidt and Lonnie Rob and Lyman Sheets on Code.

[01:11:06] And by new artist, Paul Ferris, we mean old artist, new to us and we're Data East here.

[01:11:12] Yeah.

[01:11:13] So this film, man, I think I remember seeing this maybe once.

[01:11:18] It's one of those like...

[01:11:19] Is it one of Robert De Niro is the monster?

[01:11:22] Yeah.

[01:11:23] It's a real rock creation.

[01:11:25] It's got Helen Bottom Carter.

[01:11:27] It's got John Cleese in it from 1994.

[01:11:31] It's one of these more kind of artsy horror kind of movies.

[01:11:38] It's based on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel.

[01:11:42] Yes, from the year 1818.

[01:11:44] Frankenstein.

[01:11:45] So the original writing of Frankenstein.

[01:11:48] And it is considered to be the most accurate portrayal of the novel of any film that has ever been done.

[01:11:55] It had a $45 million budget.

[01:11:58] So that's $76 million in today's dollars.

[01:12:01] So let's tie that back.

[01:12:03] Okay, let's tie that back to the last time we talked about big budget movies.

[01:12:09] It had a $100 million budget for Jurassic Park.

[01:12:13] They had a $100 million budget in today's dollars in Jurassic Park.

[01:12:18] And there you can see that you got Robert De Niro and a bunch of guys in here.

[01:12:24] And this movie is still only $76 million.

[01:12:28] It did $112 million in the box office, which is $178 million.

[01:12:34] That is a far cry from $1 billion.

[01:12:38] Right.

[01:12:40] One of the critics made those doesn't like it.

[01:12:42] 38%.

[01:12:44] They went a little too artsy, I would say.

[01:12:50] That's what happens, man.

[01:12:52] So you can see, okay, this is, oh my goodness.

[01:12:55] This is a whole, this is a whole thing now.

[01:12:58] What is also very interesting about Frankenstein is that Sega produced this game.

[01:13:06] This was no longer data east at the time.

[01:13:09] Now it had become Sega.

[01:13:11] Now Sega had produced pinball as Sega Enterprises limited from 1971 to 1978 with some classics like nothing.

[01:13:22] Oh, that's not true.

[01:13:25] They're Spanish affiliate with Segusa.

[01:13:29] And they did games like Prospector.

[01:13:33] Yeah, I guess we'll get into that some other time.

[01:13:37] Data East and Sega had this interesting relationship.

[01:13:43] So the cost of using all of these high profile licenses was catching up to data east.

[01:13:50] And you can see that they've spent a lot of money and a lot of these licenses.

[01:13:54] And then that's, that's where you get into some of these choices you have to make.

[01:13:59] Right.

[01:14:00] So if you look at Williams at the time, that sort of Valley Williams era and everybody fawns over Valley Williams.

[01:14:06] Valley Williams mechanics and there was so much in the game and magnets in the ball would hit a, you know, I'm thinking of theater magic where the balls hitting a crate, the crate rotates and then it goes in the thing and behind it.

[01:14:21] And then there's a magnet on it and it's like defurters and stuff's getting crazy over there.

[01:14:28] And you go to data east and things are a little like they're cool, but they're like.

[01:14:33] They're kind of ho-hom right.

[01:14:35] But instead of theater magic, we're talking Jurassic Park, right?

[01:14:41] Like we've got some themes dinosaur toys, not ho-hom it eats your ball.

[01:14:46] Yeah, but it's it well, let's go beyond that then and let's move into like lethal weapon three.

[01:14:53] Well, let's go back to the last action hero with the crane super cool toy.

[01:14:58] Yeah, it's okay.

[01:14:59] I'm hurting your argument here.

[01:15:01] You're you're you're winning and I don't like losing this argument.

[01:15:05] But I will say daddy's definitely went for much higher profile licensing.

[01:15:12] And the code wasn't there.

[01:15:15] They had this sort of got-leab issue where the code was kind of there and it was like copy-paste and then they changed a few things and moved on to the next.

[01:15:23] And daddy's did have a thing where at least some of the came some music sounded almost the same from title to title.

[01:15:31] It's like they would find it annoying noise from the movie and just put it on the spinner.

[01:15:36] It was awesome. Thanks daddy's.

[01:15:40] And the thing who the cost of those licenses really started to catch up with them.

[01:15:46] Now Williams was able to spend all that time on you know code on innovation on on manufacturing.

[01:15:54] Well, they spent a lot of their time on these big budget themes and those themes did produce sales like let's not let's not just sweep that out of the carpet.

[01:16:04] People bought and played a lot of these games because of the themes and they sold because of the themes and they got quarters because of the themes.

[01:16:12] So daddy's parent company decided to sell the factory and the assets to another Japanese game company called Sega who then created Sega pinball.

[01:16:22] Everybody remembers Sega from the home console Genesis.

[01:16:25] Sega.

[01:16:27] Sonic.

[01:16:28] Like the hedgehog I played some Sonic the hedgehog this week actually on the old PlayStation for this.

[01:16:34] You know, we'll get into a whole daddy east episode some other time kind of the creation of daddy east and all of that stuff.

[01:16:41] But they were a video game company and a Japan and they had their own pinball division.

[01:16:48] You know that didn't work out and it was costing a lot of money.

[01:16:52] I'm sure they were making money but they probably weren't making a lot of money in comparison to what they thought they should be making when you looked at especially by the mid 90s.

[01:17:00] Especially and you can see starting to take the downturn all those numbers that we're talking about all start to come down right like Star Wars at 10,000 units an hour down to like 3000 units.

[01:17:11] So this was the first fully made in house Sega game monster.

[01:17:18] So this is the original Jurassic Park or part of the original Jurassic Park dinosaur design as mentioned previously originally had a head motor and a body motor which moved around.

[01:17:28] It was cost it out.

[01:17:31] Oh there.

[01:17:32] Oh man or take a drink everybody was cost an out.

[01:17:35] They were also worried about ball hang ups and moving.

[01:17:37] I would be more worried I think probably with the ball hang ups and stuff of that.

[01:17:40] That's a I mean when you look at it it's kind of a neat Mac it looks silly but it is kind of neat the way it works.

[01:17:46] Oh it's very neat and that comes from John Borg and the way John Borg design things right he was a mechanical engineer right he loved that kind of stuff and all of his games especially in daddy East all head that kind of stuff which was cool.

[01:18:01] It has an awesome backlash it has an awesome awesome awesome backlash Paul Ferris.

[01:18:08] He is so good when it comes to portrait styles and paint if you go to a show where Paul Ferris is at odds are he might actually bring the original canvas painting that he drew for this probably the best part of the game.

[01:18:24] Frankenstein has the extra large DMD yeah 192 by 64 pixels.

[01:18:31] Oh the HD if it's time cost 60 more dollars than the standard DMD it's funny when you put it in dollar amount right yeah there's some of your you could have spent that on a Mac possibly who knows but they did look cool they did look very cool.

[01:18:46] It had to what they're trying to do is they're trying to stand out a little bit right they're trying to differentiate themselves to look a little bit different than everybody else.

[01:18:53] Yeah one way they did that was this was this extra large DMD not a bad idea really.

[01:18:59] The other changes is instead of the D E on the flippers now it has sonic the hedgehog on the flippers that was very cool when I read that so like on the on the left side so instead of saying like got Lee or or Williams have the little w it's got a sonic that's a cool little feature.

[01:19:15] Sonic also appeared on the DMD as well so it would say Sega one thing that's a bit interesting is that the sonic is actually the monster so he's got stitches kind of like.

[01:19:27] The Frankenstein monster on the DMD so it's not just sonic as he normally was on all the other games he had like he had like stitches in his face was very cool very nice detail that was something that was really funny that would come out with Sega is all these kind of interesting little details.

[01:19:45] It also had a six player display code prototype which was used as a proof of concept where you could play six players instead of just four that wasn't actually released until the smash hit Baywatch.

[01:19:57] Great game. Yeah we call that we call that moose knuckle up here in Canada.

[01:20:01] Another way they wanted to differentiate themselves Ron was that you could choose your music when you play the game so you put your quarters in you hit your start button and then you can choose the left flipper or the right flipper.

[01:20:13] Left flipper or the right flipper left flipper is film soundtracks if you wanted to be fully immersed in in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein you choose the left and if you wanted Edgar Winters Frankenstein theme you chose the right flipper.

[01:20:29] I would choose the right flipper. Yeah I probably would.

[01:20:31] Oh yeah. Let's talk about Fred Young for a minute. I said we'd get to him. He had a lot to do with this game and I think probably added you know the best parts of this game.

[01:20:47] You know Fred Young you've met him. All I met him. He would come to expo every year.

[01:20:52] Fred Young might not be somebody that sort of our listeners know especially if they're younger to pinball or newer to pinball but he's definitely somebody you've heard.

[01:21:04] He started doing different voices at the age of seven following tons electomy operation and he began mimicking Huckleberry Hounds voice while watching the TV show.

[01:21:15] Or can you do a Huckleberry Hound.

[01:21:17] Oh which one is he again? Oh boy. That's the Hanaba bearer ones. I'm more into the classic like looney tunes.

[01:21:25] 40s 50s shorts era. I didn't watch a lot of those other one. The yogi bearer and all that stuff I didn't watch.

[01:21:33] Yeah yeah in high school he used to copy his teachers and answer questions using their voice.

[01:21:39] This led to Sesame Street characters and then of course Star Wars. He actually did Star Wars voices in the movies and this sort of those background voices.

[01:21:51] In 1970 he took a job at an insurance company after impressing them with his telephone voice.

[01:21:57] And this led him to being spotted and invited to join a radio show.

[01:22:03] Then after that a lot of other offers for using voice work started to flow in Fred first got involved in pinball when he was doing some recordings for an all state insurance ad in Chicago.

[01:22:15] He got a call from recording studio saying that a company wanted him to voice a pinball machine after hearing his demo tape.

[01:22:22] Not knowing anything about pinball he thought it sounded like fun. He ended up meeting Gene Roddenberry, Joe Kamenkao and Brian Schmidt when they were working on 1991's daddy east star trek 25th anniversary.

[01:22:37] How cool is that he got to meet Gene Roddenberry. He went on to do a game after that of course being Star Wars which we mentioned he did the voices for back to the future.

[01:22:46] He did that really crappy game lethal weapon. He actually is Joe Pesci's voice. Joe Pesci didn't even do that Fred did that. That is pretty cool.

[01:22:58] He did the voices for Maverick. He did Frankenstein. He did Sharky shoot out the ultimate classic and Harley Davidson and of course he even did Stern's Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:23:10] He's very good at pirates. I think the pirate voices are very good in that game. Another really kind of cool little Easter egg here under the apron. There's a little Frankenstein pinball machine with Jay Borg written on it stands for John Borg.

[01:23:25] I think so.

[01:23:27] Twister was up next. Wait a minute. He got to do Twister. Yeah. Does he do any movies that don't make tons of money?

[01:23:33] I'm telling you man. He is living the licensing dream. I literally didn't realize he did this many huge licenses. Like every tremendous Frankenstein still made money as much as we kind of panned it there.

[01:23:46] But all these other movies. These are blockbuster movies. Yeah. Twister was a disaster movie license theme. This is April of 96. This is a Sega Stern white star system.

[01:23:57] What's interesting here is all of a sudden we don't know how many units they're selling. It's designed by John Borg art by Paul Ferris. Sound a music Brian Schmidt and software by Lonnie Robb and Warren day.

[01:24:11] I like how whenever says Lonnie Robb you write loony. Yeah. Is that a like.

[01:24:17] Like. It's a currency in Canada right like the. That's right. That's bad. It would auto correct to that. I think actually. You're using Canadian word. Yeah. Canadian word.

[01:24:29] A friend of the pod Edward Partridge from down on that. He would say Twister.

[01:24:36] Okay. Thanks for the feedback Edward. Take it. He didn't like it. Guess not. The film. Now this depicts a group of storm chasers researching tornadoes during a severe outbreak in Oklahoma. This stars Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton.

[01:24:56] The legendary bill Paxton. Yes. Wait. Wait. That isn't Bill Pullman. Is it Bill Paxton? I love Bill Paxton. He's a terminator. He got. He got killed by Terminator, a predator and an alien. He has a great distinction. Although he's never really shown getting killed by the terminator. So I dispute that.

[01:25:16] The movie had a 90 million dollar budget. 138 million in today's dollars. Wait a second. What's it? What's it? He also in Spaceballs? Bill Paxton. No. Oh, no. That was Bill Pullman. If you're talking about the. Yeah. Yeah. He was in Independence Day. That was the bad. No. That's not Bill. No. That's the other guy. Yes. The guy that. Look exactly the same. No, they don't.

[01:25:40] So this had a 90 million dollar budget. Adjusted for inflation. So 138 million dollars. Which is kind of crazy. So if you think we're in 1996. It's been three years later. This is around Jurassic Park budget levels. And it had some serious serious special effects. Oh, yeah.

[01:26:02] And it did $490 million in the box office. That's 750 million with inflation. That's a huge. What I remember about this movie was the Dodge truck.

[01:26:16] This is when Dodge changed their look of their their trucks from that kind of old square 80s truck to like a kind of a rounded cooler 90s. You know, things are changing and becoming cool. That and that truck just gets the crap kicked out of it. The whole the whole movie.

[01:26:36] And I remember that truck a lot because all of a sudden they just appeared everywhere here in my province. It also lost the the Oscar for best visual effects to Independence Day starring Bill Paxton. No.

[01:26:54] Ron tomatoes doesn't like it though. 53% rotten tomatoes. This is not like this movie. And to be honest, I saw this movie in the theater. And I thought it was awesome. I was also like 11.

[01:27:06] So I haven't seen it since then, although I would love to see it again to actually see if it holds us.

[01:27:13] Did the special effects hold up because Jurassic Park special. They were good. They were good. The very beginning when the guy gets sucked out of the storm seller into the.

[01:27:21] Oh, no, spoilers. Well, come on. Well, the design itself, Twister came up quick and they didn't have much time to make changes once the first whitewood was complete.

[01:27:32] So John got a patent on the magnetic spinning disc, which he has used a few times since just a few just a couple this spinning disc.

[01:27:44] Kind of like whirlwind then had a magnet in the middle so it would stick to it while it would spin. And this is like this is almost like Steve Richie's left side ramp.

[01:27:56] Right. Like this has been used quite a few times. It's a very very big John board signature. Yeah, X-Men, turtles, teams meeting into turtles. These are quite a few times.

[01:28:10] Yeah. Yeah. So he got to see again movie stars. This is he got to, you know, the film at the time when they were doing the shooting, they had rented an old school and they were prepping for, you know, shooting at the school.

[01:28:25] And then they go out and do the shooting and then they go back. And when John Borg and the group actually entered the the cafeteria of this school, which where most of the movie stars were just hanging out, Bill Paxton was singing pinball wizard on the other side of the room.

[01:28:42] Bill took them over to Helen Hunt's trailer and they just had a good chit chat. Apparently John Borg would say Paxton was super friendly, which is awesome.

[01:28:54] That is just awesome. Helen Hunt at the time was a big deal. I'm trying to think there was Philip Seymour Hoffman was in that I think also I think there's a story that he didn't have his consent for him to be on the back glass.

[01:29:07] And it didn't realize that so they actually already had it like ready for production. Oh, no. But then when then he then when Hoffman saw it, he thought it was like the coolest thing ever that he was on a pinball machine. So they judged the bullet. Yeah, they're like, yeah, cool.

[01:29:20] Now we've got some cows in this game. And you can get cow multi ball by shooting the orbit nine times. And that gives you a five ball multi ball cow multi ball, which it's from the movie because there's a cow they get sucked in by the the twister.

[01:29:38] Spoiler, but I wonder if that's like almost a mini dig on Williams with their cows. It's probably both.

[01:29:44] This is an odd one. Okay, so doing the research. This one popped up a couple times. It's called mini Viper. It's a car license game. It was June of 96. It's a Sega Stern white star.

[01:29:55] They have really they kind of had like one unit designed by John Borg, art by Jeff Bush. Sound Brian Schmidt again and software by Orin Day.

[01:30:07] This was originally a concept to have a modern game in a 1950s cabinet. So operators were often complaining to the manufacturers that the head the games were getting too big.

[01:30:21] Right. So think about the system three god leaves were just with these massive heads. And they had these smaller areas they couldn't fill in their arcades because these pins were just getting big.

[01:30:32] So they came up with this idea to make a small game. So it's basically their answer to safe cracker. Yeah. So John says we built this game and took it to the A O M A show.

[01:30:45] Customers said how come you didn't make it normal size. Yeah, perfect. So they tell them hey, you should make a small one and then it shows up. They're like, hey, that's a great game. Why didn't you make it the regular size like Thanksgiving.

[01:30:56] Well, just we'll just run through that one. The lost world Jurassic Park dinosaur movie theme, June and 97, Segister and white star. We don't know how many units were made art by Morgan reistling doesn't have credited sound and music, which I find interesting.

[01:31:20] But you know, I'm probably going to say Brian Schmidt because that's like the only one that works there apparently for sound and music and software by Warren day and Neil felcanner.

[01:31:31] Did you see this movie?

[01:31:33] I didn't see the first one. So yeah.

[01:31:39] But the film was the highly anticipated follow up to the smash hit Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg.

[01:31:46] The 1997 film is based on the book Lost World Jurassic Park by Michael Cricht, which was specifically written because of the success of the first film and for the sole purpose of being the base of this sequel film.

[01:31:59] How awesome is it that you're like, well, that movie was really good. I better write another book so I can sell that so I could write another movie. If you remember, Michael Crichton got a percentage of the gross. So he probably made so much money. This was he felt this was the least he could do.

[01:32:13] Yeah, I mean, you got to help him out a little bit, right. This had a $73 million budget, $110 million. Now, but we're also like like five years out, right. So we've had five years plus a little bit of inflation. So we're getting a little bit higher budget.

[01:32:31] It's still higher with $618 million box office just under a billion dollars. So another just just just amazing, you know, piece of work.

[01:32:46] I thought the movie was good. So Borgie received the script and reviewed it and he was super excited to do another Jurassic Park. Since the original movie was such a hit.

[01:32:59] Then he saw the movie and he was a little bit let down. I have no frame of reference. Yeah, rotten tomatoes gave it a 53. I think that's probably a bit low. It's not that bad. It's not Jurassic Park at 91. Like that's an all time great movie. But what's kind of weird and interesting is that the movie has a scene where they're kind of like hunting down the the dinosaurs.

[01:33:24] And it's like a Humvee and the guy kind of goes out and it picks up the dinosaur and sticks it in a cage and puts it on its back.

[01:33:33] It was called the snagger or the snagger truck in the script. John said that he read that in the script. He said that would be a very cool toy work and go and pick up the ball and whatever.

[01:33:43] And sadly, he did all the design work put it in the game and then the final movie basically cut out the snagger and you just sort of see it in the background. That's a bummer.

[01:33:56] But that's kind of what happens when you get the preview copy, right?

[01:34:00] The thing is that toy. I played many lost worlds. I think I played one where the toy worked. Oops. It also has an egg toy, which is like it opens up kind of like the movie.

[01:34:13] And then it's like a little dinosaur. When the snagger actually works, it is damn cool. It's a cool little toy, but it hardly ever works. And that's the problem with it.

[01:34:23] It's sad that it's kind of small and situated where it's at because you can't really see it really, really well in comparison to the egg.

[01:34:33] It would be cooler if it was maybe larger and more prominent, but that's being a bit picky. So the art.

[01:34:39] Ooh, I complained a lot about the Jurassic Park art to begin with, but this one's even worse. It's like this is when we're getting into the to the Photoshop era, right where people have learned, oh my god, you can just get these stock photos and just drag and drop and throw in some colors.

[01:34:57] But it's got like this weird, you call of switch of colors from the bottom. It's like reds and oranges and then kind of moves up the play field. It looks, oh my god. And the logo's the insert writing. It's just it's all god. It's bad. It's bad.

[01:35:15] It's bad. Oh, I don't even want to talk about it. Can we just move on? We can move on. The thing is other than that, that driving game that small game there has borg done a non licensed game. No, that he's designed interesting.

[01:35:33] He's got a couple coming up here, maybe, but we'll talk about that in a second. So let's move on to a really good movie. Lost in space. Oh shit. Never seen it. Yeah.

[01:35:42] It's a sci-fi license movie theme. It's May of 98. I've heard of the show. That's someone with the warning warning danger will Robinson robot.

[01:35:51] Exactly. Segister and white star is he in the movie kind of it's got 600 units. How do you think we know that?

[01:35:58] John said it on the podcast. Uh oh. So it's not sell very good. Did not sell very well. Yes. Art by question mark. I don't know who that would be.

[01:36:10] Brian Schmidt. Or in day Neil Faulkner again on software. So the film.

[01:36:17] This is 1998 sci-fi film directed by Stephen Hopkins based on the 1960s TV show of the same name. The series was then also inspired by the 1812 novel, the Swiss family Robinson.

[01:36:35] Basically, the, you know, this stars Joey from friends, Gary Oldman and Heather Graham. The idea is the like the Swiss family Robinson before where they get shipwrecked and they got to like live somewhere.

[01:36:55] Robinson family goes into space to go to a nearby star system to begin colonization of new planets because the earth is dying. Wow, that's a titan home.

[01:37:08] There are ship is thrown off course because of an evil saboteur and they try to find their way home. Man, I loved the original lost in space, the black and white lost in space. I watched that almost every morning before school on well, it was Nick at night, but it was just playing reruns, I guess. And it was so great. You didn't see the original show.

[01:37:32] I've seen clips from the original show. I feel like that's right up your alley because it's old space nerd theme. Right, you're like me like sci-fi stuff. That's a long time classic. I guess I lose my nerd call cards sometimes. Yeah, you've even watched Doctor who either. I mean, that means all the failure's Doctor who either it's because and not all about the British and their teeth. Oh, 80 million dollar budget.

[01:38:01] So we had a hundred and twenty million dollar budget. This is a big, big, big budget. It's it did a box office of a hundred and thirty six million dollars or in today's dollars, two hundred and five million dollars.

[01:38:18] That's a train wreck.

[01:38:20] Yeah, really made like 80 million dollars. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, by today's yeah. And Ron Tomatoes doesn't like it either. Twenty eight percent.

[01:38:32] Twenty eight percent. I did see this movie. I think I saw it on VHS. And if you don't know what that is, just Google it. And I think I was back in the day when you go to blockbuster or whatever, you pick up a movie. I'm pretty sure I did that. And I saw it with a body.

[01:38:49] And we are just looking at each other and going, Oh my God, this is bad. And that's when you're a kid. And like, you know, oh God, it was really, really, really bad. Really bad. The acting was bad. The directing was bad. The story was bad. Well, when they designed the robot, right? It was bad.

[01:39:09] Oh, when they got the script, they were really excited. After leaving the theater, they slowed down their effort on the pen. They moved on to the next project. Yeah. So this game actually pretty much has uncompleted code. And you can see that they put a lot of effort into it. And then it just doesn't go anywhere. And you can totally tell that.

[01:39:30] This is when we start getting to do another sort of shift in the pinball industry. It's 1999. Williams has bailed on pinball and they've moved directly to WMS gaming and their gambling devices.

[01:39:45] Pinball 2000 has kind of done its, you know, end of the gate and died. You know, Williams is out. Got leave is out. You've got Sega left. And quite frankly, they weren't really the, you know, killing it here with sales numbers by what we can tell.

[01:40:05] Later that year in 1999, seeing the collapse of pinball and arcade gaming in general, they decided to sell their pinball division.

[01:40:16] President of the division at the time was Gary Stern. And of course, he had been running the company since Daddy East was created in 1986. And he stepped up to take a huge risk and buy a pinball company, which is basically run on a shoestring budget.

[01:40:33] With all the other big manufacturers like Williams, got Lee began all forced or quit out of the business. You know, I don't think Gary gets enough credit for taking the risk that he did in that time and buying the company.

[01:40:50] That being said, I bet you he got a manufacturing plant facilities, tools, all that stuff. He probably got a cheap.

[01:41:00] And it was all the same stuff they had. They never moved. Yeah. So Daddy East probably spent a boatload of money to start the company up, you know, tool everything.

[01:41:10] Then they sold it, you know, probably at a loss or whatever they could get to Sega. And then Sega's like, I need to get the hell out of here and get whatever I can.

[01:41:18] And they probably sold it to Gary granted. He probably didn't get it like dirt cheap, but he probably got a pretty good deal on buying an entire manufacturing.

[01:41:26] Thank you, Gary. Money, which was then formed is the Stern pinball incorporated, which all of us know today. And it's based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.

[01:41:36] The soul survivor. Yeah, because Sega just could have said, well, screw it. We're at it here and then shut that down and move on, right? They pretty much did.

[01:41:44] Motorcycle brand license theme from 1999. It's a Sega Stern white star sells about 6,000 to 7,000 units. That's a guesstimation from John designed by John Borg and Lonnie Rob spelled correctly.

[01:42:04] I don't know who did the art and the music and sound done by Kyle Johnson who did Alvin G's sound and music and early Sterns. This is kind of where he's done software by Lonnie.

[01:42:19] 100% first Stern game. All the others were sort of like Sega holdovers. We'll talk about them some other time kind of at our maybe beginning Stern episode or something like that.

[01:42:31] Gary was so proud of the title that Stern reran this title a couple of times. Ron, Gary Stern is quite the Harley guy. So if you're looking to suck up to Gary Stern, you want to make sure that you buy a Harley and drive it around.

[01:42:48] So he sees you on it.

[01:42:50] Fried to live, live to ride Harley Davidson. Actually, I think that's the that's the Williams Harley Davidson game.

[01:42:58] So Harley Davidson, you know, it's a lifestyle brand. Did you know that? Yes, I do know that.

[01:43:06] So along with Indian Harley was one of the only survivors of the Great Depression in this in you know motorcycles and they worked for years to become what they became today.

[01:43:19] Today they are a 5.7 billion dollar annual revenue company and they have 10 billion dollars in assets. They are a monster.

[01:43:30] They have t-shirts. They have the hog branding. They have just they're just iconic. They've got this this Merrick image.

[01:43:41] Even though you know, a lot of their motorcycles are slowly being made overseas like Brazil and India while they're closing plants in the United States, but they've got an America image.

[01:43:53] You can't go wrong with a license like that. Could you?

[01:43:56] It's not the first Harley Davidson. I said, Williams did one.

[01:44:01] That Williams did one under the I think it was under the Bally label, but it was Williams.

[01:44:06] Yeah, so they they actually ran that game twice. Then they made changes on the third run, different changes like that.

[01:44:15] So it was originally on the front of this in the middle of the play field, it's got like a Harley motorcycle and you shoot or you shoot the targets and then it does like a like a wheelie, which is super, super cool.

[01:44:28] So originally it had a much smaller bike. It had six pop bumpers and it had crisscross ramps kind of like a taxi.

[01:44:37] The bike toy is really the major focus here. Have you played one of these right?

[01:44:42] Oh, yes. You hit it enough times and then it actually comes up and you can hit them all underneath it.

[01:44:47] Yeah, the wheelie bike was actually John's idea and he found this toy at Target.

[01:44:54] So what we've discovered here is when John Borg has to make a game, he just wanders around hardware stores and toy stores and then just makes a game.

[01:45:06] He tinkered with the model. So he bought the toy, he tinkered with it and he created a simple motor assembly, which would go inside the bike, which would then make it do a wheelie.

[01:45:18] On the rerun, when they reranum, Stern found a larger bike model, like a large touring bike, like a fat boy.

[01:45:26] John was laid off from Stern by the time the second and third runs happen. John didn't like the rerun machines as much.

[01:45:32] He would actually say that the third edition art package was a bit meh.

[01:45:36] Now the first two runs, the rider on the middle of the play field, if you get right down in there, you look really, really close.

[01:45:43] It's actually a woman behind the face shield, not a man. So Borgie was quite happy about that.

[01:45:51] He estimates about 6,000, 7,000 games were actually sold. And that's big time at the time.

[01:45:58] So if we think about the Sega games that had been coming out at the time, we're certainly not selling 5,000 units, let alone 6 or 7.

[01:46:11] Now, this is where we get into Dennis Creasel's favorite game.

[01:46:17] I think he cried for four days when he sold this machine.

[01:46:21] Sharky's shootout. It's a pool, billiards semi-licensed theme.

[01:46:29] This was made in September of 2000. It's a Sega white star. We don't know how many units were sold designed by John Borg and Lonnie Robb, as well as some input.

[01:46:39] From John Norris, artwork by John Yosey, music and sound by Kyle Johnson, and software by Delight Dwight Sullivan.

[01:46:49] Oh my goodness, there's this guy. And Keith P. Johnson and Lonnie Robb.

[01:46:54] So this is the first game that John and Dwight would work on, and they wouldn't work together again until the monsters.

[01:47:03] Most recently, T.H. Mutant Digital.

[01:47:06] Have you ever played Sharky's?

[01:47:09] Oh yeah.

[01:47:10] It's kind of fun. It's like a eight-band deluxe.

[01:47:12] I played the original version, which was called Golden Cube.

[01:47:15] Yes.

[01:47:16] It was designed by John Norris. They end up with Sega. They ended up not using it.

[01:47:21] And they just did a slight redesign and changed the theme and became Sharky's shootout.

[01:47:27] The original one had Kelly Packard. I guess it was on Baywatch. I never watched Baywatch.

[01:47:34] But I guess she was on Baywatch, so she was on Golden Cube. And I played that also somewhere.

[01:47:41] I think the Museum of Pinball and Baning, California, has this.

[01:47:46] Very cool.

[01:47:47] Very cool. So around that time, sort of John Norris had a falling out with Stern, and he left.

[01:47:53] He's now working a deep route, which he mentioned in the podcast around God-Leban System 3.

[01:47:59] Now, he's working on an eight-ball deluxe style kind of game at deep route.

[01:48:09] And it's like a medieval 1980s theme.

[01:48:15] And it's not, it's said in some of the deep route package that it's not kind of traditional.

[01:48:20] Well, if I were a Batman, I would look at Golden Cube. And then I would extrapolate that to today.

[01:48:28] I would add a pinbar. And then I think we've got something here.

[01:48:33] So Golden Cube was designed by Sega Pinball and incredible technologies, who you will know from the Golden T Golf Games.

[01:48:43] So like Golden T, the game was designed to be linked with other games and play internaments across the country to win prizes awarded for high scores.

[01:48:54] So it had goal-oriented play.

[01:48:57] A player must complete tasks, a checklist, and then the game ends.

[01:49:03] So the faster you complete the checklist, think of like a Jurassic Park speed run.

[01:49:08] Like I said, I think there's something here. If you look at deep route, John Norris, eight-ball deluxe, I think John Norris was working on something here that wasn't a regular pinball machine.

[01:49:20] And I think that that's what's, I think something like that is going to be what's coming with deep route.

[01:49:25] So keep your eyes peeled for maybe if that comes out.

[01:49:31] Anything Ron?

[01:49:32] We'll see. We'll see what happens.

[01:49:35] Okay, let's get back to Sharkey's because this is not a, this is a, this is a John Borg podcast.

[01:49:41] So Gary basically gave John Borg all the parts, the ramps, the drops, the eight-ball deluxe assembly, some de herders, and just basically said like here, just make a game.

[01:49:52] Right. And that's what came out of Sharkey shootout.

[01:49:58] I haven't played Sharkey shootout, but I have played eight-ball deluxe. And for some, I don't know what it is about that, that side flipper shot into those stand-up drop bank.

[01:50:09] It's, it's, it's so fun. It just drives me crazy. So when you think of like bad girls, which is the mirror version, you can't go wrong with that layout, can you?

[01:50:21] And Sharkey's shootout is a licensed game. As it has genetically, as a well-known pool player, round the back, round the back less.

[01:50:32] Super cool. Super cool. Now, she's, they like, they have her likeness and it's pool theme, but it's not like a theme or it's not her game.

[01:50:42] It's kind of cool how they did that. They kind of made it theme-y, but not so much.

[01:50:47] It's kind of cool. This is, this is one where I'm just, I'm excited to talk about this one. Austin Powers. Of course, it's a movie licensed from September of 2000.

[01:50:59] It's a Sega Stern white star. We don't know how many units were sold. John Borg, Lonnie Robb. Not sure who did the art music.

[01:51:08] So the sound here was Kyle Johnson and software by Lonnie Robb and Keith P. Johnson. So the second game with Keith Johnson working on it.

[01:51:18] Now this film, let's, let's, you know, we're following the same thing here. This is the spy action comedy film series starring Mike Myers, the Canadian icon, the number two to Ed Robertson's number one.

[01:51:34] Also Ed, you know, send us an email. Ed sent Canadian email sent us an email. Come on. I'm Canadian.

[01:51:45] He is. I mean, he's the real deal. He's the real deal Canadian too. I mean, even as everything's felt wrong in the Canadian way on these show notes. Elizabeth Hurley. She's in that. She was fantastic. Heather Graham. She was in the spy who shag me. Seth Green. Just amazing.

[01:52:02] And Vern Troyer who is mini me. So the, did you see these movies? I saw the first two first two were great. I actually saw a gold member just popped up the third movie on Netflix this past week. And I'm like, you know what? I'm going to watch that. I remember seeing it at the time when gold member came out and

[01:52:22] how is it disappointed? I feel like they, they recycled a lot of the jokes from the spy who shag me, but seeing it now, you know, we got like 20 years, 15 years on it. It's so great. I love these movies so much. If you're, if you're going back into that sort of catalogster and you're looking for, you know, movies or things you want to redo again, Alan Ninja Turtles or Jurassic Park. I'm telling you Austin Powers.

[01:52:51] Oh, so good. So the pin was released right after the second installment of the series, the spy who shagged me, which is a spoof on the spy who loved me, the James Bond movie. It had a $33 million budget, which was $48 million in today's dollars. It had a $312 million box office.

[01:53:15] So we break down the rotten tomatoes, the international man of mystery, which is the first movie, 71%. I would totally agree. Spy who shag me 52% and gold member, which would then be released in 2002 is 54%. I kind of disagree with the second two.

[01:53:34] I thought the spy who shag me was just just a riot. Oh, so good. John Borg would actually call this game his baby. He loved making this game.

[01:53:47] Sean said it was the second layout for the game. The original was three flipper like Jurassic Park and shooting across the to the time machine.

[01:53:55] A similar spinner to twister with a mini me head mouth. Borg loved mini me. John says a magnet would make the ball jump and the ball would hit him in the mouth. And he spinning and says, he when mini me was in trouble.

[01:54:10] He didn't talk. He would just say, he was so entertaining. It may have been cut as a cost issue, but we didn't get that far into the design. Yeah, how cool with that. So the idea was that it's like the ball would kind of hit him and it would it would magnet to his mouth.

[01:54:23] And he would spin around in a circle. That sounds kind of fun. It's actually not a bad game. And it probably has the most stuff that was used in other games of any game I can think of. Yeah, yeah.

[01:54:34] It has the toilet, which they actually recycle from South Park. So it has the toy, the doctor evil toy that pops up and they just repurposed that with a different model to figure reen on it for Iron Munger.

[01:54:47] It has the the time machine thing they repurposed that to be the ring Lord of the rings. Then it had the crossbow, I guess you could say, which was repurposed as the crossbow in walking dead.

[01:55:01] So they got a lot of mileage out of the mechs in that. This is a great game is it's very fanny in its layout. Oh, very fanny.

[01:55:08] It's got the you know the John Borg scoop. In there, which usually has just an astronomical amount of wear.

[01:55:18] You see those online. Keep a lookout on that. But it's a pretty cool. It's a great little game. Now the voices, of course, that's one of the biggest parts of these movies, right?

[01:55:31] And John would say that they always had problems with Mike Myers that he was like unobtainable. And John wasn't sure if this was because like Mike Myers was difficult to get along with or at the time, you know, he was going through some things in his life.

[01:55:48] So there is no custom speech by Myers. All of it was lifted from the movie. And this would happen again in the Shrek game because Mike Myers just might not have time for pinball people.

[01:55:59] So Robert Moody on Facebook says I have Austin Powers gold number one got a new inbox from a friend who was a retired distributor. It's supposedly Mike Myers machine and he never bothered to pick it up. So Sir Stern sold it has a special film star difficulty setting that isn't on the regular games. I suspect that mode is really just the easy setting.

[01:56:19] I mean, if you want to say Mike Myers, you know, maybe just doesn't like pinball. You ever think of that? Yeah, I mean, that could be part of it. I mean, it sounds like maybe he was not all that to be super involved in or was no really interested.

[01:56:33] He's better things to do. Yeah, I mean, that kind of hurts our pinball egos, right? That kind of makes us sad. The only person that they could do custom speech was the actress Mindy Sterling who did frow far business,

[01:56:47] who of course was the founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army and Dr. Evil's lover. It also has the coolest spinner of all time that many me spinner, although I'm many me spinner almost everyone I've ever seen is feeder broken off, but still cool.

[01:57:01] Here's an interesting little fact about that many me spinner that is the first production used optical spinner things you know I assume you're shocked. I think I've heard that before.

[01:57:13] Yeah, because many me is so heavy right to swing. They couldn't put the switch because they wouldn't get it. It would be like a got leab system one spinner. So they needed to put an optical switch in there so he could spin a little more.

[01:57:26] So they knew what they could expect from the first movie. That was a video. And I mean, you could generally see where they were going to go with the second film. The spy or shaggy was just awesome. Just awesome.

[01:57:39] So they you know he goes back in time and John along with the engineers there designed this spinning ring disc thing that would hold the ball and then drop it down a ramp in the back.

[01:57:53] And that was repurposed like you had mentioned earlier for Lord of the Rings. So he's like, oh, that's so cool. The Lord of the Rings thing. Oh my goodness, it's never been done before. It's like, well, it was.

[01:58:04] Austin power did it all first. That should be the quote. Whatever it is. Austin powers did it first. Exactly. So this is around 2000 things are chugging along and John is laid off from stern.

[01:58:18] He starts his own business for seven years. He does slots. He does redemption games with Brian Hansen who was formerly from Capcom. Actually interesting enough, he went on to design kitchen equipment for McDonald's for a company called H and K.

[01:58:35] H and K is you might know also do hospital equipment. So Borgie kind of you know it's that's it. He's done. We've never heard from him again.

[01:58:45] Came in. He had some of the best licenses ever and that's it. He'll be back. That's the end of the episode this month.

[01:58:52] John Borg spent the 1990s making pinball machines for that decades largest franchises and that decades biggest letdowns.

[01:59:05] He had an opportunity that many of the designers at the time would probably kill for there were high highs and there were low lows through John Borg's design career.

[01:59:19] But I can tell you it probably didn't matter to John because Borgie Borgie had fun. John would eventually return to stern pinball in 2008 when he would start I would say his best run of his career developing his own unique style and brand of pinball design.

[01:59:41] I would even say that that run which is still going on today is probably one of the best of any designers ever to come into pinball says the guy who has tron says the guy who has tron.

[02:00:01] I love me some Borgie. I have a board game. What do you think I have? What's my board? What's your board game? That's my board game. It's no other ones we mentioned. So it's from it's from you don't have the walking dead. No and you don't have a Metallica. I know I do have a Metallica. Oh there you go. Ding ding ding. You got that for the Lyman code. Uh and the play field. Oh.

[02:00:29] We're going to talk about Metallica the next John Borg episode. Oh my cuz oh Metallica Metallica Metallica. Mm-hmm love Metallica. Oh he also have an iron man. Oh crap that's right. I have multiple Borg designs. I forgot he did. And you finished second expo trivia. I'm so good at trivia. I don't even know my own games. It's not like I just played that game today. Wow. What do you think? What are your thoughts on Borgie?

[02:00:59] Borg's live in the 90s license dream is first part of his career. A lot of cool toys. Which only makes sense. Which only makes sense for where he came from.

[02:01:15] You do want me to do my whole co-gain a first in A. That is supposed to be Robert Mueller. That's great.

[02:02:21] I think that's going to turn out really well. I think that's going to be a good episode. We know brother especially if you leave a lot of the bloopers in there or put them at the end of the show dude. But that's not going to be a good episode.

[02:02:50] I'm sure that's going to be like more editing for you. I'm far too lazy for that. Oh, there was lots of good material in there.

[02:03:00] That was Bill Paulman, wasn't it? You were with the bill Paulman thing. The funny thing is I literally only know him as the guy from space balls and the guy from Independence.

[02:03:11] Yeah, it's like the president for Independence. He was in space balls. I can't believe Bill Paxton is no longer with us. That sucks. Yeah. Thank God we didn't lose Bill Paulman though.

[02:03:26] The guy that was in space balls is the guy that was in Independence day. That way I can tell you. But that's not Bill Paxton. Bill Paxton was in Terminator. He's the guy with the Mohawk at the beginning of the movie.

[02:03:39] Which I didn't realize till years later. Like, yeah, that's Bill Paxton. No, you, you honestly Google Bill Paxton, Bill Paulman put the pictures up next to each other and you're going to be like, who the fuck? Which one is which? I could switch them and you wouldn't even know. I would know.
