[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] That's just so good. We're so good even Barry Ossler thinks so.

[00:30] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me, Ron Hallett.

[00:54] What's up, fella? Good morning. We are back on your pinball airwaves here in the pinball network. As always, Ron, we are glad to have everybody join us.

[01:07] You sound like you haven't had your coffee yet. I am working on my coffee. It's right here.

[01:12] So the energy level will increase as the podcast goes on. It will. And then towards the end, it'll just taper off into complete nonsense and sadness until I get another coffee.

[01:23] That's how it works here folks on Silver Ball Chronicles. This is what we do to keep you energized and excited.

[01:31] So what have you been doing? Not much. Really? Not since the last week. We've recorded recently. This is a shortest period in between recordings, I think.

[01:41] It is. I had a bit of an issue recording last time, so it was actually a week late.

[01:47] Well, you didn't have an issue recording. You had an issue editing. That's right. So the editing didn't go well. The cloud.

[01:54] Is it were let me down? But that's just how it goes. Sometimes you'll sort of live and learn. But I was still able to get it out and entertain folks.

[02:03] Of course, I'm talking about the first in our series of pinball is dying. And that was Williams from the early 1980s. What did you think? Did you think it came together well that episode?

[02:15] Yeah, Barry Asler thinks so. Yes. So Barry Osler himself, the man or at least a person who looks like him and has a profile on Facebook mentioned that he thought the episode was great on our Facebook page.

[02:29] So of course, swing on over to Facebook.com slash Silver Ball Chronicles. You'll be able to engage with us there. And we often put up our shenanigans there.

[02:40] So I'm sure Perry is eagerly awaiting part two. So that's what we're going to give him, right? Oh, no, no, that's not how it works here. So what we do is we give you a little bit of something. We give you just a taste.

[02:53] Then we just take it away. So this episode we're going to go with a completely different topic. But we are going to give the people what they want. And that's an episode about the Adam's family. Oh, wonderful.

[03:06] So remember if you wanted to go back and listen to any of our other podcasts, you can do that at silverball Chronicles.com or you can search for us in your pod catcher under silver ball chronicles. And of course we premiere every month on the wonderful pinball network. So you can see us there.

[03:25] And we have our own feed. Yes. So if you don't want some of the other pinball content on the pinball network, which I don't know why you'd want to do that.

[03:33] I don't know why either. No, there is some premier content there. Everything except for Joel Engelberth is fantastic on the pinball network. Wow.

[03:42] Of course, you can leave us and any of the pinball network podcasts or streamers, a five star review over on the this week in pinball promoter's database.

[03:53] Swing on over to this week in pinball and check out some of the exciting streams and leave a review. Is that the only type of review you're allowed to do is a five star?

[04:03] That's it. If you leave less than a five star, don't bother. I am going to hunt you down. Okay.

[04:09] As soon as this border to the US opens, that's right. You can't even come here fail. No, no, we don't we don't want to to mix with you folk at the moment.

[04:20] And if people are listening to this 10 years down the road, there's no, there's nothing going on. That's that important. No t shirts. Of course, we sold a t shirt last month. We did one t shirt. It went all the way to New Zealand.

[04:33] I don't know if you know this or not, Ron, but we're a big deal in New Zealand. I'm sure we are probably New Zealand, Australia. Are they close? How close are they? I never looked at a map.

[04:44] Some would say that they are a hobbits throw away from each other. I don't get it. Stone's throw. Oh, okay. Of course, we don't make much off of that swag. It just feeds our egos that somebody somewhere is wearing a t shirt with probably my name on it.

[05:01] And that makes me feel like I'm completely validated and I'm important to the world much like winning an award does. What would you mean? I'm looking at our account at least $1.10 deposited. I mean, we're we're killing it.

[05:15] That's right. You can go to that ice cream shop that just opened up because it's springtime. That's true. But you still have to kick in a little bit of the extra slam tilt money.

[05:25] Yes, by the way, that's my podcast. Yes, the slam tail podcast with Bruce. What's his name? Bruce with Bruce night and gale Ron. I should wait till the end of the show to mention that plug plug plug plug plug. So we do have a correction.

[05:38] Oh, from from our last episode and this correction is not from Mr. Nightingale. Ah, okay. So you know that it's actually a good one. So this comes from William B.

[05:51] He sent an email into silver ball chronicles a Gmail.com. That's where we go through a lot of our corrections and a few other things. He also included an image.

[05:59] He says the first pinball machine to allow a difficulty setting. Now we had mentioned, of course, that it was who done it. Yes, we mentioned in who done it in the Dwight Sullivan episode that that had a difficulty setting.

[06:15] The difficulty setting William says the first pinball machine to allow a difficulty setting, which is novice expert or normal can be selected before ball one was actually ballies motor dome in 1986.

[06:31] I learned a lot from an interview with Todd Tucky and can confirm the documentation on the internet pinball database, the motor dome skill chart attached that the player can select level one, two or three with the flippers with the corresponding easy medium or hard Sullivan may have patented the novice mode, but it still isn't the first time the player control difficulty setting was used.

[06:59] Love the pod will thank you so much for that I can confirm because at pinberg every year that was one of the games that you had to know to choose level three at the beginning of the game or you were going to lose real so you couldn't sneak that in you couldn't sneak it in it right to be getting the ball you have to pick one two or three.

[07:18] You want three because the scoring is higher so if you don't pick three you're going to lose see somebody like me would be would be dumb and me if I didn't know that you're just standing there like what am I supposed to pick.

[07:30] Yep, I don't think it even says in the game easy medium or hard it just is level one level two and level three, which isn't very helpful.

[07:40] We also have from our last episode our Williams in the early 80s slashberry outslur some feedback from Bo Jimmy.

[07:47] Bo Jimmy says hi guys is usual only phrase for me I just want to mention though that in regards to Pharaoh's back glass there's also an homage to a certain man with a large mustache on the lower right.

[07:58] Yes, so I did actually look that up I confirmed I looked up the back glass on Pharaoh which we said looks like it's got hidden lady parts in it and down in the bottom corner there is in a small image of Mr Roger Sharp or maybe it's burnt Reynolds or someone with a mustache but one would assume that it's probably the man the safe.

[08:19] Is it just the assumption if there's a guy with a mustache it has to be Roger Sharp exactly if it's not him it's probably Ken Fidesna.

[08:25] So maybe we can get a correction to the correction someone saying that's not Roger Sharp that someone else.

[08:30] So there you go but that's pretty cool that's I didn't even didn't even notice that and I spend a lot of time looking at that back glass.

[08:38] We have some feedback from MTM who says I'm only 20 minutes in and eagerly awaiting my travel to and from work tomorrow so I can continue listening.

[08:47] However, the mention of a hidden back glass art made me think of Pharaoh so there you go somebody that knows how to use a pause button if they can't take the whole two hours in one go.

[09:00] He's not going to let that go.

[09:02] The most recent years of Pat Lawler's career was covered in our episode 10 Pat Lawler pinball's roller coaster tycoon you can see that in our archives.

[09:12] Now we spoke about his shift from Williams to Stern and finally Jersey Jack pinball.

[09:18] Pat has a demeanor which of course over the years has rubbed some people the wrong way you need to get strong personalities in line you need to meet corporate deadlines you need to push your creative vision to the edge and have the confidence in yourself and your team that the product that you're designing will not only be fun but it will sell well and make money.

[09:40] Maybe part of that reputation was created in his early years at William Pat began his career at Williams being tossed into a highly competitive shark tank dodging bullets avoiding naysayers all while quickly designing in rapid succession some of the highest selling most innovative and most fun pinball machines of all time machines that still stand the test of time.

[10:09] Thanks for joining us this month to cover Pat Lawler the one with Adams family I still like Williams wrecking ball.

[10:17] Okay, thank you for joining us this month for Pat Lawler the Williams wrecking ball and also the one with Adams family in it.

[10:25] I like that.

[10:26] As a quick recap to our last episode Ron you know Pat had bumped around from job to job in the early 80s went to university did some degrees he was out in the workforce being a manager at a car repair facility.

[10:43] He just wasn't was an excited to be in those industries and Pat Lawler seems like the kind of guy that needs to be emotionally invested in what he's doing to make sure that you get a hundred percent of of what he can provide.

[10:55] So you know what it you know going back to our previous episode on Pat Lawler where we covered sort of his stern and Jersey Jack years.

[11:02] Do you have any thoughts that you wanted to sort of toss in this episode now that we're actually going back in time.

[11:08] Not really I'm just going to let it play out I'm just going to let it play out.

[11:13] Yeah, so we're doing this one a little bit different usually we go sort of chronologically through time this one we started at current time and now we're kind of going back into the beginning of his career.

[11:24] I thought it would be fun to mix it up that way because you don't want to go with all the high notes all the time except for dialed in which is still awesome.

[11:31] I don't care when anybody says so Pat ended up at a company called Dave nothing and associates for a time.

[11:37] It was a video game manufacturer who worked closely with midway in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

[11:45] This is actually where Pat had met George Gomez who's currently an executive vice president and chief creative officer at Stern pinball.

[11:54] So what was so important around this sort of 1984 time period.

[12:00] Well Pat said money was thrown at the video game industry it was so big and massive there was more money around than you could imagine.

[12:07] Then it went to nothing overnight it was all gone.

[12:11] Yeah, so picking up from our last episode with Williams in the early 80s.

[12:16] This is sort of around that same time period where everything is coming to a crashing home all the money is starting to dry up even in video games in 1984.

[12:27] Sometimes though and this is very philosophical for everybody out there so pick yourselves up folks and feel good that sometimes when the worst things happen when you know the industry is crashing around us we're all losing jobs and things are bad.

[12:45] This creates opportunities and at the time it's probably very difficult to see those opportunities but this is a prime example of that.

[12:54] George Gomez says incidentally this is how pat ended up working at Williams sort of in around about way because pat was working at Dave nutting when they closed doors.

[13:03] So he had to go to find work in an around about way hooked up with Larry to mark.

[13:07] Yes, so we hear Larry to mark his name all the time he just he just continues to pop up in this era.

[13:14] Not just with his programming and not just with his code and designs and boards and all of those stuff at Williams for some reason Larry to mark always ends up popping up.

[13:25] And this is even outside of kind of his day job so pat went to work for a company that transferred arcade and video games into cartridges which at the time was if you think about sort of your early Nintendo cartridges or Atari cartridges that was sort of a novelty at the time that was a new tech.

[13:43] After less than a year that of course business had collapsed and then he ended up working at a bowling tech company developing bowling alley systems for a company called Brunswick.

[13:55] This is where he met Paul the salt who is of course that lead programmer at the time at Williams who's doing basically all of the programming and Paul new Larry to Mars.

[14:06] So this is how we're all we're drawing all of these lines in the industry the pinball industry Ron as you know everybody kind of knows everybody they know what they're doing they know where they are and people come in and out of the picture all the time.

[14:18] Isn't that right they all know each other that is definitely true.

[14:21] So one day Larry to mark came to see some of that bowling tech my assumption is that because Williams was doing those bowlers those bowling lane type of games he was probably interested in some of the bowling tech that actual bowling lanes were using.

[14:36] Or maybe just puck bowlers something like that.

[14:39] Yeah exactly or you know maybe he was just bored and needed to fill his day and he just sort of was like I'm going to go over to Brunswick and see how how the boys are doing over there.

[14:49] When Larry to Mars was over at Brunswick he bumped into Pat Lawler and Pat Lawler would say wow I mean we'd go out for lunch and I'd play high speed in a bar.

[14:59] I mean my whole world was high speed and Larry to Mars was a big part of that.

[15:04] Of course Pat had never really met Larry to Mars he would know the name Larry to Mars but he wouldn't know the face so that's when Pat said I told him hey I have an idea for a pinball machine with a vertical play field in the back glass.

[15:20] And then Larry basically said yeah let's go build this so Larry went to a distributor and bought a new box road kings and they completely stripped it.

[15:29] Oh no I like that was such a good game I like road kings they built a complete working model and we're going to show it to Williams and try to sell it to them so they were going to build a white wood a new machine.

[15:43] Well wait wait a second here now Larry to Mars who more or less works at Williams goes out and finds Pat Lawler who just one day randomly says hey you know you're one of my favorite pinball people let's build a pinball machine Larry goes okay share let's build a pinball machine so they buy a Williams pinball machine.

[16:03] They tear it apart and build a white wood and they want to sell it to Williams they bought the road kings he just didn't grab it so is Larry double dipping.

[16:12] So is he working for Williams collecting a paycheck and then on the side building white woods and selling them back.

[16:19] All right well according to Pat Lawler what Pat says Ken Fatesz knew what we were doing Larry had a reputation that he could come up with ideas that made money like Vid Kids remember that from our one of our previous episodes he come up with something and he'd sell it back to Williams like he did with Robotron all those type of games.

[16:38] He was one of the only guys that could get away with that so he he was double dipping but just as long as his ideas made money.

[16:45] As many if his ideas made money for Williams they didn't care. It's right Robotron too it'll say like designed by Vid Kids.

[16:53] So one thing that I found kind of interesting through all this research at the time is Pat Lawler actually has a shop in his house.

[16:59] Oh legendary shop so much just happening that shop.

[17:02] Yeah this isn't just a shop like it's funny because I just said shop and you're like oh it's the legend shop and this is where he did a lot of work for dialed in of course Willy Wonka and whatever he's working on right now.

[17:13] He does all of that work and fabrication in his shop at his home which I think is like an hour from Chicago or something it's not close it's quite the facility I've been told like a proper work facility and he has all of his games that he's made in there as well well he has a shop and he has a barn.

[17:30] But he put a lot of the games that he worked on new in box in the barn and they didn't survive too well a lot of them.

[17:37] Pat says I built everything Larry would come out and give me feedback like the jet bumpers in the right place.

[17:42] I changed them and then he come out and try it again and then program it. It was called Reck and Ball.

[17:47] We got to the point where it would work and it was playable.

[17:50] So this is the game with a vertical play field in the back box which sounds a lot like Bons I run but we'll talk about that in a minute.

[17:59] So if you swing on over to IPDB you can look up Reck and Ball and it's Reck and within apostrophe N not I and G.

[18:08] And you can look at all of the photos of that original white wood and it's pretty interesting because it does you can see where bonds I run had come from very very cool machine.

[18:21] It's got it's all wood right it doesn't have any art on it. It's it's very straightforward but it is it is very cool looking at some of these these pictures because it's a it's a piece of history right.

[18:33] And it pictures are not good enough for you you can actually see this thing in action as an I'm going to make a recommendation here as as the history podcast we are.

[18:45] If you go to YouTube and you look up the following channel it's called Duncan F Brown so D. U. N. C. A. N. F. B. R. O. W. N. It's Duncan Brown. He was a former Williams employee.

[18:59] I think he he eventually end up working at Larry Demar's company when Williams got out of pinball and he currently works at Jersey Jack.

[19:09] But he's also somewhat of a pinball historian and he's collected as many historical pinball items as he could he's he's built a hairy Williams game from a documentation again that was never actually manufactured and he made it and brought it to pinball expo one year.

[19:25] But he has tons of videos and a lot of them are from within the company and there isn't actually the wrecking ball original demo the one where all the Williams people and suits are standing around it looking at it and the Williams offices is online you can actually watch it.

[19:43] It's like an hour long that's so cool that's neat and I think the best part about those old videos and and will and as we move into more of that sort of late 80s into the 90s.

[19:54] Video becomes a lot easier to find right because people head camcorders and yeah don't expect this to be high death or anything and a lot of it is taken from behind the people looking at the game.

[20:06] But you get there wasn't exactly any cinematography.

[20:10] No, it actually looks like they just had a I'm guessing they probably put it on a tripod and they just pointed it at the game but unfortunately I'm looking at the video most of the time people are standing in front of the game.

[20:21] But and the interesting thing to me is the computer that's in the shot like a computer from 1986 87 was quite the quite the thing I'm just looking at this model chrome monitor.

[20:33] Sorry, I digress.

[20:35] But I mean the coolest part about those old videos are that you can see people in a very sort of casual setting that you and now we're looking away back like 30 years or more in some cases and you can sort of see these people.

[20:52] So this game was actually copyrighted in 1987 by cyber kids limited which of course would must be a tie in with Larry D'Amarr.

[21:01] Wrecking ball is kind of neat. It's like a construction theme game.

[21:06] It has all of those little bits and pieces in there.

[21:09] One day Ken Fidesz and Steve Richie came out to see what they had made.

[21:14] They played and they sat around and had a drink and Larry went into negotiations with them about building a real game at Williams.

[21:24] Four to six months later they agreed on terms Pat went to work for Williams on a contract to build wrecking ball.

[21:33] They actually gave him an office across from Larry D'Amarr. So that's pretty cool. Nowadays you just get a cube I guess.

[21:39] It depends.

[21:40] So employment at Williams. Now this is something we haven't so much talked about now in our previous episodes.

[21:47] We just wanted to sort of talk about how these what I can garner a lot of these contracts would look like or a lot of the you know the employment standards that you would have at the time.

[21:58] This was a big deal especially back then because pinball had gone through these ebbs and flows these peaks and valleys and certain individuals Steve Richie for example would have pretty amazing contracts.

[22:11] Well Pat says at this time the game designers were employees with contracts employees with extended benefits it was a great thing you negotiated the contracts the benefits were much bigger because you negotiate.

[22:22] Yeah so the designers were put in the driver's seat when it came to the contracts.

[22:27] So they were the ones that sort of had this special sauce you know getting a part of the sales or getting better performance bonuses for something that you could negotiate as I mentioned before.

[22:37] You know could you imagine Steve Richie's contract at the time like this guy just shows up and just destroys sales numbers.

[22:45] This is probably how he afforded a Porsche back in the day.

[22:48] Well Pat says the way things worked at Williams where if you were a powerful game designer you could do anything Steve Richie could convince them to do anything I couldn't do that yet.

[22:57] So Pat Lawler of course coming in on the ground floor as a contract employee he's probably got a couple of benefits.

[23:03] But wrecking ball would eventually become bonds I run now I have not played a bonds I run I've seen lots of bonds I runs I've had a friend of mine actually owned a bonds I run I just didn't end up ever playing it is mechanically impressive it is a sports motor cross theme it's from may of 1988 so we're in the late 80s now things have sort of started to recover their back on the upswing it is a Williams system 11 B.

[23:32] It sells 1,751 units it's designed by Pat Lawler and Larry D'Amarr the art is done by Mark Springer and sound and music by Brian Schmidt software Larry D'Amarr and Ed Boone did some polish on that.

[23:52] And it was also I think one of the first games of not the first game with diamond plate the clear coding process when they are starting to experiment so there diamond plate bonds I runs out there great let's start a whole podcast here with Ron and Dave talking about clear code because there's not enough podcasts in the pinball industry the talk about clear.

[24:14] It's part of history I think it was the first one someone can correct me on that but I think most of the games they experimented with were Pat while their games because he was behind that technology the theme of wrecking ball was not really that great construction E.

[24:30] Like nothing nothing says exciting like construction road show oops Pat would say we were fishing around for a theme one day Mark Springer did a bunch of drafts and said you should do a motorcycle game couldn't come up with anything better so it became bonds I run how was make sense to say ripped off a road kings to do it yeah poor road kings I like road kings Pat would say that he needed to put in time to learn the finer details of design so in the interview.

[25:00] One of the interviews and it's in the show notes of course is an old interview from top cast and he talks a little bit about his philosophies Pat Lawyer can speak sort of on a long drawn out Roger Sharp S.A. when he speaks but when he does speak much like Roger sharp you're like you're captivated by what he's talking about and when he's talking about the finer details of design designers can really figure out why things feel clunky

[25:29] and why you know why shots and make you go like yeah so do you want to kind of describe what clunky might be clunky is you know you you should a ramp it's not smooth you shoot a shot that's not smooth maybe just constantly rattles in and out rejects the shots just don't and it's not necessarily flow and one thing I game could not have flow and also not be clunky I think I've always think a clunky is more it's just shots just rattle in and out in and out

[25:58] and nothing feels good to shoot on the game when you when you make a shot you just go like yeah that feels good like like something inside you feels the way the ball moves and you know Steve Richie would sort of call that kinetics how does the ball feel really good designers instinctively know how things just end up being clunky so if I made a white wood I could make a shot and it was just the ball which is rattle around or it would be a lot of fun

[26:28] to go through and just not be that satisfying to use a cliche instinctively pinball designers that are very very good you know I'd say Keith L one for example they just sort of know OK if I put it if I move this to the left it'll be clunky if I move it to the right by you know 5 centimeters it will be smooth and it will the kinetics will play right very very cool but you don't just know that right out of the gate so somebody like pat Lawler had to sort of learn a little bit of those finer details and the other thing you learn is really good

[26:58] And he said this was his one of his newbie mistakes on Bonsai run is there's no adjustment for the outlaying posts

[27:03] So they are where they are pack gave a lot of credit to Larry DeMar who we said was good at instilling in people

[27:08] If you put in the work and you are talented you will learn how to do pinball. That's awesome good for you Larry DeMar

[27:14] Once our Larry DeMar episode. I don't think he deserves one

[27:19] It looks like this point it would be like four hours long. Nobody would listen to a podcast for four hours

[27:23] Well the basic feeling internally Williams was that Bonsai run was a joke a novelty pinball machine

[27:29] Many thought the thing was going to be an albatross and why did leadership waste the money?

[27:33] Yeah, that's kind of a bummer right that you know you kind of you come in to Williams

[27:37] You're excited to do your first game and everybody's like oh there's this new guy over there doing this

[27:43] You know novelty game like why don't they just why doesn't he just build the game with the monster truck under the glass

[27:49] The drives over cars for tickets like that's a that's that's a bummer man now at this time

[27:55] Williams was very much well known as a bit of a shark tank that

[28:00] people were incredibly

[28:03] competitive

[28:04] Incredibly competitive at Williams and they had all these different teams

[28:07] In fact, some people would call them almost like street gangs

[28:11] So Pat's feeling was that people thought stay away from the toxic new guy

[28:16] He'll be gone soon you don't want to get caught up in his crash and burn

[28:22] Wow that feels horrible

[28:25] This is what George Gomez says about shark tanks well he calls them shark pools that if he had not spent time in the Marvin glass shark tank

[28:33] He said it's a different kind of shark, but it's a shark nonetheless

[28:37] Said nobody gives a shit about you. You know you're in the shark pool. There's some big hawk and great white sharks

[28:44] So man, there's a lot of sharks in going on at Williams. It's George said a lot of positive things about those teams in a lot of his

[28:52] Interviews and quotes back in the day, but one thing was for sure

[28:56] He made sure that everybody knew that it was highly competitive and there were small wars that would happen to these teams

[29:01] That wars over Max and you can't use my Mac or you can't use it until my game is done or whatever they had like an on-written

[29:08] Rules and stuff it was yeah as the new guy you got to learn those

[29:11] And

[29:13] Each team would go into their foxhole, you know, they would work in their teams they would build their machines and

[29:19] You know may the best

[29:22] Team win really now for example

[29:25] We had brought this up in a previous episode where Python and Jolo was certainly one of the instigators and one of those

[29:31] Commanders within the battlefield wasn't he? I know he didn't like that loler

[29:35] Yeah, he didn't like him at all

[29:38] So Python says

[29:40] Lawler didn't have anything to mix and create unless Eugene and I were there

[29:44] Yeah, Pat would say I wasn't smart enough to know what was going on

[29:48] I had a once in a lifetime opportunity and I wasn't going to waste it

[29:53] That's an awesome attitude for Pat Lawler to have you know, you kind of go in you're not really sure what's going on

[29:59] But you know what Williams the pinball manufacturer in my opinion is giving you an opportunity to build a machine and and you're not gonna waste it

[30:07] You know that is some great life advice from Pat Lawler there. Yeah kind of like the Steve Richie episode when Steve Cordack told Steve

[30:16] He didn't like the flash design

[30:18] And Steve just thought it said screw it. I ain't changing it. I like it

[30:24] Pat really worked his ass off to launch the best machine and

[30:27] Of course it was based on the original specs and design of wrecking ball

[30:32] But of course that would change over time

[30:34] Pinball wanted to find ways to get more money from the player pinball had been five cents ten cents

[30:41] 25 cents now we're really moving into that we're trying to get two quarters

[30:45] The prototype was out on test at 50 cents a play and it made even more money than all of the other games on

[30:53] Location but it didn't make enough more as far as Williams was concerned did the bonsai run

[30:58] Concept fail won't be and they didn't do it again and they only made

[31:04] 1750 units the description of bonsai run so it's it's a standard play field you know cabinet on the bottom right

[31:12] You've got your regular play field on the bottom. It's got pop bumpers and a spinner. It's got a ramp

[31:18] It looks like a regular pinball machine, but the back box is like another half play field and it's sort of vertical

[31:26] Right like and and you're shooting up with the flippers on the ball. Yeah, it's not sort of vertical. It is vertical. It's really unusual

[31:34] Right like if you had this in a lineup of pins. It's something that's gonna catch your

[31:39] Imagination it is super cool to play. I'll say that. It's got three flippers in the back box

[31:44] So it's got two on the bottom and then it's got kind of like one up on the top corner

[31:48] And it's got a couple of kickers that kick it up the play field. Yeah, you go up the play field

[31:52] So the kind of the idea is you're on a motor cross bike and you make it into the back box now

[31:59] One that one bit that's super super cool is the ball that's on the upper

[32:04] Back box play field is the same ball that you're using on the bottom play field. Oh, yeah

[32:09] Carries it up there. So it's not like there's a ball kind of in there

[32:14] And it just sort of pops out of a hidden place. It is the actual

[32:17] Which is super cool. It's an unusual game

[32:20] I mean, it's gonna draw you in it's gonna make you want to put money in it right? It has an extremely

[32:26] Hard to get jackpot as if I'm remembering you you have to start multi-ball

[32:30] You have to lock a ball in the lower play field get to the upper play field and then go all the way up to the final shot

[32:36] To get the jackpot

[32:38] Williams we're changing the way the world looks at pinball this one's even better here check this one out

[32:44] Introducing bonsai run the pinball machine with one continuous play field on two different planes

[32:53] Wow

[32:55] You've never seen anything like this

[32:59] Yeah, that's because it's crazy Williams pinball number one on any plane

[33:04] Wow, yeah, they went all in on this one. So

[33:07] So 1700 units doesn't it doesn't sell very well this machine

[33:14] It goes for a lot of money on the secondary. Oh, yeah, especially if you have one of those

[33:19] Diamond plate versions I spoke of earlier. Oh god help you. It's not is it pinball. Oh, it's definitely pinball

[33:26] It's definitely pinball now. It's got a lot of those sort of a patlaw or staples

[33:34] Right, it's got that

[33:37] You know physical kickback on the left side so the ball goes down the left side is gonna physical kickback

[33:43] Yeah, the flippers both flippers are offset to the right with the larger left side

[33:48] Just a lot a lot of the staples are already coming into place

[33:51] Yeah, and it's so funny because it's such early part of his career

[33:55] It's such an early part of his design and he's just designing that

[33:59] Creating that sort of philosophy, which is very very cool

[34:02] So after selling 1700 and 50 units Ken Fideszna went to pat and said you did a fine job of taking a project

[34:09] We didn't know you could do we'd like to have you stay

[34:13] So they agreed on a new contract for a few years and pat went off to work on his next pinball machine

[34:18] And he dreamed up his own design

[34:21] So he didn't have any input from Larry DeMar or anything like that

[34:24] This is he's gonna go and build a traditional pinball machine

[34:27] So pat had a really strange idea for this next machine didn't he? I don't know if it's strange

[34:33] But he I think pat likes natural disasters. He likes those old disaster movies from the 1960s

[34:39] Or 70s whether the ones in sense around or whatever it was called

[34:43] Everything was a disaster yet earthquakes floods

[34:46] Avalanche is it's like it's like Marvel movies now it is

[34:50] Pat says I wanted to do something crazy

[34:52] They were all standing there and said you're crazy. This isn't gonna work people in the halls would stare and say you're crazy

[34:58] When people will tell me it's a crazy idea not to do it

[35:01] I'll do it and catch people's attention

[35:03] And of course we were talking about an amazing innovation

[35:07] Known as the shaker motor and this would become

[35:12] Earthshaker which is a disaster theme from February of 1989. It is a Williams system 11b sells 5,257 units

[35:22] So significantly higher in sales than his previous machine

[35:26] It's designed of course by Pat Lawler art by Tim Elliott

[35:30] Sound and music by John Hay and the legend Chris Granger and software by Mark

[35:36] Penaccio. I don't think it's penaccio. There's no eo

[35:41] We should probably figure out how to say his name being he was just hired by

[35:45] Stern yeah

[35:47] He can email me a

[35:50] Wave file of him saying his name okay

[35:54] Take that

[35:56] I have played a lot of earth shaker

[35:59] Uh, I got a buddy of mine who just picked up at earth shaker and I and I played I played a lot of it

[36:03] I really like her shaker. It's a very cool. Have you played the sinking building for

[36:07] version? No, I have not

[36:10] It's a moving experience

[36:14] Uh, that was very good. Yes, it was a moving experience

[36:19] Directly from the Williams uh, yes paperwork here Williams continues to shake up the world of pinball

[36:26] Okay, discover state of the art advances in quality dependability reliability

[36:33] Entertainment value and this was yet another one of the games that had a limited number of diamond plate versions again

[36:40] You should we see what all the other games

[36:43] It had a originally had a moving building the the building would sink into the play field, but that was cost cut

[36:50] But it still has a super cool

[36:53] It has like the state of California and right where the fault line is it actually opens up

[36:57] So the ball can roll across and diverts it

[37:00] It is that is such an amazing mac

[37:03] It is like this game is just so much fun

[37:06] It's so you know some people describe pat lawler's designs as like just fun and energetic and childish

[37:14] And I would totally agree that this game is is probably one of the most

[37:17] Make a smile games that he's been able to and as we go through these games

[37:20] You will notice like almost every one of his games has some kind of new back or some some new thing

[37:26] Some new mechanical thing that's super cool something that something that makes you think like wow

[37:30] This is different than pin then pinball was you know this this machine is a way out on the edge

[37:36] They weren't really sure what distributors would think about this shaker motor

[37:40] You put this thing in the bottom of the cabinet and it's gonna literally shake the machine

[37:45] This is the first time this has ever been done

[37:47] You know, that's kind of leading edge and that's taking a chance and and often

[37:52] As we can see with a lot of designers and distributors nowadays taking chances is not something they like to do

[37:58] So when it came down to costing you said before that they remove the building

[38:03] So that they could keep the shaker motor because the shaker motor added to that sort of ambience and theme

[38:09] We're a moving building

[38:12] The motion of the the building was still there just didn't do anything

[38:15] So Williams was going to do the first 250 machines with this

[38:19] Shaker motor inside and they convinced pat to do it as an add-on for distributors to purchase afterwards

[38:26] That way they wouldn't offend anybody who didn't want it

[38:30] And they never sold a single one of these kits because the shaker motor was such a massive hit

[38:35] They included it in every single machine. So like how does a shaker motor work?

[38:42] Well some motor with weights and they spin the faster they spin the more it shakes

[38:46] That sounds dangerous to have that in your cabinet. It's encased. Oh, it's got a little case

[38:51] It's it's all in case so the weights are not going to fly off or anything

[38:55] I guess those are the things that people would worry about at the time

[38:57] So it's mounted in the bottom of the cabinet when you do certain things it it shakes

[39:01] Oh shaker

[39:04] Did you know data east used to shaker a lot? Yes

[39:08] So John Kamenkow of course took that shaker motor idea and he fucking put it in every game from like

[39:14] 1991 to 1993 how could they do that didn't Williams patent it it they patented everything else

[39:20] Yeah, so apparently Williams did not patent the shaker motor

[39:25] It was up to the company at the time to do all the paperwork and fill out all the documentation and at the time

[39:30] They just didn't think it was something that would take off

[39:33] But Joe Kamenkow

[39:35] He could when he sees an idea that's going to make money boy. Oh boy

[39:39] He drives that into the ground until it stops making money now

[39:42] Basically the shaker motor is

[39:45] At least shaker motor support is coded into almost every game from every manufacturer now

[39:50] I have a shaker motor in my tron and I'll tell you what man it is it is awesome shaker motors are awesome

[39:55] I'm gonna be on popular here, but I do not use the shakers

[39:59] I have them in several my games and I've actually forgotten which ones because I always turn them off

[40:04] All right, and that is the end of silver ball chronicles series. So thank you my folks

[40:10] I would leave it on I would leave it on an earth shaker because it makes sense

[40:13] Huh a lot of people a lot of people that's like a must-have mod they're putting a shaker away on everything and if I had a road show

[40:19] I would definitely have got a shaker in there. What about what about your Jurassic Park?

[40:23] You know put a shaker motor in that now come on man

[40:26] That's like the whole part of the friggin movie with the dinosaur walking and rumbling and the cup with the water

[40:31] I was wondered if you were an internament and like the shaker motor actually cost a tilt

[40:35] That would be the end of the shaker book. It'd be the end of the machine

[40:38] The art on the earth shakers by Tim Elliott and he was the last person to work on a luller pin before Pat sign

[40:44] exclusivity deal with Johnny Aussie is done the artwork for every one of his games ever since which I think is kind of neat

[40:50] Now this is a very cool backlash. So it's like this 1950s

[40:55] You know guy with his part to his hair is just gorgeous as a guy who's got a receding hairline

[41:01] It makes me very jealous

[41:02] It's with a ladies doing her makeup and it's sort of like this california cool

[41:08] Pink Cadillac thing one thing that's very reminiscent or one thing that's interesting about Pat Loller games

[41:14] Say always have a lot of these like random odd characters in the background

[41:20] Just these funny sort of characters that are all getting into some sort of shenanigans

[41:25] I was always thought it was funny that the game says oh bitchin

[41:30] Yeah, which is a pretty big big risk back in the day or that was just like the lingo

[41:36] They're using that's bitchin yeah, that's true. That's what I always took it as

[41:41] It's going on bro

[41:42] So there's like a lady in the background walk in her dog and she's getting you know

[41:46] She's fallen over there's a guy being thrown out of his car. He's like this annoying kind of yuppie

[41:53] Business person with his cell phone in his car. There's an LA map

[41:59] Things are weird man like it's kind of a fun little

[42:02] Little back glass there and it's mirrored come on mirrored back glass

[42:07] So what was what do you think earth shakers response was when people actually got to see and feel the earth shaker concept

[42:15] I think it made a ton of money it made a ton of cash and I've spelled that T-O-N-N-E

[42:20] Oh the correct way to spell that a Canadian spelling that is the correct spelling yes, okay

[42:26] Pat Lawler would say internally there were usual politics being played an earth shake got the bum rush because of what was coming

[42:33] So what what game was coming after earth shaker?

[42:36] Oh, okay, we'll give everybody a moment

[42:43] If you said black night 2000 you would be correct that's right

[42:46] So cutting the production was allegedly because a German distro didn't like the game

[42:51] Which I would assume was their main German distributor who I should remember their name because they bought like 70 80 percent of Williams games

[42:58] Yeah, so the black night 2000 game of course was was a pretty was a pretty big hit course

[43:03] It is the return to

[43:06] Steve Richie's black night series the second in the trilogy of the German distro Pat would say he wielded a great deal of dollars and power

[43:15] Here's later we have come to me and apologize for not building three to four thousand more units

[43:20] That's a that must have made Pat feel pretty great that you know, it was a bit of a bit of an issue there with cutting that short and you know

[43:28] When you have Steve Richie, you know, the Steve Richie and you've got the new guy building his second game

[43:34] one that's I mean a bit strange and it's not the black night

[43:39] You know, you can't you can't blame the distributor for for going out of his way and

[43:45] You know trying to get what he thought was a bigger hit the interesting thing is how they just wouldn't rerun games

[43:52] Even when they were original themes and they could have just

[43:55] Went back and did more they just had their set schedules and once the game stopped that was it the interesting thing here is black night

[44:02] 2000 sold five thousand seven hundred units

[44:05] Earthshaker sold five thousand two hundred units. So it's not like there's like a big smash hit of 10,000 units here

[44:13] From Steve Richie. So, you know, those internal politics being played at Williams

[44:18] Certainly probably burned earthshade. Yeah, it probably would have sold at least 8k or more

[44:23] Wow, you think that many a

[44:26] Huh, so that would bring us to pat haulers next game

[44:30] whirlwind

[44:31] And that of course was a another disaster theme. This is January

[44:35] 1990. It's a Williams

[44:37] B sell 7,304 units so we could see that there's some creep up in sales here with pat luller's designs

[44:44] Art by john yosi and as you mentioned before

[44:47] This is the first game with john yosi and pat luller and pat luller will work with nobody

[44:52] But john yosi from now until all the way to today

[44:57] Sound in music by the legend chris granner and software by bill footson rooter. This is a very classic

[45:06] pat luller when it comes to disaster theme. It's a tornado. It's terrorizing the countryside in canzus

[45:14] Oh, did you hear recently that the governor's mansion in canzus was destroyed in a tornado?

[45:20] No, I didn't lame joke incoming

[45:22] The storm was so bad it almost took out the whole trailer park

[45:27] Uh-huh

[45:28] So the the translight art

[45:31] john yosi is

[45:32] The radio driver in the car so if you look at

[45:37] If you look at the back glass there is an individual who's driving a van

[45:43] He's holding a button. It is the storm blasters. That is a self portrait of john yosi. We also see the red button

[45:49] Which would be because a pat luller trademark

[45:52] Believe it was the logo of his company. It's like a it's like a thing

[45:55] Mm-hmm. Don't push the red button

[45:57] So of course we spoke

[45:59] In a lot of our art episodes and a lot of other our previous podcasts that artists would often use photographs and have some members of the

[46:08] Art team or the design team or family members pose so that they could get those designs right actually

[46:15] The reference of this was john yosi had his wife jenny take a photograph of him kind of

[46:21] Standing in that position and that's how he drew himself sitting in the car

[46:26] john yosi and pat luller all about their tiny back glass references. Isn't that right? That is right

[46:31] So john yosi would say I was asked to put hidden things in games now and then and you know was benign stuff

[46:38] I didn't put it in anything shocking

[46:40] And we could see that other designers. Yeah, they were all about putting in shocking stuff

[46:45] John also said dog Watson and I split this game up

[46:48] Another one of those beautiful play fields plastics and all that stuff

[46:51] I did the back glass and cabinet

[46:53] I had a lot of fun with it and had a lot of freedom now john yosi he would spend a lot of his later career working for

[47:00] Large companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola and they wouldn't give you that kind of freedom where you could kind of put in fun stuff in the background

[47:08] They were very on brand very focused as long as it was a licensed it was an unlicensed game

[47:14] You could pretty much get away with anything

[47:16] So because this is such an interesting position in pat luller's career. It's the first time that he spent some

[47:22] A great deal of time with john yosi want to go into this back glass in a little more detail than maybe most

[47:30] That we have so there's a a a a a child

[47:34] In a crashing car with his head out the window with a huge huge camcorder taking a video of the storm of the world wind

[47:45] Super not safe

[47:46] Not wearing a seatbelt and looking out the other way now

[47:49] There's a there's a dog with his head out the window and his hands over his eyes. It's pretty funny

[47:56] Well john yosi would say we've always had English setter so the dog is a cartoony version of a goofy setter

[48:01] There's also that hand button. So you had mentioned that hand button

[48:04] There's the the child the boy he's wearing a Williams hat

[48:10] No, he's not no, he's not

[48:13] There's three versions of the the uh whirlwind back glass

[48:17] So john yosi and pat were that wall are both cubs fans

[48:20] So in the original run of trans lights the kids wearing a cubs hat

[48:24] But the legal guys frowned on it. So a sticker was applied

[48:28] To the first run of trans lights covering the sea with the Williams w

[48:32] And then all new trans lights were made with just the w the Williams logo

[48:37] So if you have a whirlwind

[48:39] Jam your face up there real close and see if there's a sticker on it. Yeah, I know someone

[48:45] Who has the trans light and it has the sticker that's so cool

[48:48] Do you think that would actually be worth more do you think that's just something that nerds like you and I think it's cool it both

[48:53] Because nerds i.e. pinball pinheads think it's cooler. Yes

[48:58] I would put it in my listing as you know original cubs trans light give me another ten bucks

[49:04] The the flyer come on

[49:06] Feel the power of the wind very whimsical way to say it there. So wait a minute

[49:11] Why are we feeling the power of the wind?

[49:13] What gimmick do we have on this game? Well, I don't know if you knew this or not

[49:17] But world wind was creating a stir for the 90s and beyond

[49:23] Did you know that added attractions blow the competition away? Did you know that?

[49:28] I did indeed know that because Williams made sure they put it on a flyer. I love flyers

[49:34] This has like what top three top five toper of all time

[49:39] It has a fan on the top of the pinball machine that under certain times

[49:44] It blows wind on you like you're in a world wind run

[49:48] Yeah, the funny thing is the game was basically done

[49:52] They just put that on there is like a joke like wouldn't it be funny if we had a fan on top of it that just turned on

[49:58] And they put a fan on there and they turned it on and you're like we have to do this

[50:02] So Pat Waller had his program like you need to program this in and within a couple days they hadn't working

[50:07] They were three weeks away from launch when Bill Futzenruder and Pat were playing a game in the factory and having a good old time

[50:15] Pat would say the balls were in the air they were going in all directions because of the world wind wheels on the playfield

[50:24] Somebody said wouldn't it be funny if a fan blew on you

[50:27] So we grabbed a desk fan and we put it on the machine and turned it on

[50:31] We laughed uncontrollably

[50:34] That top five or like top three topper of all time was like

[50:39] Yeah, let's just stick it on the top that is that is awesome

[50:43] That is amazing inspiration and it shows you how a team and the creative process

[50:47] Bring something together and makes it that much better and the creative process

[50:54] Did you did you know that Williams legal was not a huge fan they were concerned really because they were afraid

[51:00] They were afraid someone like maybe they're smoking their cigarette and the fan comes on and blows it back in their face

[51:06] That kind of thing. Oh, man imagine somebody smoking that didn't want smoke in their face

[51:12] So Williams of course was always willing to bend over to make something great

[51:16] Which was certainly different than the other manufacturers

[51:20] We've talked about got late at the time

[51:22] Not so much about making sure that they added expense to a game

[51:26] It seemed that management was always there to be able to identify something

[51:31] Like this fan that they knew would sell more units. So that's pretty amazing

[51:36] So they mentioned the spinning world win wheels

[51:41] So what's what's what am I talking about there there's spinning discs on the play field you basically got like a

[51:47] grippy surface on them too

[51:49] So when the balls hit them they just go flying in all directions another pat wall or staple

[51:53] He likes things that just move the ball around whether it's spinning discs or magnets

[51:59] Either him he doesn't like balls just in the middle of the play field not

[52:02] reacting to something obviously these spinning discs on play field were not common

[52:08] But they're not it's not a new design right you you had the original fireball the fireball remake

[52:14] Yeah, it's just 70s

[52:16] They've they've been on machines before but distributors hated them because they had they required a lot of adjustments

[52:23] so

[52:24] Pat Lawler and his engineering team set out to make sure that they could come up with some sort of leveling system

[52:31] On the bottom of the play field to be able to help level that out

[52:35] Much simpler than the previous versions

[52:38] And it was all run all three discs are run by one motor

[52:42] Apparently these motors the drove the discs are different in the European models

[52:48] Because of European safety approvals but in general they tried to make it much better

[52:55] Than the previous versions now of course there's no Larry tomorrow anybody

[53:00] On a whirlwind Larry has disappeared from doing a lot of his

[53:04] Programming work and why was that he was busy working on their upcoming new system wpc

[53:11] Williams pinball controller around this time

[53:15] Um, there's a lot of competition out there. This is we're getting into when pinball is way

[53:22] Getting tall it's hot. It's hot. It's it's hot and they and this game is

[53:28] Right on the cusp of that hot growing market. There's a lot of really cool bits on whirlwind

[53:34] I've never played a whirlwind. I really really want to wow. You've never played a whirlwind. That's criminal

[53:39] I know I've played a lot. I played a lot of earth shaker and played any whirlwind

[53:43] A lot of that comes to the fact that I have spent the last you know year and a half under lockdown and have been able to get to any shows

[53:51] And I'll have to say again there was a certain number of whirlwinds that were diamond plate again

[53:58] Now this has a couple of really cool features

[54:02] One of them is that pat lawler again is pulling out a third flipper

[54:08] He's he's he's doing a side sort of richi-esque shot

[54:14] Which goes up into uh

[54:17] Into a ramp on the left side which then comes around and just drops in the play field

[54:22] Unlike a sea richi game that would just feed it to you right. So it's just sort of that it's a fun shot

[54:28] There's not there's not much excitement about. Oh, no, it's exciting

[54:32] It's actually when you get a jackpot with it you will you will be excited at the time

[54:36] Gotleib was recycling this mech almost all the time in their machines

[54:40] And that is like a ramp with a lift so the ramp will lift up and you can shoot under the ramp

[54:46] And that's the seller shot right or that's the what is that shot?

[54:49] That's the toll booth. I don't know exactly what it's called

[54:52] Because the seller's the scoop right so there's like there's two scoops on the left side and a shot through the pops

[54:58] Now this is this is a very big

[55:01] Pat Lawler thing is a shot through the pops right? He's shot through the pops. He likes a lot of pops

[55:07] This yes, this is this is the first game where he's like okay. There is a orbit through the pops

[55:13] Shot through the pop now earth shaker had a shot into the pops into like a weird capture scoop thing

[55:18] And then it just sort of out the side into the flipper

[55:21] But you know, this one is an actual sort of shot that kind of you want to get it right up in between the pops and around the corner

[55:26] Which is an awesome shot you got to admit

[55:29] This also has a couple of divers and pat lawler is all about divers right you likes divers

[55:35] He loves diverter so you shoot up into that sort of major toll booth shot

[55:40] It goes up around and then it'll divert it to the flipper or into a lock on the left side

[55:46] Which he likes he's used that before he has used that before and a pat lawler has this

[55:51] design

[55:52] philosophy where he puts

[55:54] Three lanes on the left or sometimes on the right and two lanes on the right

[55:59] He's able to sort of squeeze that bottom play field

[56:04] Together

[56:05] It's like his thing

[56:06] Yeah, the flippers are usually offset to the right and he's got stuff on the left

[56:10] So this game would sell 7,300 units and what was released right after that game?

[56:16] I don't know rock rock rock and roll their games

[56:20] Rock so it's so so roller games was the next game and it only sells 5,000 units

[56:26] So there's some redemption

[56:29] Yeah for pat lawler against the evil Steve Richie whirlwinds a better game

[56:34] I said it so good. I said it. Didn't you sell your roller games working on it? Wow

[56:40] The funny thing is mine is a very early production

[56:43] Roller games so the shooter gauge is actually a whirlwind shooter gauge

[56:47] Is the bridge is super cool. So this brings me to I would say

[56:54] Oh

[56:56] One of my absolute favorite games ever ever ever ever of all the all the LCD games and DMD games and and of course

[57:04] We're gonna talk about Adam's family coming up and all that stuff of all of those games man. I love

[57:10] Funhouse that's right biff. So it's a creepy

[57:14] Creepy ass clown carnival. He's not a clown. He's a dummy. It's

[57:20] November of 1990 it is a Williams WPC

[57:24] So this is this new board set that Larry tomorrow is working on it sells

[57:30] 10,751 units

[57:35] Art by John Yosey sound and music

[57:38] The legend Chris Granger and John hey software by Larry Demar and a fellow named

[57:46] Brian Eddie. So what do you think about this game?

[57:51] I think if I made a horror movie about a pinball machine that comes to life this would be the game I use

[57:58] Which I think I think this is in a horror movie this game

[58:02] I was made in the last year or so. Oh man. So the theme wow

[58:07] It is like it is like an amusement park

[58:11] Funhouse there's you know, it's it's exactly that it is it is a perfect

[58:18] creepy ass game

[58:20] Well, what makes it creepy we keep saying that well pat luller says I always wanted to do a game with a big talking head

[58:26] The head was going on the play field yackin away at you and you get to whack it back with the ball pat luller's all about

[58:32] Amazing mechanical bits he's able to mix mechanical

[58:38] physical toys like almost no other pinball designer and Rudy this

[58:44] Mechanical talking head is a great example of that but before we get into Rudy

[58:48] So you remember comment right we talked about that under our previous Python angelo episode

[58:53] Yes, I do so there was riverview amusement park which was in Chicago or outside of Chicago

[58:59] They had a funhouse there called Aladdin's castle and the mouth was the entrance to this funhouse and the eyes

[59:07] Were huge and they moved around

[59:10] Huh, that sounds scary. So fun houses are just creepy

[59:13] I don't know if they meant them to be creepy, but they just are and of course Barry outslor was the roller coaster

[59:19] Theme park guy

[59:20] So Pat's kind of moving into somebody else's territory there especially when he's taking inspiration from the exact same amusement park

[59:28] The Barry took for comment

[59:32] Hey pinheads

[59:33] I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not making cheesy jokes to make Ron laugh

[01:00:41] Now let's get into Rudy

[01:00:44] Rudy's a talking head

[01:00:45] So this started from an idea where John Riosi did some preliminary sketches

[01:00:50] He just sort of sketched something together with a head on a play field

[01:00:53] So Rudy was designed by John Crutch

[01:00:55] It was basically Pat's engineer he'd work with him from 1988 to 2005

[01:01:01] Pat would say John did all the magic

[01:01:03] And the thing is I believe John Crutch worked he worked at a toy factory or something where he was making

[01:01:10] He gave him the background to make that

[01:01:13] insane

[01:01:14] Mac that is Rudy's head

[01:01:16] Williams head just a monopoly on these amazing engineers especially in that sort of

[01:01:22] 19

[01:01:24] Like 88 to to the 1996 they just had amazing engineers the thing is one of the stories Pat told

[01:01:31] Was when he was describing this game to his engineering team

[01:01:36] And he was describing is I'm gonna have this head. It's gonna do this it's gonna do that and the engineering

[01:01:42] They thought it was more like the captain bizarre head if you remember that from party zone like when he's small heads

[01:01:48] And there's a way me you're gonna hit it with the ball and all how big is his head?

[01:01:51] So Pat gets a block of wood

[01:01:53] The size of Rudy's head and puts it on the play field and said this is how big the head's gonna be

[01:01:58] And they're there like how are you gonna fit that on the play field

[01:02:01] He said that's my problem

[01:02:03] You need to get it to work. It's it's really big. It's like when you when you when you get in there and you see it like in person

[01:02:10] You're like wow it has like this imposing it's more than a bash toy

[01:02:14] It is something else and it is a defining feature of this machine

[01:02:20] It is just amazing eyes move eyelids move mouth is on a motor

[01:02:25] The coating that went into getting that because he snores and the mouth moves like an emotion when he's snoring and all that

[01:02:32] It's crazy. So naming Rudy of course is a big deal and it is perfect

[01:02:37] It is named absolutely perfect right because the character himself is a is a bit of a douche

[01:02:41] Yeah, yeah, and he mocks you and he teases you and he's rude. So Rudy was perfect

[01:02:46] Well Pat Lawler said I showed it to my wife Cassandra and I said what should we call the dummy and she replied call him Rudy

[01:02:51] There you go. That's amazing. She just like pops that up better nowhere

[01:02:55] And everyone at Williams didn't even know what to expect

[01:02:57] They all expected to some sort of small kind of articulated like dummy head

[01:03:02] You touched on the programming now Larry Demar designs the board set here

[01:03:08] WPC this is the first WPC game and programming this head to be

[01:03:13] Talking to snore to look around the play field with his eyes

[01:03:18] That doesn't that's not easy agreed

[01:03:20] So it took Larry Demar hundreds of hours to design the script and language to actually make Rudy talk naturally

[01:03:27] And Ed Boone of Mortal Kombat fame is the voice of Rudy. Oh, they made his eyes follow the ball

[01:03:32] And then we actually

[01:03:34] Someone mentioned this I believe in our I think it was our John Borgin episode with Jurassic Park when they had it on test

[01:03:41] They actually had Williams people looking at to see if they were stealing their patented technology

[01:03:47] When the dinosaur follows the ball. Yes, it was that they patented it on this game

[01:03:52] So Rudy's eyes follow the ball

[01:03:54] And it took the sound and music eyes hundreds of hours to get the voice right because the first they thought it was too cartoonish

[01:03:59] Too dark and creepy and finally they got the voice where they wanted it

[01:04:02] If you ever played it in midnight

[01:04:04] Basically Rudy gets angry part of the funhouse closes

[01:04:08] You want you out of there you get to hit him a lot. That's always so good. It's the best part

[01:04:13] That's the best part right not only do you have this incredible toy

[01:04:15] But you can just bash it in the face over and over again when Rudy gets angry that the tone of the game actually changes right

[01:04:22] It's no longer sort of like fun and him sort of taunting you

[01:04:26] He like he gets angry he gets mad and then the tone and everything just changes

[01:04:31] And to get him to sound right to you know, you don't want him to be childish when he's angry like cranky

[01:04:37] You want him to be angry and the person becomes

[01:04:41] slower and more stern when they start talking which is pretty amazing when

[01:04:46] Rudy falls asleep at midnight

[01:04:49] He starts to snore and not only does he just sort of snore

[01:04:54] His jaw like quivers. Yeah right with the snoring. Yeah, Pat Lawler said and I this was on his top cast interview

[01:05:02] When they had the thing all set up they had knee on the Castro the president of Williams come down and play the game

[01:05:07] He just played the game once and he turned to him and said guy, you know, don't f**k this up

[01:05:13] This is so cool. I can't imagine not selling a zillion of these

[01:05:17] It's something else when I when I first saw this game

[01:05:19] I was like, oh man that guy's that is cool

[01:05:21] And then when I started playing it immediately you recognize this is special. This is different

[01:05:27] There is something going on here that is that is not like any other pin especially at the time

[01:05:32] Yeah, what they banked on was you know you walk by it and you see the head like oh, okay

[01:05:37] What does the head do you got to play at least one game to see what the head does?

[01:05:41] It's captivating. It's fun. It's unusual. It it

[01:05:47] Tons you you're a big fan of games that mock you all in one. This is an amazing package

[01:05:55] If you take training with dis with the Disney Institute

[01:05:59] What they do is they they sort of train you on the Disney philosophy and you could do that in Orlando

[01:06:04] And you could do it online now of course. I took this course with Disney

[01:06:07] There's a whole sort of section on the tiki hut. Are you familiar with the Disney tiki hut?

[01:06:13] No, I'm just curious about this whole Disney course. Do they just tell you to buy every property in the ruin it

[01:06:18] Like they did with Star Wars. Yeah

[01:06:20] Yeah, the tiki hut is an experience down in

[01:06:24] Orlando and I assume they have one in California

[01:06:26] You go to the tiki hut and it's like it's like a musical experience where the birds talk to you and they sing a song in the tiki

[01:06:34] Hut if you've been there you now have that song just stuck in your head you'll have it there for days

[01:06:39] Sounds like I would hate it. Yeah as most Disney things are what they do though is they talk about how they

[01:06:46] They suck you into that experience with things that you don't even notice for example the the animatronic birds

[01:06:54] Walt Disney was very adamant that those birds

[01:06:58] Look like they're breathing that their chests move and the majority of people will not notice that these birds have moving

[01:07:06] Breathing chests, but what it does is subconsciously you see it as being more realistic even though you may not notice it

[01:07:15] Things like the way Rudy reacts

[01:07:18] The way his eyes move the way his jaw quivers when he snores

[01:07:23] That is the exact same philosophy is that it immerses you without even knowing it

[01:07:28] And it is this is a very special game and this is why I put it amongst you know some of the top games ever

[01:07:35] And and one that I was certainly loved to have so if you're keeping scarred home we have a vertical playfield

[01:07:41] We have a shaker motor

[01:07:43] We have a fan and now we have a

[01:07:46] Talking animatronic head this guy. He's just he's just pulling every every game

[01:07:52] It's sort of like Steve Richie's earlier career, right where it's like everything he does is just something new and amazing

[01:07:58] That one thing that I really love about pat is that that he's able to really recognize and celebrate his team

[01:08:05] It doesn't just take one designer to make a game it really takes an entire team of talented people pat throughout various interviews

[01:08:15] Seminars that he's done at at like pinball expo

[01:08:18] He's made sure that he was able to to point out the amazing team that is able to do those

[01:08:23] There were over 20 people that actually worked in making this very special game

[01:08:28] It truly is a team effort. We know Steve Richie often says there's one dad the person that controls the project and inspires creativity

[01:08:35] But it's truly the team that brings it all together and they sold over 10,000 fun houses now

[01:08:41] This it's been a long time since Williams is sold 10,000 units. What was it probably black night?

[01:08:46] Been a while. No, no, what am I saying?

[01:08:49] No high speed high speed. Oh, yeah, that's right and don't forget

[01:08:53] Again the first 100 or so diamond plate play field. Yeah, so we've brought this this whole diamond plate thing up before

[01:09:01] So like let's talk about that a little bit, okay?

[01:09:04] Because it's probably driving people crazy clear coding. Yeah, yeah, the company came in with this idea

[01:09:10] And they experimented with it

[01:09:13] usually maybe 50 hundred couple hundred every run of these games

[01:09:18] Most of them ended up being loiter games because he was one of the champions of this new process

[01:09:24] But it's you know, so it's on all his all the games we just mentioned

[01:09:27] But it's also like on roller games. It's on I think

[01:09:31] Diner there's a diners with it

[01:09:34] Um, and basically all it is it's just it's clear code

[01:09:37] So what Williams was doing before this is they were doing full play field my Lars

[01:09:41] Originally, there was nothing and and just where to hell

[01:09:44] So they started putting like thick mylar down on the play field when they started getting into the faster games more

[01:09:50] You know ramps more speed

[01:09:52] So you just have a full play field mylar and then it starts experimenting with this diamond plate

[01:09:57] Yes, there's some of the big complaints among the distributors were hey, I got this game in like 24 months later

[01:10:03] All the slings are all blown out around there. It's all scratched up the paints coming off

[01:10:08] Nobody wants to play a game that looks like crap

[01:10:11] You know, they had to come up with some sort of method you said themselves. It was adding mylar right so sometimes they put some mylar around the slings or the poppumpers

[01:10:18] But that's just that's just a band-aid right? Yep, and it was son

[01:10:21] Was the company that came in and with this new process

[01:10:25] So Pat would say that it's about 20 dollars extra per play field to clear code it at the time to put this diamond plate technology

[01:10:33] And he would say it's not every day that a sales guy comes in and pitches an idea that you can do

[01:10:40] Which is simple fast and cheap and can't be replicated today

[01:10:44] Obviously as we were having clear code issues

[01:10:46] But I have a feeling what they were spraying it with with probably not pass health and safety standards

[01:10:52] Health and safety standards today

[01:10:53] Yeah, you and you had mentioned you just can't change everything right? You just can't this team can't come in and you go

[01:10:58] Yeah, let's go ahead and just every single play field they did about a three-year burn on it

[01:11:05] From the first first ones to the actually what full production

[01:11:08] And the risk was the two years down the road there'd be like big chunks ripping off the play field or massive cracks or

[01:11:16] That's just today

[01:11:18] It started to prove that it was actually a very good idea

[01:11:22] Now of course there were certainly some concerns about this diamond plate idea, right?

[01:11:27] Yeah, there's always a concern that well, oh you have the quote right here Python angelo

[01:11:32] Polycarbonite play fields we tried that idea, but we put us

[01:11:36] IE Williams out of business the play field wouldn't wear or ever need to be replaced

[01:11:41] Pat Waller didn't think of diamond coat bulls**t idea. We needed to sell machines

[01:11:45] Python's critique here which may not be his own personal critique

[01:11:48] But the critique within Williams at the time was you want to know where out you want this play field to wear out because

[01:11:54] You wouldn't buy a new pinball machine, right?

[01:11:56] If if the play field looked like it rolled off the off the factory floor and it depends

[01:12:00] I can see Pat Waller would actually say are we cutting our own throat?

[01:12:05] The people in engineering convinced the executives that selling you a machine on it lasting longer

[01:12:11] Then on selling it as a replacement to the old product that didn't last longer was a better idea

[01:12:17] So do you think that that was a mistake? Do you think clear coat and diamond plate was actually a mistake that it would impact sales?

[01:12:23] There's good arguments either way. I really think so. I mean if you

[01:12:28] Especially when the next Pat Waller game comes out

[01:12:31] And sells the way it does. Why do I need to replace it still looks good?

[01:12:35] Your machine wears out you got to go back to Williams buy a new machine you're going to keep going now

[01:12:41] My critique on this is that

[01:12:44] Pinball machines have evolved and for for especially during this time that the features the toys the max the experience

[01:12:52] Continue to evolve so if you still wanted to keep getting the the quarters

[01:12:58] You would have had to buy a new machine with the new innovations in technology

[01:13:02] Firepower is not going to earn the same as whirlwind

[01:13:06] Right, and that has nothing to do with it wearing out and everything to do with the advancement in technology

[01:13:10] Yeah, Pat Waller said you can't convince me of it if your company isn't able to build a good product

[01:13:15] If you can't build a better one than ours if we aren't good enough at building new entertainment then we shouldn't be around

[01:13:22] Yeah, so Pat Waller agrees with me. Thank you Pat Waller

[01:13:25] So this there was a new name here that popped up

[01:13:28] I don't want to just sort of gloss over this and that's Brian Eddie or brain Eddie

[01:13:33] Yeah, you you call him that throughout your show notes here. I do

[01:13:36] So he did a lot of the flasher's and some of the display effects and

[01:13:41] Animations on the alpha numeric displays. So he's sort of learned in the ropes, right? He's learning the WPC system

[01:13:47] And that's the thing about

[01:13:49] Funhouse it's a WPC alpha numeric game. So it's running on the new system and they could do some cool little effects with the alpha numeric display

[01:13:58] But as much as you could ever do the only reason you even downloaded this episode

[01:14:05] We are in March of 1992

[01:14:10] This is the Adams family. It is a licensed movie theme. It is a Williams WPC

[01:14:17] But it's a DMD this time

[01:14:20] It sells 20,270 units

[01:14:27] Art by John Yosey design of course Pat Waller

[01:14:31] Music and sound by the legend chris granner

[01:14:35] software by Larry Demar and Mike Boone

[01:14:39] Denonin

[01:14:44] All right, so this is this is the peak of peaks of peaks of peaks of peaks

[01:14:51] Licensing has finally come to Williams

[01:14:55] We had all seen

[01:14:57] Steve Richie's high speed as a watershed moment in the history of pinball would you agree with that?

[01:15:04] Yeah, it was the definitely the beginning of the resurgence

[01:15:07] You know the people like Dwight Sullivan people like Pat Lawler played high speed. They were inspired

[01:15:14] They saw my goodness. There could be a story. There could be a world

[01:15:19] under

[01:15:20] Glass

[01:15:22] No other pinball had told a story, you know, it had brought a video game to pinball

[01:15:28] But Pat Lawler also learned that theme was everything

[01:15:32] Theme wasn't just something you threw away and the William designers of course they were very proud people

[01:15:38] They were very proud because not only could they make a fun game that sold and earned

[01:15:43] But they were so creative that they could come up with their own themes

[01:15:47] Data East had had come around and they had cracked licensing

[01:15:52] Of course, this wasn't lost on Pat Lawler. It wasn't lost on Williams

[01:15:57] Like could you imagine if Rudy was Bart Simpson?

[01:16:00] Oh god, don't have a cow man. Boom. You hit him. They would have sold 20 or 30,000 fun houses, right?

[01:16:06] Like it would have just supercharged an already amazing thing

[01:16:11] So getting a license

[01:16:13] was all of a sudden important in pinball where before

[01:16:17] Maybe not so much. Well Pat said Adam's family happened because of a lunch I had with Ken Fidesna

[01:16:23] I was negotiating a new contract then Ken said these people in Highlywood are doing an Adam's family movie

[01:16:28] You could do a haunted house theme. It was my favorite show as a kid and I wanted to do it

[01:16:33] Roger Sharp knew it was dumped by one studio and picked up by another studio

[01:16:36] So Roger did some calls and they agreed to have Valley Williams do a pinball machine

[01:16:40] And lucky for them the movie ended up being hit and it was a monster license at the time

[01:16:46] Especially like it was a great movie. We'll talk about that in a minute

[01:16:49] But Roger Sharp he's he's the man that saved pinball

[01:16:53] But to be honest the most important thing that Roger has ever done in pinball

[01:16:58] Was being the liaison between a Valley Williams and pinball manufacturers and all of the fun social connections that he had in Hollywood to create

[01:17:08] Licensing so as soon as it became a thing Roger Sharp really blew up now the Adam's family license

[01:17:15] Okay, so let's dive into this a little bit. Why was this such a big theme especially in the early 90s?

[01:17:21] Well the Adam's family is a fictional household created by an American cartoonist called Charles Adam

[01:17:28] In 1938 the Adam's family is a satirical inversion of the ideal 20th century American family

[01:17:38] There are an odd wealthy aristocratic family who delighted in the black arts and are seemingly unaware or

[01:17:46] Unconcerned that other people find them bizarre or frightening

[01:17:50] It was originally published in the New Yorker magazine the Adam's family that everybody remembers right Ron

[01:17:57] Is the Adam's family TV show of the 1960s. Is this something that you watched?

[01:18:02] Uh, not really my era, but I have seen episodes. Yes

[01:18:06] Yeah, so when I was younger in the 1990s. I was a big

[01:18:11] Nick at night TV watcher. I think that comes from my mother my mother watches television on a 20 to 25 year delay

[01:18:18] So today my mother is watching shows from 20 years ago

[01:18:23] 20 years ago my mother was watching shows from 20 years before that from 40 years from today

[01:18:29] She just watches TV on a delay. I don't get that. I watched a lot of Adam's family

[01:18:34] I watched a lot of monsters. I watched a lot of get smart

[01:18:38] There's an amazing license by the way stern pinball

[01:18:41] This 30-minute television series was created by David levy and Donald Sultzman and was shot in black and white

[01:18:49] It aired for two seasons on ABC from September 18th

[01:18:54] 1964 to April 8th

[01:18:57] 1966 it had a total of 64 episodes

[01:19:01] Which is pretty interesting to have such a huge culture challenging show and only having 64 episodes

[01:19:07] Now the show of course was most notable for its opening theme which was composed and sung by Vic Mizzy

[01:19:15] That theme again Ron

[01:19:18] Dada-dada-dada-dada-dada-dada-dada-dada-dada

[01:19:23] Most of the humor of this TV show derives from the fact that the Adam'ses have this culture class

[01:19:30] Culture clash with the rest of the world

[01:19:32] They inevitably treat normal visitors with great warmth and courtesy

[01:19:37] Even though the guests express confusion and fear and dismay at the decor of their house the sight of lurch

[01:19:46] Their servant and thing their disembodied hand in a box

[01:19:52] And that was because there was a person on the table some visitors of course head bad intentions to steal their money

[01:19:58] Which the family generally ignored and they ended up suffering no harm whatsoever

[01:20:03] Another big TV show at the time was

[01:20:06] Monsters

[01:20:07] So why was this show sort of culturally impactful? Well, one of them was that at the time

[01:20:12] The idea was that people might look different and be different

[01:20:17] But you should judge them by their actions and you should judge them by their hearts

[01:20:22] Not their outside and that of course comes from the fact that there was a significant cultural change with the African American community in the United States

[01:20:31] This was a big big show wasn't it? Oh sure

[01:20:35] Nothing else I got nothing

[01:20:36] It's not it's not my era

[01:20:38] So this is what inevitably would inspire the

[01:20:41] 1991 movie the Adams family so this

[01:20:46] Movies basis is that Gomez Adams had a falling out with his brother Fester Adams from the TV show who then left the family

[01:20:55] after 25 years a person resembling Fester returns turns out it is actually Fester with MNESIA

[01:21:03] But what he does is he tries to infiltrate the family and steal their fortune on behalf of his mother

[01:21:10] Oh, so Fester's the bad guy. I never seen the movie so you haven't seen the Adams family movie

[01:21:16] She spoiled it spoilers it is really really good. I saw this movie in 1991 in the theater with my family

[01:21:23] There was a sequel of course

[01:21:25] Because you got a cash in but the the ah man. This is a great movie

[01:21:29] I recently watched this movie again about six months ago during lockdown

[01:21:34] With my wife. I love this movie. This movie just is so silly. It's so fun and it's so well-acted

[01:21:41] The casting is just just a just brilliant

[01:21:46] So this had a 30 million dollar budget. It had

[01:21:50] uh

[01:21:52] $191.5 million gross now it only scores a 64 on rotten tomatoes

[01:21:58] So Paramount did a test with random people on the street doing the Adams family song and asking him what song it was

[01:22:04] 80% of people knew that what the song was

[01:22:07] This is a monster license 80% of people know that song and know that term so this is a this is a license that you

[01:22:12] universally know and across sort of a lot of a lot of people clay herald who is was the host of

[01:22:19] Topcast he would actually say that no pinheads actually played Adams family

[01:22:26] But casual players hang off of it. It'll sit next to his new modern sterns like pirates or spider-man

[01:22:33] And it's still out earns them. So that would have been like in 2007

[01:22:38] He said that yeah to in 2007

[01:22:41] The Adams family still out earns pirates of the Caribbean by stern and spider-man the Steve richi masterpiece

[01:22:48] So originally pat wanted to take the back box and make it like a dollhouse and the house would have separate rooms with stuff in it

[01:22:55] But of course that wasn't able to be done because of the costing so back in the shark tank mentality

[01:23:01] Imagine proving all the naysayers wrong like python angelo who said

[01:23:05] Adams family isn't pat wallers. It's Roger sharps. He was Roger sharpen Larry de Marse de dine

[01:23:11] Pat lauder never thanked me for keeping the bali line alive so he could make Adams family wow

[01:23:19] Isn't that a great quote if you've ever heard the python angelo topcast you need to listen to it

[01:23:24] He does not like pat lauder pat lauer. Did you know Adams family has a topper a factory topper of course another one of those epic toppers

[01:23:32] Yeah, how much do you think that topper cost?

[01:23:35] Uh

[01:23:36] Thousand dollars no

[01:23:38] No, no, no that's lights in it though, right? 800 dollars. Oh

[01:23:42] Oh, you're being funny because of the current topper prices this coming from the guy who's got the R2D2 topper

[01:23:48] So they got the idea from the topper because because they had the script as a movie wasn't out yet

[01:23:53] There was a scene that ended up being cut

[01:23:55] Where the kids were on top of the roof generating lightning with a weather machine

[01:23:59] So the topper is the weather machine and the clouds and the whatever. Yep. It's on the back glass

[01:24:04] Well, that was in the movie, but it was cut

[01:24:06] Um, one of the other times we ran into this was in our

[01:24:10] John Borg episode

[01:24:12] live in the 90s license dream where

[01:24:15] You know, they'll get the script ahead of time and then often bits will be cut from that script and then they're sort of

[01:24:21] Stuck releasing a pin at the same time even though it may not have parts that were in the movie

[01:24:26] So in the movie one of the major pieces is the vault and this is where of course the money is stored in behind the bookcase

[01:24:34] So pat lawler the

[01:24:36] King of integrating licenses

[01:24:39] There's this awesome little bash toy that looks like a

[01:24:44] bookcase and then it rotates and then you can kind of shoot right up in behind the bookcase

[01:24:49] Originally this didn't say

[01:24:52] Anything on it. It was just the bookcase and you just hit it you can see these pictures in ipdb

[01:24:58] I'll leave them in the show notes

[01:24:59] Of course then people didn't really know what to do with those original prototypes

[01:25:03] So then they changed put a sticker on it that said spell greed to rotate the bookcase to get into the vault

[01:25:10] That almost sounds like a iron man. They added the sticker that said spinners raise iron munger

[01:25:16] Yeah, because you didn't know what to do even though the game I think told you at some point hit the spinners

[01:25:21] Yeah, raise the iron munger a pinball experience for the whole family

[01:25:26] It's creepy kooky spooky and oooki the adams family

[01:25:30] Mm-hmm very well done now there's some thing special in pinball. Oh

[01:25:37] So what could this flyer be talking about that there's some thing special in pinball, bro the thing toy

[01:25:44] This is amazing. So we're gonna you know, we just talked about how absolutely

[01:25:50] friggin awesome Rudy is

[01:25:52] Well, this simple awesome toy thing is is crazy. Yeah, there's there's a few innovations on

[01:26:00] And so you have the optical sensor in the bookcase

[01:26:04] Which doesn't really get mentioned it doesn't there's no switch there it's optic

[01:26:08] So it detects the hits

[01:26:10] Then it's got of course the thing or thing

[01:26:14] Was in the upper right and he actually comes out of the play field grabs your ball and then goes back underneath the play field

[01:26:20] Okay, so how does so there's like a box in the back right things box. Yeah, so

[01:26:27] So there's this hand that comes out and grabs the ball. So how does that work basically?

[01:26:31] It comes out

[01:26:32] Be like a motor and then there's a magnet on the hand and it just grabs the ball from a saucer then goes back in

[01:26:40] releases the ball into a subway and then it sort of

[01:26:43] Trickles down underneath the play field somewhere else and then it has thing flips

[01:26:47] Which I thought was one of the really cool features

[01:26:50] It has a little mini flipper on the left called the thing flipper. It's things flipper

[01:26:56] And if you go down the correct in lane again, there's multiple in lanes because this is a patent-lother game on the left side

[01:27:01] If you go down the correct in lane on the left side hit the ramp when it comes around

[01:27:06] Thing will shoot the

[01:27:08] I believe it's the swamp shot himself without your intervention

[01:27:12] Yeah, so the computer takes over and flips you can flip yourself

[01:27:16] But if you just let it go it will flip for you and it will detect if it missed it by what it hit if it's like early or late

[01:27:24] And it will adjust over time and it is surprisingly accurate the thing with the atoms family is it does things that surprise you

[01:27:32] You know what I mean like it's it's not just shooting

[01:27:35] Rudy or a bash toy or ramps or whatever like it it continually over the time you play and the deeper you play in the more you play

[01:27:42] Little things you notice will it'll start doing things which are pretty nuts the thing hand is pretty cool

[01:27:49] So for example in one of the modes you shoot the saucer thing comes out grabs the ball

[01:27:54] And puts it in and drops it in the subway right?

[01:27:56] But there's another moment where thing will come out he'll grab the ball put it back in and then you know

[01:28:01] The narrator Gomez Adams no

[01:28:04] No, put that thing back and then the hand comes back out puts the ball back in the saucer

[01:28:09] And then the hand goes back in so it continually does these things to surprise you

[01:28:14] Another one of those cool things is sort of this innovation called like auto flipping and the thing flips is part of that

[01:28:22] But there's a little bit more to these auto flipping right there is let what what do you saying?

[01:28:27] So I've played this game and the first few times you're kind of flipping the ball

[01:28:32] The music and the sound is a big part of the atoms family

[01:28:36] It's all in one package and a big part of that is that

[01:28:39] traditional atoms family from the song the data that snap snap

[01:28:46] And there's times where you'll drain the ball and what you'll do is you'll use the flippers yourself

[01:28:50] And it'll go ten and then and then you'll push the flipper buttons and you'll go snap snap just because you're

[01:28:55] You're having fun right?

[01:28:56] You're kind of like involved in that music and you just can't help but like

[01:29:00] Clap and of course your hands are on the flippers. So you press the buttons

[01:29:05] But then all of a sudden the game itself will automatically flip those flippers to that beat

[01:29:12] And you freak out and you go oh my god the game did the thing yeah

[01:29:16] Atoms family was the first game Williams had well designed

[01:29:21] With solid state flippers so they could control it using their flip tronics one board which I believe is only used on

[01:29:28] Atoms family pat Lawler would say that we gave people exactly what they expected

[01:29:34] The flipper was going to go data that snap snap very cool

[01:29:39] So of course that wasn't the first time they ever used auto flippers

[01:29:42] There's a 1953 Williams game called palisades

[01:29:47] And the flipper will automatically flip when the ball lands in a pocket in front of the flipper

[01:29:53] So it's not quite the same thing

[01:29:55] But it's pretty cool. There's a Zachariah game that auto flips which surprised me

[01:30:00] Because it it I think it's a soccer base game

[01:30:03] And it's trying to get balls out of a certain area. So we'll just automatically flip the flipper. So another neat bit

[01:30:09] Is five pop bumpers. Yeah

[01:30:12] So in the graveyard area there's five pop bumpers

[01:30:16] All clustered together which is a Gary Stern no no because three is the magic number

[01:30:22] It must be really hard to jam five pop bumpers into a play field with all the mechanics under the play field all the solenoids all the switches

[01:30:30] Palo are likes pop bumpers again. He's got that shot right that's that orbit shot right up through the pop bumpers that he started in world wind

[01:30:38] Very reminiscent of him. He also has the the electric chair shot which is like your mode shot, isn't it?

[01:30:48] Yeah, it starts to say this one of your first mode based games and not really called modes

[01:30:53] But they're just their windows of the mansion to where the mansion

[01:30:57] Then that's why I think it gets a certain reputation amongst pinball players in that you can just

[01:31:04] Hit the hit the ramp

[01:31:05] Hit the chair hit the ramp hit the chair hit the ramp hit the chair

[01:31:08] Hit those two shots and you can literally go through the entire game. Yeah, so it I mean this is the beginning of that

[01:31:15] Sort of era right when it comes to you know complexity of code and John Norris of course he had done the lights camera action game at

[01:31:25] Premier Gottlieb and that was really the first sort of quote-unquote mode based game

[01:31:30] But Pat would say that Adam's family was much further than lights camera action

[01:31:35] Pat Lawler says that Adam's family walked right up to the ledge of not being understandable

[01:31:41] It had modes the rest of the industry followed it off a cliff

[01:31:45] And the last 18 years everyone followed that template to make a pinball machine. It hasn't changed since

[01:31:50] Look at that pat Lawler taken credit for designing and over complicating the entire industry for the last 20 years

[01:31:59] So humble

[01:32:02] One of the I think when it comes to Adam's family

[01:32:07] Sort of the the cherry on top is the sound package

[01:32:12] The callouts the music the theme integration to use another one of those sort of clichés and originally

[01:32:20] One of the actors of that movie in jellica Houston

[01:32:25] Was asked to provide the callouts and she declined to do the custom callouts

[01:32:31] Chris Granner in an interview would say that he didn't really want to repeat her agent's response upon

[01:32:38] Declining the pinball machine. I guess one could say Ron that pinball might be beneath some actors

[01:32:44] Is that right? Yeah, and I think she also had to approve her likeness on the back glass which took several attempts

[01:32:52] Yeah, they needed to make her look

[01:32:55] Maybe not quite as realistic as she did at the time

[01:32:58] Maybe they wanted to make her look a little bit younger now

[01:33:01] I can't find any real major quotes or anything on this nobody really wanted to throw

[01:33:06] Miss Houston under the bus with her comments or concerns

[01:33:10] But one could just sort of say that she didn't want to do it

[01:33:13] And she wasn't really the nicest when it came to declining so that makes sense makes sense

[01:33:17] Yeah, she's still in the game although her audio is lifted from the movie itself now Chris Granner's interview on

[01:33:24] On the Adams family. I've got Chris Granner's

[01:33:27] Interview where he talks a lot about this in the show notes

[01:33:30] So feel free to listen to that podcast. It is worth a listen because Chris Granner is so excitable and so like child like when he talks about this stuff

[01:33:38] It's just it's so much fun to listen to him talk. I would love to meet this guy in person and Chris Granner says fortunately

[01:33:43] We had Raul Julia. It was a stunning awesome acting recording session

[01:33:48] When you get to work with an actor of that caliber

[01:33:50] Chris Granner went to New York City to meet Raul in a studio and he would say that he seemed like sick or ill

[01:33:58] Or kind of out of it

[01:34:00] Yeah, Chris said I thought he was stone altered or something

[01:34:03] He was dim and slow on the uptake. I had to describe things to him a couple of different ways

[01:34:08] Things took two times longer than expected. He was on Broadway. Shakespearean nights of the realm

[01:34:12] He needed direction because he's such a formal actor and and we're not talking like Raul Julia

[01:34:19] It wasn't just sort of like an actor right like this guy was a proper

[01:34:24] Shakespearean fancy pants actor like he needed to be told and directed and inspired fancy pants. Oh yes

[01:34:32] So Chris Granner would tell Raul just give it a try

[01:34:35] And suddenly looked up and said it's cousin it or extra ball and he had transformed in Gomez Adams

[01:34:43] Then as soon as the line was over he go right back to being Raul Julia

[01:34:46] It was a remarkable session a spectacular session

[01:34:48] Could you imagine with a caliber of that kind of when you hear those those callouts and he's just like this sort of dim

[01:34:56] Maybe stoned weird

[01:34:58] depressed guy and then all of a sudden he comes out and he's Gomez Adams and then he's not

[01:35:02] That must be weird. So they sold a lot of Am's families

[01:35:06] So this is a this is the record-breaking pin now. I've made jokes on previous podcasts about you know pat lawler and his

[01:35:14] selling of pinball machines and being the top selling

[01:35:18] pinball person of all time

[01:35:21] It's a title. I think he should be very proud of the Adams family sold 20,270 units

[01:35:26] But there was also 1,000 special edition Adams family gold editions had two years later

[01:35:33] so for example

[01:35:35] And this is not necessarily an industry order, but these are just some numbers that I've pulled out of the top selling pins

[01:35:40] the next top selling pin was eight ball by Bally

[01:35:44] We spoke about that in our Bally episode where it had a backlash that sort of looked like the fons

[01:35:49] It's the fons it was 20,230 units

[01:35:54] We had Steve Richie's original the flash

[01:35:57] Which sold 19,505 units we had Bally's playboy, which was a smash hit around the time of eight ball

[01:36:06] sells 18,250

[01:36:08] And of course Steve Richie's firepower at 17,410

[01:36:14] So he is amongst some of the legendary great machines and designers of all time and he smashed

[01:36:23] Those sales numbers absolutely smashed them because it's an all in one package right it's got fun shots

[01:36:29] It's it's surprising. It's got the toys. It's it's it is

[01:36:34] All out record breaking package and it deserves the title. What do you think? Yeah, it's it's a great game

[01:36:41] But whether pinheads are crazy about it or not it for a tournament play it is quite of

[01:36:46] Minotinus you just hit the same two shots over and over but for an experience like if like a newbie

[01:36:52] I put them on that in a second my wife loves Adams family

[01:36:57] Loves Adams family. I enjoy Adams family

[01:37:00] I haven't played enough of it. It has a couple of shots. I don't particularly like like I say how many did it sell?

[01:37:07] What do I know?

[01:37:08] It's all about what it sells

[01:37:09] So Pat Lawler wanted to commemorate the actual record breaking game from the production line

[01:37:14] And he arranged to have it made in a gold cabinet

[01:37:18] So Pat says the record breaking game was number 20,232 that game is the one we all had our picture taken in front of

[01:37:24] And it's the one on the cover replay magazine the inside of the game was signed by every worker on the line that day

[01:37:29] So that machine was originally in the possession of the late gene cunning him. Yeah, I wonder where that is now

[01:37:36] Hmm. I don't know where that machine is now

[01:37:38] So if you bought an Adams family from the late gene cunning him or his estate

[01:37:43] You got a nice little piece of history there

[01:37:46] Uh, this change caused uh several games in the run to subsequently have some strange bits

[01:37:54] So they had some gold accents in the lower cabinets and even some of the back boxes which were originally blue

[01:38:02] So you may have a if you're on one of these later 20,232 plus you might have a weird mixture of gold accents and blue accents on your

[01:38:14] cabinets

[01:38:15] Larry de Mar would say the way our line worked the cabinets and back boxes were created separately than joined together

[01:38:20] And this created a logistical problem for keeping gold with gold and blue with blue along with the likelihood that we had more

[01:38:27] spoilage and back boxes and cabinets or the other way around meant that in small number of games were mismatched

[01:38:33] So a lot of people are always on the search for an Adams family gold and we'll talk about that in a moment

[01:38:38] But you actually might have an even more rare one if you have the mixed matched colors a mixed matched Adams

[01:38:44] So Adams family gold

[01:38:46] It was uh from October 1994 at gold accents such as metal ramps gold legs and bolts gold lettering the vault plastic the bumper caps and things box were all gold

[01:38:55] And each of the thousand gold machines includes the certificate sign by members of the design team and a gold plate

[01:39:01] containing the machine number on the lower right front of the machine

[01:39:04] Machine number one is property of Pat while they're himself

[01:39:07] Pat Lawler's a nerd like all of us. I would assume and he knows that symbols and collectibility

[01:39:14] and serial numbers and special editions

[01:39:18] Are very important within the industry and here's a prime example of that those Adams family golds actually end up going for a lot more

[01:39:25] Than a standard Adams family isn't that right actually?

[01:39:28] Yeah, I would think so just because there's less of them the only thing is there's also a special the software on there is different

[01:39:34] And as like I think an extra mode and it may even have more speech by Raul Julia

[01:39:39] So I do notice that when a lot of people do updates where they'll go and they will build their own Adams family or rebuild an Adams family

[01:39:46] They'll often build it to the gold standard or they will uh they might do that

[01:39:51] But then they'll I will have the original rom in it though at least in the tournament

[01:39:55] Oh the tournament uh Raul no one wants to see the gold edition on a machine

[01:40:00] Because there's something about it. It had something in there that just makes it a crappier tournament game

[01:40:05] I don't even know what it is

[01:40:06] So of those 1000 Adams family golds they sold every single one of them on day one and pat law would say that they could actually have even sold more

[01:40:16] Denenen

[01:40:18] Denenen

[01:40:21] Wait a minute your notes here say end of episode notes why light zone?

[01:40:25] Nope, that's the end of pat lawler's career. No no roadshow. No no good gulfers

[01:40:31] ah

[01:40:32] That's it

[01:40:33] What I wanted to do is just sort of tie a nice bow on that beginning of pat lawler's career

[01:40:39] He is at the peak of not only his career but the industry and they're going to give him a great adventure

[01:40:45] Which is the super pin and twilight zone

[01:40:48] But we'll cover that under our next pat lawler episode

[01:40:51] I want to leave you with a pat lawler quote which I found very very nice

[01:40:57] Pat says I grew up drawing games and being a game geek
