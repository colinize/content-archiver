[06:55] and that's it we had no actual corrections just that good or no one's listening one or the other

[07:00] oh oh today's topic yeah I saw this like oh we're gonna do one on this one too

[07:09] it is pinball history but I mean everyone in there their mother's done this one

[07:14] Roger Sharp is hailed as the man who saved the game and is always a guest and topic for podcasters

[07:21] we've fought long and hard to avoid giving Roger Sharp yet another ego building podcast to spin

[07:30] his narrative propaganda but here we are wow poor Roger Roger is one of the most important figures

[07:39] in pinball one who rivals the industry giants and no it's not just because he did something in a

[07:47] courtroom once yes Roger did that thing in the mid 1970s where he helped legalize pinball in

[07:55] New York City but that's only a tiny part of Roger's stunning contribution to the hobby we all

[08:03] love and enjoy hey Ron did you know that Roger saved pinball in a courtroom in the 1970s well

[08:09] we're gonna talk about that because that's a very important historical thing

[08:13] huh Roger wrote about pinball Roger played pinball Roger promoted and evangelized pinball

[08:23] for many years before and after that thing that once happened that everybody talks about

[08:29] Roger has been involved in the birth of tournament pinball the second rise of licensing in the 1990s

[08:37] and mainstream journalism outside of pinball he also had a great film based on him and his

[08:46] relationship with his wife Ellen which also talked about a thing that happened in the 70s in a

[08:52] courtroom which we we are gonna talk about right for the people who have never heard about that

[08:56] thing that happened in the 70s in the courtroom this is episode 36 the token Roger Sharp episode

[09:04] what do you know about Roger Sharp seemingly everything at this point because I heard every story

[09:11] so the funny thing about Roger is his accessibility Roger is like legitimately just a guy that hangs

[09:20] out at tournaments and plays and tournaments and you can just have conversations with him most

[09:26] people who have had a autobiographical movie about them who have been the subject of all of these

[09:32] podcasts and the like it's funny that you can just hang out with Roger Sharp at

[09:37] fantastic or pinball expo and talk about coffee and things like that it's very weird is it not

[09:44] I've never really talked to him what not about coffee and stuff now

[09:48] you've never liked talked to him there was one time I've heard this story that one time at

[09:52] fantastic a bunch of people just hung out sitting on the floor and he sat in a chair and told stories

[09:57] yeah that sounds right like that is pretty pretty funny pinball is weird because it's small

[10:03] enough that you still have this accessibility but it's large enough to still have its stars I really

[10:08] enjoy that about pinball should we talk about Roger's early life sure let's did you know that Roger

[10:15] grew up in Chicago went to the University of Wisconsin in 1971 he graduated with a degree in marketing

[10:23] where he ended up in New York City pursuing a career as a journalist university of Wisconsin

[10:28] everybody knows the University of Wisconsin because it's I don't know it's in Wisconsin and he

[10:34] graduated with a marketing degree which is pretty cool you know marketing is a pretty flexible

[10:40] thing you can fall into sales you can fall into writing you can fall into to journalism as it

[10:45] would see with with Roger it's a very versatile sort of arts degree as opposed to like

[10:51] engineering where you're like right into one space and that's kind of it now Roger would often play

[10:57] pinball in university at one of the local pubs journalism was really where Roger wanted to go after

[11:06] university Roger was able to find a job at generalins quarterly and now known as GQ GQ is an

[11:14] American international monthly magazine based in New York City and was founded in 1931 as apparel

[11:21] arts it became gentlemen quarterly in 57 and GQ in the late 60s are you a subscriber to GQ

[11:29] Ron it's not really my thing you know it focuses on fashion style and culture for men through

[11:36] articles on food movies fitness sex music travel celebrities sports technology and books are also

[11:43] feature yeah it's like one of these ones where it's like what books is George Clooney reading and

[11:50] there's like on the front covers George Clooney with like his omega watch and he's like reading a

[11:56] book they had me until the fashion and fitness part yeah you were all in and then yeah no I'm not

[12:03] they're like which cargo shorts are in this season what graphic tease should you wear to a wedding

[12:10] that actually no it's it's mostly like Hugo boss stuff so Roger searching for an article on

[12:16] you know to get him published in GQ wrote an article on pinball which was his passion from university

[12:25] Roger says when I moved to New York City after I left school New York City did not have pinball

[12:31] being in the situation that I was at with gentleman's quarterly I thought this would be a nice way

[12:35] to try to meet people in the industry and maybe I could buy a machine that was really the sole

[12:40] motivation he needed an article he likes pinball and he was like man there's no pinball in New York

[12:46] maybe if I ran an article I could have a machine in my house like and find out who actually makes

[12:49] these machines that's actually pretty pretty funny it's pretty transactional also you have to

[12:55] call it New York City isn't that right Ron yep because if you call it New York as most people do

[13:02] yes as basically everyone that is not enough state New York will just call it New York

[13:08] exactly and that's a thing for you people in upstate New York yeah yeah we all hate New York City too

[13:15] why it's like the greatest city honor yeah okay so this spun off into pinball

[13:22] as in a book title yeah that's right it's all capitals with an exclamation point so you have to say

[13:28] it like that so Roger would go to libraries to do research for this article but there was no

[13:36] information on pinball there was no internet back then you'd have to go to the library you'd have

[13:43] to look through those index cards you'd have to use the Dewey decimal system do you remember that

[13:47] Ron yeah they still use it so yes but now you just can't look it up on a computer you got to

[13:52] like look through the cards so pinball was still a very tight community the information did not flow

[14:00] out of pinball easily because it was still a rather new industry back in the 1960s Roger says

[14:10] Elvin Gottlieb being one and others had some doubts and apprehensions as to whether or not I could

[14:14] really do a book or get a book off the ground because you know there have been a number of people

[14:20] that have been talking about it and it was politically charged Roger had credibility okay he had

[14:26] been printed before in legitimate publications he wasn't just like you and I who are like

[14:31] hobbyists talking into microphones and throwing it up on the internet he was like legitimately

[14:37] so he had an in with publishing companies book companies he had contacts so getting a book

[14:44] off the ground was probably something a lot easier for him than it would be for you and I just

[14:49] to try to make a book and politically charge means it's illegal in a lot of spots and it's

[14:54] and it seems as it's contributing to the you know poor youth of the America and all that stuff

[15:00] so if you're in the pinball industry you're probably thinking okay what does this guy want to

[15:03] talk to us about I mean it's just going to be like a hit piece set us up and how it's ruining the

[15:08] youth of America stuff yeah you know here's somebody who wanted to learn about the pinball business

[15:14] and he eventually went to go meet people like the Harry Williams of Williams pinball bill gersh

[15:22] Elvin Gottlieb Sam Ginsburg and Sam Stern the father of Gary Stern he met the legends you know

[15:32] what I mean these are the people that started pinball as it is today we're not talking about

[15:40] Jersey Jack who is a big contributor to pinball today but like he's not the ultimate beginner of

[15:47] that maybe he will be in 30 or 40 years right when we look back at Jersey Jack but these are like

[15:53] Mount Rushmore style a kind of people that's right pinball the book did not sell gangbusters it did

[16:02] not light the publisher on fire and Rogers Roger did not become a New York Times best seller

[16:09] but try to buy it now but but today it sells for a fortune on eBay I would love a copy of pinball

[16:21] I think it would be a good read and it's also just really cool to have which I think is the reason why

[16:28] I've also heard that there are not just a lot of copies floating around if you've got one

[16:33] congratulations and if you have one I would I would love to hear from you silver ball

[16:38] chronic silver ball vehicles a Gmail if it's so popular now why hasn't it been reprinted

[16:44] okay so this is the question right is why can't they just reprint it well let's ask Roger Roger

[16:51] why Roger says I think that's the publisher they had a nice run with it they enjoyed it but they never

[16:56] felt the need to go back and reprint I have all the rights to everything now I've kind of toyed

[17:01] around with it but it was never the right opportunity to do it there was a financial consideration just

[17:06] because of the nature of the book the amount of color the kind of paper stock and so on yeah it's

[17:13] not cheap to make a book let alone like a legitimate actual and that book was actually cut down he

[17:18] had way more pictures and stuff that we're going to go in there that end up getting cut a lot of

[17:23] it comes down to finances right like if he's gonna if it's gonna cost him three hundred thousand

[17:28] dollars to print a book you know he better make sure that he makes three hundred thousand dollars

[17:33] off of this book right like I don't even I'm just throwing that number out I have no idea what

[17:38] it cost to make a book but I have a few clients that publish books in fact I am writing

[17:44] whatever it is I'm sure a cost less in Canada it well done but but Roger

[17:53] while he was doing a lot of this research and after the book he kept up the contacts with individuals

[18:00] like Sam Stern and he would from time to time travel to Chicago and hang out with the buds

[18:09] so one day while he was at Stern he bumped in to Sam Stern while he was working on a game called

[18:17] stingray stingray is the water sports no not that kind of water so you're actually gonna say that

[18:23] oh no no no no no no no no it's from December of 1977 it sells three thousand and six units

[18:30] the amount of units that mid binball manufacturers would kill to have today yeah that would be good

[18:36] this is designed by Roger Sharp Sam Stern and Mike Kubin Kubin Mike Kubin you don't

[18:43] remember Mike Kubin the great Stern designer make great games like Sea Witch later became Beatles

[18:49] oh good stuff good stuff but Roger designed this game stingray well not really but IPDB which is

[18:56] the source that we use for a lot of our images a lot of our statistical you know information comes

[19:04] from IPDB dot org so please check them out the internet pinball database yes thank you thank you

[19:12] they report that Roger Sharp and Sam Stern designed the game and Mike Kubin designed the white

[19:20] wood well built he built up the white wood right so it kind of like you put you screw the things

[19:26] literally into the wood and he's the one that kind of tweaks the shot so what I've also heard

[19:32] is that Roger happened to be in the factory that day and Sam Stern asked him for some advice

[19:38] they would eventually redesign the right side of the game based on Roger's input and I seem to

[19:45] recall the right side of the game is the weaker side of sea witch isn't that right set sea witch

[19:52] uh uh stingray I'm pretty sure it is let me take a picture let's let's look at some pictures here

[19:58] we love look at it some pictures it's got that kind of weird spot that kind of goes up to the

[20:04] line at the software is the issue of stingray more than the play field trust me on that what's

[20:09] what's wrong with the software and stingray it's it's not good it's another one of those it's got

[20:14] like 55,000 it's got random crap that happens and you just yeah when you shouldn't win but you know

[20:21] what people level we go into the flyers yes and this is an early Stern game right this is just after

[20:30] they had purchased uh was it west not west or Chicago coin probably a couple years is this like

[20:36] something one of their not first but one of their first solid state games so you'll see things

[20:42] like digital display for scoring because it's a big deal now spinning target drop target bank

[20:49] dive into action stingray by Stern built in test program complete accounting program improve

[20:57] ball action with an innovative play field proven solid state micro processor system

[21:02] high score to date display and news yes by proven solid state mom micro processor system we mean the

[21:08] one we stole from ballet and it's proven it's proven to work and they did have a slightly

[21:18] different soundboard so I guess that's the news sound it's kind of cool it's it's like a neat

[21:22] little game it's like there's a it's like your underwater scuba diving it's got a spinner

[21:27] on the left side it doesn't have sound it's got chimes oh yeah I don't know like this new sound maybe

[21:33] it's our new chime box unit I don't I don't that doesn't make sense I think it's got the

[21:39] fa is it five chimes it's got four four bar chime units Stern uses four and it's the same one

[21:44] that like Ken ball uses that was before it so I have no idea what made him put that on the flyer

[21:49] maybe was supposed to have electronic sound originally and then it went back to that's interesting

[21:55] actually well I mean when it comes down to it this is the game that followed stars yep which

[22:02] was the other two player game and I mean man oh man stars the official game of slam till

[22:09] actually I think stars stars followed stingray but yeah oh yeah okay but they're right they're

[22:15] right yeah they have the bizarre like player one is the lowest score but they go off it's very

[22:21] confusing I'd love to ask someone at Stern why they did that no one else did that wow okay well

[22:28] could you read this line Ron Irving Holtzman and bent oh you're giving me this name

[22:35] shwokowski okay Irving Holtzman and Ben Schwikowski were two principles of the New York state

[22:40] association representing the coin op industry they did government lobbying for tax situation court

[22:47] cases about people upset over a coin op in their neighborhood so this is where this thing in the

[22:54] 1970s that happened with Roger Sharp in a courtroom starts to kind of bubble up there's a lobbying

[23:02] association right like the chamber of commerce for like the coin op industry basically in New York

[23:09] state well interesting Irving invented not work for pinball companies they weren't employees

[23:14] of pinball companies they were working for this association and they represented all kinds of

[23:19] coin op this would be you know jukeboxes you know gambling machines pinball machines video all of it

[23:26] not just pinball so in 1972 they mounted a campaign with best with best myerson who is the

[23:34] commissioner of consumer affairs in New York city she was a proponent of ending the restrictions

[23:40] and getting pinball off the black market legalizing the operation of pinball machines in New York City

[23:47] now that's the thing right when it comes to flat bands on things is that it doesn't get rid of

[23:53] the problem right look at prohibition you know alcohol did not disappear uh you know the the

[23:59] making marijuana illegal it doesn't make it disappear it just pushes it to the black market and she

[24:05] wanted to get it off that black market in New York City and the way to do that is to legalize it

[24:10] and regulate it we can also mention that pinball was legal in most places it was even legal in upstate

[24:17] New York but it was not legal in New York City I don't think it was switch cargo wasn't legal basically

[24:22] a lot of big cities it was not legal yeah because it was the part of the city underbelly degenerates

[24:29] only degenerates do that yeah well we talked about how for some reason in all the biographies of our

[24:35] pinball designing you know episodes of pinball designers their experience with pinball was when

[24:43] they were on vacation at some random out of state or out of city uh you know vacation location

[24:51] they didn't you know stumble upon it at the local strutball or Roger's case Wisconsin in the

[24:57] hearing room there's this whole thing everybody knows the story in the hearing room uh wait man

[25:01] how about in case they don't know the story all right give me that give me the give me the

[25:06] coals notes here my friend the coals notes you don't have the coals notes in the states basically

[25:10] Roger came in as a consultant to demonstrate that pinball is indeed a skill based game and not a

[25:16] gambling device what's the difference between skill based and chance based just what it says you

[25:22] need skill to actually do well at it it's not just completely random yeah you have to look at

[25:28] things and aim things and make a decision you can control the situation where in a random or a

[25:36] chance is it's sort of like every one in x amount of time something will happen now in the so he's

[25:42] been asked to come into a hearing room in New York City to display that you can actually play pinball

[25:49] as a game of skill because Roger's a pretty good player he's been playing for quite a few years

[25:54] and he has his own machine at home now this was not him coming in to you know argue with the team

[26:01] or he's he literally just came in with his satchel and his mustache to play a game of elderado

[26:09] Roger says it's a matter of being in the right place at the right time I had done or at least worked

[26:15] on the pinball book I've gotten some of familiar with many of the people in the industry I had done

[26:20] an article at gq and also done a piece in the New York Times from that the New York State Association

[26:27] reached out in contact to me to see if I would be involved or would like to get involved to help

[26:31] them legalize pinball and throw out the restrictions that have been in place at that point for 35 years

[26:38] I don't think that it was something where pinball was going to either live or die the business

[26:42] back in the mid 70s was going along nicely and didn't really need New York City but I think

[26:47] that effectively they were on this quest to try to open it up for local operators local distribution

[26:53] and it would obviously benefit everybody and I just want to say in that quote he didn't say New York

[26:58] City he said New York so even Roger as far as he's concerned that's the only New York so like

[27:03] here's the thing okay the the narrative and it's not a narrative that Roger Sharp has has promoted

[27:10] even though I joked in my intro about his propaganda the little known fact was that Roger was involved

[27:17] in Chicago Ohio Virginia and California cases as well after this to also legalize pinball

[27:26] and that was in about 1976 so slightly after this now pinball was already in a boom in the 1970s

[27:35] Roger talks about that so he's not like it's not like without Roger in a courtroom in the 1970s

[27:43] doing a thing that pinball would not exist today even though that is sort of the narrative in which

[27:49] pinball has has has promoted not Roger Rogers very clear about that in his top cast episode

[27:56] the pinball was going along pretty good without him it's just he just happened to be there and he

[27:59] just happened to do this thing with his mustache and the satchel but after this did pinball boom

[28:05] again did the legalization and opening up of a massive market benefit sales story everyone that's

[28:13] the story the story is you're supposed to play Al Dorado and one of the people on the committee

[28:19] was kind of a hardass and it's like no no no no this one's probably this is Rick play the other one

[28:25] the bank shot which was the backup game it's like okay so they brought that over and he just

[28:30] played it for a while like I'm gonna shoot this I'm gonna hit this I'm gonna hit this and at some

[28:34] point in the demonstration he just did the like see this lane up here this lane is lit I'm gonna

[28:39] plunge this lane so he plunge the lane at which point one of the committee members like okay that's

[28:45] it stop don't need to see anymore and that was it that was it they were like okay yeah it is a game

[28:52] of skill and then they just get their big rubber stamp out I don't know it's big stamp they go

[28:57] click and they're like there you go so I mean like yes he did help in the legalization of pinball

[29:04] but it's not the only reason for it it wasn't the you know he's not like without him it's not like

[29:09] their industry does not exist but I mean credit where credits do Roger is a huge huge legend in

[29:16] the industry and without him and this story there would be a different pinball industry but

[29:23] I mean come on he did a thing in in a courtroom in the 1970s and it was great it was pretty awesome

[29:30] we'll get into the other stuff later about that this also brings us into the next boom period

[29:37] so as it became legalized in places like New York City and Chicago and you know those big big

[29:43] big cities in the United States pinball goes through a massive expansion with solid state pinball

[29:49] right this is when we're getting into games like eight ball we're getting into games like ballies

[29:54] playboy things are gonna take off on a rocket ship around this time Roger would meet a person

[30:02] who would become a lifelong friend Steve Epstein who was Steve Epstein run he was the owner operator

[30:09] of the famous Broadway arcade in New York City for 35 years Broadway arcade had a reputation for

[30:15] getting all or most of the new pinball games and as soon as they were released they would show up

[30:23] at the Broadway arcade driving a lot of individuals to come and play he also had really hard to find

[30:31] games later on in that 35 year tenure such as Big Bang Bar in fact Roger and Ellen had their wedding

[30:40] reception at the Broadway arcade in 1978 also Lou Reed from the Velvet Underground had his wedding

[30:49] reception there I played his custom game walk on the wild side isn't that cool okay I made that

[30:56] last part but yes I wonder if he would ask like can I have my own could there be a Lou Reed pinball

[31:03] machine he would have been better off like like can we have an upviled at underground pinball machine I

[31:09] think it would be nice if we had a kiss oh kiss why he's not kiss I think Jean Simmons did hang out

[31:16] the Broadway arcade at least once yep celebrities went there and stuff yeah it was a big deal now Steve

[31:22] Epstein was more than just the Broadway arcade both him and Roger would come together really toy

[31:28] with the idea of competitive pinball play Roger and Steve thought about bowling leagues which were

[31:36] really big in the 1970s and that would be a good thing to replicate for pinball they needed to come

[31:43] up with a scoring mechanism competition with draws to you know bring in that interest of pinball

[31:51] and create a sense of community but most importantly it would build repeat business at the Broadway

[31:58] arcade and arcades across the country the idea is if you can get more people involved in leagues

[32:06] you can get more people playing in competition the more they will come back and grow pinball

[32:13] it's sort of like a distributor promoting pinball not necessarily to sell pinball but to grow it

[32:20] and thus sell more pinball hmm I mean as you mentioned Steve owned the Broadway arcade and more

[32:26] repeat business is a good thing so what was this the beginning of it was the beginning of the

[32:32] professional and amateur pinball association better known as papa I mean it took plenty of time

[32:38] to work on the scoring the ranking system but this was kind of a fun thing for Steven Roger they

[32:44] really legitimately enjoyed this now we come down to the real question who's the better player

[32:53] Steve a Roger well Roger says Steve Epstein or myself I used to say that Steve gets more of the

[32:59] highs but not on a more consistent basis I'm the better more consistent player late in the 1970s

[33:07] 1978 in fact super shooter super shooter we need something like this yeah Roger he helped oversee

[33:16] the super shooter and its final tournament in Chicago over 60,000 people entered the Aladdin's

[33:25] castle tournament series all over the US with 20 people reaching the finals I think they wasn't

[33:34] the one I think the prize was a car so this was in the top cast episode where Roger spoke about

[33:40] this he didn't talk too many specifics like a car in the 1970s was a big deal right like what's a

[33:46] car for the major you know the major networks not like you know ESPN Ocho or whatever yeah like it

[33:53] was legitimately a big deal it was on live news Roger says it was on live news I mean ABC CBS NBC

[34:01] had all the major network for covering the pinball spectacle it was astounding

[34:06] Ken Ludzford won beating out Joe Burley in a decision that Roger didn't quite agree with well

[34:14] he didn't like the scoring right yeah I guess it's not that he didn't like the he didn't it's not

[34:19] like he didn't like the decision but it's just the scoring structure of the event he didn't really

[34:24] like and this issue was something that influenced Papa and the international flipper pinball

[34:29] association which should speak about later rankings in the future yeah basically Ken one he got

[34:34] 5x on 8 ball and it just there was the other player there were other players that were far more

[34:40] consistent throughout the tournament but he had like the one big game at the right time and one

[34:46] yeah Roger didn't think that was it didn't the format didn't really incentivize consistent play

[34:55] which is a big thing in current Papa rankings and tournaments right well it's Papa's Papa's scoring

[35:02] it's three game series with a certain scoring system because it's and it's looking for consistency

[35:08] so yeah you can't just blow up one game slaughter everyone and you win no it's it's it's you

[35:14] have to be more consistent what we're dealing with today when it comes to the IFPA the International

[35:20] Flipper pinball association and Papa style scoring can draw a direct link back to this one huge

[35:28] tournament run by Roger and Steve back in 1978 how cool is that and one big ball of eight ball

[35:37] which is a great game by the way I love eight ball Roger of course being very well respected in the

[35:43] pinball industry from the manufacturers and those he's built relationships with and the thing that

[35:48] he did in the courtroom one time you know he didn't he didn't look like everybody else in pinball

[35:55] so his opinions were usually highly regarded amongst those in the industry people like Kenny

[36:02] Anderson most Kenny Anderson well Roger who's Kenny Anderson Roger says I was at a New York state

[36:08] trade we said New York State so that means it's not New York City this time he put the state at

[36:14] the end to make you know that's not New York City otherwise he would have just said New York maybe

[36:17] it was in New York City but it was not New York State but Roger says I was at a New York state trade

[36:23] show and counter Kenny Anderson with game plan I know Ken from his days at Chicago coin you took me

[36:30] over to look at a cocktail table pinball machine that this company I'd never heard of was doing

[36:36] real cigarettes was the brand on it and he asked me what I thought and I was like oh my god you can't

[36:41] do cigarettes and there's a lot of stigma attached to it and the next one that they're doing was

[36:46] going to be black velvet based on alcohol then I said those are like two things you can't do

[36:52] cigarettes and alcohol cigarettes and alcohol so it's like it's you know pinball in the late 70s

[36:59] is having this coming out party yeah it's legalized it's like mainstream and you want to make a

[37:05] cigarette in a in a booze forget booze game like no it's like American pinball coming out and

[37:13] doing hookers and blow not really the greatest of themes so Roger and Lee Galbos who was the

[37:21] president of game plan along with Ken went to dinner AES technology was a government tech

[37:28] contractor and Lee with his partner Mike ab abrams Mike abrams saw a new market to enter and they

[37:36] spoke about the rise of video games like Pac-Man and manufacturing pinball and arcades

[37:42] Roger says my travels and having been around all of the secret back rooms of design and development

[37:48] and having had the opportunity to play every game up to that point from the previous 20 years

[37:54] meant I had a pretty good sense of the types of games that I enjoy personally so even then

[37:58] Rogers getting to play all these games before they even come out that's so cool that's got to be

[38:03] like that's the ultimate sharp perk I guess you could say wish this passed down generations we

[38:10] get to play this up before you do that that's right now now game plan approach Roger because they

[38:16] needed designers just like today they're looking to tournament pinball because they needed designers

[38:25] Roger says when do MacAdams is there he came over from Chicago coin but they did not have any

[38:31] hardcore designers I took out a little piece of paper and I did some circles and squares and I

[38:35] held it up to Lee and explain what my drawing was I said that it would be too expensive he called

[38:40] Wendell and he comes in and I gave it to him and I gave it to him they asked me dead looking

[38:45] of the straight in the face and said would it be successful I said if I knew anything about pinball

[38:50] yes wow confident wow confident in his game confident in his game just just just a pit just a pen

[38:59] and a piece of paper napkin and what game would that be that was sharpshooter the cowboy and must

[39:05] dashes theme from 1979 sells 4200 units so actually it was a pretty decent seller for a newer

[39:16] company yeah and anything that's sell that much today would be a hit yeah Roger sharp on design

[39:22] with Joe juice junior and Ed Sabula mechanics by Joe juice junior or Joe Joe's I never know how to

[39:30] say his name could someone please write us at what what's our email address silver ball chronicles

[39:35] at gmail dot com and tell us if it's Joe Joe's or Joe juice or or another pronunciation I've heard

[39:41] it multiple ways and art by George Molinton Roger was flying back and forth from New York City to

[39:47] Chicago while working on this project do you remember back in the day Ron when you could just

[39:52] commute between two major cities to design a pinball machine and it was probably way cheaper my goodness

[40:00] it must have been really cheap to fly in the pre 911 era and not inconvenient we've spoke about

[40:09] Joe before right Joe juice Joe Joe's I'll say Joe Joe's you could say Joe juice one of us will be right

[40:14] but Roger says Joe Joe's was a very instrumental in making everything happen my top right portion

[40:20] of the play field didn't fit now the spinner was overlapping with the kick out hole in the lane

[40:25] and so on Joe excuses himself comes back and altered where I'd had to spin originally and I said well

[40:31] that's great I love it Joe and I became very very close he was an incredibly talented and gifted

[40:37] person very hard working he's also no longer with us he did some marvelous games Joe did do some

[40:43] marvelous games he was big with stern right back in the genetics quick silver dragon fist

[40:51] then he went to Williams and did mostly mostly like engineering stuff he's the one that

[40:57] made the upper play field of black 92000 serviceable that's the thing that people don't get right is

[41:01] there's there's the designer but then there's like they if they have a really good relationship with

[41:08] their mechanical engineer with their mechanical engineer that's what takes the game to the next

[41:14] level right is that it's easy it's serviceable it works it's fun say what you want about black 92000

[41:22] but that is the easily serviceable upper play field I have ever worked on but this game also has

[41:27] really cool art package by by George molten mullington and he had been doing coin op art really

[41:34] since the 1930s and his first machine was a game called gold rush by rock hola which was a

[41:41] flipperless payout game that's how long he had been around and we're talking like late 1970s now

[41:46] hmm one of those old timey pinball games could you imagine he primarily drew for Williams after

[41:53] World War II from 1947 to 1967 he also did a couple of ballet and united art packages too so he was

[42:00] he was roped in to do in sharpshooter the cowboy and mustache theme and he also did another space

[42:08] themed game from game plan called supernova so like when we look at this at this pin right over on

[42:17] IPDB it's kind of got a unique flavor to it right it's it's they're trying to do this very world

[42:25] under glass thing right of like a cluster yeah and it's and it's like in a desert right like that

[42:32] Texas kind of theme right those old western movies from the 70s so if you made your own game

[42:40] would you put yourself in the back glass it would it be like in a hockey outfit

[42:47] it would it would I'd be missing a tooth for no apparent reason but George he thought it would be

[42:54] great to put Roger in the back glass so in the middle Roger is the sharpshooter and he's

[43:02] the sheriff he's got the star right on there he's got to be the sheriff you can tell his Roger

[43:06] because of the mustache yep which really does fit with the western and remember take it takes aim

[43:12] with a winner it's great okay here we go game plan we got to see I just love the fire let's take

[43:17] a look at this fire people love when we say the flyer stuff game plan shoot you into profits with a

[43:23] wild west winner I like that a wild west winner like the the W's sharpshooter sharpshooter's

[43:32] unique full action memory holds over sharp lanes they're called sharp kick out hole multiple value

[43:40] rollover specials extra balls lit spinner and alcohol bonus multiplier it also has an improved

[43:48] integrated accounting system sharpshooter brings an industry first for the first time in the

[43:53] electronic age comes a pinball machine with million light for high score to date it was what players

[44:02] want and the operators need to get more punch for their profit picture it's like high score right

[44:08] it's like this is just about getting your initials in we're almost there right so cool it's a

[44:13] weird design is it not it's it's all right it's it's not it's not Roger's best game I don't think

[44:19] we're getting to that on this episode so it's got like seven drop targets on the left side really

[44:26] close to the to the flippers very dangerous but those if you hit those targets it comes back into

[44:32] where the right sling would be and instead of having kind of that Italian bottom left and right

[44:36] slings it has to pop up person the right side dead die it's a mean game right have you played it

[44:45] I have I play what happened I play yeah that's true I play lock this monster which was game plan

[44:51] and there's only one of those this is a this is tough this is one of the more popular this is one

[44:56] of the bigger production games game plan ever had so did you do see these yeah if you're seeing a

[45:01] game plan game probably this one yeah yeah it's it's cool it looks effective it looks fun it's

[45:10] got lots going on in the playfield but this is kind of in that era where we still haven't quite

[45:14] figured out flow so balls moving around returning to the flipper we're still in a very like catch the

[45:21] ball set your shot shoot the ball control the pre-st the pre-steef Richie era like flow doesn't exist

[45:29] we're still in what is it what is it catch and hold or unless you played any old stern games

[45:34] that have tons of flow we just haven't figured it out like some people are like what it'd be good

[45:41] if we put two pop umpers where sling would be and then they do it and they're like ah that's

[45:45] okay but it's not really that great so then they're like well we'll never do that again so then

[45:49] they move on to something else but they're still experimenting and I'd say they're doing really

[45:53] really well but I like the artwork though because they just put all the employees in it I mean like

[45:58] George's style was very realistic and it often had women and showgirls and swimmers ballroom

[46:04] dancers sort of like this level of elegance and charm it wasn't sleazy you know what I mean it

[46:10] wasn't like sleazy art it was respectful and proper for like a 1950s gentleman you know what I

[46:17] mean it was really really nice well about the art Roger says I drove George crazy for the artwork

[46:22] because I said I told him I did not want the Dracula artwork you did for Harry Williams game

[46:27] that's turn it done it had a lot of purples and things I wanted it to be as realistic as it

[46:31] possibly could be in fact if I'd had my way it would have been black and white because this is my

[46:37] odor homage to high noon which was a movie for those who don't know and I wanted it to be one

[46:43] piece of artwork there's just been the showdown I've shot the guy falling and that's why the plastics

[46:47] on the play field of horses reared up are all looking back up that was a daunting challenge for

[46:52] George to try to bring to life but having said that that was the process if you look at that playfield

[46:58] right you've got so he actually shot someone yeah yeah not actually shot someone he adjusts oh yeah

[47:04] I guess the smoke is coming out of the guy I never even thought about that like you just shot somebody

[47:09] so if you're looking at this on the back glass there's two ladies down like oh oh Roger what have

[47:15] you done and he has shot some well they're probably like thank you you killed the bad guy because you

[47:21] because you're the sheriff you're not a corrupt sheriff you're the actual good sheriff if you then

[47:26] scroll down the play field so it's all one picture you scroll down the play field you see the person

[47:33] he shot on the play field kind of reeling back and then there's the other people standing around

[47:40] watching on the plastics and stuff the idea is it's all kind of one piece of art it's not a

[47:47] back glass which is totally separate from the play field it you're supposed to look at it as one

[47:52] piece which I think is pretty cool I never realize that of course I would have I would have done it

[47:58] like the anti hero I would have had the bad guy he's turned around because he actually got shot

[48:03] in the back and his gun is still lost your terrible first so you had alluded to the Easter eggs in

[48:10] this game I guess the lady on the right side of Rogers Ellen Rogers wife and the lady on his left

[48:16] leg wait a minute it's left that would be his right leg okay which side is it I don't know okay let's

[48:22] try it this way the lady on one side of Rogers Ellen his wife and on his other side was the then

[48:30] wife of game plan legal boss her name was Maryland yes but she was the wife of the game plan legal

[48:35] boss whoever that was Lee is the gentleman on the right side with the shotgun his daughter is the

[48:41] blonde girl in front of him with their cat like Abrams the VP and partner of game plan is sitting

[48:46] on the stool with his legs up and Z's cafe is an ode to Steve Epstein who had a nickname of Zelmo

[48:52] lots of little fun bits in there so you know people talk about like zombie Yeti putting in you know

[48:58] interesting Easter eggs or Gary Stern floating around in a tube in an inner tube in the jaws game

[49:07] like those kind of fun Easter eggs Chris Franchey awesome for doing those as well that's been that's

[49:13] just been a thing that pinball has done for years the game went over I would say pretty well Roger

[49:19] gave game plan three or four other designs to start on game plan wanted to do more of just a mirror

[49:27] image of sharpshooter because it was one of their best sellers or the best seller they said let's

[49:31] just do the same thing but flip it around a little bit because it would keep the cost down well we're

[49:36] gonna roll into the 1980s do you remember the 1980s I do I don't quite remember the 1980s because

[49:42] you weren't alive yet well I was but I you know I I wasn't really there for very long I remember hair

[49:52] spandex remember macho man I mean of course yeah that kind of stuff but that's not much I don't

[49:59] remember much of the 1980s anyway in the 1980s Roger served as an editor for video games magazines

[50:06] spending his time playing pinball and attending various industry events and trade shows so he's

[50:12] working arms length from pinball he hasn't dove into designing he hasn't dove into marketing

[50:18] within a company he's not working for Williams or Valley he's writing for video games magazine

[50:23] which is very much like a I don't know like a PC gamer of its time maybe Nintendo power I mean it's

[50:30] not those names but it's kind of the same thing were you a subscriber to video games magazine I

[50:36] would have been too young I think magazines I don't know if people get this magazines were a big

[50:40] thing and like the 80s and 90s big business I got Nintendo power I have them somewhere that's

[50:46] super cool but that's like a you know like pro wrestling illustrated or or Porsche magazine

[50:53] or you know those kind of things oh shout out to my secret Santa in the Pinside Secret Santa

[51:00] thing by the way he sent me a 75 years of Porsche book like coffee table book wow that is a way

[51:08] above and beyond sir thank you so much but magazines were a big deal in the late 1980s Roger and

[51:15] Steve worked with AMOA which stood for amusement and music operators association to build a competitive

[51:24] pinball model because with their experience previously with papa they really wanted to draw more

[51:31] coin drop they wanted to build a bigger community for operators so AMOA reached out to Roger and

[51:39] who had experience and this would become the International Flipper pinball association or iFPA

[51:46] which is what basically everybody in competitive pinball plays in today it wasn't until 1991 that

[51:51] papa held their first world championship which I believe was a New York City Roger spent some of his

[51:58] time getting to know Mike Stroll who was the president of Williams in the 1980s you'll know all about

[52:06] Mike Stroll from some of our episodes about yeah I remember him yeah about 1980s Williams

[52:12] things so we're talking about flash firepower black night just named insert Steve Richie a big hit

[52:20] game of early 80s here right so he he's a subject in a Steve Richie episodes he's a subject in

[52:26] Barry Oussler saves pinball you know Mike Stroll was a big deal in the 1980s because that's when

[52:31] we were going through a pretty rough time and then a massive sort of upswing in the late he hired

[52:36] the right people to roll that back to September of 1981 let's talk about bear a cora this is the

[52:44] sci-fi theme fish name speaking speaking of of of Barry Oussler this game was a Williams system seven

[52:54] board set game 2,350 units which is a far cry from like what do you done at game plan and for that

[53:04] matter yeah game plan a much smaller company and they sell 4,000 units of sharp shooter yeah it's a

[53:10] standard body pin it's designed by Roger star sharp and Steve Epstein and this is sort of actually

[53:17] designed by Barry Oussler art by Doug Watson and sound and software by Ed Sikos Sikoski Sikoski

[53:27] another Doug Watson copy job yeah yeah yeah there's there's I can't remember what it was but there

[53:35] is a picture basically that this is kind of ripped off of kind of like was it the quick silver

[53:42] which was ripped off from a heavy metal magazine exactly poor dog was not above you know

[53:49] copying some material so the artist you know Geeger who was very much the the the influence for alien

[53:58] or the design of of the film alien what the alien looked like in the film alien the bear a cora

[54:07] is very much a lift a homage of one of the artist Geiger's things so you know again you had

[54:16] mentioned tend to get his inspiration or Doug rather tend to get his inspiration kind of from

[54:22] from other until that to him to his face though he's pretty big guy and he works out

[54:26] it big freaking arms I remember that to show like whoa I better not mess with that guy it's like

[54:31] so the original theme for this game was Las Vegas and it was totally themed around a roulette

[54:39] wheel inside the pinball machine and probably out probably on the center I would assume and this

[54:44] is not what happened you know Roger says I think there was a prevailing attitude that people didn't

[54:50] like Vegas as a theme they like the idea of gambling or what have you see virtue called it lost

[54:55] bogus so he kind of cut shut it into a corner no one paid a lot of attention to it it was a

[55:01] totally different experience in a game plan I was the only game in town for them so so Roger was

[55:06] like people were like a game plan were like oh Roger like he's the man that did a thing in

[55:11] the 1970s and in a corner they also didn't have designers but Williams has designers so

[55:17] and they got Steve Richie who is at this time in the late in the early 80s like a god and he's

[55:23] doing Steve Richie things calling the other game crap lost bogus right it's competitive that is

[55:30] so Steve Richie so they kind of toss it off into the corner but according to Roger Sharp who was

[55:35] on an episode of pinball profile with Jeff T. Oless I've included that in the show notes the original

[55:44] Las Vegas roulette wheel under the play field that became too complicated it probably wasn't going

[55:49] to work it might not have been that way it was a bit gimmicky Roger and Steve designed the rules

[55:56] and then they passed that off to Williams now that's where I want to really tie it in was the rules

[56:02] that is kind of what sets Barra Kora out amongst a lot of the games in this era tends to be a

[56:07] term in tournament darling right yeah yeah you see it a lot of terms yeah the layout was not as good

[56:14] as they wanted and Barry Ausler was the fellow that the Williams higher ups asked to help them out

[56:22] they would return a few months later they being Steve and Roger to a game with their basic

[56:28] play field but everything was completely different gone was the roulette wheel gone was Las Vegas

[56:34] there were a couple of tweaks here and there but it was it was a different it was a different

[56:36] Las Vegas was still there as in all the chopped targets but now it's spelled Barra Kora with two

[56:41] ours for one of the targets so they would fit of course why wouldn't it according to Barry there

[56:48] were a lot of changes in the early design that Stephen Roger had put together we spoke about this

[56:53] in detail and Barry Ausler saves pinball a previous podcast to go back and listen to that in the archives

[56:59] but what did Roger think Roger said it did work out although again when I saw the artwork for the

[57:04] first time walking into the factory and Steve Cordack took me down to the middle of the production line

[57:09] what is this game I'm looking at from a distance the striking face on it a fish coming out of

[57:14] her head like what the hell I died how do you even pronounce that I think my biggest regret was

[57:20] Mike Stroll not listening to me and Steve Richie was making black night the company's focus

[57:25] has shifted yeah we're we're getting into a situation here right where Steve Richie comes in

[57:30] he's like this is crap and the leader Mike Stroll is like okay we'll like do it you can this is kind

[57:37] of dumb I don't know it turned out okay it's weird but a lot of games were weird at that time right

[57:42] it's fine it's got lots of drop targets but it's the rules it's it's that whole like upper

[57:48] the lane-changing word has double lane change that's crazy talk it's neat once you get used to it

[57:55] and the Roger says Barra Corra had a chance to do multi lane change so that could take three lanes

[58:00] and have them function to six with double lighting up on top and I also gave players the opportunity

[58:06] to play for either three ball or two ball multi ball so I mean there were these little touches

[58:12] which were the rudimentary beginnings of where things were with solid state yeah people are

[58:18] starting to bend their minds a little more kind of in the 80s we've have an evolution of pinball

[58:25] we've added you know multi ball we've added sort of sound and record key the other thing that

[58:31] helped is well hurt thus helped was they were going to starting getting crushed by video games so

[58:38] they cut back on the budgets so what can we do to make the games interesting that doesn't require

[58:44] putting more stuff in them yeah like physical things right they make the rules a little more

[58:50] interesting so a lot of these these early 80s games have a lot of that yeah you got a lot of

[58:55] pro you playing this you're paying this programmer what's what's them putting in another 10 20 30 40

[59:01] hours right to make things a little more complex and and I think that that's pretty cool because it's

[59:06] made them kind of bend their head a little bit as to how I can improve things without adding another

[59:11] expensive drop target Mac but speaking of drop target Mac this is where Roger gets back into game

[59:18] with sharpshooter 2 the return cowboy and mustache this theme again exactly it's a big theme mustache

[59:26] it did not sell 4,000 units like the other one did it did not November of 83 it sells 600 units

[59:36] yikes designed by Roger Sharpen Wendell McCatum art by Larry Day who I think is really underrated

[59:43] with his pinball art and Bruce Schiferns for Schifernick that sounds good I thought that was pretty good

[59:51] I only screwed it up kind of halfway through and then I corrected software by Raymond merchant

[59:55] or Raymond merchant artist Larry Day told IPDB that while he does not remember the specifics of this

[01:00:02] machine the signatures indicate that both he and Bruce Schifernick collaborated on the game working

[01:00:09] with Gordon Morrison from advertising posters in Chicago which was a outsourcing artist he literally

[01:00:17] doesn't remember doing the game even though he didn't doesn't remember Larry said he can tell by

[01:00:20] the way sign his name in a circle that this game was early in his arcade art career as that was how

[01:00:26] he signed himself in the early days so it doesn't even know it's like oh yeah I guess I did that

[01:00:31] so the backlash it's really good Roger and Ellen are both sharpshooters together they're both

[01:00:38] kind of hanging out back to back shoulder to shoulder two guns Roger looks more like Tom

[01:00:43] Selik now than he did before it the art style has significantly changed from the previous one

[01:00:48] which I thought was pretty good but you could tell it was an artist who had been around forever

[01:00:52] and had his style of art this is really cool and and the hair God I wish I had hair like that

[01:01:02] fantastic what about the play field itself huh two pop bumpers instead of a sling was a

[01:01:08] good idea right it looks pretty much the same as the first one wait a second this is exactly the same

[01:01:14] okay two pop bumpers down by this thing it's got how many drop targets there seven drop targets on

[01:01:18] the left side looks like the same game it's it's the same game what are they doing here oh let's take

[01:01:23] a look at the flyer maybe it'll give us it'll give us oh it does the first line the return of a classic

[01:01:32] like all of the other manufacturers at this time they're going to their back catalog exciting sounds

[01:01:40] lightning fast play challenging play field magnificent graphics offering the captivating sounds of

[01:01:47] horse hooves distant Tom Tom's rifle shots gunfire bullet ricochet dynamite explosion coyotes

[01:01:57] okay rattle snakes chuck wagon bell wow I love chuck wagon bells god that is one of my favorite

[01:02:07] captivating sounds so you like those what was that a dog food commercial then at the chuck wagon

[01:02:12] it was chuck wagon wasn't it love it just love it just love it so they're they're going to the back

[01:02:19] catalog because they can they know the cost they have the parts they're trying to just get it out

[01:02:25] the door different art package that seems fine I guess that is I would say a solid game it's

[01:02:33] probably is it better than the original sharpshooter uh I don't know I know I've played it before but

[01:02:40] I don't remember if it was any better because most likely I played it at a show where I couldn't

[01:02:45] hear any of those wonderful new sound effects they were talking about like the chuck wagon bell oh

[01:02:51] yeah the chuck wagon bell that's just so it's so exciting run so exciting coyotes wonder if it has

[01:02:57] crickets does it crickets uh that's that's a patented thing for frontier that's a frontier thing yeah

[01:03:04] that is Rogers entire career no it's not yes it is that's it it's not are you sure I'm sure okay

[01:03:12] well I guess we'll probably have to do another Roger sharp episode this has been the token Roger

[01:03:17] sharp episode I'm so glad that we didn't spend all of our time talking about that thing that he

[01:03:22] did in a courtroom in the 1970s because there's so much more to Rogers career than that Roger is on

[01:03:28] the Mount Rushmore of pinball along with like Harry Williams and Gary Stern and probably George Gomez

[01:03:38] because not of what he did in that courtroom that day in the 1970s but because of all of the

[01:03:45] other things that he did and all of the things that he will do in our next Roger sharp episode so

[01:03:51] he's saying it's the courtroom thing it's actually a bad thing it just takes away from all the other

[01:03:54] stuff he did now I see where you're going do you see I'm not crappin on Roger I think Rogers great

[01:04:01] it's it's just he's done more and people don't care did you know Roger had a movie about him

[01:06:27] very good very good I think that'll be good now so what I've done is I've tried to shorten the

[01:06:30] episodes a little bit yeah I see that not a lot that was three thousand words instead of like

[01:06:34] 55 or 5,000 so it might be a little easier on me on editing as well as as um just listening in general

[01:06:42] if this was a true Roger sharp episode though it should be like four hours long
