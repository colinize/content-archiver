[00:00] The Pinball Network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:14] I miss Clippy.

[00:15] Clippy wouldn't have been there.

[00:17] Oh God, you know, I hate little characters like that, but in the case of him, it was

[00:22] like, yeah, okay, little, yeah, little paperclip.

[00:25] Name Clippy.

[00:30] Hello, everyone.

[00:55] I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:58] With me this month is my co-host.

[01:01] Ron, I picked up a new game, Hallet.

[01:04] Ron, what's up, Bella?

[01:06] This month.

[01:07] Does that denote like other months you're going to have other co-hosts?

[01:09] How do I not know this?

[01:11] You are on thin ice, my friend.

[01:13] Oh my.

[01:14] So I just want to make sure that you're aware that at any time you could be wiped out of

[01:17] this.

[01:18] Anytime I don't know something, I'm fired.

[01:21] Exactly.

[01:22] Exactly.

[01:23] Exactly.

[01:24] So I'm going to have a new game.

[01:25] Yes, I did.

[01:26] You care to share?

[01:27] It's not done by our subject of today's episode, but it is a Williams game from the era

[01:34] that he worked there.

[01:35] Oh.

[01:36] And that would be attacked from Mars.

[01:37] Wow.

[01:38] An original, of course, because you know I couldn't possibly get a remake.

[01:42] I'm surprised that you didn't already have one.

[01:46] That's sort of a top tier kind of Balli Williams and that's kind of your bag, baby.

[01:50] Well, it's been on my list for 15 years, but it's just never presented itself.

[01:55] That game seems to be right at my alley, but anytime I've played it, I've always been like,

[01:59] I felt like, I don't know, it didn't get its claws in me.

[02:02] Medieval madness gets its claws in me, not so much attack from Mars.

[02:07] And I don't know if it's because maybe I haven't had enough time on it or it doesn't have

[02:10] as much like in your face sort of flash as medieval madness.

[02:14] But I know saying that will make some people freak out because they are diehard attack from

[02:19] Mars well over medieval madness.

[02:21] Sounds like you need way more lights in that game.

[02:23] Yeah, maybe way brighter lights, which brings us to today's subject, although he hasn't

[02:30] good.

[02:31] He hasn't got to that point yet, though.

[02:33] It's Twippy season, right?

[02:35] We didn't make it on the list this year and I'm going to take full responsibility for

[02:42] the fact that both silver ball chronicles and slam tilt didn't make it on the drop-down

[02:46] list on the Twippy's this year because we split the vote.

[02:50] Everybody who loves Ron either voted for one or the other and that split the vote costing

[02:54] either us or slam tilt the drop-down list this year.

[02:59] But that's how it goes when you are as outstanding as Ron Hallett.

[03:04] So it's my fault.

[03:05] Yes.

[03:06] That's basically what you said.

[03:07] Yeah, okay.

[03:08] Yeah, so be careful.

[03:09] Be careful.

[03:10] But if you are out there, remember, Twippy is a sponsor of silver ball chronicles.

[03:14] You're on the pinball promoter's database.

[03:17] Swing on over to this week in pinball and vote in the Twippy's.

[03:20] Also happening at this time are the pinball industry awards.

[03:24] The new award shows started by TPN of which we're a member.

[03:28] Wait a minute.

[03:29] Another award show.

[03:30] Do we need more award shows?

[03:31] Yes.

[03:32] We need as many award shows as we can get and we need more shows called the pinball show

[03:37] if we can get as many of those as possible.

[03:40] Other than that, things are pretty good.

[03:42] So we're really excited about all of the happening in the industry.

[03:47] We had a good 2020 considering the world the way it was.

[03:52] In 2021, I think it's going to be pretty great.

[03:53] When I look forward of all the things that are coming, I think it's going to be pretty

[03:56] cool.

[03:57] You've got a lot of new games coming out.

[03:58] You've got a refreshed American pinball.

[04:02] It's going to be pretty exciting in 2021.

[04:04] I hope Godzilla is coming out.

[04:05] That's what I'm looking forward to.

[04:07] Yeah.

[04:08] So remember to check out our Facebook page, facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[04:12] That way you can gauge with us, chit chat and leave some comments and posts.

[04:16] Well, I have a question.

[04:18] I have a question.

[04:19] Do we have our own site?

[04:20] Yes.

[04:21] We just launched our own website.

[04:23] It's amazing.

[04:24] I just popped in my head.

[04:26] Yeah.

[04:27] Silverball Chronicles.com.

[04:29] Swing on over there.

[04:31] That's your sort of one stop shop.

[04:34] We wanted to make sure that all of the banter and shenanigans that we're doing here

[04:39] doesn't disappear from the internet.

[04:41] And the best way to do that is to start one of these web pages.

[04:46] And it's been a while since I built a web page, but I went looking for geo cities, which

[04:51] doesn't exist anymore.

[04:53] So I had to use WordPress.

[04:55] So we built a little website there.

[04:57] It's nothing too fancy.

[04:59] No shenanigans, but if you're looking to engage with us, there's a couple of bits and

[05:05] pieces there.

[05:06] As always, be sure to check out this week in Pinball promoter's database.

[05:11] That's where you can leave us a review.

[05:13] You can also check out some of the other podcasts, Twitch streams, and YouTube channels, all

[05:16] Pinball oriented.

[05:17] Please swing by there.

[05:19] Leave us a five star review.

[05:20] If you leave us less than five stars, you're dead to me.

[05:23] Hmm.

[05:24] I looks like we got some reviews.

[05:26] Yeah.

[05:27] I've pulled a couple of them in here from a couple of different sources.

[05:29] All right.

[05:30] We got Scott S.

[05:31] Says, maybe just maybe my favorite.

[05:34] A detailed fun walk through the history of Pinball.

[05:37] You get the benefits of Ron with none of the bruisisms of that other podcast.

[05:41] Keep up the good work.

[05:42] Oh, wow.

[05:44] The bruisisms, I think, are the draw.

[05:46] That and your amazing special guests on Slamtilt podcast.

[05:50] Hmm.

[05:51] Then we have Gonzo 73 from PinSide Says.

[05:54] Silverball Chronicles is just an amazing show.

[05:57] Thanks for doing such a well-researched fun show.

[06:00] I could have listened for two more hours.

[06:02] Bring on the next episode.

[06:04] Nobody's going to listen to a podcast over an hour.

[06:06] Yeah, we were thinking the same thing.

[06:07] We should hook them up with that other guy.

[06:09] Well, we've added two new shirt designs to our shirts over at silverballswag.com.

[06:16] Slash, silverball Chronicles.

[06:18] I had them switched this time to put you first.

[06:22] Yeah.

[06:23] In your renegotiated contract for 2021, we had to make sure that there were some changes

[06:29] in there.

[06:30] One of them was that your name had to come first on the next round of shirts.

[06:34] These shirts are a little more sort of classic shirts.

[06:37] They're less fancy graphics.

[06:39] So go ahead and take a look at those over at silverballswag.com.

[06:43] Very nice try the tri blend because that is a quality shirt.

[06:48] Also if you're a Canadian fan of the podcast here and you don't want to worry about cross-border

[06:55] shipping, you don't want to worry about duty or any of that stuff.

[06:59] Judas an email at silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[07:02] I have some shirts that I printed locally that I can throw in the mail for you rather

[07:07] than through silverballswag.

[07:09] If you're in the States, you're going to want to go to silverballswag.

[07:13] That's the spot to go.

[07:14] Quality printing, quality shipping, really great.

[07:18] So you have Canadian mail.

[07:19] Does it look like a mounting deliver to your house?

[07:23] No, it's a sled dog with an old lady from Saskatchewan.

[07:28] Gotcha.

[07:29] Yeah, merge.

[07:32] We do have a couple of...

[07:33] Oh God.

[07:34] Here's our corrections.

[07:36] Yes, but before we read them, where can I send my corrections?

[07:40] You can send any of your corrections to silverball Chronicles at gmail.com or you can bring them

[07:46] up on the website over at facebook.com slash silverball Chronicles.

[07:51] And here of course are the corrections from our previous episode.

[07:57] I'm Bruce Nightingale from the slam tilt podcast.

[08:00] Oh, never heard of Bruce Nightingale.

[08:02] Ripley's believe it or not has two magnets.

[08:06] He reminds us that Sam, as an abbreviation, has never been officially explained.

[08:10] Because I honestly don't think it stands for anything.

[08:13] And that's been done a lot through time.

[08:15] They've put you put periods on things like it's supposed to mean something when it doesn't.

[08:19] I still think it's just Sam Stern is what it means.

[08:22] He says monopoly little badge was a stick on.

[08:26] What does that mean?

[08:27] What's the monopoly little badge?

[08:29] So there was a little badge on the special monopoly edition.

[08:33] Oh, okay.

[08:34] That it was stick on.

[08:35] So my assumption is it's in the coin door and if you didn't stick it on, that's why it

[08:40] wasn't underneath the translate.

[08:42] He also reminds us that NASCAR loops three times on the initial plunge.

[08:46] There.

[08:47] There.

[08:48] That's the world wanted to know that.

[08:49] That's pretty good.

[08:50] That's pretty good.

[08:51] And they were short this time.

[08:52] They weren't massive novels.

[08:54] Were they really corrections?

[08:55] I mean, Sam was just an explanation monopoly.

[08:58] Wasn't really a connect.

[09:00] I've rippled.

[09:01] I might have said it had magnets.

[09:02] So he had to curve, you know, say it has two magnets.

[09:05] Anyway, what are we talking about today?

[09:08] Today's topic.

[09:10] Pinball code has become more complex and captivating over the years.

[09:14] It is a critical part of modern pinball.

[09:17] We'd be a miss if we didn't have a podcast about one of the founders of modern pinball

[09:23] code.

[09:24] Modern complexity, Dwight Sullivan.

[09:27] Now I know some people are probably upset that we did not call this blinded by Dwight,

[09:34] but there is a trademark on that from Zach Manion.

[09:37] He wouldn't give us the rights.

[09:39] Even though we're on the same network, okay.

[09:41] I see how it is.

[09:42] Dwight is one of pinball programming's most important figures.

[09:46] Throughout the 1990s, Dwight worked on some of the best selling games of all time, adding

[09:52] a level of polish, which had not been seen before.

[09:56] He brought out a new level of fun and uniqueness that continued to influence today's modern

[10:03] programmers.

[10:04] Dwight's fresh ideas and new levels of complexity reinvigorated pinball code when it needed

[10:10] the most and the machines that he worked on benefited.

[10:15] He is one of the fathers of modern pinball code by writing some of the greatest pinball

[10:21] moments.

[10:22] There's a cliche.

[10:23] And today's podcast is about Dwight Sullivan.

[10:27] So what Ron is pinball code?

[10:31] It's the stuff that tells the game what to do as most basic form.

[10:35] Yeah, this switch has this many points and you do these five switches and it equals this.

[10:41] It's a whole massive mess of stuff.

[10:45] And it's Dwight's job to give that some guidance and some structure.

[10:50] So what was like when we talk about code, what was sort of like the early EM code like?

[10:55] EM code?

[10:56] Well, it didn't really have code.

[10:59] I guess the relays and steppers and such that told the game what to do when certain things

[11:04] occurred on the play field would be considered programming.

[11:08] I guess you could technically reprogram an EM by adding a relay, moving some wiring, etc.

[11:18] Just like the most basic of basic, right?

[11:20] When you think about, you know, you're hitting this target, you're scoring 500 points,

[11:24] you're hitting this target, you're scoring five points.

[11:27] You get it in the scoop, it counts down the bonus, really, really rudimentary.

[11:32] But in its own right, it is, I guess, quote unquote code.

[11:37] So when we moved into solid state, what was sort of that early solid state code?

[11:42] How did it change a little bit?

[11:43] Well, you didn't need relays and steppers.

[11:45] You just had a circuit board and you had actual programming, which I'm thinking most

[11:51] of the early stuff was probably in like assembly, ones and zeros.

[11:54] And I guess at that point, it also got to sort of, you could start to get a little more

[11:59] complex with all of a sudden you hit these three things and you get a blinking light and

[12:04] then you get into like a Pavlov's dog sort of situation, right?

[12:08] It's getting a little more complex.

[12:09] Then we move into sort of the 80s and then what happens to code?

[12:13] Well, you had an initial, in the 70s, you had just get the thing working with solid state

[12:19] technology, with, you know, circuit computer boards, get it, just get the thing working.

[12:24] Then you get into the early 80s and it's more like, okay, what can we do with this that

[12:28] we couldn't do with EMs?

[12:29] What cool stuff can we do with all this?

[12:31] Yeah, now we've learned it won't burn the building down.

[12:34] Now you get light shows, you get speech, you get more complicated things happening because

[12:41] you can do it.

[12:42] And then unfortunately everything crashed in the around 83 or 82, 83 or so.

[12:49] So those kind of innovations.

[12:51] Yeah, it kind of regressed in that you went from games that talk.

[12:55] Now they didn't talk anymore.

[12:56] They had a bunch of multi balls.

[12:58] Now they either don't or they've only got one.

[13:00] It wasn't until the mid 80s, you get around like high speed era that it starts to take

[13:06] off again.

[13:07] Then we get into the 90s code, which is a little bit mostly what we're talking about

[13:11] today when it comes to Dwight Sullivan, but what's like 90s code all of a sudden?

[13:16] The major innovation there is you now have the dot matrix display or DMD.

[13:21] So now you can show the player things you could never show them before.

[13:24] You can do things you could never do before like video modes.

[13:27] Yeah, super.

[13:28] Oh, not really in a video modes.

[13:31] Well then we're also getting into, if you shoot this shot a bunch of times you get a special

[13:35] multi ball.

[13:36] And if you shoot this scoop and that scoop and then you shoot this target, you get a

[13:41] super jackpot, right?

[13:42] Like things are getting a lot more calm.

[13:44] You got a, you know, if you're thinking later on in the 90s, all of a sudden you've got

[13:48] like a ringmaster that comes up at the bottom and then magnet on top and it gets really,

[13:52] really complicated and convoluted in different pathways.

[13:55] How do you think 90s code is evolved to a point today?

[14:00] So if we think about sort of the last few games that were released like Ninja Turtles by

[14:04] Dwight Sullivan or Monsters, Star Wars or Game of Thrones, like how do you think his philosophies

[14:11] from the 90s have sort of kind of permeated through into today?

[14:16] I would say Dwight is a, he is a moments programmer.

[14:21] I know they get to use a lot, but Dwight has definitely been around about moments in his

[14:26] games, especially his later games.

[14:28] But you look at something like just a super jackpot on Terminator 2.

[14:34] And then he brings it to, you have Game of Thrones.

[14:38] And it's basically, it's the same exact concept, the same kind of moment in that game and

[14:44] he reduss it for, you know, the new modern age.

[14:48] He's also Ghostbusters has the super jackpot call outs.

[14:51] If you play Star Wars, it has moments.

[14:55] Like when you were about to blow up a death star, all the lights go out, like one thing flashes,

[15:00] like gee, I think I'm supposed to hit that.

[15:02] Definitely, I would call him like a, a, a, a, moments programmer.

[15:06] There's like this extra level of sort of polish or story, right?

[15:10] It's it, the code itself, beyond the intellectual property story itself tells the story, which

[15:18] is pretty cool.

[15:19] And we're going to kind of go through how that has evolved through Dwight's early career.

[15:24] If you'd like to do a little bit of extra research, or you want to hear Dwight talk about

[15:30] these things, you can check out the old head to head pinball podcast by Ryan C and Martin

[15:37] Robbins episode 73.

[15:39] That's in our show notes.

[15:41] We've got special with when lit with Ken Cromwell and Bill Webb episode three.

[15:47] That's in the show notes.

[15:49] There's the pinball players podcast, the latest one also in the show notes where he's

[15:53] talking about Ninja Turtles and loser kid pinball podcast episode 37.

[16:00] So just want to say Scott, where, where's my hat, man?

[16:04] Where's my hat?

[16:05] Anywho.

[16:07] Let's jump into the early life with pinball through a lot of these interviews.

[16:11] Dwight talks about that when he was younger, he always ended up playing ballies playboy

[16:17] and a machine that comes up to life a lot.

[16:20] His Williams high speed by Steve Richie.

[16:23] That machine comes up all the time as an influence for people who come into pinball in the

[16:31] mid to late 80s.

[16:32] I agree.

[16:33] That was a big moment, right?

[16:34] You're telling a story, you're chasing away.

[16:37] It's more video gamey as opposed to, oh, I'm shooting the ball at the targets.

[16:41] Yeah.

[16:42] Well, sure the bad guy and you're the bad guy.

[16:44] It's got great art.

[16:47] You can learn more about high speed back in episode one, our pilot episode with Steve

[16:53] Richie.

[16:54] Awesome.

[16:55] But that machine influenced a lot of people.

[16:57] So Dwight's education, he went to DeVry University, which is an Illinois-based university

[17:02] with satellite campuses throughout the US.

[17:04] It tends to be technology focused at DeVry University.

[17:08] And in fact, I had a few of my friends who are from Toronto that actually have gone

[17:13] to DeVry University.

[17:14] So basically, I'm friends with Dwight Sullivan.

[17:17] Well, where I live, we used to be DeVry commercials all the time.

[17:21] I remember when I was a kid in the 90s, DeVry University, it was like, there's like

[17:24] the guy who needs a job, but he's all of a sudden he's working on a computer with his

[17:30] keyboard and then all of a sudden he's wearing a tie and he's like a director and a corporation.

[17:35] Yeah.

[17:36] Thanks, DeVry.

[17:37] That's pretty much the same commercial we saw.

[17:39] Yeah, live in the dream at DeVry University.

[17:41] There's nothing too good for Dwight Sullivan.

[17:44] One thing that's particularly funny is a term that some people call Dwight's speak.

[17:48] Have you heard of this term?

[17:49] I have not heard of this term.

[17:50] So Dwight's speak is sort of the way that Dwight talks and Dwight is one of the funnest

[17:57] and most charming people to hear on podcast because he's genuine and he genuinely loves

[18:03] what he does so much that he gets so excited that it's difficult for him to talk about

[18:08] what's getting him so excited or he stumbles or he makes weird comments.

[18:12] He's just, he's so funny.

[18:14] The way Dwight is and I got a great quote here from Chuck Ernst that I found.

[18:19] Chuck says he made him Dwight can't get the things out of his head.

[18:23] They're in his head but he can't get that out.

[18:25] So you have to show him a bunch of options and a pick one which is what he was asking for.

[18:29] Yeah.

[18:30] So when you're working with Dwight, you got to, it's a very collaborative approach.

[18:34] Tons of fun.

[18:35] Here's a prime example of kind of the world that is Dwight Sullivan and it's how he actually

[18:42] got a job in pinball.

[18:45] And if this story is not quintessentially Dwight Sullivan, I don't know what is.

[18:51] During his time at DeVry University, there was a job fair, particularly important when

[18:57] you're kind of in college, you're getting out of college.

[19:00] You need that sort of first job.

[19:02] They have job fairs.

[19:03] You go to a hotel, you go to a high school gym somewhere.

[19:06] There's all these companies that need a cog in the wheel and they are, you know, you're

[19:10] giving them your resume and their chit chatting and you're trying to find a job that you

[19:14] think you might fit into.

[19:16] Well, this is of course a technology-based one because you're going to DeVry.

[19:20] So Dwight says, my counselor at DeVry was hard at work getting me interviews and telling

[19:25] me about job fairs.

[19:26] She told me about an entry-level job opening with Johnson Controls.

[19:30] She gave me the time and address of the hotel for the interview.

[19:33] I shaved and gathered some cool looking resumes into my leather-bound notebook.

[19:37] This is where we get the ultimate follow-up.

[19:39] So Dwight says, when I arrived at the hotel, to my dismay, there were no Johnson Controls

[19:44] interviews.

[19:45] My counselor had given me the wrong date.

[19:47] There was a job fair at the hotel that night instead.

[19:50] I was all dressed up so what could it hurt?

[19:52] I went to some of the rooms and started talking to people.

[19:55] Yes.

[19:56] So he shows up, wrong day.

[19:57] Of course, Dwight went on the wrong day.

[20:00] And he says, it was the counselor that gave him the wrong day.

[20:04] But I think if you asked Dwight's co-workers, they would probably say that maybe he went

[20:09] on the wrong day.

[20:11] You're already there.

[20:12] You shaved, right?

[20:13] After your leather-bound book, you might as well just go in and do some random interviews,

[20:17] right?

[20:18] So Dwight says, one interviewer told me that the fair was not for entry-level jobs, but

[20:21] knew a man named Ed Sajaki.

[20:23] Hopefully I said that right.

[20:25] Who often called her looking for people.

[20:27] She asked if I would like to program games.

[20:29] My eyes lit up.

[20:30] It was hard to maintain some composure.

[20:33] She told me that Edig graduated from DeVry too and I should call him.

[20:36] Yes.

[20:37] So you need to pitch to get a job, right?

[20:40] You got to go to get this job.

[20:44] You got to sell yourself, right?

[20:46] Especially when you're in technology.

[20:49] You got to be personable.

[20:50] It's kind of an odd industry, right?

[20:52] It tends to be sort of nerdy and you got to put 110% in there.

[20:57] So of course, Dwight would call Sajaki.

[21:01] Sajaki asked for a portfolio and then he come in for an interview.

[21:05] When Dwight hung up the phone, he didn't even know what a portfolio was.

[21:09] So what he did is he just gathered up what he could find.

[21:12] He gathered some logic diagrams and some schematics from school, some of the artwork that he

[21:18] had drawn on a program from his original Mac.

[21:23] And of course, he had some source code for some real time games that he wrote for his

[21:27] Commodore 64.

[21:29] So he sat down with Mark Panacho and Bill Futzenruder for an interview.

[21:35] You might recognize the name Bill Futzenruder from a lot of our other podcasts.

[21:38] He comes up from time to time as a programmer in pinball.

[21:42] He also worked at Old Stern, believe it or not, yes, there electronics.

[21:46] So we're giving you a hint where he's ended up by accident.

[21:50] So Dwight said they took me to a small room off the reception area and we sat at a round

[21:54] table.

[21:55] I opened my briefcase and in my horror my leather bound folder with my cool looking resume

[21:58] was not there.

[21:59] I apologize to them and we started to go through all the other stuff I brought.

[22:03] Right.

[22:04] Here's where we tie this back into Chuck Ernst's quote, right?

[22:09] He's got to be pretty tough, right?

[22:10] Of course, he forgot his resume.

[22:11] He's going to a job interview, right?

[22:13] So Dwight says Mark then stood up and left.

[22:15] He went to get Larry DeMar.

[22:17] Larry came in the room and I briefly went through all this stuff I brought again.

[22:20] When I was done talking about all the eclectic things I had brought, Larry didn't really

[22:24] say anything.

[22:25] That does not sound very good.

[22:27] That doesn't sound like it's going well.

[22:29] Of course, Larry DeMar, as we know, he was one of the first generation breakthrough programmers

[22:35] in the solid state era, right?

[22:37] So if you think Larry, you know, Larry DeMar is probably like the grandfather of modern

[22:43] solid state pinball code and he doesn't say anything after you're talking about it, it's

[22:49] probably not going well.

[22:51] So Larry DeMar asked Dwight, what are your favorite games?

[22:54] And Dwight told him Defender in high speed.

[22:57] Not knowing at the time who Larry DeMar was.

[23:00] That is an awesome answer.

[23:02] That is an awesome answer.

[23:04] Seems like a tough interview though.

[23:05] Regardless of sort of sucking up to Larry DeMar.

[23:09] Well, unintentionally, the funny thing is they still ask that question of interviews.

[23:16] I know people who work at Stern and that's one of like, do you want any games or what are

[23:20] your favorite games?

[23:21] They still ask that to this day.

[23:23] Good question.

[23:24] It's like in my job in the financial industry, they always ask if you have ever gone bankrupt.

[23:27] And then if you say yes, they don't give you a job.

[23:31] So Dwight would say on my way home, I was convinced that I did not get the job.

[23:36] What kind of idiot leaves his resumes at home?

[23:39] Less than a week later, I called Ed.

[23:42] He said he was glad that I called and that he was about to call me.

[23:45] He told me that apparently I made quite the impression and they wanted to hire me.

[23:52] And that's how Dwight Sullivan got a job as a programmer at Williams.

[23:58] I don't feel like those stories happen nowadays.

[24:03] I think they do.

[24:04] I think they still do.

[24:05] Of all of the sort of quote unquote origin stories, that's one of my favorites.

[24:11] That one, Pat Lawler one that we've got coming up in a few episodes down the road here.

[24:15] That's a great origin story as well.

[24:17] Super funny.

[24:18] I know when it comes to the interviews, if you have ideas, if you have game ideas, that's

[24:25] what they look for more than resumes or like what if you come in there with all these ideas

[24:32] like, I'm thinking you can do this, you can do this, you can do this, they take more notice.

[24:36] If they see that there's a bit of passion, if there's a teachability, if you understand

[24:41] sort of the basics of what they're talking about, they're able to see that even though

[24:46] you might not be able to see that as the interviewee.

[24:49] Pretty cool.

[24:50] So when Dwight started at Williams, the first project he was put on was doing some display

[24:55] effects, alpha numeric display effects for mouse and around.

[24:59] And I like to tell myself that he's the one who came up with the cool match animation,

[25:04] but I have no proof of that.

[25:05] I just always tell myself, maybe that's the one thing Dwight did on this game.

[25:09] And if it is, it's the greatest thing ever.

[25:11] Yeah.

[25:12] The moment.

[25:14] So if anyone knows, maybe even Dwight doesn't remember which effect he did, but that's

[25:20] the first, that was his getting his feet wet before he really got to be put full time

[25:25] on a game.

[25:26] Yeah, you got to learn how the computer works, you know, that they're using the...

[25:30] Yeah, whatever platform they're on.

[25:32] Yeah.

[25:33] You got to figure that out.

[25:34] And then the first game he's on after that, which is a harvacher of things to come.

[25:40] Riverboat gambler.

[25:41] Ooh, the legend.

[25:43] Do you know how many action buttons Riverboat gambler has?

[25:46] Four.

[25:49] Four buttons.

[25:50] This is what happens.

[25:52] This is what happens.

[25:53] At least there's not four nowadays.

[25:55] Not yet.

[25:56] Now this is an old timey gambling boat theme.

[26:00] It's from August of 1990.

[26:02] This is a system 11C from Williams sells 3,200 units.

[26:08] This was designed by Ward Pemberton, of course, if you remember him from our Valley episode.

[26:14] He did fathom.

[26:15] And of course, you just mentioned it mousin' around.

[26:17] This head art by Linda Deel and Pat McMan.

[26:20] Sound and music by Paul Herchst, who did Black Rose, creature from the Black Revoon,

[26:26] Brahm Stoker Stracula, that sort of 90s Valley William artist that you can think of.

[26:32] And of course, software by Dwight Sullivan.

[26:35] This is an interesting game.

[26:37] You had mentioned it before.

[26:39] It has four, count them four action buttons on it.

[26:42] Four action buttons.

[26:43] I think they use membrane switches.

[26:45] There's like a little ribbon cable thing that goes all the way across.

[26:48] I often wonder when they would do these games where you take a standard part like the lockdown

[26:53] bar and you do something like that to it.

[26:55] How much that raises the bill of materials.

[26:59] Yeah, you don't want to get messing with stuff like that, right?

[27:02] But they did.

[27:04] Yeah, if you want to get moving some drop targets around or that's one thing.

[27:09] But when you start adding extra buttons on the flipper cabinet or that's getting serious

[27:16] changes there.

[27:17] And I think I haven't played a Riverboat gambler.

[27:20] I have actually only played it maybe twice, which is unusual for me to say that, but I think

[27:26] I've only played it a couple times.

[27:28] The first part about this game is probably the fact that you don't see it very often.

[27:35] Oh, it's so mean.

[27:38] It's, yeah, it's, I mean, it's okay.

[27:40] The four buttons we should explain.

[27:42] The four buttons are basically, you can pick colors.

[27:44] Yeah, it's like gambling.

[27:46] You can like in bet, you can hold.

[27:48] That's what the buttons are for.

[27:50] Yeah, a bed hold pass.

[27:51] It's kind of cool.

[27:52] To be totally honest, I'm being facetious.

[27:54] I mean, it's actually pretty cool.

[27:57] It's really kind of neat the way it works.

[28:01] Of course, the sort of the step brother to pinball has always been gambling, right?

[28:08] It's always been slot machines and it's like that pseudo middle of the road kind of game.

[28:17] And themes like Riverboat gambler really draw on the fact that they're trying to bring

[28:23] in that gambling-esque theme without sort of hiding it.

[28:28] It's pretty transparent.

[28:30] It of course was a sure bet winner.

[28:34] Oh, you're reading the flyer almost certainly.

[28:38] You're reading the flyer.

[28:39] I don't think it was a sure bet winner.

[28:42] 3,200 units.

[28:43] Ah, I mean, at the time, I guess that's probably pretty good.

[28:46] 3,200 units today.

[28:48] Any company would take that.

[28:49] This is where we get into something called flipper codes.

[28:52] And what's particularly interesting about this game is that the flipper codes actually

[28:56] use those four buttons on the front.

[28:58] So when you start up a game before you plunge, press and hold the red button and the black

[29:03] button.

[29:04] Then press the pass button three times, the black button three times, the red button three

[29:10] times, the green button three times, then the display on the backboard, the alpha numeric

[29:15] display will shimmer, whatever that means.

[29:17] And if you press the black and the red button at the same time, it says hello world.

[29:21] Wow, that's a lot of buttons to get to say hello world.

[29:24] Dwight, as you will see throughout today's podcast, loves to kind of play with those

[29:29] things, which is neat.

[29:31] There's lots of flipper codes that he does and little hidden, little gems.

[29:36] I don't know why he does that stuff, but I guess it's fun and it's pretty cool now looking

[29:40] back at it that we can bring some of those things to light in today's pod.

[29:45] But it's, I mean, it's kind of a neat game.

[29:47] It's like, it's like a casino on a boat theme.

[29:50] It's got some really cool ramps, two sets of drop targets.

[29:54] How can you go wrong?

[29:56] It's got a diverter thing.

[29:59] It's the kind of quirky original game you probably wouldn't see being made now, unfortunately.

[30:05] Yeah, this was, I mean, nowadays this would be quite the risk.

[30:09] This would be a risky type machine and you wouldn't want to take that kind of risk

[30:14] nowadays.

[30:15] But back then, it was like, ah, go ahead, right, giver.

[30:19] And of course, before licensing, right, in a parallel universe, this would be Maverick,

[30:24] which of course would come up with Sega in the future, which is the Mel Gibson movie.

[30:29] And like it's before licensing, it's sort of Ward Pemberton kind of doing his thing and

[30:34] then bringing it into white and saying, Dwight, what could we do?

[30:36] And he's like, well, we could add buttons and we can gamble and pass and it's kind of

[30:41] cool.

[30:42] It's a risky type machine, but it is very cool.

[30:44] It is very, very cool.

[30:46] Speaking of risky, Pat McMan was on art and he could be a bit risky when it came to

[30:55] his art style.

[30:56] Isn't that right?

[30:57] There was a significant amount of skin.

[31:00] Let's just put that way.

[31:01] On the internet pinball database, you can see some of the original sketches and there's

[31:07] one specifically, which is the hand drawn sort of first sketch.

[31:12] And it's very, hmm.

[31:15] Dave Christensen would approve of the art.

[31:17] Yeah, there you go.

[31:18] Dave Christensen would approve.

[31:21] The female character is scantily clad, let's call it, and the character in the background

[31:30] is also quite scantily clad.

[31:33] So then they go to the prototype and the prototype covers up a little bit and it's a little

[31:41] bit better.

[31:42] And then of course on the final product, it is significantly toned down and I would

[31:50] say much more appropriate.

[31:54] We sort of talked about Dwight being Captain Complexity and you can see already within this

[32:03] game, the complexity is right out of the gate.

[32:07] If you open up the flyer and you look at the back of the flyer, there's like a diet

[32:13] tribe of rules already there.

[32:16] Like before it was sort of like shoot the scoops and the drop downs and then all of a sudden

[32:20] now in this flyer, it's like, yeah, there was a ton of text on the flyer.

[32:25] It's insane scoring 21 at Blackjack collects points and chips progressively for high scoring

[32:31] payout.

[32:32] And if the player doesn't bust, consecutive winning streak loop shots give players the

[32:38] opportunity to play the slot machine and also begin two ball, multi ball action.

[32:43] It's like, wow, there's a lot going on here on this machine.

[32:46] Think that that was probably the draw that wow, there's a, you could do a lot with this

[32:49] machine.

[32:50] It's not just shoot the drop targets and get a multi ball.

[32:52] I think that can be safely said that's the most anyone's talked about Riverboat gambler.

[32:56] There you go.

[32:57] The definitive podcast on all things Riverboat gambler is silver ball chronicles.

[33:01] Be sure to go over to silverballswag.com to pick up your shirt.

[33:06] Oh, Mark Richie also did the music on this game.

[33:08] That's interesting.

[33:09] Yeah, nothing else to do.

[33:10] Might as well just do a little bit of music because of course him, like his brother, Steve,

[33:14] a bit of a musician.

[33:15] Of course, the next game has been talked about a lot, usually not in a positive fashion.

[33:21] Oh, no, you got to be positive.

[33:23] Can't be negative on this podcast.

[33:24] Oh, Bugs Bunny's birthday ball.

[33:28] So Dwight was on a supporting role on Bugs Bunny birthday ball.

[33:33] He wasn't the lead programmer, but he was a support member led by Dan Lee, who was

[33:40] the lead.

[33:41] He did some minor things he said on this, which were a little bit of code cleanup, a couple

[33:46] of light blinking bits.

[33:48] But he did do some work on Bugs Bunny's birthday ball.

[33:51] So you can blame Dwight for that game next time you see him.

[33:54] Dwight says, when I arrived at Williams, the average sale of a particular title for

[33:57] us was about 3K.

[33:59] 5,000 of a unit was a good day.

[34:02] For many reasons, pinball popularity went through the roof in a few years.

[34:05] I happen to work on three of the highest earning and best selling pinball machines of that

[34:08] era.

[34:10] And in 1990, Steve Richie started designing and drawing out a play field that would later

[34:16] become the getaway high speed too.

[34:19] As we mentioned earlier, high speed was the machine that really drew Dwight in to pinball.

[34:25] At an early stage in the development, Steve shelved what he had designed so far because

[34:31] he got the opportunity to do Terminator 2.

[34:34] And of course, he took it.

[34:37] So Steve and some video game designers, including George Petro and others, went to California

[34:44] to meet with James Cameron, who of course is the movie director of Terminator 2.

[34:48] And of course, they took some others with them and they needed to learn about the movie,

[34:51] because you can't make a pinball machine without knowing about the movie.

[34:55] Now Dwight didn't go because he was not on the getaway team and therefore not on the

[35:00] Terminator 2 team.

[35:02] And the other thing to explain is back then, the games would come out at the same time as

[35:07] the movie.

[35:08] So when they made the game, they would have advanced scripts and would know what was going

[35:11] to happen in the movie before it was released.

[35:14] Which doesn't really happen anymore.

[35:16] Yeah, could you imagine having the script to Avatar 2 just having it?

[35:21] No.

[35:22] That's dangerous, man.

[35:24] So this brings us to the game of my childhood, the game that I want to have in my collection

[35:32] and I'm too cheap to actually buy.

[35:34] That's Terminator 2 Judgment Day.

[35:37] That space, time travel, sci-fi, war theme, July of 91.

[35:42] It's a solid state machine.

[35:44] This is the WPC from Williams with the Dot Matrix display or DMD.

[35:49] The standard body machine, it sells 15,202 units, music and sound by the legend Chris

[35:56] Granner, software by Dwight Sullivan, and art by Doug Watson.

[36:02] Now we've talked about how much I love T2.

[36:05] In Steve Richie, the Mollett ears, you want to go back into the archive and listen to those.

[36:10] But we're going to take a different perspective.

[36:13] We're going to take a look at it from Dwight's perspective today.

[36:16] And Dwight would say, I finished up Riverboat Gambler and went on vacation with my girlfriend.

[36:20] When I came back from vacation, I was told I was going to be working with Steve on T2

[36:24] and to not mess it up.

[36:26] That's, I love how corporate like that, right?

[36:29] Corporate folk, they're always like, hey, we're going to, we're going to give you a big

[36:31] promotion.

[36:33] Don't mess it up.

[36:34] You're like, like, ugh, that's a lot of pressure.

[36:38] This is of course because Steve had a falling out with his current programmer on the team,

[36:43] Mark Panacho.

[36:45] Steve as falling out with many programmers at C.

[36:47] I don't know why.

[36:48] I don't know why.

[36:49] I knew very little of Steve at the time.

[36:52] Little did I know that I was about to grab the tail of a comet.

[36:55] That's a good way to describe that, eh?

[36:57] Dwight, you're such a word Smith.

[37:01] So the DMD era, this is an exciting thing, okay?

[37:04] This is the, this is the first machine with the DMD, although of course.

[37:09] Checkpoint, I think had one before.

[37:11] That was checkpoint at Data East as well as there was Gilligan's Island, but this is

[37:15] kind of the first, this is the one where you're like, whoa, this is, this is really what

[37:19] it's supposed to do.

[37:21] Yeah, Gilligan's Island was the first weaves game released with a DMD.

[37:24] So Dwight would say Terminator 2 was to be the first game with a dot matrix display.

[37:29] This new innovation did what we had hoped it would do.

[37:32] It gave pinball a shot in the arm in sales.

[37:36] New games with dot matrixes made all the old games look old when they sat next to them.

[37:43] The dot matrix also enabled us to do video modes.

[37:46] This was something more we could do that was different from the recent games.

[37:52] For a while, most pins had video modes.

[37:55] Some had even more than one.

[37:57] And some were good.

[37:58] And so this brings us to the video mode.

[38:03] So we have some comments here.

[38:04] We have Mike Wynn from our Facebook page says, I generally like video modes.

[38:09] I mean, you got the screen back there.

[38:11] Why not use it?

[38:12] I wish more newer stirrens had video modes, except for the bash the flippers as fast as

[38:16] you can ones.

[38:18] Video modes like those can die.

[38:20] Wow.

[38:23] Not a fan lethal weapon three.

[38:25] Uh, why that's not bashing flippers as fast as you can.

[38:29] The fighting one is not the same.

[38:31] It's the one that's one of them, but it has the gun one.

[38:35] And how about black rose?

[38:36] That has the, you escape from the shark.

[38:38] And that's super cool bashing the button as fast as you can.

[38:41] I kind of like the video mode in Terminator 2 to be totally honest.

[38:44] Right?

[38:45] It's the robots are going through and you're just using the buttons to go left and right.

[38:49] Yep.

[38:50] It was so good.

[38:51] It was reused in Terminator 3.

[38:52] In fact, it was so good they made an entire video game around it called T2, the video

[38:58] game.

[38:59] Not really.

[39:00] Actually, I lied and made that up.

[39:02] But that was, you know, this was Terminator 2.

[39:06] Anything associated with Terminator 2 made a crap ton of money.

[39:08] Did it ever?

[39:09] The Pimball machine, the video game, the, um, it was a good, the gun's a Rosa song that

[39:13] was in it.

[39:15] Anything associated with it was a success.

[39:17] And in fact, they're still trying to revive that magic.

[39:21] Every couple of years they just try to destroy my, what are my favorite, get movies of all

[39:26] time.

[39:27] Up for Terminator 7, the rebirth or something like that.

[39:31] Oh, okay.

[39:32] Anywho.

[39:33] Twice, twice as one day near the very beginning of T2 development.

[39:36] George Petro, stop by me in the hall and told me he was concerned that T2 Pinball can make

[39:40] his game T2 Video look bad.

[39:42] I don't think he was being funny at the time.

[39:44] I thought this was very rude, but I didn't say anything.

[39:48] The N2 Pinball outsold the video game in an out-earned T2 video at most test locations.

[39:53] In fact, Terminator 2 Pinball sold over 15,000 games as one of the all-time top-selling

[39:58] pinball machines.

[39:59] This machine was everywhere.

[40:00] It was everywhere all the time in all the places you could be.

[40:04] And always next to it was T2 Video.

[40:06] I would say that T2 Pinball was the game of my childhood that I remember.

[40:12] But all I remember, I was, I don't know, like eight.

[40:16] All I did at that time was like double flip and drain and there was nothing to it.

[40:20] So I would gravitate to the video game of T2.

[40:24] And I played a lot of that because I could get more for my quarter.

[40:29] It was awesome, right?

[40:30] The T2 video game had the two guns that shook, and they had like a rocket on the side.

[40:37] You shot the Terminators and then you worked your way through sort of from the battlefield

[40:40] to the factory to the time machine.

[40:43] Then you were in the future.

[40:44] It was really, really, really cool.

[40:46] And you could see that there was a lot of competition between the two.

[40:49] The other thing about Terminator 2, it's got that moment, which would be the Super Jackpot.

[40:55] Everyone remembers the Super, or it was people say the Stupid Jackpot because that's what it sounds like Arnold says,

[41:00] but he does say Super Jackpot.

[41:02] And that's the thing you're trying to get on that game every time.

[41:05] Yeah, great little story about the Stupid Jackpot on the Super Awesome Pinball show, episode 23.

[41:14] The Getaway high speed two was the next hit in the hopper.

[41:19] And of course the driving police car theme February of 92.

[41:23] It is a WPC standard body sells 13,259 units, which of course huge again.

[41:31] Sound and music Dan Forden, software by Dwight Sullivan, art by Doug Watson,

[41:37] who does the Translight and Mark Springer, who does the Playfield and Cabinet.

[41:42] And they brought Mark back from the, he did the original high speed.

[41:46] So there was some continuity with the Playfield.

[41:48] It's the same artist.

[41:49] You want the same look and feel, right?

[41:51] You want the call back to remind people of the awesome game that was high speed.

[41:55] And from the tech standpoint, I believe this was the first Williams game to have the service rails underneath.

[42:02] So you could pull the Playfield out.

[42:03] So you could work on that wonderful Supercharger.

[42:06] Yes.

[42:07] Even though the thing really never has any issues.

[42:09] I own a Getaway.

[42:10] I've never had an issue with that thing.

[42:11] It literally only has one moving part.

[42:14] So Dwight would say when T2 was done, Steve and I quickly went into the next game,

[42:19] which was the Getaway high speed two.

[42:21] It went really fast because Steve already had a good head start.

[42:26] Early in the development of the Getaway, we went to Steve's house.

[42:29] He owned a high speed and we wanted to review what the game was like.

[42:33] The funny thing is we spent only a few minutes playing and talking about high speed.

[42:38] The rest of the evening we spent checking out Steve's new big screen home theater equipment.

[42:45] That's the funny thing about Dwight, right?

[42:47] Is that you're inquiring about high speed and building those things.

[42:53] And what sticks out in his mind is, oh yeah, we totally were hanging out with Steve's

[42:56] like home theater.

[42:57] You know what I mean?

[42:59] It's so funny the way he sort of talks about things and remembers things.

[43:03] And then Steve Richie would sell his copy of high speed to Dwight.

[43:06] Oh man.

[43:07] Did you imagine having Steve Richie's new inbox high speed?

[43:13] That's cool man.

[43:14] Dwight said he was thrilled because high speed was the game that got me into pinball and

[43:17] it was a jewel in my small collection.

[43:19] Lyman Sheets now own Steve's high speed.

[43:23] And Dwight has dibs on the machine if Lyman dies.

[43:28] I guess that's assuming that Lyman will never sell it.

[43:32] This is a great story.

[43:33] This is a wonderful story.

[43:35] One thing is that when I think we forget in pinball sort of you and I is quote unquote

[43:41] hobbyist media or you know, just the regular, you know, everyday collector or the person

[43:47] who goes to tournaments or the person who goes to the pub and there's a machine that

[43:52] there's like this emotional attachment that people have with the projects that they work

[43:59] on.

[44:00] And when you look back at people like Steve Richie, you look back at Dwight Sullivan.

[44:04] Those guys, they were, they were in some of the, just the biggest moments within this industry

[44:11] and within this hobby.

[44:12] So there's these fun emotional interesting stories.

[44:16] And here's a good one.

[44:17] Dwight says Steve and I went to back to back trade shows with T2 and then with Getaway.

[44:21] Both were in Las Vegas.

[44:23] While we were at the second show selling the Getaway, Larry Demar noticed that on one

[44:27] of the large Las Vegas strip signs that face the road, it said the following.

[44:32] Joy our new arcade featuring T2 pinball.

[44:36] T2 pinball filled their entire display.

[44:39] I think it was the silver dollar casino.

[44:41] Larry Demar drove me to see it and I have a picture of it.

[44:44] We sold over 13,000 copies of the Getaway at the trade show almost sight unseen.

[44:49] Imagine the hard work and the passion and the fun and the arguments and all of that stuff

[44:57] bundled up into that T2 project and it's blasted all over a casino sign on the Las Vegas

[45:05] strip and you're able to say that you have a piece of that.

[45:09] Isn't that amazing?

[45:11] Like that story makes me feel like excited for some reason.

[45:14] I don't know.

[45:15] And it has one of the best Super Jackpot callouts ever.

[45:18] Well, it's not even a callout, just the Super Jackpot itself.

[45:21] It's such a great game.

[45:23] It's so good to write reviews to two or three times, but it's worth it.

[45:28] It's that good.

[45:29] If you want to sell your T2 for 25% less than market value, please send me an email.

[45:34] Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[45:36] Has to be in Canada.

[45:37] You have to be able to deliver.

[45:38] Good luck with that.

[45:39] Good luck with that.

[45:40] So this brings us into the next massive license after the Getaway.

[45:46] That Star Trek, the next generation of course, space sci-fi Star Trek theme, November of

[45:50] 1993.

[45:51] This is the DCS Williams system in the back box.

[45:56] Proof sound.

[45:57] Yes.

[45:58] Ooh.

[45:59] The wide body, 11,728 units.

[46:04] Music and sound by Dan Ford and software to white Sullivan art by Greg Ferris.

[46:08] And I may be right.

[46:10] I believe that was the last Williams to be in the 10k Club.

[46:15] That's a prestigious place to be because I doubt there are very few games nowadays.

[46:20] That are in the 10k Club.

[46:21] I doubt there are any.

[46:22] Dwight says for a while the game was actually going to be under siege based on the upcoming

[46:27] movie.

[46:28] Steve had ideas of putting two cannons on the right side of the play field and dress it

[46:32] up to look like the half of the ship.

[46:34] The two cannons would look like cannons of the destroyer.

[46:38] The ship that's used in the setting of the movie.

[46:39] Yeah.

[46:40] Do you remember under siege?

[46:41] I saw that in a theater.

[46:43] That's a Steven C. Gal, but the real star of that is the cake lady.

[46:47] No.

[46:48] Oh god.

[46:49] Not the cake lady.

[46:50] Tommy Lee Jones.

[46:51] Oh.

[46:52] He was a bad guy in that one.

[46:53] It's his movie.

[46:54] I remember that movie.

[46:55] And I'm going to have to say American pinball.

[46:58] You should go after under siege.

[47:00] It's a good one.

[47:01] If you can get help from any of the actors, Steven C. Gal is usually not very cooperative

[47:05] with anything.

[47:06] It's a, I don't, you know, I think at the time that was quite, that was actually quite

[47:10] the action kind of movie.

[47:12] Like that was a big deal.

[47:13] That movie actually.

[47:14] As much as we joke and kid about it nowadays, because we've seen what's happened to Steven

[47:18] C. Gal and all his other movies.

[47:20] Well, it was one of the diehards.

[47:22] Yeah, basically.

[47:23] That's the, that's the, that's die hard on a boat.

[47:25] Yeah.

[47:26] It's that sort of genre that, that, that era, right?

[47:29] You got Arnold Schwarzenegger doing action movies.

[47:32] You've got Jean Claude Van Dam doing action movies.

[47:36] You still have Bruce Willis.

[47:37] For some reason, he's, he's the only one of that generation that has survived.

[47:41] And, and you had Steven C. Gal.

[47:42] And this was that sort of 80s kind of violent explosion.

[47:48] Interesting story, but not very good character is kind of movie.

[47:51] And it was, it was kind of fun.

[47:53] It's a fun kind of popcorn flick.

[47:54] So it was 80s in the 90s?

[47:56] I'm sorry in the 90s.

[47:57] Yeah.

[47:58] So Dwight would say, then the opportunity came to do Star Trek, the next generation.

[48:03] Steven and I were both huge fans of the show.

[48:06] And we switched tracks from under siege fast.

[48:10] You know, Dwight being a nerd, of course, he liked Star Trek.

[48:12] Like, come on, Star Trek was huge.

[48:14] In this time, you're able to, again, see the scripts, you know,

[48:18] you're either, they're going to locations, they're spending time on those locations,

[48:22] seeing where they're doing the movie and the sets and all that stuff.

[48:25] Well, Steve Richie, Roger Sharp, Greg Ferris, and Dwight all went to Hollywood.

[48:30] They went to the Paramount Studios to talk about the licensing with the licensing department.

[48:35] Actually, the licensing folk took them on a tour of the enterprise set and Dwight

[48:41] walked on the enterprise D.

[48:46] And for somebody like Dwight, I bet you this is probably one of the greatest times of

[48:49] his entire life.

[48:50] And here is one of my favorite Dwight Sullivan quotes.

[48:54] Dwight says, I saw the holodeck in 10 forward.

[48:57] I was on the bridge.

[48:58] They had the chairs covered in plastic.

[49:00] You could walk right through the view screen.

[49:02] We saw them setting up the lighting for a scene and on our way from there, Gates McFadden,

[49:06] who's Dr. Crusher, walked right past us on our way to that scene.

[49:09] She was very tall.

[49:10] After our tour of the enterprise, we had lunch in the Paramount commissary.

[49:13] This commissary was huge.

[49:15] Many other celebrity signings were to be had.

[49:17] The coolest was Patrick Stewart.

[49:18] He sat at the table directly behind Steve.

[49:21] And he said, make it so.

[49:23] Oh, no, he didn't.

[49:24] Why is this one of my favorite quotes?

[49:26] Well, it's because throughout the tour, you get a glimpse of what's going on in Dwight's

[49:32] Sullivan's head.

[49:34] So he says, I was on the bridge and the chairs were covered in plastic.

[49:38] Like that sticks out in his head so much that he asked him, that he wrote this down in

[49:41] this interview or in this blog post that I pulled from.

[49:46] Then he also said, we got to see Gates McFadden.

[49:48] And she was very tall.

[49:50] And then we got to eat and the commissary was big.

[49:54] Like it's so funny, just like what goes on in his head.

[49:58] And this quote is so perfectly him.

[50:01] You know, it was in our Steve Richie episode, the Mullet years, and we talked about Star Trek,

[50:07] the negotiations with Paramount were very difficult.

[50:10] And of course Dwight would say they wanted to make it clear that the enterprise would never

[50:14] fire first and never before some negotiating.

[50:18] There's a hidden brick game.

[50:21] Have you seen the hidden brick game?

[50:22] It's breakout.

[50:23] I have seen breakout.

[50:24] No, breakout is trademarked.

[50:26] This is a brick like game.

[50:28] Okay, it's a breakout.

[50:29] So you got to do this with a flipper code, right?

[50:31] Yeah.

[50:32] And we were talking about flipper codes with Rivervoah Gambler.

[50:34] I try to remember, I just without reading the notes, you put a code in and then when

[50:38] you get to the Rikers poker or something, you have to hold a button down and hit trigger

[50:43] or something.

[50:44] Yeah, there's a whole, I got, I'll break it out for you here.

[50:46] So, okay, when it comes to complexity and silliness, Dwight just goes nuts for some reason.

[50:55] So most of the time you'd be like, oh, you want to have a secret little mode, you put

[50:58] it in a flipper code and that's kind of it.

[51:00] Well no, not with Dwight.

[51:02] So the way it starts and I've got this, it's in the show notes here.

[51:09] So you put in the code at the beginning and then the DMD will flicker.

[51:14] Then you have to play the game and get to Rikers poker night, which is a video mode.

[51:19] And instead of getting into Rikers poker night, it goes to the brick breaker game instead.

[51:25] So what's Rikers poker night just to sort of add some context to that?

[51:29] It's a video mode where you play cards and you try to win the hands.

[51:33] Yeah, so it's like a hidden video mode.

[51:35] Rikers poker night is not like the regular mode, right?

[51:39] It itself is a hidden mode, isn't that right?

[51:41] It's not, it's in the settings of the game, you can either turn it off or on.

[51:45] So by default, it's always off.

[51:47] You go to the tunnel, isn't that right?

[51:49] Isn't that the default one?

[51:50] It's an actual setting in this offer.

[51:51] Is this like hidden video mode or something, yes or no or something like that?

[51:55] I always had it off on mine because of tournaments and stuff.

[51:58] So I honestly forget.

[52:01] Yeah, so to recap, you put the code in, you have to play the game and get to the video mode.

[52:08] You have to play the video mode, then you hold the plunger.

[52:11] You pull the trigger, you pull the trigger, there's no plunger.

[52:14] We'll get another correction.

[52:15] And then it says, you know, points or game and you choose points.

[52:19] And instead of giving you the points, it goes into the brick breaker game.

[52:25] And we've completely lost everybody.

[52:26] He really understands what we just said.

[52:28] And ladies and gentlemen, Dwight Sullivan, another really fun story is the Star Trek, the

[52:33] next generation door.

[52:35] Have you heard this story?

[52:36] No, what about the Star Trek door?

[52:38] So Bill Grup, who he worked on Congo with John Trudeau and that team on his door at Williams,

[52:46] he's one of the programmers at his door.

[52:48] He took one of the decals from the Congo back box and he stuck it very nicely in the center

[52:53] of his door, which I mean, you know,

[52:56] Congo not a good movie, but that side art, it's kind of cool.

[52:59] Dwight knew that he had a whole bunch of Star Trek, the next generation decals and he

[53:05] decided to one up Bill.

[53:08] So to do this, Dwight covered his entire door with Patrick Stewart's face.

[53:15] And this is how the Star Trek door was created.

[53:17] So if you went to Dwight Sullivan's door at Valley Williams, it was top to bottom left

[53:23] to right, completely filled with Patrick Stewart's side art from Star Trek, the next generation.

[53:28] More useless info.

[53:29] I think if I remember it is Star Trek, the next gen, the cabeted a silk screen with the

[53:34] back box as a decal.

[53:36] But I think the Proto's, it was also silk screen, the back box and then they switched

[53:41] it to a decal.

[53:43] Hence the all the decals available.

[53:46] Well Ron, it's a new year.

[53:47] We have a new podcast sponsor.

[53:49] It's time to put on my professional voice.

[53:52] 2020 has shown us anything.

[54:44] Now back to the podcast.

[54:48] Then Dwight would work with Pat Lawler on the red and Ted Roadshow.

[54:54] We're going to cover that under the Pat Lawler episode because that's a whole thing.

[54:58] So I don't want to get into that today but he worked on that project.

[55:01] And then we get into something really, really original.

[55:05] And that is who done it.

[55:06] I love who done it.

[55:08] People either love it or they hate it.

[55:10] Yeah, they just don't understand it.

[55:12] They don't understand the brilliance that is who done it.

[55:14] So this is a murder mystery kind of game.

[55:17] It's September of 1995.

[55:19] It's a WPC-S standard body so they're back to the standard body layouts.

[55:25] 2,416 units so not very many.

[55:28] Ouch.

[55:29] And of course this is sort of like after that first initial boom in the 90s it's kind

[55:34] of on its way down again the industry.

[55:36] Music and sound by Paul Heist.

[55:40] Heist.

[55:41] Heist.

[55:42] Heist.

[55:43] Sounds good.

[55:44] Software by Dwight Sullivan and Art by Linda Deal and Paul Barker.

[55:48] Yes, fine.

[55:49] We're going through all these games.

[55:50] I'm thinking with the exception of Riverboat Gambler, I've owned a Terminator 2.

[55:57] I own a get away.

[55:58] I've owned a Star Trek next generation and I own a who done it.

[56:02] I guess I'm a Dwight guy.

[56:03] Sounds like it.

[56:04] You're like your moments.

[56:06] I love moments.

[56:07] You're like, you're like, stop and start.

[56:09] That's not true.

[56:12] We've got a comment here from Pinside.

[56:15] Watch and read it.

[56:16] It's from law.

[56:17] Oh, the law.

[56:18] The law, I guess that's his name.

[56:20] So wait a minute.

[56:21] So he's the law.

[56:22] So is he, what's his face?

[56:23] Isn't Judge Dred the law?

[56:25] Yeah, probably.

[56:26] Yeah, that's right.

[56:27] Al-Law.

[56:28] The salon is the log.

[56:31] Watch and read what the law has to say.

[56:33] Who done it is a fantastic idea.

[56:36] But in reality it's a bit of a mess.

[56:39] If you don't lock in a high jackpot value during multi-ball, it's a waste.

[56:45] It has a bunch of seemingly role-playing game elements, which sounds great, but it's

[56:51] just jackpots all day and you need a ton of them.

[56:55] I'm MacArthur who is actually the guru here in my province who does all of the IFPA tournaments.

[57:04] He's the IFPA provincial director.

[57:07] He says on Facebook that who done it is perhaps his least favorite pinball machine of all

[57:12] time, definitely in the bottom five.

[57:16] And then Billy Y.J., who's a frequenter of the pinball hobby, replied to that and said

[57:23] I was just about to type that.

[57:26] Tom and Billy are dead to me.

[57:29] Just just it, you know, there's more to the game and he didn't even, that about getting

[57:35] the jackpots than the regular multi-ball.

[57:37] That's not even how you get the huge scores in the game.

[57:40] Now I'm not talking about using the bug.

[57:42] That's another thing.

[57:43] The Dwight Sullivan games, at least in the tournament crowd, are kind of known for being

[57:48] the bug games that you end up not using.

[57:50] Would you say it's a bug or it's an exploit?

[57:53] They're bugs.

[57:54] Terminator 2 has bugs where you just, I think it's like it doesn't count to Super Jackpot,

[57:59] Terminator.

[58:00] Getaway has bugs.

[58:01] So they don't typically use it.

[58:04] Who done it has the really bad bug where the motorized three-bank will just stay down

[58:10] and you can just hit the ramp into infinity forever and just play the game for hours on end.

[58:16] So there's sometimes there's a price to complexity.

[58:19] I guess this is the...

[58:21] Yeah, well said.

[58:22] Well said.

[58:23] But on who done it?

[58:24] Honestly, the main strategy I use on who done it, just to do a quick, because I like

[58:28] who done it so much.

[58:30] Basically you want to get the revolver because it makes the pop-up increase the value of

[58:34] the jackpot into infinity land.

[58:36] I don't know if there's a cap.

[58:37] Get into the basement multi-ball.

[58:40] Get some, you know, trap up your multiple balls and just hit the left orbit, get into the

[58:45] pops, get the jackpots to your dickest levels and then start collecting.

[58:49] And you will blow up the game in a huge way.

[58:51] Super fun.

[58:52] The design of this game, this is co-designed by Dwight and Barry Ausler.

[58:58] So that's interesting.

[58:59] So Dwight is actually kinda...

[59:02] He has a hand in designing this machine.

[59:05] And this looks like Dwight is sort of branching out a little bit here and partnering with

[59:08] Barry Ausler for the design and the software.

[59:12] So Dwight would say by 1995, with the help of many talented people, I helped design some

[59:18] very successful games.

[59:21] While up to this point, I had a great deal of input into those games.

[59:25] I wanted more control over the design of the game.

[59:28] So Barry Ausler, for example on Star Trek the next generation, for those of you who hate

[59:33] the subway system, that was actually Dwight's idea.

[59:36] Yeah, that's all I'm doing.

[59:38] He wanted the ball, you know, to have the balls come just be staged and ready to come out

[59:43] at various places on the play field.

[59:45] Very cool.

[59:46] It's one thing that's interesting and we'll get into this.

[59:48] I've got a Barry Ausler episode already to go.

[59:51] Barry Ausler is always like the guy that would work with somebody to finalize their design

[59:58] and really button it up and tighten it up.

[01:00:01] That I think is why he was paired with Dwight on this because you got somebody like Barry

[01:00:05] who was always, and ended up dealing with somebody like Python Angelo and was able to

[01:00:09] sort of corral a game out of that or somebody would bring a design and they'd be like,

[01:00:14] Barry, can you put a bow on this and spit shine in a little bit and then all of a sudden

[01:00:19] he would make Barracora.

[01:00:21] He would always sort of get everything nice and tighten together and I think that's why

[01:00:24] he was paired with Dwight in this case.

[01:00:26] And Dwight says, through a trition of one sort or another, Barry Ausler, a game designer

[01:00:30] of almost three decades was left with a short design team.

[01:00:34] He often worked in later years with Mark Richie, Bill Futzenruder or Python Angelo.

[01:00:38] I approached my bosses and Barry and suggested that I start co-designing games with him.

[01:00:43] They all agreed that that made sense.

[01:00:45] And the reason a lot of those guys weren't there anymore is because they all went to Capcom.

[01:00:48] Yeah, that's sort of the, you know, that group of individuals they all sort of pulled

[01:00:53] that shoot.

[01:00:54] And that's a whole episode in itself.

[01:00:56] They got a bunch of people from Williams to go over to Capcom.

[01:00:58] Yeah, that's a whole other thing.

[01:01:02] Dwight, he said, I told Barry about my idea that I had been cooking.

[01:01:07] It was an idea to do a game about a murder mystery.

[01:01:10] He liked it and showed me a play field that he had drawn.

[01:01:14] And we started talking about how we could marry this play field idea to my murder mystery

[01:01:19] game.

[01:01:20] Since it was my idea to do all of the theme, since it was my idea to do the theme, we

[01:01:26] agreed that the buck would stop with me on the theme related stuff.

[01:01:31] And Barry would handle everything else.

[01:01:33] There you go.

[01:01:34] The play field master can do his thing and just make the shots nice.

[01:01:40] And I'm going to do my thing, which is bringing the theme, you know, bringing the code, all

[01:01:45] of that stuff, and be sort of the lead, which is very cool.

[01:01:47] And can I just say the call out to music or also awesome on Who Donut?

[01:01:51] I keep, you know, saying how awesome Who Donut is, but...

[01:01:55] Yeah, a friend of mine, Trevor, he rebuilt a Who Donut and he's like, I'm shocked at how

[01:02:01] much I enjoy this game.

[01:02:02] And he downsized his home.

[01:02:05] He didn't have as much room.

[01:02:07] This was one of the machines that he moved on and he said it was difficult for him to do

[01:02:10] that.

[01:02:11] So it's like a casino theme, right?

[01:02:14] It's, it's, it's clue with a casino.

[01:02:17] Barry and Dwight still have a very good relationship.

[01:02:20] They played poker all the time.

[01:02:22] There was a sort of, there's like a Williams poker group back in the 90s, card games and

[01:02:28] things like that.

[01:02:29] I guess flow very well.

[01:02:30] Dwight would say at this point in history gambling machines in general were being blamed

[01:02:35] for the decline in coin op and pinball.

[01:02:38] It was decided that our pinball machines needed to have more gambling themes.

[01:02:44] This changed the theme of our game a little bit.

[01:02:47] We wrote into the story that it took place in a casino, Tony's palace.

[01:02:52] We also then added a slot machine toy to the game.

[01:02:56] So we're getting into the slot machine toy in a second, but there's also the phone toy.

[01:03:00] The phone toy is literally, it's, it's just a phone that flashes as a flash screen and

[01:03:04] it just flashes.

[01:03:06] It's not really a toy.

[01:03:07] It's literally just a, it's just the static piece of plastic.

[01:03:10] That's why I think toy is an exclamation marks because it's not really a toy.

[01:03:16] So I think it was Barry Dwight would say that came up with the phone, quote unquote, toy.

[01:03:20] I thought of how to use it.

[01:03:23] And it was one of my favorite features in the pinball.

[01:03:26] When the phone rings, it's clear what's going on.

[01:03:30] You have to answer it.

[01:03:31] I'm the call outs tell you that too.

[01:03:33] Well, someone answered the phone.

[01:03:35] The other thing is the slot machine in the game, right?

[01:03:37] Under the play field.

[01:03:38] I love the slot machine.

[01:03:40] If it works, consider yourself lucky if it works.

[01:03:44] If it does work, don't screw with it.

[01:03:47] It's literally a shot, it's a slot machine and it's coordinated with the play field.

[01:03:52] And when you hit certain shots, it's like you pull the lever on the slot machine.

[01:03:57] So the little things, those little barrels underneath spin and you want to line them up.

[01:04:00] And it's physical.

[01:04:01] It's physical.

[01:04:02] It's not a digital.

[01:04:03] It's a physical slot machine.

[01:04:04] That seems dangerous to work on.

[01:04:07] Let's put this way.

[01:04:08] Mine was totally rebuilt by the previous owner.

[01:04:11] So when I shopped it out, I removed the entire slot machine and put it aside and never

[01:04:15] touched it.

[01:04:18] And you may want to put LEDs in it too because it can get hot in there with the lights.

[01:04:22] That's one place I would recommend LED.

[01:04:24] The promo poster flyer for this super, super fun.

[01:04:29] Because it's done like it's like a murder mystery clue-esque thing.

[01:04:36] But it's almost like a newspaper or an article piece with the Ballet Inquisitor of Who

[01:04:43] Done It.

[01:04:44] And then it sort of outlines the butler and Victoria and Bruno and Trixi of course and Tony.

[01:04:50] And for some reason, why are they all Italian?

[01:04:52] That's not right.

[01:04:53] One is British.

[01:04:54] Victoria has a British accent.

[01:04:56] Yeah, but I bet she wasn't the one that did it though.

[01:04:59] They all did it at one point.

[01:05:00] Oh, yeah.

[01:05:01] Someone new does it every time.

[01:05:03] Every case.

[01:05:05] Not only that, there's an entire backstory that was written for this.

[01:05:10] I don't know where that is somewhere, but I mean more than just a flyer.

[01:05:14] There's like a whole backstory about this game.

[01:05:18] The story, if you will.

[01:05:19] Yeah, there's like you take the road up the railway into the subway with a diverter.

[01:05:25] There's the thing in the middle called elevator madness, which is like a 360 kind of ramp

[01:05:33] where it'll go to three different directions when you're shooting in the middle.

[01:05:37] The phone up the left side pop bumpers in the middle.

[01:05:40] There's a lot going on in this machine and it's I think it's a lot of fun.

[01:05:42] I would love to play this game just because it's so different and unusual.

[01:05:46] And we'll get into that in a minute.

[01:05:48] One thing that's also super, super cool is that you can choose between expert and novice.

[01:05:53] Oh, new feature.

[01:05:56] New feature and this brings me to an interesting point here in pinball in general, which

[01:06:03] is patents in pinball.

[01:06:04] And we haven't talked about this in any of our other previous engagements.

[01:06:09] But patents are a big thing in pinball, especially it's something that's so physical and interesting.

[01:06:16] Choosing expert or novice actually was a patent that was filed by Dwight Sullivan in

[01:06:21] Ken Fidesna on behalf of Williams Electronics game incorporated.

[01:06:27] Now that was filed in December of 1995 and it was actually granted in January of 1998.

[01:06:34] I've pulled that patent information and it says a pinball game is provided with a control

[01:06:38] system, which enables a game player to choose between a novice mode of play and a normal

[01:06:43] mode of play.

[01:06:44] In novice mode, the game play proceeds in a predetermined time regardless of the number

[01:06:50] of game balls played and selected game features such as a tilt sensor, maybe disabled.

[01:06:56] And bonuses and free play games may be made unavailable in novice mode to encourage

[01:07:01] experienced players to play the normal mode.

[01:07:03] And interestingly enough, this was used, well, kind of used again on game of thrones.

[01:07:09] There was like a novice mode in that also.

[01:07:11] And I believe it was, um, it was used in golden eye at Sega where you could choose between

[01:07:17] sort of a predetermined amount of times to get a little extra ball saver than you did the

[01:07:21] other way around.

[01:07:23] Also a fun way to cheat in tournaments.

[01:07:27] So you can review some of Dwight's other patents.

[01:07:29] He's he's he's in quite a few of the different patents and I'll include a link to that.

[01:07:35] And it's funny because he's actually determined to be a inventor, which is kind of fun.

[01:07:42] It was junkyard, which was the next game up for Dwight Sullivan and Barry Ausler.

[01:07:47] This time, Barry would take the lead followed by Dwight and of course shortly into development

[01:07:52] Barry would let go by Williams along with a lot of other people.

[01:07:57] Yeah.

[01:07:58] So there's a whole really cool story about junkyard and the back story and the interesting

[01:08:03] bits and pieces.

[01:08:04] We'll get into that in our Barry Ausler episode.

[01:08:06] This is that time again.

[01:08:08] You know, we're moving into like 96 97 98 where we're on that roller coaster ride down

[01:08:14] the bottom.

[01:08:15] Williams is cost cutting and they they cut a bunch of their designers.

[01:08:19] It was just Barry Ausler who had been there for 25 years.

[01:08:23] Dennis Nordman, he cut him by this by this point, I believe they just had it was Papa

[01:08:29] Duke, George Gomez, like Brian Eddie.

[01:08:33] I'm trying to think who else.

[01:08:35] Steve Richie moved on to video games.

[01:08:37] So yeah, he had management position and he moved on to the video games doing California

[01:08:42] speed games like that.

[01:08:43] This is where they're they're trying to watch, you know, their costs, right?

[01:08:48] Like the other thing is right when you look at these new individuals, you know, Papa

[01:08:52] Duke, Gomez, Dwight Sullivan, these kind of they're working a lot cheaper than sort of

[01:08:58] the old establishment, right?

[01:09:00] So they're probably sticking around.

[01:09:02] It's kind of like they were like the millennials of their generation.

[01:09:05] They, well, yeah, the designers were the newer designer.

[01:09:08] I mean, Brian Eddie had been there as a programmer for years, but yeah.

[01:09:12] So the next game, this is champion pub.

[01:09:17] It's like a whole, it's a whole thing.

[01:09:18] So it's like a boxer fighter novelty sports thing.

[01:09:23] Yeah.

[01:09:24] It's a WPC 95.

[01:09:26] It's from April of 1998.

[01:09:30] It is a solid state, of course.

[01:09:33] It sells 1,369 units.

[01:09:37] The concept is is done by Pete Proewski, art by Paul Barker, Linda Deel, got sound

[01:09:46] and music by Rich Carle and software by Dwight Sullivan.

[01:09:50] And we could see on this game, who are these people?

[01:09:55] You know what I mean?

[01:09:56] Like, we'll get, you know, a deeper dive into these folks some other time will be bump

[01:10:00] into them.

[01:10:01] But this is very much the symptom of the time at Williams where you're like, oh my God,

[01:10:06] it's 1998.

[01:10:07] And there's these people that we've never heard of that are making games.

[01:10:11] One of the greatest quotes of all time is from Zach Manny of the pinball show and

[01:10:17] straight down the middle of pinball show.

[01:10:20] He called this a novelty game in which Dwight Sullivan's brain exploded.

[01:10:25] Can you explain why some people call this a novelty game?

[01:10:28] Well, it has, it has the boxer that you can actually hit and it has little mini rams

[01:10:34] in front.

[01:10:35] So you can hit him in the face, which is cool.

[01:10:38] And it has a, it has a lot of cool, it has a super cool jump rope toy.

[01:10:43] So you can just jump rope.

[01:10:44] You hit the flipper buttons and jump up as the rope goes around.

[01:10:48] It has a speed bag toy.

[01:10:50] There's a lot of toys, but it's very repetitive though.

[01:10:54] You basically train and then you fight and then you train and then you fight.

[01:10:58] And each boxer is a different character.

[01:11:02] At least one of them is not allowed anymore.

[01:11:04] He's censored out of most versions of it.

[01:11:07] So like it's, it's kind of unique and different.

[01:11:10] And Mike M. from Facebook would say, as shallow as champion pub is, I love the game.

[01:11:17] Definitely a little too gimmicky at times with the training mix, but the callouts and music

[01:11:21] are just incredible.

[01:11:23] Valley Williams really went out of their way to try something different.

[01:11:27] Could this be the greatest bash toy of all time?

[01:11:30] Speaking of course of the, the boxer in the middle.

[01:11:33] So the idea is that you shoot up to the boxer who's turned around and you shoot up the

[01:11:38] ramps and you hit the bag, right?

[01:11:41] So it's like you're training to fight.

[01:11:43] So you're hitting the speed bag.

[01:11:44] Then the guy turns around and then you fight him, right?

[01:11:47] It's kind of cool.

[01:11:48] It is cool.

[01:11:49] It's one of the most mispronounced game names ever.

[01:11:52] Most people call it a championship pub.

[01:11:54] It's like, no, it's the champion pub.

[01:11:56] No one ever says the name of the game, right?

[01:11:58] The jackpot callouts are hilarious because it just doesn't have jackpots.

[01:12:01] It has double, triple, quintuple, sex tuple of cow of a, there's like at least 10 different

[01:12:09] jackpot callouts of different terms.

[01:12:11] Yeah, it's got the Dwight Sullivan complexity.

[01:12:14] And it's one of the two games that Williams did at the end where they used real backlasses

[01:12:19] for whatever reason.

[01:12:20] Instead of a translate, this and no good gofers have real backlasses for whatever reason.

[01:12:26] It's got this mech, a jump rope mech in the back left of the game.

[01:12:30] So you kind of go up and the ball gets diverted in there and it sits like a plunger or something

[01:12:35] right?

[01:12:36] Yeah, it's, that's a magnet.

[01:12:37] It gets caught right on the magnet and it pulses, it pulses the magnet as the little rope spins

[01:12:42] which is like a little metal thing.

[01:12:44] And you, you are doing the magnet pulsing.

[01:12:47] So every time the rope comes around, you want to hit the button, the flipper button.

[01:12:50] So the ball goes up in the air just like you're jumping rope.

[01:12:53] And then it's got a speed bag, Mac, in the, in the, in the right back hole.

[01:12:59] Think of Congo, but way smaller and you hit a bag.

[01:13:02] So you get the ball up there and it's got little hands and the left and right hand hits

[01:13:07] the ball into the bag.

[01:13:08] Is that right?

[01:13:09] Yep.

[01:13:10] And the jump rope one is super cool because if it gets faster and faster and the game will

[01:13:14] do call outs, it'll just start going, it starts counting.

[01:13:17] Three, four, five, six, seven.

[01:13:20] It gets more excited the more times you can jump.

[01:13:23] So like, I mean, in a nutshell, it's kind of a neat kind of concept fun game, but like

[01:13:28] you said, it gets kind of, it gets repetitive.

[01:13:31] It's the ultimate gimmick game that gets repetitive.

[01:13:33] Okay.

[01:13:34] But you would say it's gimmick in comparison to most gimmicks, pretty darn good.

[01:13:37] All the gimmicks, the toys are awesome.

[01:13:39] Yeah.

[01:13:40] If you don't want awesome, you know, stern code, this is what you get.

[01:13:43] You get a bunch of necks and nothing.

[01:13:45] Yeah, it's cool.

[01:13:46] I haven't played a champion.

[01:13:47] I have played it in the pinball arcade, the digital version, which isn't real pinball.

[01:13:52] And it's kind of fun.

[01:13:54] There is some pretty cool stuff here on the back glass.

[01:13:56] So if you go to the, if you go to the internet pinball database, you go to the champion pub

[01:14:03] page, you can look at the pictures and you can bring up a picture of the back glass.

[01:14:08] And then you can look at it.

[01:14:10] And it's super fun because everybody in there is somebody at Williams.

[01:14:16] And this is the kind of stuff that I love with pinball is all of this silly stuff.

[01:14:20] And I'll go through a couple of the names that are on there.

[01:14:24] So there's a man with a go tee and a bowler hat.

[01:14:29] Second to the left.

[01:14:30] That's Dwight Sullivan.

[01:14:32] He's watching the fight here, the old, tiny fight.

[01:14:36] There's a person with eye glasses next to him.

[01:14:40] That is a person, but I couldn't find out who that is.

[01:14:42] That's somebody from there.

[01:14:44] There's a shorter man in suspenders and a cap who's in front of Dwight.

[01:14:51] That person is Pete Perowski.

[01:14:53] The blonde lady with her arm raised, that's the person next to the person in the glasses

[01:15:01] with her arm raised.

[01:15:02] That's Linda Diel, who did the art on the game.

[01:15:05] And don't forget, there's Steve Cordeck right in the front.

[01:15:07] That's why I always see.

[01:15:08] Yeah, Steve Cordeck is the older gentleman with the money in his hand turning around

[01:15:13] and looking at the player.

[01:15:14] That's Steve Cordeck and of course the legend that is Steve Cordeck.

[01:15:18] We've got Brad Cornell, who is an individual that worked there.

[01:15:22] And he's right above the blonde boxer's arm on the right side.

[01:15:27] Rich Carl, who was the sound engineer.

[01:15:30] He's the person with the black hair, who's kind of profile next to the server.

[01:15:36] It's kind of fun that they had some of this stuff.

[01:15:39] The funniest part is that there is a fly on the bar next to the individual taking the

[01:15:46] photo on the left side.

[01:15:50] And bar fly is said to be Jim Patla.

[01:15:54] There you go.

[01:15:55] Now you know.

[01:15:56] So this brings us into the dark days at Williams, right?

[01:15:59] We were already there at that point for the last few years.

[01:16:02] Yeah, once you get to champion pub, it's kind of, that's kind of it, right?

[01:16:05] We were there a few years before.

[01:16:07] For years, about every three months, there would be layoffs at Williams.

[01:16:11] You know, usually when you're coming up on the quarter, the suits and the accountants

[01:16:16] are looking at the numbers and they're saying, all right, what are we doing here?

[01:16:19] And of course, every three months, there were layoffs.

[01:16:22] And of course, the whole industry started to decline in 94 and 95.

[01:16:27] You know, that would be pretty stressful.

[01:16:28] I had friends that worked in Blackberry in Kitchener Waterloo here in Canada.

[01:16:34] And they went through the same thing for a three year period where that sort of post

[01:16:38] iPhone, you know, collapse of Blackberry, who was like a crown jewel in Canadian technology.

[01:16:45] And every three months, there would be rounds of cuts.

[01:16:48] And the stress on my friend's face was not something that I, that I envied.

[01:16:52] At Dwight says, the layoffs were like vomiting.

[01:16:55] So gut-wrenchingly painful as it's happening, but afterwards you feel better.

[01:16:59] You think that sucked, but maybe it's over now.

[01:17:01] Maybe things will get better from here.

[01:17:02] You force yourself to have faith in the leadership of the company.

[01:17:05] That's what kind of brings us into that pinball 2000 time.

[01:17:09] And Dwight had some work on pinball 2000, but this was really more or less the brain child

[01:17:15] of the design team there, which was Pat Lawler and George Gomez.

[01:17:20] And then the peripheral of the design teams working off of the platform.

[01:17:25] But Dwight says, while I had very little to do with pinball 2000 designers, OS,

[01:17:29] I worked harder in Revenge for Mars than any other game previous.

[01:17:33] Revenge for Mars sold well two to three times more than any recent game.

[01:17:37] I've never played Revenge for Mars.

[01:17:39] I've played Star Wars, which is Star Wars episode one, which has just got awful.

[01:17:44] Revenge for Mars.

[01:17:46] You shoot up the middle.

[01:17:46] Yeah.

[01:17:47] So it's okay.

[01:17:49] So it's still not that great either.

[01:17:50] The play, it's funner to shoot, I think.

[01:17:54] That's an opinion.

[01:17:55] At pinball expo 99, pinball 2000 had been released.

[01:17:59] It was going fairly well for the most part.

[01:18:02] I think probably better than people had expected.

[01:18:05] It was October 21st through the 24th in Chicago.

[01:18:09] And what is pinball expo for those who don't know?

[01:18:11] It is the yearly big pinball show.

[01:18:14] For years, it was the main pinball show because it's actually in Chicago.

[01:18:18] So you are in the heart of pinball.

[01:18:20] They've been having it every year since 1985.

[01:18:24] Last year they had a virtual pinball expo.

[01:18:27] This year, hopefully, we'll be able to get back to the sort of the fall here.

[01:18:31] We'll be able to get back to things that are normal.

[01:18:33] But pinball expo has really had a massive resurgence.

[01:18:36] A lot of that has to do with the investment of the team.

[01:18:41] You can check them out at pinballexpo.net, bring up some of their information of all of

[01:18:45] the individuals that are involved in pinball expo.

[01:18:48] But it's because of their investment and their growth.

[01:18:50] It's really grown and become something very, very cool.

[01:18:55] But back then, it was a sad time around 99, right?

[01:18:59] Because it was about to be a very sad time.

[01:19:02] It seems like whenever some major thing happens in pinball, it's like right after expo.

[01:19:08] In 1998, right after that expo, Stern fired a bunch of people.

[01:19:15] Well, 1999 was the big one.

[01:19:18] Pinball expo in 99 that was held on a weekend, October the 21st through the 24th.

[01:19:25] That's when Dwight would say, when I arrived to work on October the 25th, the Monday following

[01:19:30] expo, I learned that Williams laid off the entire pinball department.

[01:19:35] This was over 400 people, including 45 engineers.

[01:19:39] I was devastated.

[01:19:41] Yep.

[01:19:42] And at that expo, which was right before, they had a whole presentation on pinball 2000 and

[01:19:46] George Gomez did.

[01:19:47] So it's like nobody.

[01:19:49] I think there were there were ankleings that something was going to happen.

[01:19:53] Gomez kind of knew, but it was the next that next day right after expo.

[01:19:57] You can actually see the presentation on pinball expo by George Gomez on YouTube.

[01:20:01] Yep.

[01:20:02] So you remember that Star Trek door, right?

[01:20:03] We were talking about it.

[01:20:04] And where you put a, put car space all over it.

[01:20:08] Exactly.

[01:20:09] So Dwight would say many of us were still gathering and boxing up our stuff.

[01:20:13] Ken Fideszna in passing and I'm sure half jokingly said Dwight, I'm surprised that you

[01:20:19] didn't take your door with you.

[01:20:21] Well I took that to mean I had permission.

[01:20:24] So I told the story to Jim Patler, who also agreed it must mean that I had permission

[01:20:28] and Jim gave me a property pass so I could go get the door out of the building.

[01:20:34] So Dwight Sullivan went back to his office, took the door off the hinges his Star Trek

[01:20:39] door and took it home.

[01:20:41] This door is still in Dwight's basement today.

[01:20:45] Got a picture of that door in the show notes if you want to see it.

[01:20:48] Actually, let's see the door.

[01:20:49] There's a high speed that he sold.

[01:20:51] Yeah, there's so in the background you can see his games.

[01:20:53] There's this who done it.

[01:20:54] He's got all his games.

[01:20:55] Yeah.

[01:20:56] Super cool.

[01:20:57] So that's in the show notes.

[01:20:58] It's kind of weird, but cool, I guess.

[01:21:00] So by the way, which I think is pretty funny, in this picture you can see Dwight's basement.

[01:21:06] And through 2020 Dwight did a lot of basement sort of zoom or Skype calls on reveals of video

[01:21:16] games or reveals of pinball machines like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[01:21:21] I don't think he's finished his basement.

[01:21:23] I think I think he still has an unfinished basement down there with the same look.

[01:21:29] So if you know if Dwight has finished his basement since this picture was taken, send

[01:21:34] us an email at silverballcracklesachemail.com.

[01:21:37] I know why basement isn't finished.

[01:21:38] Are you going to look down on me for my unfinished basement?

[01:21:42] The thing it really sucked is after they fired everyone, they made everyone interview

[01:21:46] if they wanted to stay at Williams in Midway, which was their video game department.

[01:21:51] God, that's horrible, isn't it?

[01:21:53] That's pretty rude.

[01:21:54] So the staff, if you wanted to stay at Midway, you said you had to do an interview and Dwight

[01:21:59] wasn't sure if he wanted to make games anymore, right?

[01:22:02] At that point, you're pretty defeated.

[01:22:04] Every three months you feel like you're going to just be slaughtered and then all of a sudden

[01:22:07] one day you come in and they let us all go and they didn't tell us and we went to Expo

[01:22:11] and pitched the product and seemed like a bunch of idiots.

[01:22:14] And especially for a Williams sister company, right?

[01:22:17] Like do you really want to still work for the people that just freaking pulled the rug

[01:22:20] out from underneath you?

[01:22:22] So headhunters, they would start calling and get a couple of interviews here or there

[01:22:27] for Dwight.

[01:22:29] And several of the teams are all competing for the same positions, right?

[01:22:34] So you've got all those, like 450 people and let's assume most of the design teams are

[01:22:42] all sort of looking for the same jobs that basically Sega Stern or some of the other novelty

[01:22:49] games at the time.

[01:22:50] So several of the teams actually heard of a fellow fairly well known, Gene Cunningham,

[01:22:56] who was planning to start his new pinball company from the ashes of Williams.

[01:22:59] And who was Gene Cunningham?

[01:23:00] He's the guy that bought all the rights to Williams.

[01:23:03] Yeah, he bought all the, he bought the, he bought the, he was, he bought the scraps.

[01:23:06] He was, he was the vulture.

[01:23:07] Yeah, warehouse is full of all their parts, the diagrams, pictures, all the cats, everything,

[01:23:15] everything.

[01:23:16] There's a whole, a whole episode behind the end of Williams.

[01:23:19] I mean, you had Roger Sharp try to get a group together to buy the rights you had with

[01:23:26] their German distributor who I can never remember their name.

[01:23:28] It's like a one word name.

[01:23:29] There was talks about them maybe buying.

[01:23:32] Hickle Groober?

[01:23:33] Yeah, no, buying, you know, buying the Williams pinball division.

[01:23:38] So there was a, there was a whole thing there that could be talked about.

[01:23:42] That's an episode in itself.

[01:23:44] And Dwight would say for a short while, this prospect seemed very interesting and yet

[01:23:48] scary.

[01:23:50] So through a good friend who was Cameron Silver, Dwight learned that Lonnie Robb who

[01:23:56] was working at Stern was looking for individuals to do some programming.

[01:24:01] So of course, there's this huge influx of talent looking for jobs and Stern really can have

[01:24:05] the pick of, of the best of the best, right?

[01:24:08] If they could pick from anybody there, they could pick the only ones that they really wanted.

[01:24:12] So Dwight called Lonnie and he interviewed over the phone and he had a lot to say and a

[01:24:17] lot to talk about.

[01:24:18] Lonnie asked Dwight to come in for an interview for a formal interview the following week.

[01:24:23] So after that phone interview on Sunday, Dwight says he drove down and meet with Jean,

[01:24:29] Jean cutting him.

[01:24:30] On the way back, I was torn about how I felt.

[01:24:31] It seemed too good with lots of unanswered questions.

[01:24:34] On Monday, I put on my one suit and gathered my letters of recommendations from Larry

[01:24:38] to Mar and Ted Estes and I went in for an interview with Lonnie and Gary Stern and went

[01:24:43] really well.

[01:24:44] I was confident that they would make me an offer.

[01:24:46] The Jean cutting hand plan turned south.

[01:24:48] I think I dodged a bullet there.

[01:24:49] He did.

[01:24:50] In the end, my only real choice was to work for Midway and learn how to do video games or

[01:24:54] work for Stern doing what I've been doing for 10 years.

[01:24:57] So Dwight began working for Stern pinball at the end of November 1999.

[01:25:01] So during this sort of Jean cutting hand starting up his company thing, you know, Pat

[01:25:06] Lawler designs had conversations with Jean cutting him.

[01:25:10] I believe in the car ride that Sunday with Dwight was also Keith Johnson, who of course

[01:25:18] would be a programmer at Stern later on as well.

[01:25:21] And you know, there was a lot of flux going on at the time, but Stern picked up who they

[01:25:25] thought was the best of the best.

[01:25:26] And I guess Dwight was considered to be one of those.

[01:25:29] So the industry was on shaky ground, but Dwight was able to find a foothold at Stern pinball

[01:25:33] incorporated.

[01:25:35] His early career was loaded with some of the highest pinball sellers of all time and the

[01:25:40] most complex rules ever and some of the most beloved themes.

[01:25:44] This was a great start to a legendary career.

[01:25:48] And I'm excited to get on to our next bit with Dwight Sullivan, which is when he moves

[01:25:54] into Stern.

[01:25:55] Well, he moves into Stern and then he leaves Stern and then he comes back to Stern and

[01:26:00] then he goes on the upswing.

[01:26:03] As Dwight said, he thought this was quite humorous, the fact that since 1989, he's worked

[01:26:10] for the same two companies.

[01:26:12] It's either been W Williams, WMS industries or Stern.

[01:26:17] Yeah, Dwight is one of my favorite programmers.

[01:26:22] And like you, I enjoy the quote unquote cliche moments, but I enjoy the way that he does things

[01:26:31] wonderful, wonderful beginning to a start of a career, a lot of fun, little interesting

[01:26:36] stories with the creation of complexity, Dwight Sullivan.

[01:26:39] Do you have anything else you want to add before we zip out here?

[01:26:43] Nah, I can't wait to see what he's got next.

[01:26:45] He's still going strong.

[01:26:47] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles last year.

[01:26:49] Yeah, there's going to be a lot of fun, I think, coming up.

[01:26:52] And should we tell them what we're going to do on the next episode, Ron?

[01:26:56] What are we doing?

[01:26:58] You can tell me?

[01:27:00] How about we dive into Barry Hooster?

[01:27:03] So it's time for me to do the outro?

[01:28:27] While we were at the second show selling the getaway, Larry Demar noticed one of the

[01:28:40] large Las Vegas strip signs strip signs.

[01:28:43] Las Vegas strip signs.

[01:28:44] Okay, let me try it again.

[01:28:45] That's like a strip sign.
