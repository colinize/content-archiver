[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:07] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:15] Oh, I see crusty, very good.

[00:17] Yes.

[00:18] See that?

[00:19] Yes.

[00:20] Very good.

[00:21] I got crusty and I got the delorean.

[00:25] It's you, you got a delorean over there yet.

[00:28] I got this is my, when I host my like digital meetings with clients.

[00:33] I got my Iron Man comic there and I got the death of the green goblin from amazing spider

[00:40] man right there.

[00:58] Hello, everyone.

[01:05] I'm David Dennis and this is episode 25 of Silver Ball Chronicles.

[01:17] A pinball history podcast with me every month is my co host Ron the gracious.

[01:25] What's up, fella?

[01:27] Yo.

[01:28] Hey, hey, I wanted to say thank you for being a gracious host for letting me and my wife

[01:35] hang out at level zero and completely dominate you in tournament play.

[01:43] It was wonderful.

[01:44] Thank you so much for being so gracious Ron.

[01:47] No problem.

[01:48] It's an honor to lose to you if that had actually happened.

[01:51] Level zero is an amazing arcade that you have in your basement and it was a loads of fun

[01:58] to meet finally in person that people can see that you and I are indeed different people.

[02:04] But the greatest part of that was the stream that we did with both yourself, me, and then

[02:12] eventually stew showed up.

[02:14] The world famous stew, Mick Vickery.

[02:16] Yes, the 1978 Playboy launch party champion showed up.

[02:19] And you beat him in a game.

[02:22] I did.

[02:23] Yes, sir.

[02:24] We did actually take a series of urine samples before this because it is a highly competitive

[02:30] arena.

[02:31] Those samples were sent away.

[02:33] Dennis Kreisel for a taste test.

[02:36] And yours came back inconclusive.

[02:40] So we can't count yours as a win, unfortunately.

[02:45] I got nothing.

[02:46] That's the rules.

[02:47] Yeah.

[02:48] Now, Pintastic was my first actual show, my first real actual big show.

[02:54] I did seriously enjoy myself.

[02:56] I met some great people.

[02:58] So I met a lot of really great podcasters.

[03:01] The back box crew was there.

[03:03] They were really lovely.

[03:05] We, of course, would see a resurgence of the pinball players podcast with Jeff and Joe

[03:15] Lamir.

[03:16] It was really great to just see everybody and say hello, finally to meet everybody in person.

[03:21] And I met my hero, Raymond Davidson.

[03:25] Oh, and you got to see Rush.

[03:28] I got to see the limelight.

[03:31] Limelight.

[03:32] That's right.

[03:33] Yeah.

[03:34] They were, they were actually quite good.

[03:36] I was impressed.

[03:37] And as a Canadian, it played out well.

[03:40] And their singer said I'm more like Getty Lee than Getty Lee.

[03:42] Sounds like Getty Lee.

[03:43] It was impressive.

[03:44] I have to say very, very impressive loads of fun played some toy story, played a lot of

[03:48] games.

[03:49] I haven't played before.

[03:51] And I'll be able to add some of those to my checklist of games that I have actually played.

[03:56] So now I can get through it with all of this.

[03:59] And I want to have a shout out to all of the great listeners who popped by and said hello.

[04:06] Everybody was incredibly friendly.

[04:08] You just said hello.

[04:10] He just chatted a little bit of pinball here and there.

[04:12] It was really great.

[04:14] And big high to Rodney, who is also in the financial industry.

[04:18] He is a much bigger deal than I, but it was just really cool to talk pinball with him and

[04:23] talk a little industry.

[04:25] What a great show.

[04:26] I had a lot of fun.

[04:27] How about you, Ron?

[04:28] Yeah.

[04:29] It's a good show.

[04:30] It's always a good show.

[04:31] I love Fantastic.

[04:32] I finished 90th out of 181.

[04:35] I'm incredibly impressed.

[04:36] And now David, thanks for the shirts.

[04:39] Yes, of course.

[04:40] And if you passed out a few shirts, a couple people bought some shirts while I was down

[04:44] there.

[04:45] And now they are very warm.

[04:48] Wait a minute.

[04:49] They bought shirts.

[04:50] That means you were in violation of what's that thing that you're in violation of?

[04:55] Cross-border, green card stuff.

[04:58] Yeah, that thing.

[04:59] Yeah, no, no, no.

[05:00] What they did is they bought shirts.

[05:02] They paid on the website and the website shipped it to them.

[05:06] Oh, okay.

[05:07] That's fine.

[05:08] Sell any physical shirts.

[05:09] I wouldn't want you to get in trouble at NAFTA.

[05:12] That's what it is.

[05:13] Yes, that's, yeah, we don't want any NAFTA violations.

[05:16] Certainly.

[05:17] That would be bad.

[05:18] Social media, you can connect with us a variety of ways.

[05:21] The best way is over at facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[05:26] That's where we post up a lot of things.

[05:28] Recently we started every now and then when I'll get ready to promote an episode or get

[05:33] ready to record.

[05:35] I'll kind of ask, hey, what are your thoughts about?

[05:37] You know, this designer, this era of game and then we take that information.

[05:42] We try to toss it into the episode.

[05:46] Check us out on silverballcronicles.com.

[05:48] If you want to see the archive, I have a list of all of the episodes there.

[05:51] So if you're like, oh, I really want to go back and hear the Steve Richie episode or

[05:56] the Dwight Sullivan episode, feel free to go to silver ball chronicles or search for silver

[06:01] ball chronicles in your pod catcher to get the direct feed and access the archive.

[06:07] You can always jump over to this week in pinball.com.

[06:10] Give us a five star review on their pinball promoters database.

[06:14] We don't have any new reviews up there yet, but come on folks toss in over and we'll read

[06:19] them out online because I always enjoy feeding my ego.

[06:25] This week Ron, we're going to jump into a topic which is surprisingly always asked for

[06:34] over and over and over again.

[06:37] We get more comments.

[06:38] I've no idea why.

[06:39] We get more comments on, hey, when are you going to do a got leave episode or why don't you

[06:43] guys talk about got leave a little more.

[06:45] It's like my God.

[06:47] Everybody just wants to hear Valley Williams, man.

[06:49] Nobody wants to hear about got leave, but we get more messages about that.

[06:53] Isn't that right?

[06:54] The Cadillac of the industry.

[06:56] So I made sure that I wrote to our cronies online at Facebook.com slash silverball chronicles.

[07:03] And I said, do you have any comments about pre 1984 got leave the system 80 and we got

[07:10] some serious, serious, positive and oddly weird comments about some of the cool stuff in

[07:19] that era.

[07:21] So the late 70s were a boon for pinball manufacturing.

[07:26] Valley and Williams had transitioned to solid state early and had evolved their platform

[07:32] many, many times got leave with their system one had struggled right out of the gate.

[07:40] But by early 1980 got leave knew they needed a new solution and they were preparing the

[07:47] new system 80 platform because Ron the 80s were the future.

[07:55] The future and to be fair, even on their system one platform, some of their initial games

[08:00] did sell very well.

[08:01] They sold astronomically well.

[08:04] So if we just sort of recap system one, we have a system one episode which we titled stepping

[08:10] on rakes.

[08:11] I think we're talking like episode four or five back back in the archive.

[08:15] It's a good listen because it adds a lot of context as to kind of why they struggled through

[08:20] that time to just put it in a nutshell.

[08:25] The manufacturers like Valley and Williams into some extent stern electronics what they

[08:29] had done is created their own platform in house.

[08:33] They made their own boards and they designed it around pinball where got leave outsourced

[08:41] the development of those electronics to an outside company.

[08:46] The Valley and Williams came up with their own sets and then stern ripped off ballies

[08:49] board set.

[08:50] Yeah, yeah, famously, which then again they would do again, which you can hear about in

[08:54] our last episode.

[08:57] That system one system, although it was very, very good.

[09:00] They basically took the EM formula and gave it to what was that company called Rockwell

[09:07] industry.

[09:08] Thank you.

[09:09] They gave it to Rockwell industries and they said, hey, we need to make a board system,

[09:12] electronic solid state system that does this and Rockwell was known for making like board

[09:17] sets for fighter planes and like big time tech industry like they were a manufacturer.

[09:23] But you're in tech or in IT, Ron and you know that when you're given a requirements document,

[09:30] you get exactly that.

[09:33] You get if you left something out of the requirements or you said you left out a part where like we

[09:38] want to be able to add on to the system or add more or make it easier to work on.

[09:42] If you left that out, you're not getting that.

[09:44] You're getting exactly what you asked for and they got and you can see in those first

[09:49] system one games, a fantastic EM based, you know, solid system one system.

[09:55] Didn't they?

[09:56] It was solid.

[09:57] All right.

[09:58] Now by 77, this is kind of when that transition was happening, there was a significant change

[10:02] in the got leave ownership and that's when they were sold to Columbia pictures.

[10:09] The statue of Liberty lady holding the thing for the movies, right?

[10:15] That was the big deal.

[10:16] They wanted to get into point off because it was movies and movie theaters and entertainment.

[10:24] So that's when they acquired got leave from the got leave family, DeGot leave and co.

[10:31] So why did they need a new system?

[10:35] What was the big deal, Ron?

[10:36] They sold a boat load of countdowns.

[10:40] They sold just an absolute mega load of sinbed at like 10,000 units.

[10:47] Everything seems to be working fine.

[10:49] Why did they need to transition to system 80 from somewhere around like the late 70s?

[10:56] What was happening?

[10:57] They got to keep up with Williams and Valley.

[10:59] Yeah, they started to fall behind.

[11:01] What was Williams and Valley doing in the late 70s to their board sets?

[11:05] While they're making games like Flash with continuous background sound, games like Gorgar,

[11:09] that talk.

[11:10] Oh, man.

[11:12] That must have been something else.

[11:14] Instead of the dinging and the binging, it like talked to you, that must have been mind-boggling.

[11:18] That's why the 80s were the future, Ron.

[11:20] The 80s were definitely the future.

[11:23] Flip up headlights?

[11:24] You remember flip up headlights, right?

[11:25] Don't they still exist?

[11:27] They, well, some cars, but man, oh man, they were like, if your car was aerodynamic and

[11:33] sleek and it was like a jet because it had flip up headlights like a Corvette or a Miata

[11:37] or something.

[11:39] What a stupid idea.

[11:40] Anywho, the new platform would provide more functionality.

[11:45] It would allow more solenoids.

[11:47] It would allow more lighting, more lamps, I guess.

[11:50] It would have more switches.

[11:52] There would be attract lighting.

[11:53] There would be light shows, you know, a strobing high-scored a date or a third coin slot.

[12:00] It would add more functionality.

[12:03] But bali and Williams had been doing is slowly adding and tweaking that functionality to their

[12:09] board sets.

[12:10] In technology, you know, a year is like forever.

[12:13] So every so often, bali and Williams would add a new board or they would change something

[12:18] or they would add a speech cable onto a daughter board or something, but godly was falling

[12:23] away behind.

[12:25] By the late 70s, those 10,000 sales numbers that they would receive on like Sinbad or Cleopatra

[12:32] had dropped to like 2000 units, which was terrifying.

[12:37] Now originally, like we mentioned before, they went with Rockwell Industries with System

[12:42] 1.

[12:43] And that was again not the best decision because they were an outside company.

[12:47] They didn't know pinball.

[12:48] They didn't know where they wanted to take pinball.

[12:50] Williams and bali, they did theirs in house.

[12:52] So godly for their system, 80 platform, they went with who run Rockwell Industries.

[12:58] Oh god.

[12:59] Why?

[13:00] Why?

[13:01] They didn't work out the first time.

[13:02] Why would they go again?

[13:04] I guess it's because maybe the leadership at godly, like I love to speculate.

[13:09] So let's speculate a little.

[13:10] Let's get into speculation corner.

[13:15] This is where I would put music if I had the editing skills for that.

[13:18] Do you think it's because the leadership at godly realize that they are not an electronics

[13:24] company that they're a pinball manufacturer and they just want an expert to do it?

[13:28] I could go with that.

[13:30] Do you think it's because the leadership at godly at the time were like EM engineers

[13:36] and they just didn't understand the technology?

[13:38] I think there was some degree of overconfidence there.

[13:41] We are the Cadillac of the industry, our games are the best.

[13:45] And there was initial reluctance to do solid state.

[13:49] That's why a lot of even amongst all the manufacturers, that's why a lot of the first

[13:53] ones would still have chimes in them, even though they are electronic because they are

[13:56] worried if they didn't have chimes.

[13:59] And it would be turned off by that.

[14:01] Yeah, they missed the dingy.

[14:04] The Pavlov's dog.

[14:07] Some of them would literally have like a reel that would run in there.

[14:09] So if you hit a spinner or something, you could hear that sound.

[14:13] It is pretty awesome.

[14:14] I'm not going to lie.

[14:15] EM noises are pretty great, but it's a different, it's like a different breed of horse,

[14:19] right?

[14:20] It's still a horse.

[14:21] It's just different.

[14:22] It's different, right?

[14:23] And it's okay being different and it's okay trying something new.

[14:25] I mean, I guess with System 80, their thought was probably something more along the lines

[14:32] of, let's add what people want.

[14:35] They want some speech or noises or more lamps or more switches.

[14:39] We're not going to deviate too far from System 1.

[14:43] Even though it is a big leap in technology, I think they leapfrogged Bally and Williams

[14:48] at the time, but not for very long.

[14:51] And then they would have to sort of adapt the System 80 board set.

[14:54] Look at it that little further, but it's a little more modular this time.

[14:57] I think it's a little more easier to make changes to it, which is probably something that

[15:02] they put in the requirements.

[15:04] So the first System 80 game was the incredible Hulk, but that was actually a System 1.

[15:11] So the incredible Hulk was Model 500.

[15:14] And according to IBDB, there are four known examples held by collectors out there somewhere

[15:24] of System 80 versions of the incredible Hulk.

[15:29] There is an email exchange and a discussion around Hulk number 500 back from 2008 on IBDB,

[15:41] IBDB if you want to dive deeper into that.

[15:43] Hulk Model 500 makes it sound like it's the 500th game.

[15:47] Right, yes, the Model 500.

[15:50] There's about probably four or fewer, very fancy, super expensive elite, really terrible

[15:59] games that might be worth a lot of money.

[16:02] Oh, they're green.

[16:04] The Hulk is beautiful to look at, but it is terrible, terrible, terrible.

[16:09] We talk about that in our System 1 episode.

[16:14] I would put that back last and I would put that play field on my wall.

[16:20] I'm a big comic book fan and I would love to have one of those and just never play it

[16:26] because it's terrible.

[16:27] Which brings us to the actual first production System 80 game, the amazing Spider-Man, which

[16:36] is the Marvel superhero comic licensed theme from May of 1980.

[16:43] This is a wide body pin.

[16:46] It sells 7,625 units.

[16:49] It is designed by Ed Khrinsky, the legend, art by Gordon Morrison, who is from ad posters.

[16:58] He was an outsourced, you know, him and Ed worked for years and years and years together.

[17:03] The sound and software is on on credited.

[17:08] So first things first, what is your initial impression of the amazing Spider-Man?

[17:16] It looks really cool and it's wide.

[17:19] It's gorgeous.

[17:20] Absolutely gorgeous.

[17:23] They want the comic book, comic book art.

[17:27] Interesting thing about Hulk, I think at the time that game was released, the TV show

[17:31] was out.

[17:32] Yeah.

[17:33] But they went for the comic book style.

[17:36] Like if you look at other games like when Superman was out, the movie was out, but they

[17:40] went for the comic book style.

[17:43] And that kind of goes to present day.

[17:47] Sometimes that happens.

[17:48] When you look at things like an Avengers End Game, there's a movie but we go for the comic

[17:53] book version.

[17:54] Yeah, you tie it in.

[17:55] Yeah, over like 30 years, this has been a thing that continues.

[17:59] It's loose enough that you're going to get the name recognition.

[18:03] You're going to get the emotional response, but you're not going to have to deal with all

[18:07] the issues, especially in the modern day of LCD animations and using video assets and rights

[18:15] for actors and voice.

[18:17] And you're not getting into all that stuff.

[18:18] You're getting into enough of it that you get kind of the response you want.

[18:23] And the amazing Spider-Man based on the legendary comic book character, it is gorgeous.

[18:32] Immediately you look at it, you're like, man, that looks great.

[18:35] I'm going to play that game.

[18:36] And then you're disappointed, but we'll get into that in a moment.

[18:41] What do you think of this flyer?

[18:42] So this is the first system 80 game.

[18:45] So now they're going to start it with new branding, right?

[18:47] They're going to start it on new branding on their new platform.

[18:50] Yep, you know that it's the number one in Gottlieb.

[18:54] It's a new decade of stars, the star series star 80.

[19:01] It's the Gottlieb star series 80.

[19:05] They are all in on the marketing and branding here because they got to, you know, they realize

[19:09] hey, we're changing it up.

[19:11] Things are getting big, big deal, big changes.

[19:15] So on IPDB, one of the best parts are the flyers.

[19:21] Each manufacturer has a different way of spinning what they have.

[19:27] Games is all about puns and gameplay and innovation in the last episode during the

[19:35] data East days.

[19:36] You can tell it's all about how different it is, how reliable it is, the new innovation,

[19:43] you know, cheap and easy to maintain.

[19:48] Gottlieb is all about it's a tank.

[19:49] It's Gottlieb.

[19:50] You know what you're getting.

[19:52] No puns, but a hilarious amount of branding.

[19:57] Man, they're branding the whole 80 thing.

[20:00] The 80s are the future.

[20:01] They know that and man, they are beating it to death on the second page of this.

[20:07] Yeah, I never heard this one.

[20:08] So it says it's system 80, which it is, the board set, but it's also dimension 80, which

[20:14] is the actual play field size.

[20:15] They're giving it a name.

[20:17] It's they, it is, we're changing it up.

[20:20] We're shaking it up.

[20:21] And it's a wide body.

[20:24] Augmented game with a brain memory.

[20:26] Game with a brain, game with a brain memory.

[20:29] New play field size design for ultimate in pinball action, which is the wide body.

[20:35] Unique ear level sound through Gottlieb's sound projector sound projector.

[20:41] Nice name for a speaker, but yeah.

[20:43] New attract sound and sight modes with sequenced flashing play field lights.

[20:49] It's so exciting.

[20:50] Actually, sequented.

[20:51] I don't know if I've ever heard that.

[20:53] New play field, sequented flashing play field lights, new high powered individually controlled

[21:00] pop bumpers, new light box design with easy access insert expanded 15 step bookkeeping

[21:08] system with automatic percentages and game time averaging.

[21:13] Very nice.

[21:14] I want to buy this now.

[21:17] More appropriate theme for Gottlieb's first star series 80 game.

[21:22] Marvel comics universally recognized adventure character spider man trademark.

[21:29] Wow.

[21:30] They're oversellin it.

[21:34] You can never over sell anything.

[21:37] It's they're all in star series 80 system 80 dimension 80 the 80s right.

[21:46] We're in a new decade.

[21:48] We're moving on.

[21:49] The 80s are here.

[21:51] Disco is dead.

[21:52] Let's roll.

[21:54] But it's going to be designed by somebody who got most of the accolades of the 60s and

[22:00] 70s in Ed Kinsky.

[22:02] So 7,000 years though.

[22:04] It did.

[22:05] This was among the last original games designed by Ed Kinsky.

[22:11] So he would design a couple of really quick games kind of around this era.

[22:15] And then he would more or less bow out of game design.

[22:19] Most of the later games in the system 80 era that are attached to Ed Kinsky's names

[22:26] are actually solid state system 80 adaptations of previously released games.

[22:34] His most recent best sellers around this time were countdown, which is a awesome game.

[22:41] 9,900 units and solar ride.

[22:45] If you're the kind of person like me who loves a good very target at 8,800 units.

[22:51] What do you think of dimension 80?

[22:54] A lot of stuff on it.

[22:55] There's a lot of stuff on it.

[22:57] More does not usually mean better.

[23:00] And this might be an example of that.

[23:03] You remember Atari's wide bodies right Ron?

[23:06] That's all of them because that's all they made or wide bodies.

[23:09] So Atari shows up in the late 70s and they're like, hey guys.

[23:14] We're giving you more stuff.

[23:16] We're going to change the game.

[23:18] We're going to jam pack more, more quote unquote toys into this game.

[23:24] We're going to have dropped targets and spinners and extra flippers and all directions and

[23:28] all that stuff.

[23:30] And the industry had kind of freaked out and we're concerned about that.

[23:35] Valley made wide bodies, Williams made wide bodies, Stern probably made the best version

[23:40] of wide bodies.

[23:43] That leap is now all in on wide bodies.

[23:46] They didn't just dip their toe and make three or four like Valley.

[23:49] We're going to see dimension 80 really take over the got leap portfolio.

[23:55] Ron, if you put five pounds of crap in a three pound bag, what do you get?

[24:01] Eight pounds.

[24:03] No, you get it.

[24:04] You get it.

[24:05] You get to wash your hands a lot.

[24:06] Okay.

[24:07] Because you got poo everywhere.

[24:08] A fun game, yes.

[24:11] But if ifs was a narrow body, I think it would be better.

[24:14] The opinions expressed by David Dennis or his own.

[24:16] What do you think?

[24:17] Do you think this is the wide body is where it's at with this game?

[24:21] It's no genie.

[24:22] That's true.

[24:23] It's not terrible.

[24:24] I mean, it doesn't have anything egregiously weird or crazy in it.

[24:28] They did not.

[24:29] Yeah.

[24:30] Ed Krisky was not a dry and weird stuff guy.

[24:32] He had kind of his tried and true kind of things that he would do.

[24:38] Like let's start top of the play field and work our way down.

[24:40] We'll talk about things that are odd but not crazy.

[24:44] So instead of having traditional roll overs on the top of your play field, like most

[24:51] traditional games where you shoot the ball up and it falls between some roll overs, this

[24:56] one has three sort of capture saucers.

[24:59] And then it has a piece of plastic and then it has like a roll over, star roll over.

[25:05] And then it has your regular kind of top lane roll overs with an A and B on it.

[25:10] It's actually pretty cool because it makes it really difficult to get up to that top

[25:16] of the play field and get into all of the various points.

[25:23] That looks cool.

[25:24] The game suffers from more of a software exploit than anything else which will make you

[25:29] ignore pretty much everything on this play field.

[25:32] Right.

[25:33] So you see this and you're like, okay, there's one, two, three,

[25:35] capture holes and there's A, B, roll overs and there's a light pop bumpers skill-ish shot

[25:41] to the roll over.

[25:43] You know, that's like, okay, yeah, this is cool.

[25:45] This is really great.

[25:46] Then it gets into the pop bumpers.

[25:48] Right's got two just perfectly, perfectly placed pop bumpers in the middle of the play field.

[25:55] It's got a set of five drop banks on the right side, a set of three drop targets on the

[26:01] left, an orbit spinner which is just, well, we'll get to that in a second.

[26:07] Five drop banks on the right.

[26:08] That's a lot of drop.

[26:09] Five, five targets.

[26:10] Five targets, not five banks.

[26:12] They've got a five bank.

[26:13] Yes, a five bank, if you will.

[26:17] Gotley makes the best drop targets in the industry.

[26:21] They feel good.

[26:22] They're reliable.

[26:23] They're super easy to clean, super easy to work on.

[26:27] They are quite literally the Cadillac when it comes to things like drop targets.

[26:32] I don't know if they're the easiest to work on, but they are the best.

[26:34] I thought they were pretty easy.

[26:36] It's just like one little plate.

[26:38] You pull it off.

[26:39] Well, the springs are kind of annoying.

[26:41] Yes.

[26:42] They're compared to some of the other drop banks.

[26:45] They could be a pain to work on.

[26:47] But they're the best drop targets in the industry right next to the worst spinner in the industry.

[26:52] All right.

[26:53] So we're getting pulled into the spinner here.

[26:56] The spinner, they still haven't made changes to this spinner.

[27:02] This is the same spinner from the system once.

[27:04] The plastic spinner.

[27:06] It just doesn't spin.

[27:07] No, it doesn't spin.

[27:09] That's the thing I don't get.

[27:10] What was the point?

[27:12] Everyone else uses the metal spinners.

[27:13] They use this plastic spinner.

[27:14] He hit it.

[27:15] It spins like three times.

[27:17] Three times.

[27:18] They had those metal spinners in the EM era and you'd hit those on an orbiter or something

[27:23] like that.

[27:24] You know, like, it was awesome.

[27:28] And to be fair, they will make up for this in the later era where they will go to the

[27:32] nicest sparkly, I call it the sparkle.

[27:35] Sparkle metal spinner that spins awesomely.

[27:38] But man, they had this period in the middle.

[27:40] I don't get it.

[27:41] And it wasn't just like two or three games and they're like, oh, this is not fun.

[27:45] It was like they ordered like a million of these and they're like, oh, I guess we can't

[27:49] just melt them down or throw them out.

[27:51] We got to use them.

[27:52] The other thing about Spider-Man, not only is the art tremendous.

[27:54] If you look at the pop-upers, our Spider-Man's face, like his mask, the spinner is a web,

[28:02] which they will later reuse in other games, but it's just all this custom art and all

[28:07] these different parts.

[28:08] It went all in.

[28:09] Yep.

[28:10] Looks great.

[28:11] If you've got an old late 70s silver era bronze era Spider-Man, like this looks spot

[28:18] on.

[28:19] Right.

[28:20] The art was done by Jack Kirby, who is one of the original sort of designers of Spider-Man.

[28:29] The credit is given to Gordon Morrison, but I'll tell you what, he was able to mimic that

[28:35] design like pretty much perfect.

[28:37] I'm having a hard time telling the difference.

[28:40] If it is in fact not, Jack Kirby who provided the image.

[28:44] And the one thing you're going to notice when we start getting into these games is at some

[28:48] point, Kyle Lee must have thought, people are going to be like, oh, I'm going to be

[28:50] like, people with two flippers are wooseys.

[28:52] You've got to have more than two flippers.

[28:55] Two flippers is just, no, that's not where it's at.

[28:57] The more flippers, the better.

[29:01] Artiside, this is the best part about that game.

[29:04] And that is the lower play field.

[29:07] We're talking scissor flippers with no safety.

[29:11] So we are, we are going to have to try to catch that ball.

[29:13] We can't trap on that right side quite as easily as we'd like.

[29:18] That adds a lot of fun.

[29:20] And all that being said, this game has a bad exploit.

[29:24] So you mentioned that a second ago.

[29:26] What is the downfall of this?

[29:28] So it's got all this cool.

[29:29] It's got drop targets and it's got these cool capture holes at the top and it's got loops

[29:34] to shoot around.

[29:35] Yeah.

[29:36] And it is very cool.

[29:37] And if your skill level is good enough, you don't have to play any of those.

[29:39] You don't have to, you don't have to play any of the play field.

[29:42] None of it.

[29:43] Basically, you plunge the ball into one of the two lanes on the top, the ones on the

[29:46] right, which lights the add bonus lights in the in lanes.

[29:50] And then you just shats back and forth and build your bonus and it builds your bonus and

[29:55] your multiplier and you just do that until you can't do it anymore.

[29:59] And you will max out the bonus.

[30:00] The shats being that you let the ball roll right to the tip of the flip, like way down

[30:05] to the tip of the flipper, like the absolute last second.

[30:09] And you just flip and it rolls up the in lane, the opposite in lane.

[30:13] Yeah, the opposite in lane and it just kisses that roll over switch and it adds the bonus

[30:20] and it adds to the multiplier.

[30:23] You catch it on the on the opposite side and you shats to the right of the tip of the

[30:28] flipper, just flip it and it goes backwards up the in lane and touches that.

[30:32] It's just it's terrible because that's what tournament does.

[30:35] Tournament's just ruined.

[30:36] Tournament's ruined everything.

[30:37] I mean, you need a certain amount of skill to be able to do that.

[30:40] Your average play.

[30:41] It's not easy.

[30:42] I'm going to be able to do that.

[30:43] If you can get into a groove with it, you can ignore the entire rest of the play field,

[30:47] which is a shame.

[30:48] So it's not like, oh, I got to shoot the drop targets up on the corner and then that's

[30:53] going to be, you know, that's going to increase my multiplier.

[30:55] And then I got to build my bonus by shooting it up to the top lanes and getting ABC or

[31:00] one, two, three or it really, really just is terrible this way.

[31:07] And that's the same problem.

[31:09] The exact same problem that the incredible Hulk has.

[31:12] The system one is it's just once you know that rule, it kind of ruins the game because

[31:17] you're like, oh, if I really actually want to set a high score, I got to keep getting

[31:21] it in the in lane some way.

[31:23] And it just sucks.

[31:25] But they've sold over 7,000 of these.

[31:27] So this is a good start.

[31:28] What do you think that they thought right out of the gate?

[31:31] Just so many sales of such an awesome theme.

[31:34] It's a good start.

[31:35] And they're the got leave construction is awesome.

[31:39] Like if you ever worked on any of them, you lift the play field up, especially these

[31:42] wide bodies, they'll have like a bracket thing that comes up to hold the play field in place.

[31:46] And it's not like a, it's not like a little breath like it's like a proper like you could

[31:50] be demanded death with this thing.

[31:52] Yes.

[31:53] It is their games are like tanks.

[31:56] It's impressive, impressive.

[31:58] So if we follow that up, we're like, okay, we got this awesome licensed comic book

[32:02] theme.

[32:03] Back, we're lighted on fire again.

[32:06] What's going to draw in the next round of sales?

[32:08] And that Ron is a circuits theme and original theme, which is an ultra wide.

[32:16] It's one of the, it's one of the two.

[32:19] I think these are if you exclude things like Hercules.

[32:22] This is one of the widest games ever made this in a star race, which is probably coming

[32:27] later.

[32:28] But yeah, it is very, very what I actually played one of the he's a few weeks ago.

[32:33] It is so wide.

[32:36] And they would sell 1700 units.

[32:41] Yeah.

[32:42] That is a far cry from what they just sold designed again by Ed Kinsky, art by Gordon

[32:49] Morrison and again, the software and sound is uncredited.

[32:54] Now that play field is three inches wider than the other system 80 wide.

[33:00] We'll call dimension 80.

[33:01] We'll use their terminology.

[33:03] Yes, the demand is this three inches wider than dimension 80, which is, which is already

[33:09] like among the widest of the wide.

[33:11] So it's just like dimension 83.

[33:13] Actually to be fair, dimension 80 is not one of, for example, Paragon that, that era of

[33:20] a ballies, they're all wider than dimension 80.

[33:24] Also the Williams ones like Pokerino and the one that Steve Richie did that I can't think

[33:29] of right now.

[33:30] Stellar Wars.

[33:31] Stellar Wars.

[33:32] So they're wide.

[33:33] They're wider than dimension 80.

[33:35] But they don't feel as wide as it's probably the design.

[33:38] No, they feel as wide to me.

[33:39] Do they?

[33:40] Yeah.

[33:41] Maybe I just don't have enough time on them.

[33:42] But when I've played those ones, they just don't, they don't, it just seems like the ball

[33:46] just rolls and rolls and rolls on these got leaves.

[33:49] Maybe it's the flippers.

[33:50] Maybe the flippers aren't as powerful on the got leaves.

[33:53] They're 50 ball flippers.

[33:55] I think a lot of people just don't set them up right.

[33:57] This is a really cool play field design.

[34:00] I really enjoy this play field because it has the spinner right up the center at the

[34:04] top lanes, which is a really cool placement for it.

[34:08] It has traditional roll over lanes on the top into two pop bumpers.

[34:12] But then it has a drop target bank and that drop target bank has like four drop targets.

[34:19] But there's a space in between the four.

[34:23] So you can miss the target and kind of shoot it up into the pop bumper, which is going

[34:28] to get you into trouble.

[34:30] What they used to do at Valley Williams when they started the wide bodies is the designers

[34:34] made a conscious decision to use a portion of the play field on the left or the right side

[34:41] and actually shrink the play field.

[34:43] So you don't actually shoot the orbits.

[34:45] You don't actually shoot the entire width of the play field.

[34:50] And they've done that here on circus, which they did on Genie as well, where they create

[34:55] like a mini play field on the regular play field.

[34:59] And it's got too many flippers.

[35:01] So it's like a smaller play field up in the top left corner.

[35:05] And it's got next to the greatest of all time, very target.

[35:11] It has the roto target.

[35:13] What's a roto target, Ron?

[35:15] It's a target that rotates.

[35:18] Yes.

[35:19] It's like a fan, right?

[35:22] Rototargets are hilarious because they just go, like when you hit a switch, they'll spin

[35:29] around and it'll reveal a different target.

[35:34] So much fun.

[35:35] Wow.

[35:36] You are a big fan of roto targets.

[35:37] I don't know what it is.

[35:38] Rototargets and very targets.

[35:40] They're just so odd and unique.

[35:42] How many flippers does circus have?

[35:44] We got to have our flipper count.

[35:47] Yeah, flipper count.

[35:48] Is that what we're going to do this episode?

[35:50] We had four flippers on Spider-Man.

[35:52] We had one on the left.

[35:54] We had one on the bottom on the bottom left.

[35:56] And then we had the two scissor flippers on the right.

[35:59] So how many do we have here with this one, Ron?

[36:01] We have five flippers.

[36:03] Five flippers.

[36:04] Too many flippers, three standard flippers.

[36:06] So we're kind of...

[36:08] Not everyone is a standard sized flipper.

[36:10] There's still flippers in from a shop out perspective.

[36:14] It's fun when you have that many flippers.

[36:15] Where do we get to some of the later ones?

[36:17] Where do we get to a particular title?

[36:19] I think that is the king of flippers.

[36:22] So circus is still part of the Gottlieb system 80 mega branding here.

[36:29] And on the flyer, they kind of just abbreviated the stuff they sit in the last one.

[36:32] The game with a brain, which they've quoted.

[36:36] Also features new pop-up or power, ear level sound projection, 15 step bookkeeping system,

[36:44] automatic replay percentages, track site and sound, automatic playing time average

[36:49] and super accurate scoring.

[36:51] I love the super accurate scoring.

[36:53] Do you know how they put stuff like that in there?

[36:55] Sometimes you would shoot a target and you'd have to wait for it to catch up to do the math.

[37:00] More like in the EM era.

[37:02] If you hit like two targets, it would only give you the one.

[37:06] That's a thing with solid state now.

[37:08] We count everything, everything, super accurate scoring.

[37:12] Featuring Gottlieb's exclusive rototargets

[37:17] and the popular game within a game concept.

[37:20] Oh, game within a game concept.

[37:23] I like cool.

[37:23] I like what the different manufacturers will call things like a play field.

[37:27] They might have a different term for it.

[37:29] And the Gottlieb world, it looks like the huge spectacular action playboard

[37:34] is loaded with play appealing features to generate high profits.

[37:37] So they call it a playboard.

[37:39] The flippers on the bottom right are not scissor flippers.

[37:43] They're actually mounted.

[37:44] One is mounted directly to the sling.

[37:46] The other one is mounted on the in lane.

[37:49] So that could be quite tricky, I think, shooting that one.

[37:52] The spinner is terrible.

[37:55] The artwork, although creepy circus theme is actually really, really, really good.

[38:01] Is it creepy because it has clowns?

[38:04] Yeah, and they're like the terrifying 70s clowns.

[38:07] The kind that are usually evil now, yes.

[38:11] But I mean, clowns used to mean fun, you know?

[38:14] Yeah, they didn't always mean murder in your sleep.

[38:16] Yeah, I like they call the back box a light box.

[38:19] And they put the speaker on the light box.

[38:21] So it's pointed directly at your head for better sound.

[38:24] Because it's, yeah, it's right there.

[38:26] Yeah, you know, it's in your ear.

[38:28] What do you think of this back glass?

[38:30] I mean, it's...

[38:31] Gottlieb was never much for the bikini ladies.

[38:35] But there's a couple on here.

[38:36] Yep, there are.

[38:38] That is a new marketing strategy.

[38:40] An elephant's and the unicorn master.

[38:43] I guess is that the ring?

[38:44] Yeah, that's what you call them.

[38:45] Ringmaster clowns.

[38:48] Yeah, a unicorn.

[38:51] Unicorns are very in now.

[38:52] As a father of two daughters under seven,

[38:55] unicorns are very in.

[38:57] There you go.

[38:58] Yeah.

[38:59] I think this would get some play in my house, to be honest.

[39:02] It's a great play field.

[39:03] The theme is terrible.

[39:05] But the, I think the play field is very cool.

[39:07] The theme is terrible.

[39:07] Everyone loves the circus.

[39:09] And not everybody.

[39:11] Animal rights people don't like this.

[39:12] They didn't exist in 1980.

[39:16] Well, I guess I've said everything I want to say here.

[39:19] Is there anything else you want to just sum it up here?

[39:21] Gottlieb hopes the next one will sell better.

[39:24] And this is...

[39:25] We're going to need a game with a cool name.

[39:27] And that's Panthera.

[39:29] That is a cool name.

[39:30] It is a cool name.

[39:32] I don't know where they got it from.

[39:34] I don't know what it's what it is.

[39:36] But this is like a fantasy mythic theme.

[39:39] This is June of 1980.

[39:42] It is a wide body again.

[39:44] Cells 5,220 units.

[39:46] Oh, thank goodness.

[39:47] A better setter.

[39:48] Designed by Ed Kinsky.

[39:50] This has art by somebody who will become quite prominent in pinball.

[39:54] Doug Watson.

[39:56] Again, sound and software is uncredited.

[39:59] This has a little bit of controversy

[40:02] as to who the actual designer was.

[40:05] Now we've given it to Ed Kinsky here on the show.

[40:08] But there's actually some talk that a John Burris

[40:12] may have actually done a lot of work on this with Ed

[40:16] and maybe even more work than Ed.

[40:19] So when asked by IPDB,

[40:21] Burris couldn't actually remember who designed it,

[40:24] but he thought maybe Ed would.

[40:26] So that's like this weird like,

[40:28] nobody remembers who worked on their games,

[40:30] which I find amazing.

[40:32] But Ron, they were slamming them out at this time.

[40:34] So...

[40:35] It's not like they're making a game every year or two years.

[40:37] So yeah, they could get confused.

[40:39] So imagine being so busy.

[40:41] Manufacturing machines that you're not able to remember

[40:45] the actual games that you made.

[40:47] You don't have a list.

[40:49] You don't have it in a diary.

[40:50] You don't have the work orders.

[40:51] Nothing because it's all thrown in the garbage basically

[40:53] when you're done with it.

[40:54] And a lot of designers and artists,

[40:56] even to this day, have a difficult time remembering

[40:58] what they've worked on.

[41:00] And they will often say that at conventions,

[41:02] when people ask them,

[41:04] what are their favorite games or, hey, I love this game,

[41:07] they'll actually not even remember any of the details

[41:10] of those games.

[41:11] I think it's more interesting that these are all

[41:13] uncredited software.

[41:14] Like nobody knows who did the software on these games.

[41:18] The names that often pop up when we talk about

[41:22] the designing of System 80,

[41:25] the implementation of System 80 is John Burris,

[41:29] Alan Edwell, and Tom DeFotis.

[41:33] They are sort of the three kind of big heads

[41:37] when it comes to doing that.

[41:39] So many people in fact say that a lot of these games

[41:42] were probably a collaboration of those team members.

[41:47] And some of those kind of crappy, exploitive code issues

[41:52] may have arisen because they're still learning

[41:55] the System 80 board set and what it can do.

[41:58] And they don't want to run too fast

[42:01] and put something out into the field that is not reliable

[42:05] because that would be very not God-leab.

[42:08] Alan Edwell told IPDB that he and Tom DeFotis

[42:12] were troubleshooting this game a lot for a nasty bug

[42:14] in one of the hardware timer chips made by Rockwell.

[42:17] So there you go, we're running into a lot of the issues.

[42:22] And they're still learning some of those things

[42:24] so they don't want to blow it.

[42:26] But one thing they don't blow is the marketing

[42:30] because this game in a nutshell,

[42:33] a mystical lady and her panthers.

[42:37] Yes, Panthera, mystical princess goddess, born to royalty,

[42:42] kidnapped and abandoned in the forest,

[42:45] raised and nurtured by fierce but maternalistic tribe

[42:48] of jungle denizens, ultimately returning to her queen ship.

[42:52] Panthera, exciting, mysterious, unpredictable,

[42:56] a fitting name and theme for Gottlieb's newest star series 80 game.

[43:01] What?

[43:02] Whoa.

[43:03] What?

[43:04] It's like the jungle book.

[43:05] Wow.

[43:07] That's like almost as crazy as the Cheetah one for Stern,

[43:11] which was like a whole page.

[43:13] Yeah.

[43:13] Now we're adding some extra flair to this game as well.

[43:17] To say the same thing,

[43:19] Gottlieb's unique new light box design carries

[43:22] a sequential cascade of sound to the player at ear level,

[43:26] creating an accelerating fever, pitch of excitement.

[43:30] Wow.

[43:32] It's better sound incredible.

[43:34] They're literally saying the same things,

[43:37] but making it sound even better.

[43:40] And right, they're going all in.

[43:42] It's an uninterrupted, endasteling array of play field lights,

[43:46] stimulates and enhances the player's feelings of emotion

[43:49] and competition.

[43:51] Wow.

[43:51] Whoo.

[43:52] How about the total memory recall?

[43:53] Resetting draw targets,

[43:55] which duplicate the play field condition from player to player

[44:00] is just one of Panthers superb new memory features.

[44:04] It's new for Gottlieb, but who invented that?

[44:07] Oh, that was a Stern thing.

[44:09] That was a Stern thing.

[44:10] Can you remember the game years ago, right?

[44:12] I'm trying to remember.

[44:13] I think it was Triton.

[44:14] I think Triton did that first,

[44:15] but yes, now Gottlieb has the memory targets.

[44:18] And if you're wondering what that means,

[44:20] the target targets can drop themselves

[44:22] and they can remember state from player to player.

[44:25] Gottlieb's new dimension 80 cabinet light box

[44:28] with over 30% more game area than the old standard

[44:32] add up to the perfect proportions for contemporary pinball.

[44:36] So they're wording this like this is the new normal.

[44:39] The new standard.

[44:40] This is the new standard.

[44:40] The other one is the old standard.

[44:42] The old games are old.

[44:44] Yeah.

[44:45] The new wide 80 games are the new games.

[44:49] Which we saw with Williams when they had their by-level games.

[44:51] Like this is the new standard.

[44:53] So we're going to this is the new game.

[44:55] This is how it is now.

[44:56] We're going to make four of Menero.

[44:57] And then make anymore.

[44:59] And then they discovered ramps were probably a better idea.

[45:01] Well, no, they needed wraps to get to the multiple levels of.

[45:04] Yeah, but like just ramps.

[45:06] Oh, this 15 step bookkeeping system.

[45:10] That's a big deal with self testing.

[45:12] They fail the last couple.

[45:14] They don't make it as a flowery language.

[45:16] And those literally just says it has a 15 step bookkeeping system

[45:20] self testing on parallel accuracy

[45:22] and an optional, what if that's a coin counter?

[45:25] Yeah, it's exciting.

[45:27] We've got some really, really cool.

[45:30] They really want to get you to buy in to the story of Pantera.

[45:35] It's more about that connection.

[45:37] The back glass tells the story.

[45:40] You've got kind of a scantily clad aboriginal looking lady

[45:48] who's there next to these two just fearsome muscular panthers.

[45:53] And if she wearing heels.

[45:55] She is because in the jungle, totally, totally worth it.

[46:01] The play field art.

[46:02] And this is a critique that I have on multiple games

[46:07] over kind of pinball history.

[46:09] A lot of reds and oranges don't do it for me.

[46:13] It doesn't look as pleasing for some reason.

[46:15] And it's red and orange and purple and blue.

[46:19] It's just, it's an odd palette.

[46:22] It doesn't look quite right.

[46:23] But art aside, this is a pretty great play field.

[46:28] I think I've only played this a few times.

[46:31] But how about our flipper count?

[46:33] I can't stop it.

[46:33] Oh, let's go back to flipper count.

[46:35] I think this one has failed us.

[46:37] This is, this is a let down.

[46:39] Oh my God.

[46:40] There's two flippers.

[46:41] Only two flippers, so probably plays better than the other ones.

[46:44] It does.

[46:45] And that's why I would say that this is a great play field.

[46:48] The only major issue with Pantera when I played it

[46:52] is getting up to the top of the play field.

[46:56] You got to have rebuilt flippers because there's only,

[46:58] they're way down at the bottom of the play field.

[47:00] The play field is wide.

[47:02] So you got to shoot that left orbit spinner,

[47:04] which when you hit it doesn't move.

[47:06] So it's, it doesn't have, it slows the ball down a lot.

[47:10] As well as shooting up to the right side orbit

[47:12] is really, really difficult.

[47:15] It's, it's unique.

[47:17] It's fun.

[47:18] It has three separate four target drop banks.

[47:22] So it is a drop fest for the eyes.

[47:25] Love it.

[47:27] Great play field by Ed Khrinsky.

[47:29] So here's a comment from our Facebook post.

[47:32] We're asking people about what they thought,

[47:35] a system 80, Chuck word of straight down the middle pinball,

[47:39] SDT and pinball says horrible sounds.

[47:43] Very early digital sounds and they clearly were still

[47:46] figuring things out at this point.

[47:48] Interesting memory drop target rule set,

[47:50] you have to collect four colors.

[47:52] Once you do those corresponding lights on the drops

[47:54] light allowing you to hit three of one color

[47:57] for a bonus X.

[47:59] This progress holds ball to ball.

[48:01] Once you collect all four bonus X advances,

[48:03] all drops reset and they are 5K each rust of the game.

[48:07] Very challenging and satisfying to get this set up.

[48:09] So we're getting into some pretty unique rule sets.

[48:12] The other thing that he loves about this

[48:16] is that the gott-leab does the nicest knocker sound effects.

[48:21] Five loud knocks for the 50,000 points that you can get.

[48:27] And this is common for gott-leabs

[48:29] and one of the favorite features of Chuck word and panthera.

[48:34] He also has a comment about the spinner.

[48:37] Spinner on the left orbit is pretty lame.

[48:39] If lit it will advance bonus and award 10K per spin.

[48:42] But it's kept at 50K points

[48:44] and five bonus advances per one rip, that's it.

[48:48] That's terrible.

[48:49] Well it probably only spins three times anyway.

[48:50] Right, so that's just how it goes.

[48:54] We can use that memory somewhere else.

[48:56] It's only gonna spin three times.

[48:57] Terrible. Have you played this?

[48:59] I played it a few times.

[49:01] What's your initial impression?

[49:03] Kind of when you first shot it, you're like,

[49:05] yeah, that's pretty good.

[49:06] I can't remember.

[49:07] I can't remember.

[49:08] So then it's kind of a bit home.

[49:09] I wasn't like, oh my god, but yeah, I know I've played it.

[49:12] Yeah, it's not one of those ones where you play it

[49:14] and you're like, oh yeah, this is one of the good ones.

[49:18] You just, it's just kind of fun.

[49:20] I get it.

[49:21] I like it.

[49:21] It's kind of, again, kind of fun.

[49:23] Great play field layout, but I don't know.

[49:26] The artwork really is a bit of a turn off.

[49:28] Now, Doug Watson is the guy who did that art

[49:31] and this is his second game.

[49:34] His first game was Stern's big game,

[49:37] which I think is equally kind of ugly.

[49:40] No, Rob, I love big games art.

[49:42] Doug worked advertising posters

[49:45] and they were a third party company

[49:47] that would do like band posters or vinyl records.

[49:51] They would do the pinball machines.

[49:53] They would do a bunch of stuff.

[49:54] And he would eventually flip to Gottlieb and Stern

[49:59] and then would eventually end up at Balli Midway

[50:02] and he would do his best work in my opinion

[50:06] at Balli Williams in the 90s.

[50:10] Big games are horrible.

[50:11] Big game is incredible.

[50:13] They look like animals, the back glass

[50:15] with a tiger looking at you.

[50:17] Lost too much green.

[50:18] Awesome.

[50:19] Too much green.

[50:20] Wrong.

[50:21] This one's got too much red, too much orange,

[50:22] too much blue, too much pink.

[50:24] Purple.

[50:25] That was it.

[50:26] We're tonight listeners email you

[50:27] to tell you you're wrong about the art.

[50:29] They can email us.

[50:30] It's silver ball chronicles at gmail.com

[50:32] to let us know that Dave is right.

[50:35] Cool art on both of those games.

[50:37] I'm not gonna lie, but it's just, it's not quite,

[50:40] it's like there's certain rules that when you go

[50:44] to doing play fields and colors

[50:47] that is not totally apparent.

[50:49] And I don't know what it is,

[50:51] but those who do play fields,

[50:52] I think Zombie Yeti, Christopher Franchi

[50:55] in the modern day, John Yosey,

[50:56] they know what those rules are just instinctively.

[51:00] They could probably tell us what it is.

[51:02] Usually it's space themes that sell

[51:06] one way that we can tell that space themes

[51:09] are what can sell is that recently

[51:11] American pinball trademarked galactic tank force

[51:16] for their upcoming game

[51:18] because space sells machines.

[51:22] And I'll tell you what counter force

[51:25] sounds like a fancy space theme from August of 1980.

[51:31] It is the Dimension 80 Wide Body

[51:33] sells 3,870 units designed by Ed Kinsky,

[51:38] Art By Gordon Morrison and once again,

[51:40] the Uncredited software.

[51:43] Counter force has a killer marketing campaign here.

[51:47] It's a new kind of pinball.

[51:49] They'll fight to play because this one fights back.

[51:53] It's the pinball that fights back.

[51:55] It's literally the tagline.

[51:56] That's the tagline.

[51:57] Yeah.

[51:59] And you know what this rule base is based on generally?

[52:02] No.

[52:04] It's basically kind of like space invaders.

[52:07] Oh, okay.

[52:08] They come down and you gotta hit them

[52:11] before they get down to the bottom.

[52:14] Oh, I see.

[52:15] That's actually quite smart.

[52:16] Or you could say it's like missile command.

[52:18] You have to hit them before they blow up your cities.

[52:20] It's, I think there might even be cult cities in this.

[52:24] So there's seven drop targets right kind of up

[52:26] in the middle of the play field in the back.

[52:29] And in front of them there's seven lights

[52:31] and then there's another row of seven lights

[52:33] and another row of seven and another row of seven.

[52:35] And then finally like your city lights at the bottom.

[52:39] So you gotta shoot those drop targets at the top

[52:41] over and over.

[52:42] Cause the alien attack rockets descend

[52:46] at increasing speed, their mission knock out

[52:50] the player's multiplier guns.

[52:53] Yep.

[52:54] And any rocket reaching a lit multiplier gun

[52:56] will cancel those points and reset the bank of targets.

[52:59] And it starts all over again,

[53:00] but this time with an accelerated attack rate

[53:03] who will be the winner, man or machine.

[53:07] Ooh, your mission, arm your multiplier guns

[53:11] and destroy the alien attack rockets.

[53:13] So I guess the multiplier guns are kind of like cities

[53:15] in missile command, but yeah.

[53:16] Yeah, yeah, it's cool.

[53:18] It's a cool, cool, cool concept.

[53:20] It's a little bit different.

[53:22] It's not like shoot here and get your multiplier

[53:25] or shats the inline.

[53:26] A very video gamey type concept.

[53:29] They're starting to get comfortable

[53:31] with that system 80 rule set that's built into the boards.

[53:35] So they're able to kind of come up

[53:37] with some really unique gameplay options.

[53:40] This is why I said earlier that they would seriously

[53:43] leapfrog, bali and Williams kind of in this beginning era.

[53:47] Cause like this is a really kind of cool, innovative way.

[53:50] I mean, it's not.

[53:51] It obviously didn't change the industry,

[53:53] but it is different and cool.

[53:55] Dimension 80, the new ideal play field size.

[53:58] So now it's the ideal play field size.

[54:01] Yeah, it's, you know, it's not the new standard.

[54:04] It's just ideal.

[54:05] It's pretty good.

[54:06] I can't wait to see when they go back to normal size

[54:08] what they market that totally.

[54:10] Let's count some flippers.

[54:11] So we got two at the bottom,

[54:13] kind of in your standard spot.

[54:16] Count four here.

[54:17] You got one jammed into the right sling.

[54:20] So there is no sling.

[54:21] There's just a flipper on the right side.

[54:24] And then on the left,

[54:25] the flipper is all the way on the left play field

[54:28] right above three in lane, out lane mixture.

[54:33] That's in a weird spot.

[54:34] My assumption is that they start putting a lot of these flippers

[54:40] farther up the play field because they noticed

[54:43] that they're having a difficult time getting all the way around

[54:46] some of these play fields with the flipper so far down.

[54:50] What do you think?

[54:51] Do you think that sounds about right?

[54:52] Yeah, maybe just could be a better angle

[54:55] to attack those targets.

[54:56] So you shoot up.

[54:57] It's got a set of three roll over lanes on the left.

[55:00] A set of roll over lanes on the right.

[55:03] Now the ones on the right, you get from the plunge.

[55:06] The ones on the left, you get from shooting the left orbit

[55:09] which is kind of a neat kind of concept.

[55:11] You can't get to them normally.

[55:12] And then you got that huge drop target bank in the middle.

[55:16] Well, Jordan from HUP Challenge,

[55:19] which is one of the TPN partner streamers

[55:22] has some comments on this game which they will stream quite regularly

[55:26] and is one that he truly, truly loves.

[55:29] He says you have to knock those targets down quick

[55:31] and collect your multipliers or the game

[55:33] takes the multipliers back and resets your targets.

[55:36] In each time you don't knock all the targets down

[55:38] and then decreases the time you have to knock the targets down

[55:41] and collect your special extra ball or bonus.

[55:44] It's, I believe, one of the earlier games to remember

[55:46] how many targets were down from your previous ball.

[55:48] I have a roller disc to produce the same year

[55:50] and they reset completely each ball.

[55:52] I love Counter Force.

[55:53] It's a challenge.

[55:55] Yeah. So this is a unique, different,

[55:58] fun shooting play field.

[55:59] It's wide open, but there's a couple of dangerous pop bumpers

[56:03] right up there on the top right.

[56:04] If you, if you screw up on those drop targets

[56:07] or you shoot the drop target to deflects into the pops,

[56:10] you're in danger really quick.

[56:11] It's a cool game.

[56:12] I really like this game.

[56:13] I've played this a couple of times.

[56:15] Well worth your time.

[56:17] And you could tell the sales numbers are there.

[56:19] Now what was trying to remember

[56:20] if it makes some kind of buzzer sound

[56:22] or something when it gets to the bottom

[56:23] and blows up your, yeah, that's in my head for some reason.

[56:28] I'm probably wrong.

[56:29] Now this is Gordon Morrison's last pin.

[56:33] I mean, technically he would do asteroid Annie

[56:35] and the aliens was his last pin.

[56:38] But this was the last full, complete art package

[56:42] that he would do from start to finish in the process.

[56:47] Gordon Morrison is an absolute legend

[56:52] when it comes to the early solid state

[56:54] and EM era of pinball art.

[56:58] He is the grandfather of pinball art.

[57:03] He was born April 27th, 1930,

[57:06] and he died in 2000 from lung cancer.

[57:10] These guys used to just smoke like chimneys

[57:13] and draw and do all that stuff.

[57:15] That was the thing in the 70s man.

[57:17] Just sitting in a room covered in smoke,

[57:21] drawn pinball stuff.

[57:23] Crazy.

[57:24] His first game was Gottlieb's 2001 in 1971

[57:29] and he did about 140 games over his career.

[57:36] Isn't that nuts?

[57:37] He did 140 pinball games in like 10 years.

[57:41] Yeah, that's a lot.

[57:44] Christopher French has done like three

[57:47] and he's like an amazing artist

[57:50] that I think is probably one of the best ever.

[57:53] And he's done three.

[57:54] And this guy did 140.

[57:57] They made way more games then.

[57:59] During the wedgehead era,

[58:00] he did all the classics that you love.

[58:03] He did Abracadabra with like the wizard and stuff.

[58:07] He did rock star.

[58:09] He did 300, the really cool bowling game

[58:11] with those amazing spinners.

[58:14] Strange world and of course my favorite

[58:17] along with everybody else's.

[58:19] Centigrade 37, which I mean the art package

[58:21] is probably the best part of that game.

[58:23] He is truly one of pinball's unsung heroes

[58:28] and there was a really great article

[58:31] written by Voodoo who defined Gordon's style.

[58:37] His style oscillates between a very deco sensibility

[58:40] focusing on geometry and patterning

[58:42] and psychedelic era maximalism.

[58:45] His pinball machines are almost always my top aesthetic choices.

[58:49] His work with Gottlie produced a classic

[58:51] perfect aesthetic for the pinball machine.

[58:53] Art work for pinball machines coexist

[58:55] and then fed off of other producers of popular culture.

[58:58] Band flyers, posters, album covers, photography, film,

[59:02] et cetera, all entered into a feedback loop

[59:04] refining a visual language that could define a generation.

[59:07] The article is titled pinball unsung art hero.

[59:11] The magazine Voodoo is really like an artist magazine.

[59:15] Like it's speaking to artists.

[59:17] So we're getting all the artist themes and aesthetic

[59:20] and psychedelic era maximalism and all of that stuff,

[59:23] which I don't understand unless I looked it up on Wikipedia.

[59:26] He added a lot to art in general, not just pinball art.

[59:31] It was something very, very cool.

[59:35] After Gordon passed away,

[59:37] Dr. Keith Egging hosted a seminar at Expo

[59:42] about Gordon Morrison and his pinball art.

[59:45] Russ Jensen wrote a summary of the seminar.

[59:49] And here are some of the comments from that seminar

[59:53] that I thought was really great.

[59:55] Now could you know who those two people are?

[59:57] Well, Russ was an enthusiast.

[59:59] And if you look at IPDB,

[01:00:02] a ton of the early pictures that were posted IPDB

[01:00:06] were by Russ, especially a lot of rare games and stuff.

[01:00:10] You don't see because he would go to the shows.

[01:00:12] Let's see.

[01:00:13] Dr. Egging commented that designers give pinball

[01:00:15] their personalities while artists give them their soul.

[01:00:19] Gordon gave the industry a soul.

[01:00:21] Gordon believed that his art deco style

[01:00:23] gave pin games soul.

[01:00:26] Gordon never grew up and that he loved comic books, cartoons

[01:00:29] and toys.

[01:00:30] He was incredibly witty, described himself as having flexible

[01:00:33] ethics and his home was described as strange

[01:00:36] with various types of art all over, including gargoyles.

[01:00:40] That explains why his Spider-Man art was so killer.

[01:00:44] Yeah, there you go.

[01:00:45] He probably was like, I want to do that.

[01:00:47] Give that to me now.

[01:00:49] Oh, and then he did the Hulk as well.

[01:00:52] So working at advertising posters was able to give

[01:00:58] a lot of flexibility in what Gordon worked on.

[01:01:03] If it was a vinyl record poster, a movie band poster,

[01:01:09] he really did a lot of stuff.

[01:01:10] And they would borrow from pop culture

[01:01:13] and put it into his games.

[01:01:15] And you can see they're all very cool and trendy.

[01:01:18] I've included links to those articles in the show notes.

[01:01:23] If you want to go back and take a look at them in detail,

[01:01:26] Gordon Morrison was inducted into the expo pinball hall of fame

[01:01:30] in 1998.

[01:01:34] Allegedly, after putting in his time at Gottlieb,

[01:01:37] Morrison was still working up to 80 hours a week

[01:01:43] doing freelance art and advertising projects

[01:01:47] all the way up to his death in 2000.

[01:01:51] This guy loved what he did.

[01:01:54] I'll tell you what, Ron, you got to do what you love to do

[01:01:58] because you'll never work a day in your life.

[01:02:00] Okay. You know, it's also important.

[01:02:02] It's important that you like yourself.

[01:02:05] You love yourself, but you have to be careful

[01:02:06] because too much self-level, it just make you jealous

[01:02:08] of the people who envy you.

[01:02:11] Exactly.

[01:02:12] Exactly.

[01:02:14] Life moments with Ron.

[01:02:17] Let's get into the greatest system 80 game ever made.

[01:02:22] It's so great.

[01:02:22] It sold 3625 units.

[01:02:25] This is James Bond.

[01:02:28] It's the spy movie license theme from October of 1980.

[01:02:33] It was designed by Alan Edwell, who also did Charlie's Angels.

[01:02:37] Everybody loves that.

[01:02:39] And he would do a bunch of the Gottlieb premier games in the late 80s.

[01:02:45] This is the art by Doug Watson.

[01:02:47] Sound and software once again uncredited.

[01:02:51] You know, Ron, I am a massive James Bond fan.

[01:02:55] Really? I just, I couldn't tell.

[01:02:58] I love pop culture.

[01:03:00] I love the old era.

[01:03:03] I love the 1980s comedy bond, which we'll speak about in a minute.

[01:03:08] I love the 90s over the top James Bond through gold and I and all those

[01:03:14] eras. And I mean, Daniel Craig, the best bond.

[01:03:19] No. So you haven't seen him.

[01:03:21] You can't comment.

[01:03:22] I saw like the first 15 minutes of casino royale.

[01:03:25] No, no, he got to see the royales like one of the best bond movies.

[01:03:29] Shotconery all the way.

[01:03:30] Sorry.

[01:03:32] Before we get into why James Bond is awesome and all that other cool stuff, the

[01:03:37] flyer to set the mood.

[01:03:39] Let's use as many James Bond cliches as we can.

[01:03:43] Okay.

[01:03:44] Yes, James Bond 007, the pinball licensed to thrill.

[01:03:49] Yes.

[01:03:50] Nobody has ever used that before.

[01:03:52] Very good.

[01:03:53] Got leave. Here's another one.

[01:03:55] It's time for a thrilling new pinball concept and got leave introduces it now.

[01:04:00] Oh God.

[01:04:01] When you think about it, how crazy it is, you get James Bond license, which is a big

[01:04:07] deal.

[01:04:07] It's huge, huge license at the time.

[01:04:09] So you use that game to try a completely new, basically rule set idea.

[01:04:15] Oh, you're blowing it.

[01:04:16] They absolutely.

[01:04:17] Why would you do that?

[01:04:20] Which is what we'll talk about.

[01:04:21] They decided to make it a time-based game, which pinball has done on several

[01:04:27] occasions and it has never, ever worked.

[01:04:31] Pinball players are always looking for a new challenge in James Bond is got

[01:04:35] leaves dramatic new breakthrough in pinball design.

[01:04:38] Each player is given 50 time units at the start of the game.

[01:04:42] So already you've lost most of your player base with that first line.

[01:04:46] Totally.

[01:04:47] I don't get it.

[01:04:48] They've taken the, hey, what can we do with this board set?

[01:04:51] And they've just, they've gone a bit too far.

[01:04:53] The kind of the idea is it's like your James Bond, right?

[01:04:57] And time is counting down on the bomb.

[01:05:00] And it's like ticking away and you got to, you know, defuse the bomb.

[01:05:05] And it's, it's, it's just just God awful, terrible.

[01:05:09] So then it addresses like a clown and then he just enables the bomb.

[01:05:13] We'll talk about that in a second.

[01:05:15] You got that.

[01:05:15] Did you get my reference there?

[01:05:17] I did.

[01:05:18] Octopus, you reference there.

[01:05:19] Yes.

[01:05:19] One of a, a Ben, one of the listeners of the show sent me a couple of really cool

[01:05:25] links.

[01:05:27] They are of some of the patents that were filed by Gottlieb and the designers

[01:05:33] around this time.

[01:05:34] They patented the time based pinball machine.

[01:05:39] So what I've got here are the, uh,

[01:05:43] readouts of what was filed for the patents for Gottlieb and the time unit

[01:05:50] based pinball machine.

[01:05:52] I've included these in the show notes, but, um, these are really nerdy and really

[01:05:58] interesting.

[01:06:00] So if you could help me out here, Ron, how would you best describe, um, a time based

[01:06:06] pinball machine?

[01:06:08] I almost feel British accent will be needed to make it really.

[01:06:10] Ah.

[01:06:12] Yeah.

[01:06:12] A pinball machine is gameplay determined primarily by time, rather than

[01:06:16] a number of ball plays, a specificable amount of tape or specificable.

[01:06:22] That's actually, I don't, I'm not misreading that.

[01:06:25] That literally is where it says, yeah, a specificable amount of gameplay time

[01:06:29] is originally according to a given player.

[01:06:32] The gameplay time is reduced at an instantaneous rate, which changes according

[01:06:36] to our actively, he plays in schools.

[01:06:39] The more active the ball play, the slower the gameplay time is reduced.

[01:06:43] In another feature, the pinball game machine is controlled by a digital

[01:06:46] processor, which also participates as a contested against the human player.

[01:06:51] Ooh, wow.

[01:06:52] Sounds fancy.

[01:06:54] As another feature upon certain play field achievements, a given player is

[01:06:58] entitled to operate a mechanism, which alters the play field conditions of

[01:07:01] another player.

[01:07:02] Yet another feature includes the provision of multiple independent play field

[01:07:06] areas on a common play field.

[01:07:08] Each play field area is self-contained, having its own captured ball,

[01:07:12] flippant mechanism, and scoring targets.

[01:07:14] Preferably the areas having the captured balls are enabled for ball play only

[01:07:18] for specified periods of time.

[01:07:20] Wow.

[01:07:20] That is the patent I've included again in the show.

[01:07:23] Oh crap.

[01:07:23] The interesting is they call it play field here when they were calling it play board

[01:07:28] or whatever in the in the flyer.

[01:07:30] Yeah.

[01:07:31] Time units.

[01:07:32] You collect the time units.

[01:07:33] Ah, time units.

[01:07:34] Yes.

[01:07:35] Instead of having like three balls and you try to get a high score and it

[01:07:38] drains out or five balls, which was the time, which was popular kind of

[01:07:42] around this time as well, we're going to reinvent pinball.

[01:07:46] We're trying to find something that's unique and we're doing it with the

[01:07:50] biggest license we possibly could have, which is a terrible.

[01:07:53] That support that blows my mind.

[01:07:55] Why would you do that?

[01:07:56] This went over so badly, unless, unless you think this is so incredible,

[01:08:02] you want to introduce it with your biggest license because that'll just

[01:08:05] guarantee buy in right, which terrible, terrible decision.

[01:08:10] And we can see that in the sales numbers sells 3000 units and it's a huge

[01:08:14] license like the license itself should have sold like 6000 units.

[01:08:19] But people played it and it was terrible.

[01:08:20] And those that got the game, the coin drop for, for like actual customers at

[01:08:26] an operator's archives or a bar was so bad that they actually released an

[01:08:32] updated ROM to replace it to put it to a regular three and five ball game.

[01:08:38] But it was too late.

[01:08:40] It was dead.

[01:08:42] As we know, Scott Lee never will come out with new software after the

[01:08:46] fact. Never.

[01:08:47] So when they're doing that, you know, this did not work well.

[01:08:51] And they know that they blew their biggest license.

[01:08:56] Ever.

[01:08:57] You think they had to get permission from any of the actors back then?

[01:09:00] I doubt it.

[01:09:01] I, you know, I think the way James Bond works and this is a total assumption on

[01:09:05] me is the images of the actors that portray James Bond are then the property

[01:09:14] of Eon productions or the movie ownership.

[01:09:18] I don't think like most contracts that the actors own their image.

[01:09:24] I think when they play James Bond, they give all that up because they are on like

[01:09:28] lunch boxes and trading cards and they are on movie posters left and right.

[01:09:35] They are on a mega watch stuff.

[01:09:39] They are on Austin Martin commercials.

[01:09:41] They are everywhere.

[01:09:43] And I think that that is just part of the big dollar amount that they get when

[01:09:47] they sign a contract.

[01:09:48] Now this game is pretty much based on Moonbreaker.

[01:09:52] It is.

[01:09:53] It has Roger Moore as James Bond as Richard Keel as Joz is in there.

[01:09:58] Gorgeous back glass.

[01:10:00] This is the artwork from Moonbreaker.

[01:10:04] Moonbreaker was released in 1979.

[01:10:06] It was the highest grossing and most profitable James Bond movie ever

[01:10:12] until 1995's Golden Eye, which is sad because it's not good.

[01:10:18] Gold Nies a great movie.

[01:10:19] No, Golden Eyes a great movie.

[01:10:21] Moonbreaker ain't.

[01:10:22] Yeah, I mean, if it's not, but it's one of the worst villains,

[01:10:26] tracks that guy just made no impression on it.

[01:10:29] It's a fun movie.

[01:10:31] So at the time, right?

[01:10:32] It's post, it's post Star Wars 1977.

[01:10:36] Everybody's doing space stuff.

[01:10:38] James Bond in space.

[01:10:39] James Bond in space.

[01:10:41] It's fun for what it is, but it's not great.

[01:10:44] This was followed up by for your eyes only in 1981,

[01:10:49] which is probably Roger Moore's best acted James Bond film and should have been

[01:10:55] his last.

[01:10:56] If you look at the back glass, the image of James Bond holding the gun with

[01:11:02] Joz kind of jumping or falling behind him, the ladies in front, that is the

[01:11:08] Moonbreaker image.

[01:11:09] So if you Google James Bond Moonbreaker and you look at the movie or promotional

[01:11:14] film images, that exact image is basically the same one on the back

[01:11:20] glass, except he's not in his space suit.

[01:11:23] He's in the traditional tuxedo.

[01:11:26] God, do I want this game?

[01:11:28] I think I do.

[01:11:29] I want the three and five ball version.

[01:11:32] They're kind of hard to find because there's not very many of them.

[01:11:36] The play field looks loads of fun to play.

[01:11:40] It's got scissors flippers on the left and the right side.

[01:11:42] So we got four flippers on the skippers.

[01:11:45] It's got drop targets on the left.

[01:11:48] It's got some stellar art like it's really, really good.

[01:11:53] Middle of the play field got Roger Moore doing his Roger Moore standing with his

[01:11:58] hand up in the the Walther in his hand.

[01:12:01] It's got the kind of the blood running down.

[01:12:03] It's like that iconic gun barrel scene in the beginning of all James Bond movies.

[01:12:10] Just I love this game.

[01:12:12] Never played it terrible with the time bonus crap.

[01:12:17] But it's it reeks of James Bond.

[01:12:19] This is a James Bond game.

[01:12:21] They nailed it.

[01:12:22] Why don't you have this game, Ron?

[01:12:25] I didn't really like it that much.

[01:12:28] It's pretty terrible.

[01:12:29] I'm sorry.

[01:12:30] Besides an art piece, it's pretty terrible.

[01:12:32] Yeah.

[01:12:33] It's like all of those people that have the original back to the future game.

[01:12:38] They have that game because it's back to the future and not because it's a great

[01:12:42] game.

[01:12:43] Well, although compared to the next game, James Bond is going to seem like a big

[01:12:48] seller.

[01:12:49] Oh my God.

[01:12:50] This is bad.

[01:12:51] So we go back to space.

[01:12:53] James Bond did the same thing, right?

[01:12:55] Space is where it's at when it comes to increasing numbers.

[01:12:59] Yeah, especially when Star Wars came out.

[01:13:01] This is star race.

[01:13:03] It is a sci fi space racing theme from October of 1980.

[01:13:11] It sells this is bad.

[01:13:13] 870 units.

[01:13:16] It's designed by John Buris.

[01:13:19] Art is uncredited.

[01:13:20] Sound and software by John Buris.

[01:13:23] This is another one of those ultra or extra wide bodies.

[01:13:27] It is also the last of those extra white circus and star race.

[01:13:32] What is star race?

[01:13:35] It's wide body pinball excitement.

[01:13:39] That's what it is.

[01:13:42] It's got leaves race through space to pinball profits.

[01:13:46] Star race grabs players and holds them with its exciting new wide body

[01:13:50] play field design.

[01:13:52] When does it become not new anymore?

[01:13:54] I mean, they had tons of they even did another one this why previously.

[01:13:57] So it's not new.

[01:13:58] Well, we're still in 1980.

[01:14:00] We haven't made it through 12 months.

[01:14:01] True.

[01:14:01] I've not used to this many games in one year simple to understand,

[01:14:05] but devilishly challenging to play.

[01:14:08] Players return again and again to fly through the universe of star race scoring

[01:14:13] features.

[01:14:14] No, they didn't.

[01:14:14] They did not return.

[01:14:17] That is a that is a lie.

[01:14:18] Oh, man, fiery graphics explode off the game and send the players racing

[01:14:23] through the galaxies.

[01:14:24] The sounds of space surround every star race player and complete the universal

[01:14:28] appeal of this wide body wonder.

[01:14:31] All right, let's sum it up.

[01:14:33] So the game is kind of designed to be like racing through space.

[01:14:40] So the ball is kind of like your spaceship or space motorcycle,

[01:14:45] which makes no sense.

[01:14:46] And it's got all these really, I think, very cool loops and pathways to follow along.

[01:14:56] It just doesn't quite work out for some reason.

[01:15:01] All right, let's start with a flipper count.

[01:15:02] What we got here to at the bottom where they normally are.

[01:15:05] We got one on the left, which is there's no sling on the left.

[01:15:10] So it's just sitting on the left on the inside of one of the in lane.

[01:15:14] Then it has won away up the play field in the middle on the right side kind of

[01:15:19] buried in a plastic.

[01:15:21] And that is designed to shoot kind of this really cool drop tank, drop target

[01:15:25] bank and loop at the top.

[01:15:29] Have you played it?

[01:15:31] Um, probably at least once or twice at a show.

[01:15:34] It was that memorable.

[01:15:35] I don't I don't recall anything about it.

[01:15:37] But yes, other than it was really wide.

[01:15:40] Four rollovers at the top's got two pop bumpers in the middle, very kind of crinsky

[01:15:44] ask.

[01:15:45] You can see that they are working together as a team that John Burris and Ed

[01:15:49] Crinsky are, you know, John is absorbing some of those crinsky footprints,

[01:15:54] if you will, fingerprints.

[01:15:55] We got some very targets.

[01:15:56] Yeah.

[01:15:58] I realize very targets.

[01:15:59] And I will say for those who are the complaint about cookie can't cutter layouts

[01:16:04] and that is not got me.

[01:16:07] There is something crazy and new every game.

[01:16:11] Even things like that James Bond time thing that failed.

[01:16:14] But they are trying.

[01:16:17] They are trying a lot of stuff.

[01:16:19] It's cool.

[01:16:19] You can't fault them for trying.

[01:16:21] I haven't I haven't seen one of these in the wild because there's only like 800 of them.

[01:16:25] So there's probably like 200 left.

[01:16:27] This you'd probably see one at a show.

[01:16:30] Yes.

[01:16:30] I would say this is like one of those ones where somebody's like, oh, I got this random

[01:16:34] game I'm going to bring to a show.

[01:16:36] Again, if it was a standard body, it would probably flow better, right?

[01:16:40] The this we're not into the back to the, you know, we're using ramps back to the

[01:16:44] the in lane outlane flow stuff.

[01:16:47] But the ball movement and geometry, I think, would go much better if it was just a little tighter.

[01:16:55] I would assume like all of these standard, all of these wide bodies, especially the ultra wide

[01:17:00] bodies, I betcha if those flippers are not new and strong, really struggle.

[01:17:05] But it has a very target.

[01:17:06] So you should be happy.

[01:17:07] It's all that matters.

[01:17:08] The art's great.

[01:17:09] It's got like these these space motorcycles with these like ladies on them racing through space.

[01:17:15] They're not wearing helmets, which I find a bit concerning because how are they breathing in space?

[01:17:20] Oh, okay.

[01:17:22] Right.

[01:17:23] So I mean, that's completely unrealistic.

[01:17:26] Let's call this the era of experimentation.

[01:17:29] Is that maybe the best way to define this time?

[01:17:32] When it comes to the 80s, they're trying out new things, they're trying out new scoring.

[01:17:35] That's a rigidity, man.

[01:17:37] Yeah.

[01:17:38] Timeline.

[01:17:39] Now I have played a timeline.

[01:17:40] Yes.

[01:17:42] This is actually really cool.

[01:17:43] I love timeline.

[01:17:45] This is where time-based, interesting little bits here or there.

[01:17:49] This is where it shines.

[01:17:50] They really figured something out with this.

[01:17:52] And I think that's because Alan Edwell did a lot of work on this game.

[01:17:58] It is a fantasy time travel adventure theme.

[01:18:02] It's December of 1980.

[01:18:03] So at the end of the year, it's back to the regular kind of wide body, the Dimension 80.

[01:18:08] Dimension 80.

[01:18:09] I love that it has a name.

[01:18:10] Now I'm gonna say that and see how many people look at me funny.

[01:18:14] Oh, it's a Dimension 80.

[01:18:16] Like what?

[01:18:17] Yeah, don't you know it's a big deal.

[01:18:19] Did you listen to the silver ball chronicles?

[01:18:22] Shouldn't you?

[01:18:22] I mean, this is much more intelligent and highbrow than

[01:18:26] slam tilt podcast with Bruce Nightingale.

[01:18:29] Oh, my other podcast, yes.

[01:18:31] Yes.

[01:18:32] Yes.

[01:18:32] www.slamtiltpodcast.com.

[01:18:35] Gotta get that in there.

[01:18:36] Or my co-hosty beats me severely if I don't mention the podcast.

[01:18:39] Yeah.

[01:18:40] He's very violent.

[01:18:42] This sells 3,167 units.

[01:18:45] It's designed, as I mentioned.

[01:18:46] Alan Edwell.

[01:18:48] He did bone busters.

[01:18:49] He did cactus, cactus jacks.

[01:18:51] He did Stargate system, system threes.

[01:18:54] Art by Jerry Simmekus.

[01:18:57] Simkus.

[01:18:58] Simkus?

[01:18:59] He did a lot of work with Dan Fordon.

[01:19:04] And he did a short time.

[01:19:05] He worked with Flight 2000 and Stargazer back in the Stern days.

[01:19:09] But he didn't really stick around for very long.

[01:19:11] This has the new attract mode feature,

[01:19:15] which was the big sales point here on this game.

[01:19:21] I did you know it has the dazzling new attract feature.

[01:19:25] The atomic symbol of timeline flesh is around and around

[01:19:29] with a speeding strobe light pattern.

[01:19:32] The effect is mesmerizing.

[01:19:34] It is cool.

[01:19:35] It is mesmerizing.

[01:19:38] It is cool.

[01:19:39] It does, you know, it's just a pattern, right?

[01:19:41] But these are the things that they're able to do with system 80.

[01:19:44] Now that they've spent a year kind of playing with it

[01:19:47] and they've figured out.

[01:19:49] Now this has a game in a game again.

[01:19:52] So it has the upper play field on the top left.

[01:19:54] Yeah, it's two small flippers into a five bank.

[01:19:58] Upper part of the play field doesn't actually have an upper play field.

[01:20:01] It does.

[01:20:01] That's right.

[01:20:02] It has a section of the upper left

[01:20:04] that you actually plunge into it at the beginning.

[01:20:06] And it's got, and Gottlieb did this a lot.

[01:20:08] They did this on, um,

[01:20:09] trying to remember the boxing one.

[01:20:12] I think it's a system 80 title fight.

[01:20:16] It has something like this.

[01:20:17] Yeah, it's almost in the same spot too.

[01:20:19] This is like a Gottlieb thing.

[01:20:20] Out of all the games I played that Gottlieb did this,

[01:20:23] I like this one the best.

[01:20:25] This, this is very cool.

[01:20:26] This is actually a really good game.

[01:20:27] Too many flippers.

[01:20:28] You have five drop targets.

[01:20:29] When you plunge, it goes in there and it's timed.

[01:20:32] You have so many seconds to try to get all the targets down.

[01:20:35] And then a buzzer will fall.

[01:20:36] In the top, in the top play field.

[01:20:38] Not the regular play.

[01:20:39] It'll go, er, there's like a buzzer that goes off.

[01:20:41] And then it flippers die and the ball drops out.

[01:20:44] And you can hit it back in there during regular play.

[01:20:47] It's not something that you could only hit it in the plunge.

[01:20:49] Exactly.

[01:20:50] So you get it up there.

[01:20:52] You can plunge all the way around into that area.

[01:20:55] Then the flippers die.

[01:20:56] It rolls back into the play field.

[01:20:57] Then you can shoot it back up around if you're fairly skilled.

[01:21:01] Yeah, I know multiple people have this game,

[01:21:03] including one who doesn't even like Gottlieb's.

[01:21:05] And he has this game.

[01:21:06] So you know,

[01:21:06] they didn't blow it like James Bond.

[01:21:08] James Bond was like your regular flippers die.

[01:21:11] So if you don't know what you're doing

[01:21:12] or you just want to flip the ball around,

[01:21:14] you're not, you're not getting anywhere.

[01:21:16] It's terrible.

[01:21:16] Flipper count is four on this game.

[01:21:19] Four flippers.

[01:21:20] Two regular, two many.

[01:21:22] We've got two sets, three sets of drop target banks.

[01:21:26] A four and two fives.

[01:21:31] Three pop bumpers, very dangerous in the middle of the play field.

[01:21:34] Because to get back up into that little play field on the top left,

[01:21:40] you have to squeeze it right by a pop bumper and into like a lane

[01:21:45] that circles back around the top kind of orbit.

[01:21:49] And it falls back into the shooter lane.

[01:21:51] And that's how you get back up to that timed area.

[01:21:54] When you're in the timed area,

[01:21:56] you're trying to add to your multiplier and your bonus,

[01:22:00] which is calculated on a really neat tick-tack tow board.

[01:22:05] I love what they call it.

[01:22:06] Atomic tick-tack tow.

[01:22:09] Yeah, because it'll explode if you don't do it right.

[01:22:11] Player versus machine in this contemporized classic game.

[01:22:14] To win three Xs in a row,

[01:22:16] player tries the many skillshots positioned all over

[01:22:19] timelines play field.

[01:22:20] So it's a play field now.

[01:22:22] It's no longer a playable interest.

[01:22:23] For each X he earns, again, it's always a he.

[01:22:27] Come on, Gottlieb.

[01:22:28] Bad.

[01:22:28] Brutal.

[01:22:29] Actually, to be fair,

[01:22:30] Gottlieb was the first for seeing to have the non-gender specific.

[01:22:35] It would say,

[01:22:37] machine broken, call service person on your system threes.

[01:22:41] For each X he earns, the game counters with an oh,

[01:22:44] every winner draw advances the multiplier.

[01:22:47] This fun feature is the centerpiece of timelines action.

[01:22:51] Yeah, so if you just want to get the ball and shoot it at some drop targets and flip around,

[01:22:56] you can do that.

[01:22:57] But if you want to play the medicame,

[01:22:59] it's got that in spades.

[01:23:01] Very, very, very cool and amazing art.

[01:23:04] Let's dive into that right now.

[01:23:06] The theme is like time travel as you can tell by timeline.

[01:23:11] But what's really cool is it's like jammed a bunch of different times and time lines together.

[01:23:18] At the bottom, they're like

[01:23:21] female gladiators of some sort,

[01:23:24] like fighting against a futuristic robot with like lasers and stuff.

[01:23:29] Which is super cool.

[01:23:31] It looks awesome.

[01:23:33] It is so much fun.

[01:23:36] And that atomic sign that's in the center of the play field is also in the back glass,

[01:23:41] which is kind of like that's the opening and space time that this robot is coming through.

[01:23:48] The atomic thing.

[01:23:50] The play field itself has really cool art too.

[01:23:53] It's a very similar image to what's on the back glass.

[01:23:57] There's mountains on the side.

[01:24:00] There's like a fight going in the middle.

[01:24:03] It's neat.

[01:24:03] This is a great game.

[01:24:04] If you can play one of these, play it to death because it is unique and it is cool.

[01:24:09] I love timeline.

[01:24:11] But we got to follow that up with another space theme that is February 1981.

[01:24:17] Force 2.

[01:24:20] It is space combat adventure theme sells 2000 units even.

[01:24:25] This is designed by John Osborne.

[01:24:27] There's a new name.

[01:24:29] Art by David Moore.

[01:24:31] So why is it's Force 2?

[01:24:34] So was there a Force 1?

[01:24:36] There was not a Force 1.

[01:24:37] So then why would there be a Force 2?

[01:24:39] I don't know.

[01:24:40] So it's like an Xbox 1.

[01:24:41] When there was already an Xbox 1, like the first one.

[01:24:45] It was terrible.

[01:24:46] Multi-ball art, the crew of the alien star cruiser is preparing for space combat.

[01:24:52] Get ready for adventure.

[01:24:54] Yeah.

[01:24:55] And I'm wondering.

[01:24:56] It says multi-ball right on the flyer, which was trademarked by Williams.

[01:25:02] I'm wondering how they even were allowed to use that if they had to pay.

[01:25:05] Because it's literally formatted the same way.

[01:25:07] Multi with a dash and then ball.

[01:25:10] God leave head and head multi-ball.

[01:25:12] That wasn't their thing.

[01:25:13] That wasn't their thing.

[01:25:14] But this game has four flippers.

[01:25:16] And you know, four flippers mean vertical and horizontal action all over the board.

[01:25:20] Okay, it's a board again.

[01:25:22] Yes.

[01:25:22] Man, they're not consistent.

[01:25:24] It's a playboard.

[01:25:25] It's a playfield.

[01:25:25] It's a playboard.

[01:25:27] And four flippers.

[01:25:28] Horizontal movement is the worst thing you could possibly have in pinball.

[01:25:31] You know that.

[01:25:32] This game plays all right.

[01:25:34] It's more known for a couple things.

[01:25:36] Let's start with the back glass.

[01:25:39] Yes.

[01:25:40] The art leaves a lot to be desired.

[01:25:43] The aliens' heads look like phallic symbols.

[01:25:50] They do.

[01:25:50] I've never noticed that.

[01:25:52] There's no way that's what everyone I know calls this game.

[01:25:55] They have like a, it's very helmet-like.

[01:25:58] If you will.

[01:25:59] Yes.

[01:25:59] Yeah.

[01:25:59] That's what they look like.

[01:26:01] I was going to say that it's like they have a jock strap on their face,

[01:26:05] but it's on their eyebrows instead of like down low.

[01:26:08] Yeah.

[01:26:08] It's very odd.

[01:26:10] And one of the,

[01:26:12] might have mentioned this in a previous episode,

[01:26:13] but in the movie, Rocky III,

[01:26:17] at the beginning of the movie,

[01:26:19] Pauli goes into an arcade and he sees a rocky machine.

[01:26:22] And he throws his liquor bottle through the back glass.

[01:26:26] It's not a rocky machine because it didn't exist yet.

[01:26:29] Hmm.

[01:26:30] There wasn't made yet as we'll see.

[01:26:33] It was a force two.

[01:26:34] Well, it was probably deserved it.

[01:26:36] It was a force two with a prop back glass in it.

[01:26:40] So where are the flippers in this game all over the place?

[01:26:44] We got two at the bottom.

[01:26:45] We got one in the middle right and one all the way at the top

[01:26:49] and the upper left to hit the foreback.

[01:26:51] Like a way at the top.

[01:26:53] Yep.

[01:26:53] This doesn't have your traditional Italian bottom,

[01:26:56] inline outline sling.

[01:26:59] It has on the left side inline outline sling

[01:27:01] and then a flipper on the left.

[01:27:02] On the right side it has a flipper,

[01:27:04] which is attached to just a rubber.

[01:27:07] And then there's a kicker basically.

[01:27:11] It falls into the kicker and kicks it up the playfield

[01:27:14] into the drop target bank on the left side

[01:27:17] just below the upper left flipper.

[01:27:19] Kind of like an incredible Hulk.

[01:27:22] You know how it's got those flippers?

[01:27:24] Yeah.

[01:27:25] Instead of it being vertical pointing up the playfield,

[01:27:27] it's kind of pointing to the left.

[01:27:31] This game looks okay.

[01:27:33] But the art is terrible.

[01:27:38] There's rarely times where I'm like,

[01:27:40] this art is bad.

[01:27:42] This is terrible.

[01:27:44] But you're not going to get any disagreements.

[01:27:46] If the art is supposed to make you want to play the game,

[01:27:48] this makes you more look at like,

[01:27:50] huh?

[01:27:51] What is going on?

[01:27:53] And there's like one alien who's like,

[01:27:55] clearly the female who's trying to like,

[01:27:58] draw you in and she's got like,

[01:28:03] the same odd shaped head,

[01:28:05] but they put hair on her.

[01:28:07] They put ladies hair.

[01:28:08] It's a woman, yes.

[01:28:09] She's got more chest stuff.

[01:28:11] It's just, it's just,

[01:28:13] in general, it's embarrassing.

[01:28:17] I feel so bad for you, David Moore.

[01:28:20] He did the art for that.

[01:28:22] Now, David Moore is quite famous.

[01:28:24] He would do a lot of those system 80 games,

[01:28:28] 80 B games.

[01:28:29] He worked at Gottlieb Premiere.

[01:28:30] He did cactus jacks.

[01:28:32] He did class of 1812.

[01:28:34] But this you can tell was obviously his first kick at the can.

[01:28:38] And he course corrected very quickly on his next game.

[01:28:43] Oh, it must be one you like.

[01:28:44] This is, it's not that I like it.

[01:28:47] It's just better.

[01:28:48] Hey, Pint Heads, I just wanted to let you know

[01:28:51] that when I'm not making cheesy jokes

[01:29:58] Mars God of War.

[01:30:00] This is a combat theme, March of 81, 5,240 units,

[01:30:08] John Burist Design, David Moore on Art,

[01:30:11] and software by John Burist.

[01:30:15] Very common for everybody at GotLeab to wear multiple hats.

[01:30:19] And this is their Gorgar.

[01:30:21] Their first game would speech.

[01:30:23] It would have the Voltrax SCO1.

[01:30:27] That sounds fancy, huh?

[01:30:29] Voltrax SCO1, that does sound cool.

[01:30:32] It sounds cool.

[01:30:33] How do they promote that on this thing?

[01:30:35] They must have some fancy marketing for this.

[01:30:37] The mighty warrior of the gods challenges you.

[01:30:41] You think they would advertise the talking more,

[01:30:43] but probably since other companies that already had the talking

[01:30:46] for like a year and a half,

[01:30:48] they were probably a little behind on that when you think about it.

[01:30:50] You don't want to sort of point out the fact

[01:30:52] that you're two years behind.

[01:30:54] I mean, think about your first,

[01:30:58] what's your first talking game for Williams?

[01:31:00] You have Gorgar from 1979.

[01:31:03] For Bali, it's Xenon, 1980.

[01:31:07] And then even Stern, they have a flight 2000, 1980.

[01:31:12] Yeah, which is basically mid to early 80 as well.

[01:31:16] And we're now in 1981 before Gottlieh finally has some speech going on.

[01:31:22] But here in Mars, God of War,

[01:31:24] you enter the battlefield of Mars,

[01:31:26] overlooking his home planet.

[01:31:28] The God of War supervises battle on this fantastic new pinball play field.

[01:31:32] We're back to play field again.

[01:31:33] Great features such as hyper force,

[01:31:36] selectable pop bumpers and lanes,

[01:31:39] the Stargate ramp.

[01:31:41] I think the first appearance of the famous Stargate ramp.

[01:31:43] It is.

[01:31:44] Last chance ball and many others.

[01:31:46] Entertainment thrill, all brave warriors who enter here.

[01:31:49] So gaze closely upon Mars.

[01:31:52] Once seen, he has never forgotten.

[01:31:54] And again, the Stargate ramp is basically,

[01:31:58] it's an up-down ramp.

[01:32:00] So a ramp that raises and lowers,

[01:32:01] so you can shoot underneath it.

[01:32:02] Exactly.

[01:32:03] So you shoot under it, it goes through the orbit.

[01:32:05] When the ramp drops, when the coil energizes the rope,

[01:32:08] it drops, then you can shoot up it.

[01:32:11] And it basically shoots through a similar tube, a xenon,

[01:32:15] and drops into basically a ball lock.

[01:32:17] And they're advertising the selectable lanes and pop bumpers.

[01:32:22] Now, the selectable lanes thing had been around since Williams did it with firepower.

[01:32:26] Yeah, that's where you're moving the lit lane at the top of the play field.

[01:32:31] I'm just looking at it somewhere on the fire where they mentioned.

[01:32:33] It talks.

[01:32:35] But nothing.

[01:32:36] It doesn't really promote that, does it?

[01:32:38] It does not.

[01:32:39] Oh, here it is.

[01:32:40] On the very last page.

[01:32:41] Oh yeah.

[01:32:42] Mars Voice commands you.

[01:32:45] It speaks to each player challenging and instructing them through their battle.

[01:32:49] Gottlieb's sophisticated new voice system delivers a fuller vocabulary

[01:32:54] than ever possible before in talking games.

[01:32:57] Okay.

[01:32:58] Okay, so it's there.

[01:33:00] It's just, it's just they didn't hitch in the head with a hammer about it,

[01:33:04] which is nice.

[01:33:06] Now, this has the back box,

[01:33:08] infinity glass.

[01:33:09] Infinity, yeah, infinity lighting is so cool.

[01:33:12] Multiple back glasses.

[01:33:14] Yeah, it kind of got like a like a tint to it and it looks like it kind of goes

[01:33:18] through a tube through the hole all the way there.

[01:33:20] Infinity lights that go around the perimeter.

[01:33:23] That's like a black hole zing on.

[01:33:26] The stranger things topper does that.

[01:33:29] Very neat.

[01:33:30] This is a pretty good game.

[01:33:31] I only ever flipped it once.

[01:33:35] And it was broken, so I didn't really actually play it.

[01:33:37] It's a very cool layout because it's got your traditional flippers at the bottom.

[01:33:42] It's got no slings.

[01:33:44] Then it, but it's got two flippers a little bit higher up.

[01:33:47] Got the drop targets.

[01:33:49] It's got the stargate ramp and the appearance of the new spinner.

[01:33:55] Yep.

[01:33:56] The new metal heavy weighted sparkly looking.

[01:34:02] Yeah, I call it the sparkly spinner, yeah.

[01:34:04] It's amazing.

[01:34:07] The last I looked, it's still not available at the parts suppliers.

[01:34:11] I don't get it.

[01:34:12] They use them like on every game from here on out pretty much in 80.

[01:34:16] They use this spinner.

[01:34:18] The artwork's pretty cool.

[01:34:19] It's like you're in a space battle right on the play field.

[01:34:22] In the back glass, it's like a Roman god of war thing, which is weird.

[01:34:27] But then the play field is like space because Mars is a planet.

[01:34:30] And I guess you have to fight against a planet.

[01:34:33] The funny part about the art is that if you look at the ships on the play field,

[01:34:41] they are remarkably similar to the early snow speeder examples

[01:34:49] from the Empire Strikes Back film drawn by a Star Wars concept artist, Joe Johnson,

[01:34:56] from February of 78.

[01:34:58] The image of the drawing was produced in a book called the Empire Strikes Back sketchbook

[01:35:03] and was released in June of 1980, which was shortly after the movie's release.

[01:35:08] So the following year, those images of the snow speeders that weren't quite like the ones

[01:35:15] in the movies ended up on this play field.

[01:35:18] Don't tell George Lucas.

[01:35:19] I'm sure he doesn't care.

[01:35:21] Sure he wouldn't have noticed.

[01:35:24] But yeah, yeah, there are snow speeders.

[01:35:26] They are indeed snow speeders pretty close to what the original images were.

[01:35:31] So it's a good game.

[01:35:34] It's a good game.

[01:35:35] But is it as good as the next one, Ron?

[01:35:41] We have a license again.

[01:35:43] Yeah, it's the fictional license character, the Pink Panther,

[01:35:48] March of 81, 2,840 units.

[01:35:51] Oh, that's a bummer.

[01:35:52] Designed by John Burris, Art once again by Jerry Simkus and Software by the man of many hats,

[01:36:00] John Burris.

[01:36:01] So the Pink Panther franchise.

[01:36:05] I remember Pink Panther from when I was a kid from the classic

[01:36:10] Hannah Barbera cartoon.

[01:36:13] Is it Hannah Barbera?

[01:36:14] No, no, it's Fritz Freeling and his company.

[01:36:18] Yeah.

[01:36:19] What is it called?

[01:36:20] De Pati or something?

[01:36:22] De Pati Freeling?

[01:36:23] It must say here.

[01:36:24] Yeah, it's right there.

[01:36:26] Ah, so it is the De Pati Freeling Art House Pink Panther.

[01:36:31] I remember this show on Saturday morning cartoons for some reason.

[01:36:35] It's very weird because when I was a kid, I would always watch these old

[01:36:39] rerun TV shows instead of like the newer ones until, you know,

[01:36:43] the real ghost busters and teenage mutant intertools and all those appeared.

[01:36:47] I always ended up watching a lot of Hannah Barbera, a lot of Pink Panther

[01:36:51] loony tunes for some reason.

[01:36:53] Very weird.

[01:36:54] The original franchise of the Pink Panther is basically an American comedy series of

[01:37:02] comedy mystery films, which follow an inept French police detective named Inspector Jacques Clousseau.

[01:37:10] The franchise began with the release of the classic Pink Panther film in 1963.

[01:37:17] Then a movie was released every five years or so, including in the early 1980s.

[01:37:25] It was once again rebooted in 2006.

[01:37:30] See, the original Pink Panther movie, Inspector Clousseau is just another character.

[01:37:35] He literally was just the, he wasn't the main character,

[01:37:39] but he was so over in the movie they just decided to immediately make a sequel with him as the

[01:37:43] main character.

[01:37:44] They had to spin him off.

[01:37:45] Yep.

[01:37:46] Yeah, so the movies started out with a 90% rotten tomatoes and then a 93% respectively.

[01:37:55] Then it dropped with every movie, including the new rebooted 2006 Steve Martin versions,

[01:38:02] which received a 21% and a follow up receiving a 12% rating.

[01:38:08] Not worth your time, folks, even if you like Steve Martin.

[01:38:12] Yeah, I would say this license though is based more on the

[01:38:16] the actual Pink Panther show, the TV cartoons.

[01:38:19] Yeah, so the TV cartoons, the animated TV show, which was called the Pink Panther Show,

[01:38:25] had various reiterations and it ran almost consecutively from 1969 to 1980.

[01:38:31] It was produced by David H. DePatte and Fritz Furlong.

[01:38:36] No, no, Fritz Freeling.

[01:38:38] Fritz, Fritz, you spelled it wrong here, it's not Fritz, it's Fritz Freeling and his real name

[01:38:44] was Isadora Freeling.

[01:38:46] He is a, you're into animation like I am, Warner Brothers.

[01:38:50] He was one of their main directors, guys like Chuck Jones, Fritz Freeling, Robert McKimson.

[01:38:56] Fritz was a big deal with the Looney Tunes.

[01:38:58] Yes, because I remember seeing his name all the time.

[01:39:01] Yep.

[01:39:02] And of course, the Marvel TV shows from the 1980s.

[01:39:06] And you, you, you, you, Semity Sam is based on Fritz Freeling.

[01:39:08] No way.

[01:39:09] He was a, he was a really short guy who supposedly had a temper.

[01:39:12] He can get pissed off.

[01:39:13] So they literally made the character to kind of make fun of him.

[01:39:16] Yep.

[01:39:16] Let's go to this machine.

[01:39:17] It's very blue.

[01:39:18] The back glass is a bit of a letdown because it's like a,

[01:39:24] a thief.

[01:39:25] I don't know about that.

[01:39:27] It's more of a, do we put a big pink Panther on the back glass?

[01:39:31] Or do we put a woman on the back glass?

[01:39:33] Okay, I give it a, woman was better than a big pink Panther.

[01:39:37] And the pink Panther is kind of just off to the left.

[01:39:40] Yeah, he's on there.

[01:39:41] He's almost hard to find at times.

[01:39:42] Like, where's the big Panther?

[01:39:43] Oh, there he is.

[01:39:44] So she's like stealing stuff.

[01:39:46] Yep.

[01:39:47] Cause in the original movie, I think it was,

[01:39:50] well, was David Niven was the thief,

[01:39:51] but he was with the other woman who was also in it with him or whatever.

[01:39:55] What's the secret of our new pinball game, Ron?

[01:39:58] The secret?

[01:39:59] It doesn't really tell you what the secret is.

[01:40:01] No, it says the secrets out.

[01:40:03] Oh, pink Panther is the best multi-ball game ever.

[01:40:08] Wow.

[01:40:08] Whoa, that's like you're releasing the game

[01:40:11] and it's already the best ever.

[01:40:12] You just know.

[01:40:13] That's like telling somebody that you had the theme

[01:40:18] that everybody wanted of the first three movies of a beloved franchise.

[01:40:22] And then saying you passed on that to do the worst entry of that franchise.

[01:40:26] That's a big disappointment to set up for people.

[01:40:29] Super fast action.

[01:40:31] Twice the ball velocity off the flippers,

[01:40:34] pump bumpers and kicking rubbers.

[01:40:36] Twice the velocity.

[01:40:37] Easy to follow strategy.

[01:40:39] Designed for all players to enjoy fabulous features.

[01:40:43] Multi-ball.

[01:40:44] Multi-ball special.

[01:40:45] Hidden captive holes and more.

[01:40:48] Okay.

[01:40:48] All right, I'm in.

[01:40:49] They got me.

[01:40:50] We need a flipper count.

[01:40:51] All right, let's bring up the play field here in my,

[01:40:54] on IPDB, the internet pinball database,

[01:40:57] ipdb.org.

[01:40:59] Whoa, only three?

[01:41:00] Wow, it sounded like there was like a dozen with the kickers and the...

[01:41:07] This looks kind of fun.

[01:41:09] It's okay.

[01:41:10] It's got a pop bumper on the left side,

[01:41:12] right on the in lane.

[01:41:14] A little Rick and Morty ask, but it also has a...

[01:41:16] Literally in the, yeah, the Rick and Morty position.

[01:41:18] It's dangerous.

[01:41:20] It looks cool.

[01:41:21] It adds some flare and something different.

[01:41:23] It's got a capture hole on the right.

[01:41:25] And on the left, it's got the drop targets,

[01:41:27] drop targets in the middle.

[01:41:28] No orbit shot.

[01:41:30] No spinner.

[01:41:30] So that's a bit of a wallpump.

[01:41:32] Looks fun.

[01:41:34] Haven't played it.

[01:41:34] Can't really make any comments.

[01:41:36] Yeah, I played it a few times.

[01:41:37] I can't remember much about it.

[01:41:39] And it's multiple ball play.

[01:41:41] Wow.

[01:41:43] Cool. I guess if you're a big pig panther fan,

[01:41:46] right, this would be a really cool thing to have in your basement.

[01:41:48] You'd be, you know, there's gotta be,

[01:41:50] there's gotta be big pig panther fans out there, right?

[01:41:52] There's James Bond fans, there's Pez people,

[01:41:55] there's...

[01:41:55] I bet sure there's someone who got this game,

[01:41:57] then re-themed it to be the Inspector Closel pig panther.

[01:42:00] Yeah, yeah.

[01:42:01] Somebody who just loves Steve Martins.

[01:42:03] No, no, no.

[01:42:04] No, no.

[01:42:04] No, no.

[01:42:05] No, no, no, no.

[01:42:06] No, no, no, no, no.

[01:42:07] You put Peter Sellers on there.

[01:42:09] Come on.

[01:42:09] Yeah, that's right.

[01:42:10] Come on.

[01:42:11] That's right. Let's go into volcano.

[01:42:14] This is a caveman dinosaur natural disaster.

[01:42:17] Okay.

[01:42:18] For a second, I thought you were telling me to go into a volcano.

[01:42:20] No, no, that would just be dangerous.

[01:42:23] We're all about safety here.

[01:42:24] This is September of 81, 3655 units,

[01:42:28] designed by John Burris, Jerry Simkus on Art Again and software by John Burris.

[01:42:34] While the domestic games had speech,

[01:42:36] there are export games to the European market and to Australia

[01:42:41] that did not have speech.

[01:42:43] An owner from France actually told IPDB

[01:42:46] that his game has an MA55,

[01:42:50] which is an early system 80 soundboard with no speech.

[01:42:54] Apparently, they don't know if all the games intended for export

[01:42:59] had a lack of speech, or if it was just this one off.

[01:43:03] I made a comment a moment ago about the colors of play fields and pinball machines

[01:43:10] that I just despise.

[01:43:13] Orange and red are on the top of that list,

[01:43:15] and this machine is all orange.

[01:43:18] Wow.

[01:43:18] All red.

[01:43:19] So you don't like Deadpool then?

[01:43:22] Oh, I got him there.

[01:43:23] I don't really like Deadpool to be honest.

[01:43:26] I'm trying to find a way because it's not offensively bad.

[01:43:30] Let's put it that way.

[01:43:32] But it is a bit red.

[01:43:35] Yeah, I'm not a fan.

[01:43:37] But volcano, you are basically pinball with pal.

[01:43:42] I don't know what that means.

[01:43:43] Interesting picture for the on the flyer.

[01:43:47] Yeah, there's a lady with caveman.

[01:43:51] Yeah, yeah,

[01:43:52] but an actual photo.

[01:43:54] It's not art.

[01:43:55] Yeah, I guess this pin needed all the help it could get.

[01:43:59] Explosive action, explosive profits, pal.

[01:44:04] I guess that's the sound an eruption makes.

[01:44:07] It has an amazing spinner on the left side.

[01:44:09] It is wide open.

[01:44:11] This is John Beerus again who did Mars God of War.

[01:44:14] So we put the spinner in a very similar place.

[01:44:16] He knows how satisfying that that can be.

[01:44:20] It's also got a very unique,

[01:44:23] it's not a skill shot because you don't do it off the plunge.

[01:44:26] But it's like you get up to this little

[01:44:30] inverted raised area in the top left.

[01:44:35] It's known as the crater.

[01:44:37] And you go up into that area and you can kind of fall into crater one two or one two three or four

[01:44:45] when the ball gets up in there.

[01:44:47] And I don't get it.

[01:44:50] It must be neat.

[01:44:51] You got to kind of shoot it up like a jump ramp sort of.

[01:44:55] Have you played it? Do you know how that works?

[01:44:57] I mean, I played it.

[01:44:58] Yeah, you hit it up there and it goes in whichever hole it's going to go in.

[01:45:02] And it just kind of comes out of that set, right?

[01:45:04] It's like, I mean, if you if you got some more details on that,

[01:45:07] I'd love to know, silverballcronicles.gmail.com.

[01:45:10] But let's do a flipper count.

[01:45:13] So we got one away up there by the crater on the top on the top right side.

[01:45:19] And we've got two on the bottom.

[01:45:22] So not crazy, but it is unique.

[01:45:27] The flipper placement of the top one is very cool.

[01:45:30] It's like a way up there.

[01:45:32] And pop bumpers on the left and right side on the top of the slings.

[01:45:36] Very dangerous.

[01:45:38] I'm trying to remember if this is the one that has the millionaire style

[01:45:43] moving,

[01:45:44] late shooter guide that moves back and forth.

[01:45:48] Oh, I'm trying to find somewhere where it mentions if it has that feature.

[01:45:52] Because it was either this or Mars God of War that has it.

[01:45:55] And I always get them confused at which one has it.

[01:45:58] Okay, what do you think about the caveman art there?

[01:46:01] So it's like cavemen running away from a volcano and there's like

[01:46:05] teradactyls and fire.

[01:46:09] Fire.

[01:46:09] It's very red.

[01:46:12] Yeah.

[01:46:12] Man, you have just hatred of red.

[01:46:15] It's it's it's it's and the art is just it's the I don't know.

[01:46:21] Go look it up.

[01:46:22] IPDB show notes are have a lot of that stuff.

[01:46:28] Yeah, I think I think it's volcano.

[01:46:29] If you look at the shooter lane and you see the guy the way curves around,

[01:46:34] I believe that moves back and forth.

[01:46:37] If you think of a millionaire,

[01:46:40] the one cool feature of millionaire does the same thing.

[01:46:44] Very neat.

[01:46:45] And if I'm completely wrong, you can email us at uh,

[01:46:48] silver roll chronicles at gmail.com and tell me I screwed up again.

[01:46:51] So if you if you really want to cause trouble,

[01:46:54] you can send that to slamtailpodcastgmail.com.

[01:46:58] Please don't.

[01:46:58] Yeah, that's Ron's other podcast.

[01:47:01] But let's get into the let's get into where it matters.

[01:47:04] Oh, where it matters.

[01:47:05] This game doesn't matter.

[01:47:06] Oh, it well compared to the sales of the next game.

[01:47:10] It doesn't matter.

[01:47:12] This is black hole,

[01:47:13] October of 81.

[01:47:15] So we're towards the end of 81.

[01:47:16] This sells

[01:47:18] 8,774 units.

[01:47:21] This is a home run into a slam dunk championship winner.

[01:47:27] This is a big deal.

[01:47:28] We're in the low threes high twos.

[01:47:32] And then we just smash it.

[01:47:34] This has a co-designed by John Beerus in shing lamb,

[01:47:39] who I couldn't find a whole lot of information on.

[01:47:42] I really search.

[01:47:43] So if you have any information on shing lamb,

[01:47:46] please send it over to silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[01:47:50] Art by Terry Dozaff,

[01:47:52] who also did haunted house and the software by John Beerus.

[01:47:57] Now the legend goes, Ron,

[01:48:00] that this two level play field design was written on a napkin

[01:48:05] in a bar after hours.

[01:48:08] And then a prototype was made.

[01:48:11] Black hole, it was a Hollywood movie,

[01:48:14] sci-fi movie produced by Disney, and it was directed by Gary Nelson.

[01:48:19] That this was not based on.

[01:48:21] This was not based on that movie.

[01:48:23] It just happened to come out around a similar time.

[01:48:26] Yeah, two years later.

[01:48:26] Similar theme.

[01:48:27] Yeah, but it's not.

[01:48:29] I think Disney would have had an issue with that.

[01:48:31] Now the production budget of the movie was 20 million,

[01:48:34] plus another six million in advertising.

[01:48:36] It was a massive flop for Disney.

[01:48:39] It had a 38% rotten tomatoes.

[01:48:43] Neal DeCrasse Tyson, who is the astrophysicist, deemed the film,

[01:48:47] to be the least scientifically accurate movie of all time.

[01:48:50] But it had a cool robot.

[01:48:51] It did have a cool robot.

[01:48:52] I haven't seen this.

[01:48:53] When I was a kid, I'm trying to remember,

[01:48:55] I think Maximilian, I think, was the name of the robot.

[01:48:58] You have like, as the arm came out and spun or something.

[01:49:01] I was a kid.

[01:49:02] I thought it was cool.

[01:49:03] Yeah, of course it was cool.

[01:49:04] This is not based on that at all.

[01:49:07] Not at all.

[01:49:08] There's no similarities to this.

[01:49:10] It just happens to be a black hole.

[01:49:12] Round time of a movie called the black hole.

[01:49:14] It could have been an inspiration, but I mean,

[01:49:16] they couldn't use any assets from the movie.

[01:49:17] Obviously, it's Disney.

[01:49:18] And it got leaves on by Columbia Pictures.

[01:49:21] So I don't think that would have worked out.

[01:49:23] Apparently, Disney Plus looking to reboot this.

[01:49:26] I mean, and even then, Disney was very apt to sue you.

[01:49:30] I mean, they sued Williams for Robotron

[01:49:33] because it had Tron in the title of the game.

[01:49:38] They're pretty protective.

[01:49:40] Discover the magnetic attraction of black hole.

[01:49:45] That's the thing.

[01:49:46] It's not the black hole like the movie.

[01:49:48] It's just black hole.

[01:49:50] Black hole features a hidden play field inside the cabinet,

[01:49:53] visible to the player through the upper play field window.

[01:49:56] Multiple ball play is achieved when both captive balls are filled

[01:50:01] and player enters the black hole.

[01:50:04] Yeah.

[01:50:05] And if you want a game that shows your got Lee Benjeneering,

[01:50:10] this is it.

[01:50:11] This game is awesome.

[01:50:12] This game, I would own this game in a heartbeat.

[01:50:14] I've played it a couple of times.

[01:50:17] I played it at modern pinball in New York,

[01:50:19] in Manhattan a couple of times before they closed.

[01:50:22] I really love this game.

[01:50:25] It just has kind of one critical error.

[01:50:28] How many flippers?

[01:50:29] Woo, okay, let's count them up.

[01:50:31] Four, oh my goodness, there's two in the lower play fields.

[01:50:35] Six.

[01:50:36] Six flippers.

[01:50:38] Six coils running all of those.

[01:50:40] Six brackets holding all of them up.

[01:50:43] This is a, uh, what did they call it?

[01:50:47] High maintenance machine.

[01:50:49] Six flippers, six pop-up.

[01:50:51] Three slings, one five bank drop target, two four bank drop targets,

[01:50:57] one three bank drop target, two kickout holes, two play fields, one control gate,

[01:51:05] one spinning backbock disc.

[01:51:07] The motor will die on your spinning disc and you will have to fix it.

[01:51:10] The back glass.

[01:51:12] Let's start, let's start at the top work our way down.

[01:51:14] The back glass is again the infinity back glass with the chasing lights.

[01:51:18] Yep.

[01:51:19] Two piece back glass.

[01:51:20] It's got the art of dudes being sucked into a play field or into a black hole.

[01:51:27] It rotates.

[01:51:28] Yep.

[01:51:28] So not only do the lights rotate, the image in the background rotates that creates like this

[01:51:37] of falling effect and it works to perfection.

[01:51:42] It is really smart.

[01:51:44] Then we get into the play field and you've got like a standard wide body,

[01:51:49] got-leab system 80, I'm sorry, dimension 80.

[01:51:54] But the play field in the middle has a hole in it with a piece of plastic or a lexan over it

[01:51:58] and there's another play field underneath it.

[01:52:02] But it's not in the same direction.

[01:52:04] The flippers are on the other side and the play field goes up the other way.

[01:52:09] That's so awesome.

[01:52:11] And it's got drop targets on that lower play field.

[01:52:14] We're not talking like the monsters down there.

[01:52:18] This is like an actual play field.

[01:52:19] Did we mention multiple and speech?

[01:52:22] Oh, the sound package.

[01:52:25] The speech package.

[01:52:27] Except the sound of wind, which wouldn't hear space anyway.

[01:52:30] It literally sounds like someone got in front of the mic and just went

[01:52:36] that's what it sounds like someone did.

[01:52:37] But then when it hits slings, the stuff goes like

[01:52:41] now on escapes the black hole.

[01:52:44] The voice, the robotic voice.

[01:52:46] It's like flight 2000, right?

[01:52:47] It's like it's just so good.

[01:52:51] So good.

[01:52:52] They have a patent on method and apparatus of mounting a play field window.

[01:52:59] A pinball machine having multi level.

[01:53:02] Oh, we got to use the British guy.

[01:53:03] Uh oh.

[01:53:05] A pinball machine having multi level play fields with a transparent window.

[01:53:10] Mountain, at least, an upper level play field to allow observation

[01:53:14] there through to a lower level play field.

[01:53:16] The window is mounted on a ledge in an opening in the upper level play field.

[01:53:20] Compressible rings and screws extending through the window rings and

[01:53:24] ledge to compress that rings until the window is in the same plane as said play field.

[01:53:29] In other words, an adjustable the plexiglass or whatever they're using.

[01:53:33] It's adjustable.

[01:53:34] Yeah, and it's got, you know, the the screws won't back out because they're in there

[01:53:38] nice and tight and it's flat with the play field.

[01:53:41] Like, so if you wanted to make a lower play field with like a

[01:53:44] a piece of removable and replaceable plastic, you got to pay got leave.

[01:53:52] They got the patent on that.

[01:53:53] The lower play field is very cool.

[01:53:56] It's lots of fun, but it has a massive critical error,

[01:54:00] which I'm very sad about.

[01:54:02] So you want to play on the upper play field as much as you can

[01:54:07] until you open the reentry gate.

[01:54:10] So you know what I'm talking about here, right, Ron?

[01:54:13] So basically if you get on the lower play field and you don't complete at least one

[01:54:18] bank of drop targets down there, your scrooge.

[01:54:21] It's the same as losing the ball.

[01:54:23] It will it will eject the ball out directly into the outlane and you lose.

[01:54:29] Oh, so that's really hard.

[01:54:30] It's the black hole.

[01:54:33] You will get sucked into the outlane.

[01:54:35] Yeah, so when you get down there, you're down there and unless you knock down that

[01:54:38] drop target bank before you get back up,

[01:54:41] that's it.

[01:54:42] You're out.

[01:54:43] Yep.

[01:54:43] I feel like if it was open once on the first go through and then it closed and then you were out.

[01:54:51] If you didn't shoot it down, I think it would have been much better.

[01:54:53] Because what you do is you're like, I want to get on that bottom play field.

[01:54:56] And you get down there, you flip it twice and the ball comes back up and out the outlane.

[01:55:00] It doesn't give you enough fun.

[01:55:02] On the flip side of that, it is pretty challenging and it is kind of exciting when you can get that to work.

[01:55:08] You're going into the black hole.

[01:55:09] You have to do something or you die.

[01:55:12] Take a look at the under play field image of this thing.

[01:55:14] It's wonderful, isn't it?

[01:55:16] Holy s***.

[01:55:17] There's a lot of stuff under there.

[01:55:18] Yep.

[01:55:19] And that's only one play field.

[01:55:20] Yeah, there's a whole other play field.

[01:55:22] And it's got that big tube that goes all the way across with that Mac with that has multiple ball

[01:55:27] positions and stuff.

[01:55:28] It's insane.

[01:55:29] God, this thing must be heavy.

[01:55:31] Great engineering.

[01:55:32] When it works.

[01:55:34] It has two transformers.

[01:55:36] It's so big.

[01:55:37] It's got a massive fuse holder on the right side because there's so much that's going to explode.

[01:55:42] These system 80s had a bit of a grounding issue.

[01:55:46] Are you aware of that, Ron?

[01:55:48] Yeah, they're known to have grounding issues.

[01:55:50] Did you know though the pop-uppers on black hole, they are so powerful.

[01:55:55] They're like the pop-upper in TNA type power.

[01:55:59] Like insane.

[01:56:00] Whoa.

[01:56:00] Absolutely insane.

[01:56:02] They have pop-bomper boards on the system 80s.

[01:56:06] So on most of the games from a Valley or Williams, the pop-bumpers were controlled by the driver board

[01:56:14] in the back.

[01:56:15] These had a driver board, but the actual I.C. chips and things like that to run the boards

[01:56:24] were actually mounted under the play field.

[01:56:25] So if you had four pop-bumpers, you had four independent pop-bumper boards,

[01:56:30] which would often cause trouble.

[01:56:32] A lot of it was they didn't have enough

[01:56:35] transistors.

[01:56:36] So they had the pop-upper boards, but the one thing about the pop-upper boards is also

[01:56:40] they would prevent the thing from getting locked on.

[01:56:42] Yes.

[01:56:43] So the board would burn out before it would burn out your entire back box.

[01:56:47] I'm like, oh Williams, where if you hit the pop-upper and you just left the thing down,

[01:56:52] the pop-upper engaged it would just stay engaged till it burned up.

[01:56:55] Yeah, it would literally melt.

[01:56:57] This I think is the biggest departure away from the system one system,

[01:57:03] was that when they were designing system 80, they were at least smart enough from what they

[01:57:07] learned, Gottlieb, that they would be able to create modules and add on to system 80.

[01:57:15] And that's inevitably how all of these sound boards and pop-bumper boards and things like

[01:57:21] that came about because they were able to sort of be much more modular.

[01:57:25] So you could add a dozen pop-bumpers if you wanted to because you just had to add another

[01:57:30] pop-bumper board.

[01:57:31] They also made a single level version of this game called Eclipse.

[01:57:36] Oh, yeah.

[01:57:37] And this was manufactured in 82.

[01:57:39] It was get this a modular design kit, which was sent to anybody who wanted to convert their James Bond

[01:57:49] 007 cabinets into a new game. It had a new back glass play field and game ROM.

[01:57:56] Steve Young from Pinball Resource told IPDB that the bill of materials on the kits

[01:58:04] indicate the model 671, which was the name of this, the full games were 671A, which is where

[01:58:12] you got the cabinet and everything else. They don't know from him what components actually made up

[01:58:18] the kit version. But there are a few of these out there. And it's basically the upper play field

[01:58:25] of black hole with no under play field. That is good.

[01:58:30] It actually looks like a lot of fun. I have played it.

[01:58:32] Is it cool? It looks cool. It's not as good as black hole.

[01:58:35] Oh, well, it's, yeah, I guess. But it is better than James Bond.

[01:58:39] Because when you hit it up in the area where it would go to the lower play field, obviously it

[01:58:43] doesn't. It just comes out. But I think it might just have a kicker to come back out the same way

[01:58:48] if I remember. Tons of fun. So you could check that out. I've got that in the show notes.

[01:58:52] Trying to save James Bond. They also did another game around this time, which was

[01:58:57] unreleased called critical mass. There's the whitewood version of that IPDB, which looked

[01:59:05] pretty close to being finished. And according to a gentleman named Eric Selik, one of the creators

[01:59:12] of the game, Jim Cap, Joe Sickak and Jerry Yinxed worked on the game in 1981. And there was,

[01:59:21] this was their second pinball machine prototype. The prototype was built and it was never produced.

[01:59:28] There are some pretty cool images of IPDB. So at the bottom, the under play field or the

[01:59:35] lower play field has again two other flippers. And it's got a bunch of kickers. So there's

[01:59:40] like a lot of chaos under there. It looks like a lot of fun and a bunch of drop targets.

[01:59:44] I believe there was a crew. This was the same crew of people, the critical mass here that actually

[01:59:50] did the original black hole idea and sold it to Gottlieb with the multiple play fields.

[01:59:56] Even though it has the other Gottlieb employees names on IPDB as the designers, I think it was

[02:00:00] originally, I thought it was their idea. And then that got picked up. So they were working on

[02:00:06] another idea to get picked up, which was critical mass, which didn't get picked up because

[02:00:11] Gottlieb eventually did their own haunted house. That's the way I heard it. I could be wrong.

[02:00:18] Very famous haunted house was from June of 82. It sells 6,835 units designed by John Osborne,

[02:00:28] Art by Terry Dozerf. Dozerf. Here's a better way to address all of the maintenance concerns on

[02:00:36] black hole. Let's make even more stuff that can break on this machine.

[02:00:43] Also, this is the flipper king. Let's count the flippers here, Ron. There are eight flippers.

[02:00:49] In this game. So if you have to do a flipper rebuild in this, you will be hating your life.

[02:00:54] And you will have to spend a fortune because if you've ever worked on Gottlieb,

[02:01:00] if the flipper kits, you get them from pinball resource. The only ones to have them because they

[02:01:04] exclusive Gottlieb parts suppliers. And what he gives you, you have to knock a pin out of the

[02:01:11] existing mechs in the game to get the one piece off because you use it with the new stuff from

[02:01:16] the kit. So you've got to do that for eight flippers. Yes. Not only that, there are four pop

[02:01:24] bumpers, five one five bank drop target, one four bank drop target, two upkickers and three playfields,

[02:01:33] a lower playfield, a main playfield, and then basically the by level top playfield. The

[02:01:40] crazy thing, no speech, no multi ball, no multi ball. That is a that is a crying shame.

[02:01:47] Yeah, the multi ball of three levels that could have been something. I don't know. I wonder why

[02:01:52] they did that was it's just too expensive. It must have been right. It had to be, it had to be

[02:01:57] that there was enough time or the budget was too high. So John Osborne did the design of this one.

[02:02:04] And he was not a programmer like John Burris. John Burris, if he did both, you know, he could kind

[02:02:10] of do it. And so the programming for this was done either by John or somebody else. So their

[02:02:15] their their time is much more valuable because it's not just the designer who's kind of split in

[02:02:20] their time, if you will. The best part about this game though is the art. The art is tremendous.

[02:02:25] And the lightning effects in the back box. It's got like this haunted house, which is very

[02:02:31] Adam's family-esque scary house looking thing with three or four levels. It's got a headless ghost

[02:02:39] in the window. It has this amazing. You said lighting effect on the back glass. It's got orange

[02:02:47] and red, but it's not offensive. It's broken up in a way because it's got that playfield glass

[02:02:54] for the lower playfield in the middle. It's not every there's not yellow and orange everywhere.

[02:03:00] They break it up into various rooms. There's like an attic. There's the basement. There's the main floor.

[02:03:07] I have played it a few times. It's a lot more difficult than you can imagine. I'll say I don't

[02:03:15] understand how it can be so difficult. It's it's no black hole. It's no black hole. But it looks so

[02:03:21] good. And that's the cool stand-up target that looks like a stand-up target. But when you hit it,

[02:03:25] it actually collapses and goes down to the lower playfield. That's pretty cool. They've got

[02:03:30] underneath the ramp that goes to the upper playfield. There's like a secret entrance into the basement,

[02:03:38] which is really neat. And that's where that target is. It's so cool. And they got to reuse

[02:03:42] apart from an amazing spider-man. Do you know what that is? The spinner. No. Remember,

[02:03:49] an amazing spider-man had the crappy plastic spinner. Oh yeah, no, I don't. Look at the drop

[02:03:53] targets on the upper playfield. It's got the spider-web drop targets. Yeah. They got to reuse some parts.

[02:04:00] There. So what does Robert Mooney have to say about haunted house, Ron?

[02:04:06] Well, from our Facebook, Robert says, have always loved haunted house. Can never shake the feeling

[02:04:11] that it could have been the perfect Batman 66 layout. The upper playfield is the villain's layer.

[02:04:16] Main playfield has got them city. And of course, the lower playfield has the bad cave.

[02:04:21] No, there's a man after my own heart. Batman 66. He knows. Robert knows. I bet, man.

[02:04:29] Very, very, very cool. Well, I'll tell you what, Ron. 1981 was quite the year for pinball in general.

[02:04:36] We've seen a bit of a resurgence here with some innovation with Gottlieb. They've really

[02:04:41] improved things with the system 80 software. But what was Bally doing at this time? The class of 81.

[02:04:48] Oh my goodness. A whole podcast. We did a whole podcast on the class of 81, Ron. We did.

[02:04:53] But that was when they just smashed sales numbers and gave you some of the greatest

[02:04:59] most revered games before the inevitable collapse of pinball. By 1982, Coca-Cola would buy

[02:05:10] Columbia pictures because I guess they want to sell more snacks. And you do that in entertainment.

[02:05:18] And Gottlieb owns entertainment stuff. I don't know. Anywho, we spoke with this a couple of times

[02:05:26] in our 80s episodes around this time that mergers and acquisitions was like the thing in the 80s.

[02:05:32] That's where we are now. There have been a few changes in ownership with Gottlieb. This is a big

[02:05:38] one. Like Coca-Cola is very different than Columbia pictures. There are a lot of games in the

[02:05:46] pipeline that are already under development. So it usually takes like three or four months to

[02:05:52] really turn around a machine. But as you can see with the amount of machines they're releasing in 81

[02:05:58] and 1980, they have a huge lead time. But they're going to make a big jump. And that's with the

[02:06:05] system 80a. We're moving into a new era, Ron. New era. New era. We're moving from six digit

[02:06:15] displays from scoring and bonus values and timers. And we're now moving into the seven digit

[02:06:23] displays. Exciting. Exciting. Seven digits. I'm trying to think. What does that mean? Well, I'm

[02:06:31] trying to think when the other manufacturers started that. Let's see, Williams, it would have been

[02:06:38] Algar and Alien poker using it in 1980. Stern was big game in 1980. And Bally, when did they

[02:06:48] start it? That one's escaping me. But the other ones are in 1980. And here we're in 1982.

[02:06:56] Yee. So again, a little behind. Yeah, we're talking August of 1982. We're selling 3,832 units of

[02:07:07] devil's dare. Yeah. This is a satanic worshiping hellfire fantasy theme. Satan, baby.

[02:07:16] Yeah, it's not a good theme. Oh, come on. August of 82. It's the first system 80a. It sells 3,832.

[02:07:28] I say that twice. It'll only not sell in the south. The rest of the country, it'll be fine. Yeah.

[02:07:34] Tom Zafransky. He would do this and he would do punk, which will come up later,

[02:07:40] art by Doug Watson and David Moore. We need more Satan in pinball because Gorgar was not a

[02:07:47] proof of that. And Satan's gate, Satan's hollow. The George Gomez arcade gate. I didn't sell in

[02:07:54] the south either. We just keep making the same mistake, man. But holy moly, the art on this thing.

[02:08:02] It's great. Satan on the back glass there is very, uh, we're looking at Satan. He's welcoming.

[02:08:07] You're like, come to me. Yeah, he's like, scaly. It's like very, very, uh, lizard-esque,

[02:08:14] which is I assume how Satan would be. He's either that or he's like a British man in a suit.

[02:08:18] Well, it's got it's got Doug Watson's original picture in there somewhere. Yes. So what you're

[02:08:23] talking about is the original back glass. The pre-production back glass can be seen on IPDB.

[02:08:30] And it's not so much the image of Satan that is the problem. It's the ladies on the score windows.

[02:08:42] Yeah. Yeah. Topless, green, devil ladies on top of the score windows. Yeah. So this would fly

[02:08:49] at stern because they're, it's not skin colored. It's not, they're not human.

[02:08:54] Valley definitely would have lied. No problem with Valley. Totally. Here it's a bit risky. And I have

[02:09:01] to say, even though they are green and they have wings and it's, it's a bit much. So that changed

[02:09:08] as well as the design of Satan become a little, um, less evil, less, less demonic. Yeah, less

[02:09:16] terribly creepy and more humanoid. I don't know. I don't want to say that it's, you know,

[02:09:23] they wanted to make Satan look a little less like Satan and a little more like a little iguana.

[02:09:27] Great game. I played this at Fun Spot in New Hampshire. Oh, goodness.

[02:09:34] Shout out to Fun Spot. Yes. I played the one at Fun Spot also. Yes. If it wasn't incredibly cheap,

[02:09:40] I would be very disappointed in Fun Spot. Well, it was, it's fun spot. So the speech probably didn't

[02:09:46] work. I'm assuming it did not. No, it's a cool game. It has probably the most useless upper flipper

[02:09:53] I have ever seen. Oh, not at all. You need that to hit those three drop targets. I couldn't

[02:09:58] hit anything with it. I couldn't get the ball. You can't, it doesn't mean they're useless. They're

[02:10:01] there. It's totally their hit those targets and the standups. Great flipper placement. And it has

[02:10:07] a player controlled kickback. One of the few games with that. That has it. I think like defender

[02:10:14] had that. But I bring that back. I love that extra button on the left side of the cabinet.

[02:10:20] If you light the kickback, that's not enough. You actually have to hit it when the ball's

[02:10:26] training. You control the kickback. It's got speech, which really isn't necessary and doesn't

[02:10:32] fit the theme at all, which is funny because it'll say things like shoot captive cave with it.

[02:10:38] Robotic. I would picture Satan. The robotic voice. That is not how I picture Satan talking.

[02:10:44] You know, it's just the Satan robot. It's a drop target bank on the left side. It's very, very cool.

[02:10:52] Because you shoot down the drop target bank to light the captive ball area behind it. But you

[02:10:58] can also shoot through the middle drop targets once they're down. It's got an amazing spinner

[02:11:04] right above those drop targets. So you can almost sweep it into the spinner. If you can get it

[02:11:10] just right. Two ball and three ball. Multi ball. Yes. It is yellow and red. But I yes, but

[02:11:21] they're flames fire. And that's broken up by another Satan character and the green gargoyle dudes

[02:11:29] in the middle. Very cool. It's a cool game. I played a lot of it. I thought it was really,

[02:11:35] I thought it was a really, really, really good game. Satan worship aside. It's got the. It's a cool

[02:11:41] game called bonus ball. It says it right on the back glass. You can get some extra time at the

[02:11:48] end of the game. Yeah, you can build up that bonus and play a little extra. It's cool. It's

[02:11:54] good game. Worth the flip. Oh, yeah, worth the flip. That would be one of a, I would consider that

[02:12:01] as a purchase possibly. Really? If I had to pick a system 80 game, I already have it and that's

[02:12:07] alien star, but that one's up there. The other system 80 I'd love to have is just too expensive

[02:12:13] and I would never, I mean, I know where one is like 20 minutes from well, actually,

[02:12:19] 40 minutes from where I'm sitting right now. But we'll get to that one. This brings us to

[02:12:26] one of the most innovative games of all time. That's a good name for caveman. Yeah,

[02:12:32] this is a system 80 a game. It sells 1,800 units, which was too many. There's obviously some

[02:12:39] suckers that had to buy this game because they had to keep a contract with Gottlieb or something.

[02:12:45] And to get it background, this is what we're getting into the era of video games or king. So

[02:12:49] they're trying to make video game pinball tie-ins. You have like Williams had joust and defender

[02:12:57] and they did hyperball, which was supposed to be like combination video game type play with a

[02:13:04] mechanical pinball thing. Yeah, Bali with what was it? Baby Pac-Man? Yes. Or Mr. and Mrs. Pai,

[02:13:13] I always forget what grand graders that everyone was trying this. And Gottlieb was

[02:13:19] no exception. They went all in. They didn't goof around. This was this was the future

[02:13:27] because it was the 80s run. But you're right. We're on that downward, we're at the end of 82. Things

[02:13:32] are on a downward spiral to begin with. So I guess if you just tack on the craziness that is caveman

[02:13:41] with the downward death spiral of pinball and arcade in general, this did not turn things

[02:13:49] around. What does the flyers say? I mean, they really got to be pushing this.

[02:13:54] Oh, by the way, how many flippers did devils dare have?

[02:13:58] Three, only three. So four. No, three. Three. Yes, the two on the bottom and the one

[02:14:04] way up at the top. That's right. Okay. So we got caveman. It will

[02:14:09] amaze you. It's the world's first pinball video game. It is the worst of both worlds. It says

[02:14:17] the best of both worlds. Caveman's intriguing combination of video and pinball appeals to all

[02:14:23] game players. Video fans can discover the challenging fun of pinball and pinball lovers can discover

[02:14:29] the electronic excitement of video and larger player appeal means larger collections.

[02:14:37] It's the worst. It's like how do you make a video game terrible for video game players?

[02:14:42] And how do you make pinball terrible for pinball players? That's basically what this game is.

[02:14:46] Let me paint you a word picture. You have a pinball machine and in the upper middle. So

[02:14:54] all the way in the back of the back box, you have like a 13 inch color CRT tube television.

[02:15:01] And on that is a video game. So at the bottom, you're shooting the ball around, you're playing

[02:15:07] pinball and then you shoot up an orbit and do a capture hole. And then all of a sudden,

[02:15:11] you're playing some sort of Pac-Man-like game where you control a caveman and there's a joystick

[02:15:20] in the apron, right? Where the tealus button usually is. So you move that stick around and you get

[02:15:28] chased by tarot dactyls or caveman animal things like a T-Rex. And then you get eaten and then

[02:15:36] your ball comes out and you play some pinball again. Well, you can also you can also escape.

[02:15:43] It's terrible. It's terrible. I played one of these in Montreal, no in Quebec City,

[02:15:50] on a vacation. If you see one of these games, don't put money in it because you're the problem.

[02:15:56] If you put money in it, the person who's operating that game is going to be like, oh, look,

[02:16:00] it's it made $3 this week. I'm going to keep this on location. How many flippers does it?

[02:16:05] It's got four flippers. It's got two sets of drop target banks, which is which are weird. They have

[02:16:11] five four flippers because you could hit all the targets from the two bottom ones without the

[02:16:16] difference. Yeah. The in lane out lane is very unique. It's all over the place there. There's

[02:16:25] come straight down. There's no there's no kickers. There's no slings, if you will. It's terrible.

[02:16:32] It is the worst thing I have ever played. Okay, folks. It's it's it's not that bad, but it's

[02:16:39] it's not a it's not a great game. So bad. You want to read the patent? Yes, there's a patent on this.

[02:16:46] An electronic game apparatus comprising both video game play and pinball gameplay. Operation

[02:16:52] of video game plays enabled by gameplay conditions of the pinball gameplay and vice versa.

[02:16:58] Video game play is implemented using a CRT supported by a housing common to the pinball game.

[02:17:04] So Jeff Lee was Gottlieb's first video game artist and he told IPDB that caveman was his first

[02:17:12] project. Now eventually, Jeff Lee would go on to work on some pretty famous games.

[02:17:19] Jeff Lee would go on to create one of the most famous video game characters for Gottlieb and

[02:17:26] that is Cubert. Oh, Cuber is a cute little voice. Oh, yeah, his yeah, there is a pinball

[02:17:37] elements of the Cubert video game. What is it? No idea. There's a pinball mech in the actual

[02:17:45] Cubert arcade game. What happens if you fall off the cube? Oh, you get picked up and put back,

[02:17:50] you know, if you fall away off and die, what happens? I don't know. A knocker goes off.

[02:17:55] Oh, because I've never played an actual arcade. Oh, yeah. But yeah, if you go off, literally,

[02:18:02] it dissimulate you hitting like you're in the cabinet, which I thought was super cool. That is so

[02:18:08] smart. So they repurpose the, you know, a pinball knocker. Joel Krieger, who did most of the video

[02:18:14] game programming for caveman, Joel would eventually leave the company before the game was released,

[02:18:20] probably because he knew it was a turd. So Frank star sack star sack star sack star sack. That's

[02:18:30] like a space portal. Frank star shack. Uh, he would finish off the video game programming. John

[02:18:38] Burris would then program the pinball portion of the game. Was baby Pacman any good? It's,

[02:18:46] baby Pacman is more of a video game than the pinball machine. Honestly, the pinball part is

[02:18:52] smaller and you're playing like Pacman. I think it's, it's more important for you to play the video

[02:18:57] game well as opposed to caveman. It's not like that. They tried God bless them speaking of trying.

[02:19:05] What do we do? Let's keep on trying, right? Uh, sales, the industry isn't a dire straits. Let's

[02:19:12] bring on a new designer, John Trudeau. He would design Rocky, which is a licensed movie boxing

[02:19:19] theme, September of 82. It sells 1,504 units, art by David Moore software is uncredited.

[02:19:28] Now Rocky is the 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Alvetson, written by

[02:19:39] and starring Sylvester Stallone. This is what made Sylvester Stallone. It tells the

[02:19:44] rags to riches American dream story of Rocky Bell Boa and uneducated kindhearted working class

[02:19:51] Italian American boxer working as a debt collector for a loan shark in the slums of Philadelphia.

[02:19:59] Rocky a small time club boxer gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship. This is like

[02:20:07] your life story, Aeron. Oh, yeah. Budget of 960,000 or 4.37 million in 2020 dollars and it grossed

[02:20:20] 225 million or 1.05 billion dollars in 2020 dollars. That is insane. It was nominated for nine

[02:20:32] Academy Awards at one best picture, best director and best film editing. It has spawned

[02:20:39] eight sequels and I can't remember really any of them but I think I can remember Rocky 3 with the

[02:20:45] Russian guy. No, that's four. That four Rocky 3 is clubber laying. Come on. Good lord. They're so

[02:20:53] bad those sequels. They're great. I love them. The pinball machine was being made around the time of

[02:20:59] Rocky 3 because once you find a really great movie franchise, you got to beat it to death.

[02:21:07] This can sort of be seen in the movie, right Ron? You told that story a few months ago. Yeah,

[02:21:11] look at this. See, Khrinsky had a design and backlash but a new designer was hired to

[02:21:16] take over the project. They used the original backlash in the movie because they didn't have time

[02:21:20] to do another one. Only three of the prop backlasses were made and the one destroyed in the film.

[02:21:26] And one was destroyed in the film when Pauli Rocky's brother was all through a bottle of scotch

[02:21:30] through it. I see one's with a designer and the other one's with a collector.

[02:21:37] So there are two unknown extras. Now I did some searching and one of those extra fancy backlasses

[02:21:49] from the movie Rocky 3. It was with John Trudeau and it was destroyed in a flood in his basement.

[02:21:57] There is only one maybe around in the hands of some sort of collector in the United States.

[02:22:04] Funny thing it's completely useless as an actual pinball backclass because it has no space for the

[02:22:09] scoring. David Moore, he hand painted the backlast twice before it was approved by the

[02:22:16] licenser. Yeah, yeah, Sylvester still didn't like his face or something. He got into that again.

[02:22:22] Sylvester Stallone with Demoman. It's very particular with how he is depicted. That was more of an

[02:22:29] issue with what's his face. Wesley Snipes? Yeah. I look too crazy. Turns out if you look at

[02:22:35] Wesley Snipes, IPDB, he is. Enter the ring with the champ, Rocky 3, which is featured in Rocky 3.

[02:22:42] That's we know it's actually forced to. Yeah, it's something. The crowd cheers, the music plays,

[02:22:51] the fun begins. Ten drop targets represent 10 rounds to win a round. Drop the target that matches

[02:22:58] the round you're in. If that target is not dropped before the round ends, the round is lost.

[02:23:03] Winning seven rounds in one ball lights special. Interesting. After completing 10 rounds,

[02:23:08] extra ball target is lit dropping the target awards extra ball and lit. See, popular Rocky theme

[02:23:14] is featured in the exciting sound program. Sheering crowds, loop player for each round one.

[02:23:20] They missed an opportunity. They could have either Tiger in the game. Totally.

[02:23:25] Four flippers, actually, no, five flippers. Four of them in just the weirdest configuration that

[02:23:31] will screw with your brain. Instead of having a left and right flipper, they're moved to the left.

[02:23:38] There's a left jab and a right hook on the right side, which is like a smaller playfield, I guess.

[02:23:44] And then there's a center drain that collects your bonus where you're on the ropes, which is like a

[02:23:49] kicker that kicks it back up the center of the playfield. And then on the right side of where

[02:23:55] the regular flippers would be, there's another set of two flippers, a left hook and a right jab.

[02:24:00] It's really weird. Yeah, and I'm trying to remember if when you flip the flipper buttons,

[02:24:05] so there's a Tari game called Time 2000, which has the same flipper arrangement at the bottom.

[02:24:12] But on time, time 2000, I believe it does the thing where when you hit the left flipper button,

[02:24:17] it will flip both flippers on the left side. And then if you hit the right, it'll do both on the

[02:24:23] right. I think even the left set and the right. I think on the Rocky one, it's more like your

[02:24:28] brain would think it is. Like you hit the left one and it'll both of the left side. No, the flippers

[02:24:35] on the left of the two pairs will go up. You know what I mean? And then the right. I think that's

[02:24:41] how it works. I've only played this like baby once or twice. When it compares to the movie back

[02:24:47] glass and the actual back glass, the actual back glass is really, really good. Doug Watson killed

[02:24:56] it on this back glass. And in fact, he is depicted in the back glass. If you look at the back glass

[02:25:03] on the right side, there is a gentleman standing next to a bunch of people cheering with his arms crossed.

[02:25:09] That is a little Easter egg. That is Doug Watson. How could this sell less than caveman? The

[02:25:16] market wasn't good and the flippers were just, it's just weird. It just looks so weird.

[02:25:22] It's so weird. But a game which is widely revered comes up next, which is Spirit from November of

[02:25:31] 82, 1,230 units. It is designed by John Trudeau, art by Terry Doephat, Doe's Zaff, and an

[02:25:42] uncredited software. Another maintenance hog. It is another big machine with a upper plate.

[02:25:49] Dimension 80. Let's do a flipper count here. We got one, one and two on the out lanes. You can flip

[02:25:55] a ball back in from the out lane. Three and four. Three and four in the center, which is just like your

[02:26:01] regular, thank God flippers. And then you've got another one on the upper plate field. So we've got five.

[02:26:07] Oh no. Oh no, you got six. Where is the sixth one? It's right by the left pop-up. Oh yeah,

[02:26:12] there's one by the left pop-up or there's six. It has a cool flip-safe feature. So Spirit, the

[02:26:18] art work is killer. It's got this weird mask face thing. It has the rotating, the rotating disc in

[02:26:28] the back glass that actually works better than black hole. It looks cooler than black holes does.

[02:26:33] Yeah, it's like stars behind this disembodied electric looking face. And just like

[02:26:40] black hole, it's almost always not working. But an actual upper plate field in the upper right

[02:26:47] has the stargate ramp lifts up and down. It's like a by-level design, basically.

[02:26:52] It's one of the best games I ever made. It has it really in the center. When you start

[02:26:57] multiple on this thing, you know it. There is a whole presentation. There is a whole thing that

[02:27:02] occurs when you start. So the play field is broken out into sections and those sections have

[02:27:07] different colors. So it's all black like space. But then on the left side, it's got like orange

[02:27:12] smoke. And then on the right side, it's got blue smoke on the upper play field at the top. It's

[02:27:17] got like red smoke. And then there's like the silhouettes of humans falling circled in that color.

[02:27:24] On the left side, there's green on these rollovers. It looks like a trip. It's got some stunning

[02:27:32] art. It is just really unusual. You've played one of these quite a few times. I think. Yes,

[02:27:37] Zach, who's on our featured on the slam tilt podcast, he grew up like 40 minutes from me here.

[02:27:46] And he had a spirit in his bedroom as a kid growing up. It's still there. His dad bought it

[02:27:52] from like an arcade for God knows probably a couple hundred bucks, whatever. And literally

[02:27:58] hadn't as living in his bedroom. No idea till he got older how rare it was.

[02:28:03] The unique thing about this pin, you know, besides like the art and stuff, are the kind of

[02:28:08] unusual shots that are throughout the play field. There's there's zigs and zags of the way the ball

[02:28:15] gets around in areas, which is really unique. And that would become a staple of John Trudeau's

[02:28:21] style around this time of odd bent ball guides circling the ball around coming out in a different

[02:28:29] direction than it comes in. It's very neat. When I talked about system 80s, I would get like,

[02:28:34] this, this is it. This is the pinnacle. Is it? But it's also extremely rare. Most of them were

[02:28:39] actually, I believe, exported. And when they are available, they sell for a just obscene

[02:28:46] prices. I think there was. Is it really difficult to play? No. It seems like a really tight

[02:28:51] lower place. It's quite easy. Okay. And I think at the Alan Town Show one year, they had one of

[02:28:57] these in the first day. It's some like obscene price for sale. And it didn't last a few hours.

[02:29:02] It was gone. Well, after space, let's go to soccer. Let's sell. Let's get striker. When it comes

[02:29:09] to offensive colors, there's nothing more offensive than green. Man, you have just color hatred.

[02:29:14] I, I, I, I, I, I, I, it was fine on haunted house. Now it's bad. But it's, it's the way that it's

[02:29:19] utilized. It's, it's all over the place. It's not broken up with figures or images or, or things in

[02:29:26] the middle. Like it's, so striker is soccer themed or football everywhere else in the world,

[02:29:31] because that actually makes sense. Cause you kick the ball with your foot, not getting into that

[02:29:36] argument. But anyway, sells 910 units, which is 10. Six flippers. Six flippers. So we're still

[02:29:45] putting a lot in the games. We're not taking stuff out of the games. And this is very rocky

[02:29:50] ask with the left and right set of flippers and a left and right. A left set of flippers and a

[02:29:58] right set of thing I was thinking about is there's no other pinball manufacturer. I think that went

[02:30:04] this many years. I'm just all wide bodies. Yeah. Still on the, still do it. Except maybe Atari.

[02:30:12] But they were only, what were they around for two or three years? So may, Atari might have them,

[02:30:18] but I mean, just the amount of games definitely got lead. Let's striker score big profits for

[02:30:26] you. And striker. Wait a minute. It doesn't look like a dog. No, it looks okay. Doesn't it?

[02:30:32] Striker was the dog from World Cup. No, it's got two orbit spinners. So you can't go wrong with

[02:30:38] that. Realistic soccer play and the thrill of hands on pinball combined. Wait a minute, hands on

[02:30:45] pinball. What's the dip? What other kind of pinball is there? And you're not allowed to touch the

[02:30:51] soccer ball with your hands. Or maybe they're talking about cave mail. Like this is actual hands on

[02:30:55] pinball. This is clearly designed for the export to make an exciting entertainment event. Striker

[02:31:02] extra features arena like sound program. I don't even know what that means. And beautiful graphics

[02:31:08] add to striker. Add to strikers popular appeal. Big profits are waiting to be scored with striker

[02:31:14] color contact or local got leaf distributor. So yeah, it's like soccer. You can score goals and

[02:31:20] stuff. Shoot drop targets. And it's green. Same old same old. You know, it's it's it's it's a bit

[02:31:30] rough, but it's also a chance for do again. We're getting to the point. There will be a point where

[02:31:35] he pretty much is the sole designer. He's like he's like the only one there. He's like he showed up.

[02:31:41] He put some food in them in the fridge at the got laid place and he just hasn't left. So it is

[02:31:47] a dimension 80. After I said it was not a dimension 80. We've edited that out. But because it does

[02:31:54] not look like it. It didn't look like a wide body. I remember it not being a wide body, but I'm wrong.

[02:31:59] This is designed by Tom Zofransky, art by David Moore and Terry Doe, Zaf again. Tom would leave

[02:32:07] the company and the design was put into production. So it wasn't really finished. It was sort of like

[02:32:13] what he had left and they just sort of did it. It has an unconventional Italian bottom, I call it.

[02:32:19] The unconventional part is that it's got pop bumpers on top of the slings and the slings themselves

[02:32:25] don't have kickers. So that seems kind of dangerous. Which we saw in a previous game when it was

[02:32:29] on the left. Yes, you're right. Now it's on both sides. More symmetrical. Music is something that

[02:32:37] got leave really got so well in this era, especially when we get into the more trendier system 80

[02:32:44] bees. When we get into the mid to late 80s at some point, it's yeah. They really do a heck of a job.

[02:32:49] Or did we do those already? I'm losing track of how many episodes we've done. Yeah, we did the 80 bees

[02:32:54] already. Okay, there you go. Live in the dream. Go in nuts. Ron, there's one thing that I know you

[02:33:01] love and it's nuts. We are going nuts. It's funny. It's a 10 total units never placed in

[02:33:07] a production yet. I've played this game. You've played this. I didn't even know this existed this

[02:33:12] February of 83. Yeah. This is a squirrel theme. This is designed by Xing Lam. So this is the

[02:33:21] individual that I have no information about. I believe Lam is a Vietnamese name. So that would

[02:33:27] be really interesting to know what it was like for an Asian American to be working in pinball in

[02:33:33] the 80s. Like that is Italian white man's industry if I've ever heard of it. This thing's got seven

[02:33:40] pop bumpers. Ron seven. Yeah, it does. What is going on? Three flippers and seven pop bumpers.

[02:33:47] So there's a pop bumper in the top in the center. There's two on the left cluster together. Then

[02:33:51] there's two on the right which are like jammed into the plastic. Then there's two above each

[02:33:56] sling at the bottom. It's really got these cute little squirrels collected nuts on the top. There's

[02:34:03] a chubby one. There's one wearing a there's one wearing a scarf. Man, oh man, this looks like fun.

[02:34:09] Pops. Yeah. And they pop a lot. So you're going to get the ball popping all over the place.

[02:34:15] I guess it's probably because like squirrels are in trees and they're causing trouble and they're

[02:34:22] bumping around. I think that's what's the I think that's what the symbolism is there. It's got a

[02:34:26] really neat plunge. Yeah, if you plunge it hard enough, you can go right into the pop bumpers for

[02:34:30] instant drain action. It does have multi ball though. We're still there. We're still in a lot of

[02:34:35] pops. We're still into a bunch of flippers. So I've still got leave hasn't really totally destroyed,

[02:34:41] you know, cutting back on every single wondering how these because even when Valley did multi ball,

[02:34:45] I don't think they were called it multi ball. And here's got leave actually using not only multi ball,

[02:34:50] but with the dash in the center just like Williams and Williams trademarked that.

[02:34:55] They probably I'd be sure they have to pay them. They probably did. There's no outlines

[02:35:01] in this game. It's all right down the middle. That it is. Looking for a Facebook quotes here.

[02:35:09] David, please stop advertising your company on the show. What? Well, Ron ever actually listened to

[02:35:14] an episode Stewart Burns says going nuts should be remade. Wow. That's a that's a gutsy thing over

[02:35:22] there on our Facebook page. Facebook.com slash super ball. How much pop up or max cost? Well,

[02:35:27] they'll be like, oh man, now put us over budget. And not only that, look at all the that drop target

[02:35:32] banks. It has in it. That's even worse. One, two, three, four, out. This is probably one bank.

[02:35:40] Yeah, it's just in the middle. Still come on. Oh, I'm sorry. Steve Richie couldn't get two drop

[02:35:46] target banks in his stern. So I can only imagine what it would be like nowadays. Do you ever play

[02:35:51] World Poker Tour? He got a lot of drop targets in his turn. That was like 20 years ago.

[02:35:56] One of my holy grail games. This is a holy grail for you, but to play because when you go to as many

[02:36:04] shows as I go to, you've played all these super rare, you know, 10 exists in the world games.

[02:36:10] This one alluded me for a long time. I literally went to a party where a guy had a crawl and it

[02:36:19] broke 10 minutes before I arrived. So I got to just look at it, broke and sitting there and not

[02:36:24] being able to play it. So this is from February of 1983. It is the licensed fantasy movie theme.

[02:36:31] It is a system 80A, again, 10 units is mentioned just a moment ago, designed by John Trudeau,

[02:36:38] Art by Keith Parkinson, and software is uncredited. I've seen as a child, I have seen crawl quite a

[02:36:48] few times. I haven't seen it in 30 years, but I remember seeing it a couple of times when I was

[02:36:52] younger. Did you see crawl? I did see it once. I just remember the cool spinny thing. The disc thing is

[02:37:00] called, but yeah, and Liam Neeson's in it. Yeah. So crawl is the 1983 science fiction swashbunkler film

[02:37:09] directed by Peter Yates. He directed Bullet in 1986, which is a friggin awesome movie.

[02:37:17] And it was written by Stanford Sherman. This stirred Ken Marshall. Let's see, let's

[02:37:27] last set, Lyset Anthony Trevor Martin and Freddie Martin. And if you're asking who they are,

[02:37:36] then you're not alone. It had an early career appearance of Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane

[02:37:42] who appeared as bandits. He was showing his particular set of skills. You

[02:37:49] basically it follows the journey of Prince Collin and his group of outlaws on the planet

[02:37:55] crawl to save a future princess Lessa from a beast and is constantly teleporting Black Fortress.

[02:38:04] Yeah, and there was a video game which did actually get made in production. It had a budget of 27 to

[02:38:12] $30 million, which is $73 million today. And it grossed $16.9 million or $41.4 million in today's

[02:38:20] dollars. So it was a massive flop. It is a terrible movie. It's more of a cult film now, though.

[02:38:26] Dennis Creasel and I often reference it in jokes to each other from time to time about crawl.

[02:38:33] But it's just it's it's weird. It's like princess bride, star wars, dungeons and dragons mixed with

[02:38:44] like just it's just terrible. Ed Crinsky would make the original game with a transparent playfield,

[02:38:51] but it was deemed too expensive. Then the project was given to John Trudeau who redid the playfield

[02:38:57] into what we know. And somehow they still made 10 of them. So the back glass by Keith Parkinson,

[02:39:06] he did Stern electronics iron maiden and the Viper which is awesome. Wow. So he was three for three.

[02:39:12] Not sure who did the playfield, but Margaret Hudson and Larry Day say it isn't them and they did

[02:39:18] some of the work back around this time. The original back glass, if you look at this thing, is

[02:39:25] really, really good. It looks exactly like the movie. It is super cool, probably better than

[02:39:33] the movie itself. The playfield is quite original. It has its buy level. So it has the upper playfield

[02:39:39] to to section off its try level. But then it has a third lower playfield similar to black hole

[02:39:47] or haunted house. But what's interesting about this lower playfield? Well, the interesting thing

[02:39:52] isn't the playfield necessarily itself. It's the glass that you look through. It's like special

[02:40:00] refractive, whatever the hell it is. It makes everything look small. So the playfield underneath

[02:40:06] is like a full-size playfield. But when you look through the window, it looks tiny.

[02:40:11] Which begs the question, why didn't they just make a tiny playfield? I don't know. It's got, yeah,

[02:40:18] it's a full upper playfield. Well, I finally got to play this at Expo, pinball Expo in Chicago

[02:40:26] as I was in line to play it. It broke. I'm like, oh my god, I'm never going to get to play this.

[02:40:31] But luckily, I'll do a shout out to Chris Hibbler was in the booth right next to the guy who had

[02:40:38] this game. So he came over and fixed it. And he had to keep fixing it throughout the show.

[02:40:44] And you got to see why they kind of abandoned chip on this. It is a maintenance nightmare.

[02:40:49] And this was a completely redone. This was a hep restoration crawl.

[02:40:55] And it still kept breaking over and over. Yet he still was able to sell it by the end of the show.

[02:41:01] Of course. How could you not? Let's count some flippers here again.

[02:41:05] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven flippers. Two on the upper playfield with a drop

[02:41:13] target bank and a pop bumper. That's the spiders nest, which is probably the most memorable part of

[02:41:18] the entire movie. It has a vertical upkicker bit to get up there. It's got two ramps to get up

[02:41:25] there. There's two pop bumpers on the lower playfield with two flippers in the center, one on the

[02:41:33] left side of the main playfield. It is, there is so much going on here. It is impressive that it even

[02:41:43] even made ten of them. Do you know what I said about spirit? This ain't spirit. This is a clunky

[02:41:49] maintenance nightmare. It looks like it shoots terrible. It's a wide open playfield with a

[02:41:54] couple of pop bumpers. And then you've got an upper playfield, which has a drop target. It looks

[02:41:58] like it's just shoot it up to the spider's web area, shoot the drop targets back again.

[02:42:04] I played it a couple times. I got to experience all the gimmicks and that was enough. That was good.

[02:42:10] And that was enough, which is why you could see they probably only made ten.

[02:42:13] But I accomplished my goal. I finally got to play that thing.

[02:42:18] Three playfields again. Yes. And when they had it was broken so often, you got to see it.

[02:42:23] The main playfield lifted up and I'm looking at the lower playfield. It's like as big as

[02:42:28] like the black hole one. It's huge. But it looks tiny. Holy crap. Why do they do that?

[02:42:34] It's just it's everybody else is freaking out and they're cutting everything out of their games.

[02:42:40] If you look at Bali midway at this time, you know, 83, there's like nothing in their

[02:42:46] game. They're an Apster vector. Yes, they're cutting out everything. Yeah.

[02:42:49] Same thing with Williams, right? They're panicking too. Yeah. Not Gottlieb. They're still throwing

[02:42:54] as much. That is true. What do you think about we're still doing wide body. We still got

[02:42:59] multi level playfields. It's it's it's only have one designer. And what we're getting at. Yeah.

[02:43:04] Because our next game is Cuberts Quest. Oh, this is also played. And if I remember, I think it has

[02:43:13] another bizarre flipper thing going on. It does. It's a licensed video game theme from March of 83.

[02:43:20] We're still in this wide body era. It sells 884 units designed by John Trudeau,

[02:43:27] art by David Moore and Terry Dozaff, sound by David Thiel and Craig Beerwalt, Beerwalt's software

[02:43:38] is uncredited. This thing and what you're talking about with crazy flippers is the flipper layout

[02:43:45] on the bottom here. Can you describe this? I'll describe this is John Trudeau as a design he would do

[02:43:53] anything on a playfield. There was zero fear of trying anything. The flippers are how would you

[02:44:00] even explain what it looks like? It looks like a letter X. Yeah. So the flippers are regular in

[02:44:06] the middle. There's a left and right flipper. But they're up. I would say I want to say 10

[02:44:13] centimeters. Yeah. And then underneath them, you have two flippers that are facing down, which

[02:44:17] but they're not mounted top up. They're mounted top down just like they remind me of Q. Another

[02:44:24] super rare game you've probably never played. But that's exactly how they're mounted. So when they flip,

[02:44:29] they don't flip north-south, they flip east-west. And the ball goes up orbits. And it goes up

[02:44:36] orbits that are at the bottom. And the entire playfield is basically a large figure eight. Yeah.

[02:44:41] It's like a large figure eight. And the center drain is right down the middle. And it plays as good

[02:44:46] as it looks. It plays as good as you would think it would play for something that looks this crazy.

[02:44:53] Yeah. If you're having a hard time picturing what we're saying, it basically tells you what the

[02:44:57] game play is like. Yeah. There's not very many of these. I think there's one of these in the Dutch

[02:45:02] pinball museum. I still recommend you play it though. You got to experience it. No matter what a

[02:45:07] game is. Yeah. You got to make up your own mind. Except for caveman. Don't play caveman. No, you

[02:45:10] need to play caveman. Don't listen to date. Maybe it'll turn out you're the best ever at that

[02:45:14] video game portion of caveman. Benjamin Madison from our Facebook page says,

[02:45:19] Cuber has a not seen in pinball flipper arrangement. Much as Python Angelo gave so much

[02:45:26] flack to the pinball industry for not having any creativity, he's certainly joined a company that

[02:45:30] stifled it. If you could do anything you want at CUTE, at Godleab, they're putting the reins a

[02:45:36] little bit tighter over at Williams because they know making a game and spending all the time to

[02:45:41] sell 800 units is is not again. I would argue in the end the ideas to sell games and when you

[02:45:47] make something that weird, I mean, it's sold eight hundred and eighty four units. That's more

[02:45:53] legends of Valhalla that are out there. But I think we've reached the end of dimension 80.

[02:46:01] Thank God. Why? Why bodies are cool? You got to have strong flippers. If you're going to

[02:46:06] have a wide body, you're going to get one of these system 80s. Don't be like, oh, the flippers

[02:46:10] are pretty good. No. Bill just reflipers. Yeah, I think the issue, most of them is the

[02:46:16] Gottlieb flipper mechs are of that error are indestructible. So they keep working. So no one

[02:46:21] feels the need to have to rebuild them. That's why I don't think they get rebuilt for a long

[02:46:27] period of time. But if you do rebuild them, you should have no problems. Yeah. So David Thiel was

[02:46:31] on sound here. Do you know why? Why? Well, he did this sound design for Cubert, the arcade

[02:46:39] game. So they stole all of that work and put it in this machine. But man, Cubert does have amazing

[02:46:45] sounds. Jersey Jack, you got a higher David Thiel back. Pat Lawler's gone now. Just let him,

[02:46:51] just David will come back. Wow. We're in survival mode, right? We've had a couple of really tight

[02:46:58] sales numbers here making crazy original play feels that don't sell. Why not just

[02:47:04] repeat old play fields and maybe they will sell. Yeah. So let's take an old super popular

[02:47:11] EM play field. And let's just update it with seven digit scoring and new fancy sound. And that's

[02:47:18] where we're going to get super orbit, which is like orbit, but super super orbit and it's not a

[02:47:25] wide body. It is not we're going back to the standard body. We are in survival mode. We have to

[02:47:30] cut expenses. No more, no more a dozen friggin flippers in a machine, man. We can't, we can't,

[02:47:35] we can't be doing that. Three years, three years of wide bodies finally ended. Yeah. Imagine Dennis

[02:47:41] Creasel was a super orbit owner. Did you know that? I did know that. It's all right. It's a cool

[02:47:47] game. At the pinburg tournament then finals one year, they had a super orbit there. Probably

[02:47:53] some of the highest state games of super orbit ever played. Absolutely. Very target. Hello. Yep.

[02:48:00] We know you're in love. Yes. It's got the amazing spinner. The only issue with this spinner is

[02:48:05] though that when you go through the spinner on the right side, it bounces into the pop bumpers,

[02:48:09] which often pop the ball back into the spinner. So it doesn't quite go as much as you'd like.

[02:48:16] No fancy, um, no, no fancy flyer lingo here. It's pretty straightforward. Blast off on a pinball

[02:48:26] journey through space, advance your ship through a 10 step sequence to complete each orbit.

[02:48:32] Increase your bonus level with every orbit you complete. Six level very target also advances

[02:48:38] your bonus and scores special when lit. Yeah. It's interesting how if you look at the flyers now,

[02:48:44] and it's good to look at these develop over time, they no longer are mentioning,

[02:48:50] you know, the sound pointed out your head dimension 80. Yeah. They're no longer mentioning

[02:48:56] any of these cool features anymore. It's all about the story now. But let's see what it says. If

[02:49:01] it mentions, oh, it does mention that's a narrow body. Gottlieb's super orbit offers your players

[02:49:06] a classic narrow bodied play field enhanced with power and style of today's best games.

[02:49:13] It almost is worded like this is kind of a one off. We're just giving you a classic feel for this one.

[02:49:20] We're going to give you the classic orbit. So, you know, I would assume that distributors would have

[02:49:24] come to Gottlieb and said, Hey, why don't you give us some of the games that we're like of the back

[02:49:28] in the day, but just with the new technology. And that's what they did with super orbit. They took

[02:49:33] orbit and just made it super. How about that? So this is, uh, and how many units do they sell?

[02:49:40] 2,100. This is designed by Ed Khrinsky. Now he has not come out of retirement to design this game.

[02:49:48] They've just taken his play field, art by David Moore, uncredited. Well, pinball retirement.

[02:49:54] He was still working pinball retirement. That's right. So it's the modernized version of

[02:50:00] Gottlieb's 1971 four player orbit and the 72's two player outer space orbit and outer space

[02:50:06] backlasses, by the way, are amazing. Super good. That was obviously a good idea. We popped a number,

[02:50:17] right? We're selling 2,000 units all of a sudden. So let's do it again. So we crack out royal flush

[02:50:23] deluxe from June of 83, we're at a standard body again. It sells 2,044 units. This is another

[02:50:31] repurposed Ed Khrinsky design with art by David Moore. This is a remake of 1976's royal flush.

[02:50:40] Yeah, I think I had to play this at pinburg. I did not. Royal flush deluxe. Nothing beats it.

[02:50:47] I didn't beat it. I'll tell you that. There's just lots and lots of drop targets. Huge.

[02:50:53] Yeah, this one looks, yeah, you hit it up top. You get it through one of the lanes, which lights

[02:51:00] a shot and then you can try to shots it over and over. And it has the big rope.

[02:51:05] Yeah, you got to shoot the two kings and then the two queens and then the, yeah, it looks so easy.

[02:51:12] Just knocked down the card targets to complete the poker hands, especially the royal flush.

[02:51:17] But it's not what makes royal flush deluxe so challenging is as timeless as poker itself.

[02:51:24] It twice is fun. That looks awesome. Looks good. Looks like a fun game. Not going to lie.

[02:51:30] It's good artwork. But again, how many do they sell? 2000. So not bad.

[02:51:37] All right, so what do we do? We got to do it again.

[02:51:41] Amazon Hunt. This is the fantasy jungle theme.

[02:51:45] 1983. Another repurposed Ed Khrinsky design, art by Larry Day. It sells 1,515 units.

[02:51:56] I've not played it. So it dropped a little bit. It did. This one's based on

[02:52:02] this one's based on 1975's fast draw. Okay. I'm sure I've played this at some point.

[02:52:08] And this might even have been an alternative. A jungle of fun.

[02:52:12] Roaring lions and trumpeting elephants welcome players to Amazon Hunt.

[02:52:16] The latest in Gottlieb series of economically priced convertible pinball games.

[02:52:22] So this is literally starting their trend there. It's like we're going to remake old games.

[02:52:26] That's what we're doing. A dirt cheap, super quick design, update the software, run some

[02:52:31] new cable out the door. It's kind of funny. We've almost come full circle. We did, we did,

[02:52:36] it's just of one where we were like make our EMS be solid states.

[02:52:41] Then we went through a stage where we're intervading. We're trying all kinds of crazy stuff.

[02:52:44] And now at the end, we're back to, let's bring back the EMS play fields and just make them work

[02:52:49] like a solid state game. It's like what's old is new again. Yeah. It's literally like they just

[02:52:54] did 360 there. Well, they're in survival mode. They're, you know, they're just trying to keep it

[02:52:59] along. They're limping and they're doing what best they can. And they're pulling out some

[02:53:06] pretty solid classics. I would own a super orbit. Absolutely. And they're still around.

[02:53:11] So what were Bally and Williams doing at this time? At Williams, they're serious. They're

[02:53:16] suffering probably almost as bad as anyone. Barry Osler is the only one that's left. And he's

[02:53:22] keeping the lights on. They're doing Defender in 1982 with 369 units. They did time fantasy

[02:53:29] in 1983 with 608 units, juiced with 402 units. Firepower 2 sells 3400 units. Which that one was

[02:53:40] Mark Richey. 1984 is laser Q sells 2800 units. Starlight sells 100 units. You've never even heard of

[02:53:49] that pin. And by the end of 1984, space shuttle sells 7000. And the last three releases, Gottlieb has

[02:53:57] actually done a pretty good number in comparison to Williams. But what about Bally? Well, in 1982,

[02:54:04] Bally was just dying. Vector was their last sort of major kick at the point everything in it can.

[02:54:11] That sells 3500 units. Mr. Mrs. Pac-Man, a huge hit at 10k. Yes, that was they banked on the Pac-Man

[02:54:19] license and it paid off. Spectrum where they literally said we don't care if this game sells,

[02:54:23] we need to get rid of these parts. So they just went crazy into Spectrum. Speak easy sells 3000 units.

[02:54:30] 8 ball deluxe limited edition, which was 8 ball deluxe re-released in the hyper in the rabbit.

[02:54:37] Yeah, not the game they ripped off, which was hyperbolic. Yeah. And baby Pac-Man sells 7000 units.

[02:54:46] So Williams is really suffering with sales here. In 1983, Bally was folded into the Midway

[02:54:51] Division to form Bally Midway. So no more classic Bally. Yeah. So then we get into the real

[02:54:57] mess of it in 83. That's BMX of 406 units. That's terror. Grand slam with a thousand units.

[02:55:07] Centaur 2, which was the rapid fire cabinet, Centaur play field repurposed. So even Bally is kind of

[02:55:15] doing the same thing. I've taken old machine, put it in a new or take an old layout, put it in a new

[02:55:20] cabinet and sell it again, 1,550 units and gold ball, which I've never heard of.

[02:55:26] Oh, gold balls. It has a gold ball. Now Coca-Cola, who had acquired Gottlieb kind of at the peak

[02:55:35] in 1981, well, they start to see a death spiral. They had spun off the Gottlieb assets into a

[02:55:44] company called Milestar. And that'll be the topic of another podcast. But they would quickly lose

[02:55:51] patience with Milestar's inability to stabilize the company and turn a profit.

[02:55:57] Gottlieb was not the reason behind Coca-Cola's acquisition from Columbia Pictures. And it was

[02:56:04] certainly a low priority. They head to get rid of this dead weight. Eventually, Coca-Cola would

[02:56:11] sell off Milestar, which was of course Gottlieb to another company. But that's another story.

[02:56:19] Ron starting on the back foot, Gottlieb looked to add more and more into their games to draw in new

[02:56:28] players. They tried to reinvent their boards to give them more power, more programming, and more

[02:56:35] pizzazz than their system one. But their system one missteps had them running this race on a

[02:56:43] sprained ankle as they continued through 80 and 81 to fall behind Williams and Valley in sales numbers.

[02:56:52] However, the system 80 era gave us some of the coolest Gottlieb's of all time with some of the

[02:56:58] most innovative features. Some of those exciting concepts are still beloved today. And they've given

[02:57:07] us some pretty cool themes as well. Any last thoughts, Ron? From people I know on the tech side,

[02:57:14] they'll tell you that the system 80 had a lot of power to the system 80 system. That wasn't

[02:57:22] always used. Yeah, it was like there. It was in the box. They just didn't have the resources to

[02:57:27] really spend the time to do the the innovation and research on the programming side. Because Gottlieb

[02:57:33] was always like a company run by engineers of the mechanical sort. And they didn't bring in the

[02:57:40] programmers like Valley or Williams did with these these new young upstart, you know, software people.

[02:57:46] And it shows I'll tell you though, I do enjoy playing a lot of those system 80s. My first two games

[02:57:53] were system 80s. Besides the grounding modifications that you have to do which are quite simple,

[02:57:59] they were rock solid for a game to learn to do stuff on. I wouldn't have thought of anything

[02:58:04] better. Go play some system 80s, the early system 80 series. The star series. Dimension 80 baby,

[02:58:11] Dimension 80 for light. When you get your tattoo. Never.

[02:59:32] Play or versus machine in this contemporary contemporized, I'm sucking at reading,

[02:59:55] contemporary classic. That's a weird word. What does a patent clerk sound like? What kind of

[03:00:03] voice do they have? It's like a 1930s guy in a window. Maybe nasally. Yeah, pinball game. A pinball game.

[03:00:13] A pinball game has gameplay determined primarily by time rather than the number of ball plays.

[03:00:19] I don't know if that works. Hold on, I know.

[03:00:23] Do you want to read this one? How did we say the names again?

[03:00:31] New attract sound and slight modes at knit site. No, site modes.

[03:00:39] There will be lots of p-breaks today by the way. Thank you. I got a bunch of water on board

[03:00:48] because I was very thirsty when I woke up this morning.

[03:00:54] We have some comments from our social media. Should I say? Yeah, let me do that again. I think

[03:01:01] that came out all weird. The window was mounted on a ledge in an opening and the upper level.

[03:01:07] Oh, it didn't sound British. Upper. Upper. Upper. Upper.

[03:01:11] L. Because John Burris is the programmer or John Osborne is the designer. If it were John

[03:01:20] beer, if it were man, oh man.
