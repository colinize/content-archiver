[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:15] All right, ready to jump in? What is this episode on?

[00:19] This is going to be a surprise for you. We'll just jump in.

[00:22] Okay.

[00:31] Hello, everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles. And with me is Ron?

[00:45] Halit, that's my last name, H-A-L-L-E-T.

[00:50] I always give you like a funny middle name.

[00:53] I guess you're good and think it one.

[00:57] Vegemite?

[00:58] Oh, it's like it'll be related to what we're talking about.

[01:01] It is. It is. What's up, fella? You play X-Men yet?

[01:05] Yes.

[01:06] Yeah, did the shooter lane work?

[01:07] No.

[01:08] I did figure out a way to pull the plunger back and kind of jam it off to one side and release it and then it worked.

[01:16] Ah, the old sideways jam it released.

[01:20] It's a classic.

[01:22] Well, Stern has a fix coming out, so.

[01:24] That's good. It's really exciting. I was really excited to play that.

[01:28] Pintastics coming up in April up here, which is up in the north east.

[01:34] That's only five months away.

[01:36] It's only five months away the countdown has started.

[01:38] Wow, the countdown has started already. Okay.

[01:40] Not.

[01:41] They have the Silver Ball Rumble, which is a major tournament, which is our tournament.

[01:48] Silver Ball Chronicles and the Silver Ball Rumble. I don't know if anybody knew that.

[01:52] Oh, really? I didn't know that either. Cool.

[01:54] It is our tournament.

[01:56] Yes, and we always represent well. Well, you do. I drink too much and embarrass myself on a stream.

[02:02] Well, I haven't made finals for that one in a long time, so.

[02:06] I'm not exactly representing well, either.

[02:09] Well, you're representing.

[02:11] Mm-hmm.

[02:12] They're representing well.

[02:13] Ron, we have seen a lot of people joining us over at Patreon.com's.

[02:19] They're Silver Ball Chronicles.

[02:21] Most of them from Australia in the last little while.

[02:26] They popped in, which I think is very, very cool.

[02:29] They're coming in for, I think, the American Barbecues.

[02:32] All the tips that the Americans have with Barbecues.

[02:36] Huh?

[02:37] I think they call them Barbie.

[02:39] A strip on the Barbie, yes.

[02:41] Oh, don't, don't.

[02:43] At least I didn't do any accents, so.

[02:47] Well, okay. I thought we could go a whole episode without the stereotypical kind of Australian things that probably drive them insane.

[02:55] Like the Foster's beer.

[02:57] The Foster's beer.

[02:59] The knifey Spoonie.

[03:01] And remember, that's our knife. That's a knife.

[03:04] Thank you.

[03:06] So, you know, we've had some people pop in for a couple of months and leave just to say thanks.

[03:10] They've come in.

[03:11] If you're in our middle tier, which is $6 a month, you get early ad free access to the show.

[03:16] You can jump into our private Discord chat room.

[03:20] You also get the barbecue tips, which I mean are a big deal.

[03:26] Right? Have you used any of these barbecue tips?

[03:29] No. I don't actually like barbecue.

[03:32] Oh, my God.

[03:34] I'm sorry.

[03:35] I thought I knew you.

[03:36] I thought you knew me.

[03:37] I don't like lunch, so.

[03:38] Oh, man.

[03:40] You're like pizza. That's it.

[03:42] Pizza is good.

[03:43] Yeah. You know what's also good?

[03:44] Our Discord.

[03:45] Yeah.

[03:46] So come on in there.

[03:47] You get a free sticker after three months.

[03:49] If you drop up to the elitist category, there's where you're going to get after a three month period.

[03:56] You're going to get all the same things.

[03:57] But you're also after three months, you're going to get a silver ball of chronicles.

[04:01] T-shirt.

[04:03] So thank you very much for our new patrons.

[04:07] And all of the shenanigans that have come from that.

[04:12] Now, Ron, we're always on Facebook as well.

[04:16] That's another great place to chat with us.

[04:18] So swing on over.

[04:19] Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[04:21] And please leave us a five star review wherever you found us.

[04:26] That way more people will see us.

[04:28] We'll rise up in the algorithm.

[04:30] Are you familiar with the algorithm?

[04:32] Why, why don't you four stars is the highest or six?

[04:35] And give us those stars.

[04:37] But five is really the best.

[04:40] Right.

[04:41] That's the way to do it.

[04:43] If you just want a t-shirt just to say thanks.

[04:45] We've sold a lot of t-shirts.

[04:46] Some of them went to Australia.

[04:48] And we also sold a mug to Michigan.

[04:50] So cheers to the guy who bought the mug.

[04:52] A Michigan mug.

[04:53] Yeah.

[04:54] Well, it's not a Michigan mug.

[04:56] I'm sure it's made in China.

[04:57] I thought it was made like in Canada of the finest Canadian maple.

[05:03] Yes, that's right.

[05:04] Just like the playfields of barrels to fun machine.

[05:08] Barrels of fun machine.

[05:10] Maples?

[05:11] Wait a minute.

[05:12] They're made out of maple.

[05:13] I think it's made out of Canadian maple.

[05:15] No, wasn't that the other one?

[05:17] The ones who did punny factory?

[05:19] Oh, we don't talk about that.

[05:21] They're the ones I believe that said they that was made out of whatever.

[05:24] That's where I was getting that from.

[05:26] Pinball adventures.

[05:27] That's what their name is.

[05:28] Yeah.

[05:30] That brings us to the corrections and concerns from our mailbag.

[05:35] That's over at SilverBall Chronicles of Gmail.com.

[05:37] The first one was you and I made some Simpsons jokes.

[05:42] And Joe Chirivino reached out.

[05:45] And he made some corrections.

[05:47] Did he reach out to you or just me?

[05:50] What did we say wrong?

[05:54] So the first one is we were talking about Rainier Worth Castle, the character that does the Austrian accent.

[06:02] Is it a Wolf Castle?

[06:03] Right.

[06:04] Something like that?

[06:05] Rainier Wolf Castle.

[06:06] Yes.

[06:07] He's the R.S.W.W.S. vinegar of the show.

[06:08] Yes.

[06:09] Right.

[06:10] Well, we actually made reference to him and used the incorrect name.

[06:14] We used the name McBain, which is his character in the film that he plays in.

[06:21] Is this what one of the things I say?

[06:23] It's something like I...

[06:26] It's not my job to read, but to lead, or to lead not to read.

[06:29] But he does that when he's governor, which he's not McBain when he's governor.

[06:33] Exactly.

[06:34] Well, that needed a correction.

[06:35] That needed the correction.

[06:36] The other thing was that I made the comment that my eyes had been...

[06:41] Right, from the episode where he's playing.

[06:44] Rainier Wolf Castle is playing...

[06:47] What was the character that he played?

[06:49] Radioactive man.

[06:50] Radioactive man.

[06:52] So we screwed that up.

[06:54] So that was a big deal.

[06:56] Joe, I think we've actually lost quite a few credit points with Joe.

[07:01] We're now down the list of respect when it comes to podcasters in the pinball industry.

[07:08] I think we're down there with the loser kids now.

[07:11] We didn't even talk about when he was commenting on his adult film career, Rainier Wolf Castle.

[07:17] Yes.

[07:18] We left that on the table.

[07:20] The other thing was we had a whole section, a whole little like five minute conversation

[07:25] about why did D. Gottlieb and Co get sold?

[07:31] I said that I was never able to find a primary source of David Gottlieb or Alvin Gottlieb,

[07:38] specifically saying kind of why it was sold off to Columbia Pictures.

[07:44] Well, the man himself, Michael Gottlieb, reached out and he gave us a piece of the missing link.

[07:52] But before I get into that, who is Michael Gottlieb?

[07:55] Michael Gottlieb is the son of Alvin Gottlieb.

[07:57] Yes.

[07:58] And the grandson of the D in D. Gottlieb and Co.

[08:02] David Gottlieb.

[08:03] So he's in the know.

[08:05] He knows what's up.

[08:06] Well, Michael said, dad and Uncle Judd sold D. Gottlieb and company because they were getting older

[08:12] and neither of them had children that were interested in taking over the business.

[08:16] Judd's boys were all doing their own thing and my brother and I were too young.

[08:21] Further, Atari had been bought by Warner Communications, which sparked an interest in Columbia Pictures acquiring a game company.

[08:27] D. Gottlieb had used capital gains and Columbia Pictures had a tax loss carry over forward that year,

[08:33] so it made sense from a tax perspective as well.

[08:36] And had nothing to do with the hospital, dad and Uncle Judd were both on the board of the hospital

[08:41] and it was doing great.

[08:43] So there you go.

[08:44] It just, it comes down to timing, right?

[08:47] So Alvin was able to spend all that time working with David, kind of learning the ropes, manufacturing,

[08:54] doing little sales, building relationships, but Alvin's children, Michael being one of them, were too young.

[09:03] And Judd's boys were off due in their own thing.

[09:06] And he was just timing.

[09:08] Perhaps if Michael and his siblings were born a little sooner, that transition would have taken place.

[09:15] And there you go, once again Atari screwing it up for everybody, right?

[09:19] For Atari.

[09:21] Right, everybody following Atari, thinking, oh my god if Atari's doing it, it must be smart.

[09:25] The thing is, that kind of thing happens all the time with family run businesses.

[09:30] 100% in name, a bunch.

[09:32] We have in my area here, we had a jeweler, Finkle Jewelers.

[09:37] They've been around forever.

[09:39] I don't know how many generations they're in, but they just had their big going out of business sale.

[09:45] Because the current generation did not want to do it anymore.

[09:48] Yeah, well I think it was because their son Howard Finkle went to play football for the dolphins, isn't that correct?

[09:55] Oh, that's so bad.

[10:02] You could have said Howard Finkle, he later went on to announce for WWE or something.

[10:07] Yeah.

[10:09] Now, the other thing that Michael had pointed out was actually a big error on my part.

[10:14] Yeah, you really blew this one.

[10:16] I really, this is like legitimately, usually we joke because we always get like a bunch of like silly corrections

[10:22] or we get corrections from Bruce Knight and Gale, the co-host of the slam tilt podcast.

[10:27] Yes, my other podcast, check it out.

[10:29] And then we just ignore those.

[10:31] Or all the names we say are wrong, which is most of them.

[10:35] Exactly, but this one is actually like a legit error.

[10:38] So we've corrected our previous episodes.

[10:41] So if you go back and listen to the D-Gottleeve episode, you like it's gone.

[10:46] The reference to an uncle who passed away and left an inheritance to David Gottlieb.

[10:52] That has been completely removed.

[10:55] So you will never hear that again unless it's this podcast.

[10:58] What had happened here was that during the listen back to this one, it was, it was a bit difficult to hear

[11:06] because of a couple of accents and people talking over each other.

[11:10] And then the transcription software didn't write it out.

[11:14] So I had two issues. One is the software didn't write the words out.

[11:18] And the other one was that it was a bit of cross-talkie, so it was difficult to hear.

[11:22] So I sent that document, the audio file off to Michael.

[11:29] And he listened and confirmed, because he knows how his father speaks, that this was the joke about an uncle who died

[11:37] and left somebody, you know, a bunch of money in an inheritance was a joke that Alvin Gottlieb would often tell about a fictional self-made man,

[11:48] who inherited a bunch of money where his father had worked for every single penny.

[11:53] And that was the major reason he was so tight and was so risk-adverse when it came to spending his money.

[12:02] Does that make sense?

[12:03] Makes perfect sense to me.

[12:05] Yeah, oops. Except the part we said out, I don't know what that is, but.

[12:09] So anyway, I wanted to like personally apologize to the Gottlieb's for throwing in kind of a comment or a thing in our,

[12:17] because we are, I don't know if you know this or not, Ron, a big deal.

[12:21] And not only are we a big deal, we are the source for all things history and pinball from here on out forever.

[12:29] Oh, really? You better not get anything else wrong.

[12:33] Yeah, that's right. So that's why I wanted to make that correction.

[12:37] Now I didn't have to make that correction. I could just, you know, whatever.

[12:41] But I mean, I want to do the best job possible.

[12:44] So that's why we made that correction.

[12:46] And nobody will ever hear of us making a mistake ever again.

[12:49] It's important that history is correct.

[12:51] Yes, well, I mean, this is because of you.

[12:54] Oh, really?

[12:55] You should have, you should have known that this was not correct.

[12:58] And you should have stopped me.

[13:00] Okay.

[13:01] Because you usually do.

[13:03] That is true. That is true.

[13:05] I've saved you many times, but.

[13:07] Oh, the stuff that has hit the editing floor.

[13:09] But all those situations where stuff I was actually there for.

[13:12] So I knew it was wrong.

[13:14] Yeah. All right. Good stuff.

[13:16] But you know what? I wasn't there for our subject today.

[13:19] Oh.

[13:21] Do you ever find yourself craving, Ron?

[13:24] Do you ever talk to me?

[13:27] Do you ever hanker for something special?

[13:30] Hanker.

[13:32] We have had multiple people email.

[13:35] And we have had inquiries when we are out in the public about a little known company called Hankin.

[13:43] Some might say that all of these people had a craving for another Australian-based episode

[13:51] after our huge hit a couple of months ago.

[13:54] Let's go down under with part two.

[13:57] Hankerin for Hankin.

[14:00] You had to say down under, huh?

[14:02] I did.

[14:03] At least I didn't say shrimp on a barbeque.

[14:06] Mm.

[14:07] Pinball's big in Australia.

[14:08] You know that.

[14:09] Oh, yeah.

[14:10] It's unusually large for such a small country.

[14:15] It's far away from where most pinball is created.

[14:20] But yet it's big.

[14:23] A lot of Australian podcasters are down there.

[14:26] As opposed to your English podcasters from Australia.

[14:30] Exactly.

[14:31] Or the German ones in Australia.

[14:33] Okay.

[14:34] Yeah.

[14:35] Now, it's usually the Greeks in Australia that the Australians don't know.

[14:39] Yes.

[14:40] Now, we're big in Australia.

[14:41] Did you know that?

[14:43] I did not know that.

[14:44] I don't look at the stats.

[14:45] We are a big deal.

[14:47] That's why I wanted to correct our previous episode.

[14:50] Because the United States is clearly the number one listening group.

[14:55] And I would assume Canada is two.

[14:57] Canada is number two.

[14:58] But only by like 90 listens.

[15:00] Oh.

[15:01] The third largest is Australia.

[15:03] Wow.

[15:04] And oddly enough, Sweden after that.

[15:06] Which is weird.

[15:07] So, hello, Sweden.

[15:08] Not really.

[15:09] It's pretty big there.

[15:10] Is it big and sweet?

[15:11] Yeah.

[15:12] Huh.

[15:13] I think that's pretty cool.

[15:15] I think that's pretty cool.

[15:16] We've sold shirts to Australia.

[15:18] I don't know why they wanted to because the shipping is a fortune.

[15:22] But thank you.

[15:23] And if you're an Australian and you want any shirts.

[15:28] Silverballswag.com slash silver ball.

[15:31] Well, I was saying you're going to be a fantastic.

[15:33] So, if any of you are going to fantastic,

[15:35] you can just get a whole bunch of them.

[15:37] Yeah.

[15:38] Shoot me an email.

[15:39] Okay.

[15:40] I don't think anybody comes to like Boston when they come from Australia.

[15:43] Right?

[15:44] It doesn't seem like an Australian destination.

[15:47] Los Angeles, you know, Disney World, you know, maybe they could stop on the way to New

[15:53] York City or something.

[15:54] Texas.

[15:55] Yeah.

[15:56] That's true.

[15:57] There you go.

[15:58] But Boston, Boston's pretty cool.

[16:00] But we're in, it gets in Marlboro, which is not Boston.

[16:04] The first Aussie pinball company was Hanken and Co.

[16:09] Manufacturing Limited.

[16:12] And it's basically known as Hanken.

[16:15] Now this is the Australian-based entertainment company that in 1978 decided to dip its toe

[16:21] into pinball manufacturing.

[16:24] So I went over to their website and this is what it says.

[16:29] What says a Hanken and company provides any venue with a fast array of entertainment and

[16:35] atmospheric solutions.

[16:37] Long established and highly regarded, we have been servicing the hotel and club industries

[16:41] since 1955.

[16:42] A Hanken company maintains an edge on all competitors by managing to stay at the forefront

[16:50] of the music and pool table industry through continual investment into new research and

[16:55] development.

[16:56] And by subsequently improving existing products and ultimately meeting the ever-changing market

[17:01] demands when launching new products on a regular basis.

[17:05] So they do basically a lot of digital jute boxes and stuff for venues like clubs and

[17:17] audio visuals.

[17:18] I'm wondering what kind of new products come out in the pool table market.

[17:23] Different colors.

[17:24] I've heard there is so much change in the slate industry recently.

[17:29] Like do the pockets light up different colors?

[17:30] I'm just wondering.

[17:32] Yeah, exactly.

[17:33] How do you innovate on a pool table basically?

[17:37] There's probably a way.

[17:38] But nailing down what the company actually has been is today and over the time has been

[17:45] kind of difficult.

[17:47] Like for example, they made seven pinball machines between 1978 and 1980.

[17:53] However, IPDB only lists them as five.

[17:58] So there's like it's the episode's a bit muddled.

[18:01] It's a little bit of a thing here.

[18:04] So I'm letting you know that when I looked for my sources, things did get weird.

[18:08] In 1978, they had dark rider.

[18:11] It sold 1200 units and 1978 they had liquid lightning.

[18:15] That sounds wet.

[18:16] Yeah, that could be like the diarrhea game or something.

[18:21] Sounds shocking.

[18:22] Oh, god.

[18:24] We're on a roll here.

[18:26] This is great.

[18:27] Those games are listed in the Mr. pinball list and price guide from 2018 when I looked

[18:33] that one up.

[18:34] But those two games are not listed on IPDB.

[18:37] So they were either video or they were conversion kits for existing machines.

[18:46] These games in loose release order are listed here.

[18:52] So we're going to usually we'll go through games in chronological order when they were

[18:56] released, but some of them kind of overlap or they were released at similar times or

[19:01] one was released and then actually manufactured after the other.

[19:04] So it's a bit of a muddled ish here, but I'm going through as best as I can.

[19:09] So please, it's it's we're doing our best here.

[19:15] The games are mostly uncredited designs as well.

[19:19] But I believe that they were most likely designed by David Hanken, who was the owner and

[19:25] founder of Hanken.

[19:29] Ron, you have played all of these games recently.

[19:33] Yes, recently.

[19:34] Yes, these were all at pinball expo.

[19:36] So we have first hand account of the stunning events of this company and the machines that

[19:47] they produced.

[19:49] Oh, this is exciting.

[19:51] So first out of the gate, how are these games?

[19:55] Are they built well?

[19:57] Do they feel solid?

[19:58] Oh, they feel like a pinball machine.

[20:02] So are they are they stern electronics kind of wish or are they more like, you know,

[20:09] modern ballie Williams like built like a rock?

[20:13] It's tough to tell that just by playing it.

[20:14] I didn't take them apart or let's to play filled up or look at any of the max.

[20:17] Okay.

[20:18] You didn't give them a jiggle.

[20:20] I mean, they didn't fall apart.

[20:22] They didn't squeak.

[20:23] No, back glasses looked good.

[20:25] As good as back glasses that old are going to look.

[20:28] Okay.

[20:29] So at first glance, good looking pinball machine doesn't look weird, right?

[20:34] They look normal.

[20:36] Back box play field.

[20:37] They're not they're not Atari weird looking.

[20:40] No.

[20:41] No, and they don't have odd shaped back boxes or weird square pop bumpers like some of those

[20:46] European companies.

[20:47] No.

[20:48] So we're off to the races here.

[20:50] Oh, literally.

[20:51] Literally.

[20:52] Their first machine was called FJ.

[20:54] It's a hot rods and car theme.

[20:57] From 1978, it sells one thousand twenty units.

[21:02] And it has uncredited art, but it's believed that it was Michael Egelston.

[21:07] I hope I got that one right.

[21:09] What's an FJ?

[21:10] Ah, okay.

[21:11] So an FJ had to look this up.

[21:14] What joy.

[21:15] It's a golf related.

[21:16] No.

[21:17] Right.

[21:18] So when FJ into Google, you get some some some difficult, uh, returned results.

[21:26] Okay.

[21:27] So be careful if you're doing that around the family.

[21:31] But what I did do is I threw it through that in there and I added the, uh, Australian

[21:39] kind of thing.

[21:40] And then it came up with what is an FJ.

[21:43] This is something that is and everybody who's listening to this in Australia is like,

[21:46] well, of course, I know what that is.

[21:48] Right.

[21:49] But we don't know what that is here in North America.

[21:50] Uh, I think it was a TJ, right?

[21:53] Wasn't that a Jeep?

[21:55] Jeep TJ.

[21:56] That was the thing up here.

[21:58] So okay.

[21:59] We're in the closer area.

[22:00] FJ refers to the Australian automobile model FJ made in the 1950s by a company called

[22:10] Holden.

[22:11] Reportedly, these were an iconic youth car in the 60s and 70s, much like in North America

[22:19] if you had a 57 Chevy or a 32 Ford coupe.

[22:24] D-coup.

[22:25] No, it's Coupé.

[22:26] No, it's Coup.

[22:27] Why does it have an E in it?

[22:29] The 30, 32 Ford doose Coup.

[22:32] I know you say Coup, but it's Coupé.

[22:34] I say it the correct American way.

[22:36] Yes.

[22:37] Holden became a division of general motors in the 30s and in 2020 ceased trading after 164 years.

[22:44] Now, this I did know.

[22:46] I do know who Holden is because they popularized the Yut.

[22:51] Do you know what a Yut is?

[22:53] That's what, what's this face called Yut's in my cousin Vinnie?

[22:59] No.

[23:00] Yeah.

[23:01] Yeah.

[23:02] Yeah.

[23:03] No, no, no, no.

[23:04] Yut are like utility vehicles down in Australia, but it's not like in North America

[23:11] where you have a sport utility vehicle.

[23:13] Those are the car trucks.

[23:15] You know what I mean?

[23:17] That it's a car that has a truck bed on it, like an El Camino.

[23:21] Yeah, are you with me?

[23:23] Sure.

[23:24] It's looking up.

[23:26] Look up, throw it into the Google.

[23:29] Here I got to show you now.

[23:30] Because now I got to get you.

[23:31] I got to get you.

[23:32] El Camino.

[23:33] Wasn't that a Clint Eastwood movie?

[23:35] No, that was Grand Tourino.

[23:36] Oh, Grand Torino.

[23:38] Oh.

[23:39] So there, that thing.

[23:40] Ah.

[23:41] You know what I mean?

[23:42] So it's like a car, but it's a truck.

[23:43] Yes, I've seen those.

[23:44] These stuff.

[23:45] Yeah.

[23:46] There was an airway saw a lot of those, but yes.

[23:49] These are a big deal in Australia.

[23:51] To the point of that they still made them for many, I think they still make them today.

[23:56] But these are like a, these are like a cool kind of car down there and I'll tell you.

[24:00] That Australians have some really, really sweet euths down there, these cars.

[24:06] Like, like legitimately, there was like a voxel, I think, at one time.

[24:10] That was like, head like a huge Corvette V8 in it or something.

[24:14] Well worth to throw that into the Google machine and look some of those up.

[24:18] Because there's some cool ones.

[24:19] But getting back to pinball.

[24:21] Come on, man.

[24:22] It was just, that's, I love cars.

[24:24] Okay.

[24:25] So, backed pinball.

[24:26] Let's click on the flyer.

[24:28] Because you're coming out of the, coming out of the gates here, right?

[24:30] You got to have a flyer.

[24:31] We know we love our flyers.

[24:33] And you got to smash it out of the park to use a cliche to ensure that we are launching

[24:40] a new company in Australia, the first manufacturer in Australia.

[24:45] So they're not manufactured elsewhere, brought in and manufactured.

[24:48] It is 100% made in Australia.

[24:51] It's exciting.

[24:52] It's exciting.

[24:53] It's fast.

[24:54] It looks good.

[24:55] It's reliable, easy to service and under warranty.

[24:59] It's competitive.

[25:00] It's the right place and it's Australian.

[25:03] Yes.

[25:05] Top saucer bonus multiplier.

[25:07] That sounds like a ballie.

[25:11] Shoot it up to the top into the saucer.

[25:13] That's what that sounds like.

[25:14] Return ball to the action area of the play field.

[25:17] Come on, Aussies.

[25:18] Come on.

[25:19] Light spinning targets and star roll overs.

[25:22] Wait a minute.

[25:23] It has a revolutionary new target system.

[25:25] Oh.

[25:26] Hmm.

[25:27] Which I can't read because you're not zoomed in enough for me.

[25:29] I can't say.

[25:30] I think if I get any further, it's going to be.

[25:32] That's better.

[25:33] Automatically steps varying target value.

[25:39] Exciting skill shooting to obtain extra ball.

[25:42] Completing all through rows starts special sequence.

[25:47] A justable stepping speed of spotted targets.

[25:51] Optional memory recall on targets.

[25:53] Oh.

[25:54] Hmm.

[25:55] That's actually fancy.

[25:57] Right?

[25:58] This is that kind of late 70s when we're moving from the EM era into solid state.

[26:04] Right?

[26:05] So now we can have some of these fancier little additional things like memory recall targets.

[26:10] I like their little saying they got in there.

[26:12] Come on, Aussie.

[26:13] Come on.

[26:14] Yeah.

[26:15] I wonder what that must be a thing.

[26:16] Be the first in your street, in your street, not on your street.

[26:20] That's weird.

[26:21] Be the first in your street with an FJ.

[26:24] New and your customers to serve it.

[26:27] Yeah.

[26:28] Okay.

[26:29] When we're looking at this, we've got like three pop bumpers in the middle of the play field.

[26:33] Right?

[26:34] We've, which is, you know, pretty standard back in the day for those things.

[26:39] We've got your Italian bottom right, sling, flipper, flipper sling.

[26:44] So then we've got an inline and an outline.

[26:47] So we're looking pretty good there.

[26:48] But above the outlines, there's these, what do they call those?

[26:53] Those holes, captive holes.

[26:56] There's saucers, aren't they?

[26:58] Saucers, that's the word.

[26:59] Frig, I'm blanking the saucers.

[27:01] Drop targets on the left with like flames.

[27:04] Looks like a drag strip.

[27:06] And it has two really awesomely placed spinners.

[27:09] What do you think?

[27:10] Spinners are awesome.

[27:11] Is this a wide body?

[27:12] I'm trying to remember.

[27:13] I just place these.

[27:14] So you can't remember.

[27:15] You just play, it looks like a standard body to me in this picture.

[27:18] Well, it would say if it's a wide body somewhere in the listing.

[27:21] It looks cool.

[27:22] And a lot of the posts very, very close to the flippers.

[27:27] Very dangerous looking game.

[27:28] This one looks fun.

[27:29] What do you think?

[27:31] Okay.

[27:32] Not so much, he says.

[27:35] Let's put this way.

[27:36] At Expo where there was lots of Aussies there, at least two of them said, hey, did you

[27:42] play the Hanking Games?

[27:44] They kind of suck.

[27:45] That's what they told me.

[27:47] They told me.

[27:48] And they're, they're the Australian.

[27:50] Yeah, I'll stir it.

[27:51] So you got to have some.

[27:54] I start somewhere.

[27:55] It kind of starts somewhere, man.

[27:58] You got to start somewhere.

[27:59] So that brings us to the second game also made in 1978.

[28:04] That's orbiter one.

[28:05] No.

[28:06] It's orbit one.

[28:08] Orbiter one would be the, that would be the start.

[28:11] Yeah.

[28:12] It's just a prequel.

[28:14] Or maybe this is a, maybe this is a sequel to orbit.

[28:18] Or maybe it's a sequel to super orbit.

[28:22] Science fiction fantasy theme sells a thousand twenty units, the same amount oddly enough as

[28:28] the FJ game.

[28:29] So it's like they must have just ordered that amount of parts.

[28:33] Uncredited design and art.

[28:35] But again, it's probably David Hanken that did it.

[28:37] The game is named after an arcade that Hanken opened in Newcastle, Australia in the

[28:45] late seventies.

[28:46] Around Newcastle, but yes.

[28:47] Yeah, whatever.

[28:49] I'm just trying to be accurate.

[28:52] We're not into details here.

[28:53] We know that from the last episode.

[28:55] So this is an awesome flyer, but it also says first Australian pinball.

[29:01] Yeah.

[29:02] So I don't know.

[29:03] So this is where this is where I'm getting into the like weird crossing over of when they

[29:08] were made and released because the other one kind of made it sound like it was the first.

[29:12] Now this one is saying first.

[29:14] Now they were also made in the same year.

[29:16] So it's possible that they were launched at the same time like at the same show.

[29:21] It's one to four players, three or five balls, space age electronic score sounds built

[29:28] in self test system.

[29:30] Front, wait a minute, front and programming.

[29:32] I don't know what that means.

[29:34] That must be like a keeping track of like money and stuff.

[29:38] Feature memory.

[29:39] Wait a minute.

[29:40] Automatic free game percentage calculation.

[29:44] Oh, that's a wait a minute.

[29:45] We had a whole thing.

[29:46] Wait a minute.

[29:47] That was done on high speed.

[29:48] You mean to tell me orbit one had that first?

[29:50] Yeah.

[29:51] Well, here's the thing like seven or eight years before that.

[29:55] This was a whole a whole thing with Williams and Gottlieb, right?

[29:59] We talked about this where Williams was suing Gottlieb or they had to pay a bunch of

[30:02] fees for their automatic free game percentage calculation.

[30:06] It must be a different type of automatic free game.

[30:09] Yeah, that's got to be different than what I'm thinking.

[30:13] It might be the same thing, but maybe the calculation itself, like the algorithm is different.

[30:17] I mean, if they did it, that far before high speed did it.

[30:22] That's impressive.

[30:24] Yeah.

[30:25] And it has a six month warranty on its boards.

[30:31] For those people moving from a electro mechanical into this whole solid state era, I bet you

[30:39] that was a huge concern was how reliable are these boards going to be because all I have

[30:44] to do is file and clean the, you know, the stepper motor, the computer in the M system,

[30:52] right?

[30:53] Where this is a whole thing that I don't know.

[30:54] Well, that's a six month warranty.

[30:56] It uses the motor all the 68-02 microprocessor.

[30:59] It has four Ks, four K of memory.

[31:03] All of the Ks?

[31:06] See, what I like this, 25% less componentry, I didn't know that was a word, than most US-made

[31:13] machines.

[31:14] Yeah, it's got less cram.

[31:17] Switches allow 11 different pricing levels.

[31:20] Cheat proof, income total totalizer, totalist, what does that say?

[31:27] T-O-T-A-L total is the later?

[31:30] Total isolator.

[31:32] Sure.

[31:33] Automatic free game percentage calculator.

[31:36] I really want to know how that works.

[31:38] If you know what that is, throw that in to silverbalkronicles at g.com.

[31:41] That's something we'd like to know.

[31:42] I'd like to know what that means.

[31:44] Yeah.

[31:45] If anyone at past times arcade knows what that means because they have all these games

[31:49] there.

[31:50] Yeah, there you go.

[31:51] There you go.

[31:52] Has own onboard, quote unquote, onboard microprocessor enabling sound to be produced simultaneously

[31:59] with score.

[32:01] That's serious and costly delays, particularly when a machine is counting off bonus points.

[32:06] Yeah, sorry, everybody.

[32:08] This is a bit blurry.

[32:09] That's why we're having a hard time.

[32:10] No, you're having a hard time.

[32:11] I could read it.

[32:12] I wondered if that means it could play the sound simultaneously with saying like, I don't

[32:16] have to wait to play all the sounds.

[32:19] Sound system has the ability to create 16 different notes, whoa, which when combined with

[32:25] wave shape, I don't know what that says.

[32:31] All the iterations literally enable it to produce a limitless, limitless number of different

[32:37] sounds.

[32:38] Yeah.

[32:39] So yes, you're not having any trouble at all reading through this blurry text.

[32:43] I just don't know what that word is.

[32:46] It's a great thing.

[32:47] Let's take a look at the play field.

[32:49] Let's look at this backlash.

[32:50] This backlash is pretty awesome.

[32:51] It's like a, it's like a planet.

[32:53] It's, it's got the mirroring mirror.

[32:56] You've got to have the mirroring.

[32:58] Man, the mirroring.

[32:59] It looks like, I wish we did more.

[33:00] It's planet silver bomb.

[33:02] It looks like.

[33:03] Yeah.

[33:04] So cool.

[33:05] So cool.

[33:06] See, I'm a sucker for these old, like the cool thing about science fiction art.

[33:10] And this goes back to like pinball machines or films or movie posters or comic books.

[33:16] Science fiction art around different eras is so cool.

[33:21] Because it's, you can distinctly look at it and be like, oh, that is totally like 70s,

[33:25] you know, science fiction art.

[33:27] And it's so distinctly different than science fiction art today.

[33:30] It's so cool.

[33:32] But this is another kind of unique play field.

[33:35] It has what looks to be a captive ball on the left side that bounces up to hit, hits

[33:40] a target.

[33:41] There's an orbit spinner that kind of has one of those loops in the middle.

[33:45] So instead of going all the way around the orbit, it's got a horseshoe.

[33:49] The captive ball on the left is in a thing that looks, I think it's supposed to look like

[33:52] a rocket.

[33:53] And it actually looks just like the inline drop target area of future spa.

[33:57] Yeah.

[33:58] And it looks like a boat.

[34:00] It doesn't look like a rocket.

[34:01] It looks like a boat.

[34:03] Just kind of the weird shape of it.

[34:06] But it's a unique play field.

[34:07] It's kind of neat, right?

[34:09] It's got that old stern kind of looking feel to it.

[34:12] Although it doesn't look weird enough to be an oldster.

[34:16] Like it has a couple of, like you look at it, you're like, oh, that's kind of cool.

[34:18] And then I think when you play it, you're going to go, that's kind of gross.

[34:22] Yeah, I'd say I played all five of them and there was nothing in any of them that was

[34:25] like offensive.

[34:26] Yeah, like, oh my God, what were they thinking?

[34:29] Okay.

[34:30] So do you think they're stealing ideas from anybody or do you think he's, well, we'll

[34:34] get to that.

[34:35] But no, I mean, these are very, very safe, simple play field designs.

[34:40] Yes, nothing.

[34:41] Two pop bumpers, captive ball spinner, two stand, three standups.

[34:46] Yeah.

[34:47] Pretty straightforward, very simple game.

[34:49] Looks like it's fun.

[34:51] Looks like a fun game.

[34:52] If you had this in your basement, you'd enjoy it for sure.

[34:54] It's no stars.

[34:55] Oh, well, yeah, nothing is stars, but yeah, no stars.

[34:59] How about this is the game?

[35:02] I was like, confused me.

[35:04] Like, who is this?

[35:05] It literally says on Dennis lilies, how's that?

[35:09] How's that?

[35:10] O W Z A T.

[35:11] I'm like, that's got to be, that means something in Australia.

[35:14] I have no idea what that is.

[35:16] A H O W Z A T.

[35:18] In terms of Dennis lily, I guess, is a cricket player?

[35:21] Yeah.

[35:22] So how is that?

[35:23] I would assume it would be like, how is that, which is like jammed together in Australia

[35:26] in a way?

[35:27] Dennis lilies, what is Dennis lilies?

[35:30] How is that?

[35:31] Something like that.

[35:32] So that's how I would see it.

[35:33] So yeah, it's cricket theme.

[35:34] Only 350 units.

[35:35] Uncredited all around.

[35:36] And this one is, in fact, a wide body.

[35:39] This brings me to who the hell is Dennis lily?

[35:43] So I googled Dennis lily.

[35:44] And this is like everybody in Australia.

[35:47] And if anybody listens to us in Australian cricketing or the cricket world is going to

[35:53] think like, how do you not know who Dennis lily is?

[35:58] And to us in North America, cricket is not a thing unless you're from a way and you play

[36:05] cricket here amongst your community.

[36:06] But Canadians don't play cricket.

[36:09] I was actually hoping to be an Australian football player.

[36:12] So I love that stuff.

[36:14] See, that's cool.

[36:15] And then you could be like out or a rugby guy, right?

[36:18] Rugby rules football to me is very Australian because it's Australian rules football.

[36:23] Yeah, isn't that soccer?

[36:24] No.

[36:25] No, Australian rules football, they play with a football.

[36:28] It looks more like an American football.

[36:30] But they have to punch it to each other or kick it to each other.

[36:34] And if they kick it in the air and the guys all jump up, if the guy catches it, it's

[36:38] a mark and they have to clear out of his way and then it gets like a free kick and stuff.

[36:43] And there's what four goal posts, you kick it between the middle two, I think it's like

[36:47] six points.

[36:48] Just like in the outer two or one or two points or something.

[36:53] And these guys just tackles each other and stuff.

[36:55] It's great.

[36:56] It's like Canadian football.

[36:57] We're like, ah, that field's not big enough.

[37:00] Let's make it a little bigger.

[37:01] And then all the players that aren't good enough in the NFL can come play here.

[37:04] You know, the Dennis lily, he was rated as the outstanding fast boulder of his generation.

[37:09] So, okay.

[37:10] This brings me to this thing.

[37:12] I Google Dennis lily and he's this Australian retired cricketer.

[37:17] And then as you say, he's the outstanding fast boulder of his generation.

[37:21] So then I'm like, oh, God, now I got to look up a bunch of other words that I don't understand.

[37:27] So lily formed a new ball partnership with Jeff Thompson, which is recognized as one

[37:34] of the greatest bowling pairs of all time.

[37:37] So now I got to look up bowling, which I think is throwing the ball.

[37:42] And then I got to look up this Jeff Thompson, this Jeff Thompson guy Thompson.

[37:46] And without a B Thompson.

[37:49] Now by the time of his retirement, David lily's retirement from international cricket in 1984.

[37:55] So this is five years after this game is made or six years after this game is made.

[38:00] He had become the world record holder for the most test wicks wickets at 355 and had firmly

[38:08] established himself as one of the most recognizable and renowned Australian sports persons of all time.

[38:15] What's his name?

[38:16] David lily.

[38:17] You know, it's Dennis lily.

[38:18] Dennis lily.

[38:19] Dennis lily.

[38:20] David Dennis, that's my name.

[38:23] So now I got to look up what the heck a test wicket is.

[38:26] He was part of the Australian squad, which finished his runner up runner's up at the 1975

[38:31] cricket world cup.

[38:33] And in 2009, lily was inducted into the ICC cricket hall of fame.

[38:38] Yes.

[38:39] So that means when this game was made, he was still active.

[38:41] Yes, he was still a big deal.

[38:44] Cricket is the sport, not big in North America, much bigger in British colonies and in India.

[38:51] Bowling and bowler, that's the pitcher who throws the ball.

[38:57] So they do it all crazy like like their arm is made of jello, which is kind of neat.

[39:02] A wicket, that's the posts that are up behind the cricket bat person who holds the bat.

[39:11] And the bowler has to hit the wickets down.

[39:14] And a test is apparently the longest format of the game, which is very historical and

[39:19] prestigious and can end up being played over five days.

[39:24] That's right.

[39:25] Yeah, because they keep going.

[39:28] You think watching a stream of pinball.

[39:30] I think that would never that would never work in this country in the US.

[39:35] They they they would insist the game ends.

[39:38] They had to speed up baseball because it was too slow.

[39:42] So let's take a look at the play field.

[39:43] This one you played.

[39:45] And this is the one that confused.

[39:46] Look at the back glass.

[39:47] I want to start.

[39:48] He's got the dude's face like right in the center.

[39:50] You know who that strikes me.

[39:52] So it says Dennis lilies.

[39:54] How is that?

[39:55] And then there's like cricket or like the ball at the bottom.

[39:58] And it looks like yawning.

[39:59] He looks like yawning.

[40:00] So he's got dark long hair and this super thick black mustache.

[41:09] He looks like in that episode of the Simpsons when they have the baseball team.

[41:13] That's and Mr. Burns makes Mr. and Mr. Burns makes him shave his his.

[41:20] Okay, you're really okay.

[41:21] It's a softball team and he makes Don Mattingley shave off his.

[41:26] Yeah, it could be because he's get a haircut because there was an incident where they told

[41:31] him to get a haircut when he was with the Yankees, so they wanted to make fun of it.

[41:35] So he looks like him because he's got that big friggin mustache, the dark hair.

[41:41] It's hilarious.

[41:44] And on the flyer, it just has how's that Dennis lilies.

[41:51] How's that?

[41:53] Love it.

[41:55] This game, this is all it's the pinball with the speed and excitement that only Dennis lily

[42:00] or David lily if you're David Dennis can match.

[42:04] Lincoln's new wide bodied pinball, see they're they're plugging that and it's wide

[42:08] body featuring two sets of drop targets and dual flippers test the skills of every player.

[42:16] Yeah, so so Hankin is not immune from the late 70s early 80s freak out over wide.

[42:27] Holy crap, I'm looking at this.

[42:30] You know, I've commented in the past how many times Arnold Schwarzenegger was on Terminator

[42:35] 3, like he's on it so many times.

[42:38] This game beats him hands down.

[42:42] I'm losing track of how many Dennis lilies are on this game.

[42:46] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, all the pop bumpers, all three pop bumpers are

[42:52] him.

[42:53] It's like if you had a kiss and Gene Simmons was just on all four pop bumpers, like he probably

[42:56] would want to be.

[42:58] So you can see that that apparently the bowler, the the pitcher if they they like a like

[43:04] a actual baseball pitcher hold the ball a certain way and then it makes the ball spin in

[43:09] weird ways.

[43:11] It's his hand is like all over in the ball being thrown and it's like it's the thing.

[43:17] It's awesome.

[43:18] You know, you need how is that like Australia needs lily?

[43:22] Love it.

[43:23] You know, oh, I like this extra large cash box.

[43:27] It comes with because you're going to need it.

[43:28] Wait a minute, each solenoid individually fused.

[43:33] Damn, that's a lot of fuses.

[43:35] Unless there's not a lot of solenoids.

[43:38] But it looks it looks packed, right?

[43:40] It also has the automatic free game calculator.

[43:43] Yeah.

[43:44] There is a pop bumper and the bottom of the left of the lower playfield.

[43:49] It's the paragraph position.

[43:50] The dungeon or whatever?

[43:52] No.

[43:53] No, it's a keep going.

[43:54] It's out.

[43:55] You're it's like the cave.

[43:56] The beast layer.

[43:58] The layer.

[43:58] There you go.

[43:59] It's a beast can have a layer in a cave.

[44:01] Mm-hmm.

[44:02] Then you go up the playfield.

[44:03] You got drop targets right right in front of the four flippers.

[44:08] Yeah, it's got the five targets in front.

[44:09] So it kind of looks like what I expected.

[44:12] Like soccer targets.

[44:13] Well, I'm trying to say what was the seaver to you one that he did?

[44:17] The white body.

[44:18] Superman?

[44:19] No, the one after the white body he did after that one.

[44:22] That will you.

[44:22] Oh, yeah.

[44:24] Darn it.

[44:25] But it reminds me of that with the targets in front.

[44:27] But yeah, Superman I think has the same deal with the five targets in front.

[44:30] Yeah.

[44:31] Two spinners.

[44:32] Everybody loves the spinner.

[44:33] Nice captive spot on the right side of saucer.

[44:39] It's got the flip.

[44:40] So it's got a set of flippers right in front of those five drop targets on the left side,

[44:44] which is just terrible if you ask me.

[44:46] They don't really shoot at anything.

[44:48] But then the one on the left side, it's almost like genie right where it's got the drop

[44:54] targets at the top and it's got the flipper on the bottom left side.

[44:57] A little bit of that into it.

[44:58] And then there's a spinner up there.

[44:59] It looks cool.

[45:00] And you played this and it was not good.

[45:04] Why was it not good?

[45:05] I honestly, I can't remember.

[45:08] I just remember one of the five I actually was like, I kind of like this one.

[45:13] And that was it.

[45:14] I didn't hate any of them.

[45:16] Does this one suffer from that kind of wide body?

[45:19] Like the ball kind of lumbars around and takes a while and you're like, I wish it was

[45:24] fast.

[45:25] No, they all they all played pretty fast.

[45:26] Okay.

[45:27] That's good.

[45:28] God, he's all over the play field.

[45:29] I don't.

[45:30] He's everywhere.

[45:31] This has to be a record.

[45:32] Actually, I'm going to put it out there.

[45:35] If anyone wants to email us, if they can find any play field that has more instances of

[45:39] the same dude.

[45:40] Yes.

[45:41] Because I'm counting.

[45:42] It's literally the same guy.

[45:43] One, two, three.

[45:44] On the front of the play field here, he's throwing the ball.

[45:49] So it's what it is.

[45:50] One picture with his hand at the top.

[45:52] One of it coming down.

[45:53] One of it fully all the way down.

[45:55] I'm counting at least 15 instances of him.

[45:58] Yeah.

[45:59] So the three on the bottom are the batter.

[46:00] I don't know if that's actually.

[46:02] He's like on every plastic.

[46:04] One, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

[46:12] Was there an issue with approvals?

[46:14] There's 13 and then on the back glass, 14.

[46:17] It's like, no, mate.

[46:18] I'm not on there enough.

[46:20] More.

[46:21] So what was that 14?

[46:23] Oh, that's right.

[46:24] He's on the back glass at least another five times.

[46:26] Oh my God.

[46:28] Unbelievable.

[46:28] If you can find any other pinball machine that has the character.

[46:32] We challenge our listeners.

[46:34] It doesn't have to be, I'm not going to qualify it by saying it has to be the license

[46:37] person.

[46:38] No, just have to be.

[46:39] Any instance.

[46:40] The same character this many times.

[46:42] Good, good on you, Australia.

[46:44] Good on you.

[46:45] Good for you.

[46:46] Or Melka.

[46:47] Or Ben on him if he had a huge ego and demanded that he be on the game that many times.

[46:51] You know, I bet you what it was is the Hanken team realized that they had like a huge

[46:58] star and they wanted to put them all over it so they could like, fawn over him and talk

[47:02] to him and say like, look, we made for you and all that's like, it's like if Wayne

[47:07] Gretzky came to a Canadian team.

[47:10] A Canadian manufacturer was like, can you make me a pinball machine?

[47:13] Maybe there would be like, oh my God, it's Wayne Gretzky.

[47:15] It'd be like they didn't get any permission to make the game from him.

[47:19] So they figured they put them on it enough.

[47:21] He couldn't turn it down like, oh my God.

[47:24] I'm on this thing like 20 times.

[47:26] This is great.

[47:27] Yeah.

[47:28] Okay.

[47:29] Do you have a favorite week of television?

[47:32] I don't watch television.

[47:33] You don't watch television.

[47:34] You don't have a favorite time of the year.

[47:37] Gee, I wonder if maybe, maybe shark week would be my favorite time of the year.

[47:43] There you go.

[47:44] The next game is shark.

[47:46] This is the one I actually kind of liked.

[47:48] It's a futuristic underwater surfing shark attack theme.

[47:53] Yeah, it's jaws, but they probably didn't have license so it's just shark.

[47:57] But in jaws, they did not surf in space suits.

[48:00] That's true.

[48:01] This is like cosmic gunfight if it's about sharks somehow.

[48:05] So in Australia, like surfing is a thing.

[48:09] That's like a whole subculture.

[48:11] It can't look as cool as these people surfing though.

[48:15] It's so it where I'm from going to the beaches like that, but we don't have like Australian

[48:19] beaches where we're at, right?

[48:21] Like we're in northern Atlantic province.

[48:24] It's freaking cold here.

[48:26] Even all the time it like you get used to the cold water.

[48:29] We don't really like when we surf here, we wear like full wet suits.

[48:34] Looking at the back glass, I like it even more now.

[48:37] Isn't that cool?

[48:38] It's got sharks.

[48:41] It's got people surfing on like futuristic surfboards wearing like spacesuits.

[48:48] All the score displays have shark teeth around them.

[48:50] And I just realized that being eaten.

[48:52] Like the whole border of the back glass is shark teeth for eyeballs.

[48:57] For random eyeballs in the corner.

[48:58] I don't know if those are the sharks eyeballs or those the eyeballs of the people that are

[49:03] left over because they've been eaten by a shark or those are the eyeballs that Wesley

[49:06] Stypes popped out of the guy's head and demolish your man.

[49:09] I think.

[49:10] I think that's a question.

[49:12] Are the sharks and the surfers, are they fighting crime?

[49:19] Are the surfers fighting off the sharks?

[49:21] Yeah, it's kind of confusing.

[49:23] They almost look like they're on the same team.

[49:24] Are the sharks in space?

[49:27] No, there's water.

[49:28] There's water.

[49:29] You can see the water.

[49:30] Are they under the water?

[49:31] They don't look like they're on.

[49:32] They're jumping up.

[49:33] Maybe it's like shark NATO.

[49:35] Yeah, it's before it's time.

[49:38] Is this a wide body too?

[49:39] I think it is.

[49:40] It is.

[49:41] Yes.

[49:42] You know, you can sink your teeth into big profits.

[49:45] Great.

[49:46] I love it already.

[49:47] Very good.

[49:48] Yeah.

[49:49] Three banks of drop targets for exciting skillshooting.

[49:53] The extra ball wedge turns every 35 scores of 100 points or more for approximately eight

[49:59] seconds.

[50:00] Turns on every 35 scores of 100 points.

[50:03] Okay.

[50:04] It has a horseshoe.

[50:05] It has a horseshoe.

[50:06] Memory options.

[50:08] For both bonus multipliers and bonus count, you can hold them over.

[50:12] The finish is top quality polyurethane paint for extra attraction and durability.

[50:18] Polyurethane.

[50:20] My favorite kind of urethane.

[50:21] Don't forget that self-test system with that automatic free game calculation, which I

[50:26] got to find out what the hell that means.

[50:28] Somebody needs to tell us what that means.

[50:29] Big time.

[50:30] But let's take a look at it.

[50:31] The art on the side.

[50:34] The side of the cabinet, since we're talking about art, is like a dude in a wetsuit scuba

[50:40] dive.

[50:41] He's looking for the thunderball edition auditions.

[50:45] But man, that wetsuit is tight.

[50:47] Look at how tight it is around his butt.

[50:49] Yes.

[50:50] It is very tight.

[50:51] It looks uncomfortably tight.

[50:52] It's surprising that they were able to do that with like stencils and spraying it on.

[50:57] Actually isn't the thing in his mouth like out?

[51:00] Yes.

[51:01] It's like hanging.

[51:02] It's like hanging behind him.

[51:03] He has another one in his mouth.

[51:04] I'm confused.

[51:05] So he's got a backup.

[51:06] That's not a bad idea, I guess.

[51:09] I mean, you are under one.

[51:12] So this one has the two flippers on the bottom plus the mini flippers above them.

[51:18] And this is a little bit like, oh, space invaders, right?

[51:23] Where it's got the kind of the two at the top and the two on the bottom.

[51:26] It's kind of cool.

[51:29] The play field art is dark.

[51:33] It's very blackish.

[51:34] Yep.

[51:35] It's got lots of blacks.

[51:36] There's like a weird, like I want to say he's like a wizard looking dude in the middle.

[51:44] I don't understand what he's doing.

[51:46] He's like mad at the shark.

[51:48] But it is busy.

[51:49] It is a busy play field.

[51:51] There is art all over the place.

[51:53] This is like, this is like if Steve Richie had a modern game and they had to fill up the

[51:57] middle of the play field so they just did a bunch of art.

[51:59] Hey, it's the best card they've had so far, my opinion.

[52:02] It's cool.

[52:03] This fish right here has glasses on.

[52:07] Always not a wizard.

[52:08] He's like a fish with like a face, a human face with sideburns.

[52:14] I, man, this is a shark.

[52:17] This game is a trip, dude.

[52:21] I remember it's the one I really liked.

[52:23] And this is the one you liked of all of them.

[52:25] Because of the art or because of the gameplay?

[52:27] Ah, gameplay.

[52:28] Oh, okay.

[52:29] So describe a little bit of that, would you?

[52:30] I can't remember.

[52:31] I just remember.

[52:32] I just remember I liked it.

[52:34] It was simple to figure out what to do and I just kept doing it over and over.

[52:38] It's like, it's kind of cool.

[52:40] It is something else going on here.

[52:44] And there's like a fish lady at the top without a shirt on.

[52:48] Topless, yes, because we can do that.

[52:50] Because she's a fish lady.

[52:52] Oh no, because we're not in the US.

[52:54] Yeah.

[52:55] I thought the water was warmer in Australia though.

[52:57] Mm.

[52:58] I like that there's a drain skirt.

[53:01] Yes.

[53:02] It's not an apron.

[53:03] It's a drain skirt.

[53:04] It's a drain skirt.

[53:05] A drain skirt.

[53:06] Ron approved winner this one.

[53:09] Yeah.

[53:10] If I was forced to take a handkin game, that would be the one.

[53:13] That would be the one.

[53:14] Not the one you would think.

[53:16] Being the huge Star Wars fan I am, you would think a certain game.

[53:21] So the last pinball machine made by handkin was the Empire Strikes Back.

[53:27] This is the one that everybody's like, oh, everyone actually knows exists.

[53:31] Yes.

[53:32] Yeah, nobody knows, nobody would know about handkin if it wasn't for this game.

[53:36] There's tons of games that were made in Spain or in Italy or in a lot of those countries

[53:42] and people don't really know about those companies.

[53:45] I mean, someone can correct me, but I believe this is the first Star Wars pinball machine.

[53:50] Yeah.

[53:51] It's not even built in the US.

[53:53] It's an Australia.

[53:54] It's the best Star Wars film theme.

[53:57] The Empire Strikes Back from June of 1980.

[54:00] Mm-hmm.

[54:01] Yeah.

[54:02] Right when the movie came out too.

[54:03] So this hit at the right time.

[54:06] And it is licensed.

[54:07] Yeah.

[54:08] This is not one of those sketches where they just did it.

[54:10] No, they actually licensed this.

[54:13] Yes.

[54:14] The Empire Storks Back.

[54:16] The Empire Strikes Back.

[54:17] Yeah.

[54:18] None of that.

[54:19] It's been some letters to make it soundfamous.

[54:21] Release May of 1980.

[54:22] Yeah.

[54:23] What a great game.

[54:24] Oh, I'm sorry.

[54:25] What a great film.

[54:26] Yes.

[54:27] So this film was a $30 million budget and it was the follow up to the movie that started

[54:31] at all Empire Strikes Back.

[54:33] I'm sorry.

[54:34] Star Wars.

[54:35] I just like the fact that it only cost 30 million and it made $538 million.

[54:41] $538 million back then.

[54:43] Of course, that is after the destruction of the Death Star.

[54:47] The Imperial Fleet is trying to chase down all of the.

[54:50] The Empire Strikes Back.

[54:52] Yes, as the name would suggest.

[54:55] And this movie is really great for a couple of reasons.

[54:58] One of them is George Lucas didn't direct it or do any of the screenplay.

[55:02] Wow.

[55:03] It's also the first one I actually saw in a theater.

[55:08] When I was a kid, man, Empire Strikes Back.

[55:09] Still awesome.

[55:10] I think probably the next best one is the last Jedi, which now people have crashed their

[55:15] cars because they're so angry, I say.

[55:18] But I think the last Jedi is a freaking great story.

[55:20] There's only three Star Wars movies, bro.

[55:22] Come on.

[55:23] That's true.

[55:24] That's because they're no longer for your age group after you see them when you're a

[55:26] child.

[55:27] It sucks.

[55:29] This is all from a secondary source.

[55:31] What I'm going to talk about here.

[55:32] So I wasn't able to find any primary sources of David Hanken talking on a podcast or any

[55:39] written documentation on any of this.

[55:42] So I'm getting this from a secondary source.

[55:45] Currently, the licensing was arranged through roadshow licensing corp limited, which was

[55:51] the Australian representative for Lucasfilm.

[55:55] So it wasn't Lucasfilm directly.

[55:58] It was the Australian arm of Lucasfilm or the person that they delegated that to.

[56:04] So I guess in Australia, if you were going to make Star Wars toys, you probably had to

[56:08] go through this roadshow licensing corporation company.

[56:13] The game itself is pretty.

[56:17] The highlight is the back glass is pretty is pretty familiar because it's got Vader.

[56:23] So the back glass has the Vader.

[56:25] It's got the Empire Strikes back and it has the infinity glass look.

[56:29] Yeah.

[56:30] I think it's my body too from xenon.

[56:31] Yeah, it's a wide body.

[56:32] It's got that xenon look.

[56:33] Right.

[56:34] I love it.

[56:35] I love it.

[56:36] Strike back and strike it rich.

[56:38] Get in on it because man, they were behind the ball with how Star Wars like exploded into

[56:45] the scene.

[56:47] They kind of had their ducks in a row when it came to licensing and toys and stuff with

[56:50] Empire Strikes back.

[56:51] And where was the US on and stuff?

[56:53] They failed so miserably with pinball trying to.

[56:56] Yeah.

[56:57] I mean, there's doesn't make any sense.

[56:58] Yeah.

[56:59] Even the first like, well, the video game was huge.

[57:05] You might be too.

[57:06] You might be too young to remember the vector graphics classic Star Wars, but yes, well,

[57:11] one of the greatest controllers ever.

[57:13] And yeah, if you can find the sit down model, awesome.

[57:17] That's the way to go.

[57:18] That's got like the, what is it?

[57:19] 25 inch monitor.

[57:20] It's got the bigger monitor.

[57:21] Yeah.

[57:22] So see, I don't, I didn't know about that game when it was younger.

[57:25] I knew about that game when I was like looking up arcade machines and I'm like, yeah, there's

[57:28] a picture somewhere that the one they gave to Lucas.

[57:31] They put an extra plaque on the side or something.

[57:35] This doesn't have just a flyer.

[57:38] This has a booklet.

[57:39] Yeah, got to have a booklet.

[57:40] It's Star Wars.

[57:41] May the force be with you with Hank.

[57:44] Yeah.

[57:45] Nice.

[57:46] They've really, they hammered it with that one.

[57:48] They put Vader everywhere, which is smart.

[57:51] Now look at this picture on the left.

[57:54] What is, who is that?

[57:56] Leaning over this pinball machine, leaning over it, checking it out.

[58:00] Oh, is that Mark Campbell?

[58:01] That is Mark.

[58:02] Wow.

[58:03] A young Mark Hamill before he got old and bitter.

[58:09] Before they destroyed his character, it's Luke Skywalker himself.

[58:12] Or gave his character more depth.

[58:14] Yeah.

[58:15] Okay.

[58:16] Luke Skywalker.

[58:17] The movie of the year is now the pinball of the year.

[58:21] And it was such a pinball of the year.

[58:23] How many units did it sell?

[58:25] Uh, 350.

[58:26] Yikes.

[58:27] Okay.

[58:28] So Mark Hamill was looking at it saying, hey, this looks like firepower.

[58:33] He's like, he's like, wait a second.

[58:35] Isn't this game space invaders?

[58:38] I always saw it more as firepower, especially the whole four pop bumper nest with the six

[58:44] targets, just like firepower.

[58:47] It's got two dead bumpers at the top.

[58:50] So a total of like six bumpers, four active, two inactive.

[58:54] Is that their first inactive bumpers?

[58:56] I think so.

[58:57] There's a spinner on the left side.

[58:59] There's a spinner on the right on the orbits.

[59:02] Active hole on the right.

[59:04] It looks like not a very target, but a stand up target, some drop targets.

[59:08] And in the middle, it's got those, like you said, six stand up targets like firepower.

[59:13] Now when it gets to the lower play field and the sort of the middle, let me say middle

[59:19] play field to lower play field, because it's a wide body.

[59:21] So it was really big.

[59:23] And it's all the arch or what did they call it?

[59:26] The, uh, oh yeah, we just said it.

[59:28] The drain cover.

[59:29] The drain cover.

[59:30] Yeah.

[59:31] The drain cover.

[59:32] It's really way down the play field.

[59:34] But I just like that.

[59:36] So this came out in 1980.

[59:38] So at the beginning of 1980, they saw firepower and they saw how much money that made.

[59:42] So it's like, we need to replicate this in our design.

[59:45] But let's make it better.

[59:47] I don't think to see, I don't think this has multi ball.

[59:50] So let's make more, let's make more of it because more is always better.

[59:54] Yeah.

[59:55] So let's put four flippers at the bottom.

[59:57] Again, like space invaders, two small ones and then two regular size ones below that.

[01:00:03] It's got six lanes, two out lanes.

[01:00:07] I'm sorry, one out laying on each side and then two in lanes on each side.

[01:00:12] So six in total.

[01:00:14] The middle, the art.

[01:00:16] So it's star war.

[01:00:17] It's, you look at it and it's, um, it, it ain't no shark.

[01:00:23] It ain't no shark.

[01:00:24] It's got an ad at.

[01:00:25] It's got Vader.

[01:00:27] The ad at just doesn't look the same.

[01:00:29] It just, it looks, it's a bit, I don't know, it just looks all.

[01:00:32] No, in the movie, they never caught that either.

[01:00:34] Ad at was purely to sell the product as a kid and it worked because I still caught that.

[01:00:40] What they'd actually called ATAT?

[01:00:41] No, they're just called Imperial walkers.

[01:00:44] That's all they call them in the movie.

[01:00:46] They don't say the ad atts are here.

[01:00:48] There's a Millennium Falcon which did not fight the, the Walker.

[01:00:52] At least the size is close.

[01:00:55] Yeah.

[01:00:56] It's got the, it's got the little other ships that fly around it.

[01:01:00] They did everything with the artwork they should have.

[01:01:02] They put lots of Vader because the Empire Strikes Back.

[01:01:05] So it's all very Empire heavy.

[01:01:07] Yeah, it's the darker of the film.

[01:01:09] I think when you get people a choice between like good guys and bad guy,

[01:01:13] or it worked, they almost go for bad guys.

[01:01:15] Or it worked every time.

[01:01:16] I mean, they did that, stern did that with their star wars.

[01:01:18] They had the one that was more rebel side and then had the art package.

[01:01:23] It was more, you know, Imperial, more Vader.

[01:01:26] Yeah, it was like premium versus pro super cool.

[01:01:30] Vaders on the pop upbers because of course he is.

[01:01:33] He's on the side cabinet which looks really cool.

[01:01:37] He's using the force, right?

[01:01:39] There's like waves coming out.

[01:01:41] He's probably from it.

[01:01:42] He's using the force which is an invisible way.

[01:01:47] So cool.

[01:01:50] That'd be cool if it made that sound.

[01:01:52] Yeah.

[01:01:53] I don't believe it even has multi ball though.

[01:01:54] I don't believe it does, but it is super cool and you played it and thought it was awesome.

[01:02:01] I played it and went back to play Shark instead.

[01:02:04] So according to pinball memories, which is a book, the game was first exhibited in November

[01:02:10] of 1980 at the National Amusement Machine Operator's Convention held in Surfers, Paradise,

[01:02:16] Queen's Land Australia.

[01:02:17] Cool.

[01:02:18] What an awesome name.

[01:02:20] Surfers, Paradise.

[01:02:21] Imagine showing up for that and there's a freaking Empire Strikes Back and it's like,

[01:02:26] what?

[01:02:27] It's good race.

[01:02:28] But why with such an awesome, they're getting into the licensing.

[01:02:30] They're getting it, right?

[01:02:32] Why was this their final game and why do they cut production so short?

[01:02:37] Because of video games.

[01:02:38] Killin' everything, man.

[01:02:40] The pinball compendium, which is the 1970 to 1981 version.

[01:02:44] David Hanken tells the author that the pinball production stopped because of video games,

[01:02:51] popularity, right?

[01:02:53] It was the video game sort of revolution because of video game.

[01:02:58] You just put it on location.

[01:03:00] You turn it on.

[01:03:02] People put coins in it and it makes money.

[01:03:06] There's no pop bumpers.

[01:03:07] There's no fuses.

[01:03:08] There's no controllers.

[01:03:09] There's no controllers.

[01:03:10] Really only you got to worry about.

[01:03:11] The ball doesn't get stuck, right?

[01:03:15] If the joystick stops working, you unscrew it.

[01:03:18] You screw a new one in, you plug it in, done.

[01:03:21] Right?

[01:03:22] Like, I just bought a missile command.

[01:03:25] You love missile command, Ron.

[01:03:26] You bought a missile command?

[01:03:27] I bought a missile command.

[01:03:28] You bought a vector game?

[01:03:29] Good luck with that monitor.

[01:03:30] No, this is a regular monitor.

[01:03:31] Really?

[01:03:32] I thought it was a vector monitor.

[01:03:33] Oh yeah, you're right.

[01:03:34] What am I thinking of?

[01:03:35] Damn.

[01:03:36] You're thinking of...

[01:03:37] I'm thinking of asteroids.

[01:03:38] Nothing in asteroids.

[01:03:39] Yeah.

[01:03:40] Asteroids.

[01:03:41] Which I would love in asteroids too.

[01:03:43] Those are my two favorite games.

[01:03:45] So I bought a missile command.

[01:03:46] That's got like the large track ball.

[01:03:49] Yeah, the four inch.

[01:03:51] Yeah, the four inch instead of the three inch.

[01:03:53] Oh my.

[01:03:54] So this thing just sits in my living room.

[01:03:55] I just turn on and it works.

[01:03:57] Right?

[01:03:58] There's no screwing around with it.

[01:03:59] Yeah, actually with a CRT monitor, if it's been like recapped,

[01:04:03] rebuilt.

[01:04:04] It has.

[01:04:05] It will in a home use where you hardly ever turn on.

[01:04:07] It'll outlast you.

[01:04:09] It'll be dead before it, I think, doesn't work.

[01:04:11] Yeah, so this game was refurbished by the one and the only Todd Tuckie.

[01:04:18] This is a Todd Tuckie.

[01:04:19] Oh, shit.

[01:04:20] So it's been all redone on the inside, new, the roller ball and all the stuff is in the

[01:04:24] chips and the big blue and all that other crap inside has all been done.

[01:04:29] And it's signed on the back by the whole team.

[01:04:32] I believe this is one of those machines that was sent to Mark from Canada.

[01:04:37] And he must not have liked it or wasn't very good at it, but now it's mine.

[01:04:40] So who got the next kick at the kangaroo, Ron?

[01:04:43] The next kick.

[01:04:44] Oh, you mean the next Australian to try to make a game?

[01:04:47] Yeah.

[01:04:48] I mean, I mean, you could say Wayne.

[01:04:51] Yeah.

[01:04:52] And Wayne's last name is?

[01:04:54] Oh, is it, it's, it's Jalard?

[01:04:57] I think it's Gillard.

[01:04:59] Gillard, yeah, I think you're right.

[01:05:00] Wayne Gillard.

[01:05:01] Now he was on the Ozzy pinball podcast, which is hosted by Dr. John Carson, who is a staple

[01:05:09] in pinball streaming and podcasting in the Australian scene.

[01:05:14] And you know him best for his great trivia that he plays with you and Bruce Nightingale,

[01:05:21] who is the co-host of Slamtill podcast.

[01:05:23] Yeah.

[01:05:24] And he, Wayne, he's known in Australia.

[01:05:29] It's Mr. Pinball.

[01:05:30] Mr. Pinball, Australia.

[01:05:32] I think he's the main distributor there still to this day, I believe.

[01:05:36] Since he was 15, Wayne has been in to pinball and he started Mr. Pinball in Oakley, South

[01:05:43] Victoria, Australia.

[01:05:46] So the company grew all through the 90s and in the 2000s to become the major distributor,

[01:05:53] distributor, I guess some people say, in Australia with allied leisure.

[01:05:59] And I mean, he started in a purchase 20 of the pinball 2000 machines and Wayne saw an

[01:06:05] opportunity.

[01:06:06] So he sold 80 of them to boost his standings in the distributor network because he wanted

[01:06:12] to get further up the ordering chain.

[01:06:16] In 2005, Wayne secured the rights for pinball manufacturing and replacement parts from who?

[01:06:24] That was from Jean Cunningham.

[01:06:26] Yes.

[01:06:27] Illinois pinball.

[01:06:28] Illinois pinball, yeah.

[01:06:30] Now they originally had the exclusive licensing to sell and remanufacture pinball.

[01:06:36] And those were the parts were like five years.

[01:06:40] They had the non-exclusive rights.

[01:06:42] They still retain some rights because they were still making Williams parts in Illinois

[01:06:46] pinball.

[01:06:47] But yeah, that you can make a whole podcast about just the Williams rights debacle and everything

[01:06:55] with that.

[01:06:56] It was a big time.

[01:06:57] We have a whole episode on Illinois pinball where we talked about Jean Cunningham, the pinball

[01:07:02] enthusiast and collector where he purchased all the leftover Williams stuff.

[01:07:07] And then he tried to distribute all of those parts and ran into trouble.

[01:07:11] And he makes new parts and replacement parts when he kind of wasn't supposed to.

[01:07:16] But he only had the exclusivity for five years.

[01:07:19] Yeah.

[01:07:20] Then Williams went out to find other people to license it and do some things with building

[01:07:25] those parts because we talked about how like building a game, tooling the parts, being

[01:07:31] able to build the parts like the pop bumpers or solenoids or plastics or things.

[01:07:35] Those all had different licensing requirements.

[01:07:38] Yeah, but Wayne, he got the license.

[01:07:40] As far remember, he got the license to the ballet name.

[01:07:42] Yeah.

[01:07:43] So that was a big deal.

[01:07:44] That was the trademark for ballet.

[01:07:46] So he could make ballet games.

[01:07:48] But he couldn't necessarily make the parts for ballet games.

[01:07:52] He had to have a license for that too.

[01:07:54] And then you could buy the old parts that were left in a warehouse, but you couldn't manufacture

[01:07:57] those like it was all weird.

[01:07:59] And we talk about that in our Capcom episode.

[01:08:01] Yeah, but I think he still uses on Pinside.

[01:08:04] He's like, Balli Man or Balli something.

[01:08:07] He still uses the ballet.

[01:08:08] He still holds the trademark.

[01:08:10] Yeah.

[01:08:11] Well, he had held the trademark.

[01:08:12] I'm sorry, the Wayne.

[01:08:15] Yes, Wayne's the, yes.

[01:08:16] Yeah, I believe I got my, who done it, um, translate from him because that was the only

[01:08:22] place I could get a new one was from Australia.

[01:08:25] There.

[01:08:26] So he also, so this is interesting.

[01:08:28] So Wayne, when, when he was like the trademarking of ballet and Williams and, and using those

[01:08:34] trademarks in the gaming industry, for example, if we go into like Indiana Jones, the pinball

[01:08:40] adventure is, that's a third party license.

[01:08:43] They could remake the game, but they couldn't put Williams on it.

[01:08:49] They could, however, name the game and put Balli on it because Balli was owned by Caesar's

[01:08:57] entertainment.

[01:08:58] Well, what does that mean?

[01:08:59] That means that it won't be confused in gaming with Balli because Balli doesn't make

[01:09:05] gaming anymore.

[01:09:06] It's, it's a bit of a mess.

[01:09:08] And I don't know how he manages to deal with it.

[01:09:12] The, the modern example is Chicago gaming, right?

[01:09:15] Chicago gaming, when they build the Williams machines, you'll, you'll notice they don't

[01:09:21] have Williams written on the back box.

[01:09:24] They have CGC.

[01:09:26] But if you look at the Balli game, attack from Mars, it has Balli written on it.

[01:09:32] It's outrageously confusing.

[01:09:34] So when did he get into thinking about building a game?

[01:09:37] Well, there's two that I remember.

[01:09:39] One was the medieval madness.

[01:09:41] He was going to do those, but he, the remake, because everybody wanted to remap.

[01:09:44] Yeah, because that, yeah, even then everyone wanted, medieval madness was like the one

[01:09:48] everyone wanted, which Chicago gaming would eventually do that one first, I believe, because

[01:09:54] it's the one everyone wanted.

[01:09:55] But he also was looking into doing the crocodile hunter game.

[01:09:59] Yes.

[01:10:00] So Wayne, like everybody thought, building and manufacturing pinball would be fun.

[01:10:05] Hmm.

[01:10:06] And he looked at building a Steve Irwin crocodile hunter game because Steve Irwin was

[01:10:10] a big deal in it, early 2000s.

[01:10:13] The thing was that you have to learn kinetics, right?

[01:10:16] And what do I mean by kinetics when you talk about pinball?

[01:10:19] How it shoots.

[01:10:20] How it shoots in the ball movements and things like that.

[01:10:23] But what the best part is the Balli Williams designs that he purchased came with a lot

[01:10:30] of the drawings or auto CAD files.

[01:10:33] So he saw all of that stuff already.

[01:10:36] He didn't have to learn by drilling into a thing.

[01:10:39] He could look at Steve Richie's designs and be like, oh, that's why Steve Richie

[01:10:43] bent the wire form that way.

[01:10:46] That's pretty slick.

[01:10:47] So who was Steve Irwin?

[01:10:48] Is crocodile hunter?

[01:10:50] He was the Australian zookeeper.

[01:10:51] He was a conservationist, conservationist, television personality, a wildlife educator,

[01:10:57] and a huge environmentalist.

[01:10:59] He was the guy that had the really short brown pants and the cargo boots in the Australian

[01:11:09] accent.

[01:11:10] He knows, head known.

[01:11:12] He was a huge deal.

[01:11:13] Now, he grew up around crocodiles.

[01:11:16] We assume everybody in Australia does.

[01:11:19] And of course, other types of reptiles.

[01:11:21] And he educated, he was educated by his father, Bob Irwin.

[01:11:25] Steve achieved international fame in the late 1990s from the television series, The Crocodile

[01:11:29] Hunter, an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series that he co-hosted with

[01:11:34] his wife Terry.

[01:11:36] And the thing most people don't realize is he didn't own the name crocodile hunter.

[01:11:40] But he was hired by the company that the crocodile hunter to be the crocodile hunter.

[01:11:45] They could have replaced him with someone else and called them the crocodile hunter.

[01:11:49] In 2006, that's when tragedy struck.

[01:11:52] And Irwin died from an injury that he was caused by a stingray while he was filming

[01:11:57] an underwater documentary by the great barrier wreath.

[01:12:02] His death became international news and hit a lot of young children quite hard, if I

[01:12:09] recall.

[01:12:10] But we were right along building this crocodile hunter game.

[01:12:15] If you go on IPDB and the link is in the notes, you can see some of the proofs for the

[01:12:21] crocodile hunter.

[01:12:23] So what does it look like?

[01:12:25] It's got a weird back box design.

[01:12:27] Yeah.

[01:12:28] So the back glass is at the top and then it's got like speakers kind of in the, so the

[01:12:34] translate almost looks like the size of the new modern LCD sturns, where it's a little

[01:12:40] smaller than the older back glasses.

[01:12:42] It's using a DMD.

[01:12:44] It's got speakers above the DMD and then the DMD is kind of recessed underneath the, those

[01:12:49] in the valley logo because he owns the thing.

[01:12:53] But we don't have any play field pictures because I don't think they ever got that far.

[01:12:57] Yeah.

[01:12:58] Or maybe they did and they just just not out there because all of the play fields are

[01:13:02] all kind of blurred out on these promos.

[01:13:05] It's the crocodile hunter out back adventure.

[01:13:08] Isn't she a little ripper?

[01:13:10] Isn't she a little ripper?

[01:13:11] In Canada, we say we're going for a rip.

[01:13:13] Do you guys say that?

[01:13:14] I know.

[01:13:16] Going for a rip, which basically means I'm going like for drive somewhere, going fast.

[01:13:20] Oh, I thought it meant something else.

[01:13:22] I'm going to have a bunch of drinks.

[01:13:24] I'm going to like, if I'm going to let her rip, I'm going to like go flat.

[01:13:27] So they said that here I would think a bomb was involved or something.

[01:13:30] Yes.

[01:13:31] I'm going to send a lot of people call it full send.

[01:13:34] No.

[01:13:35] No.

[01:13:36] All right.

[01:13:37] But if we zip on over to, there's not a whole lot of information about that.

[01:13:44] But if you go over to Pinside, it does have some of the information on, on this game itself.

[01:13:52] So the software by a gentleman named Mark Alexander and Wayne Simmons, the concept by

[01:13:58] Wayne Gullard, Jill Ard.

[01:14:01] Oh, God.

[01:14:02] I'm sorry, Dr. John.

[01:14:03] I should have looked up your email, how to pronounce that.

[01:14:06] Sound by Philip Stevens and music by Philip Stephen.

[01:14:10] So it's got some of the information as to who did this information.

[01:14:14] But why didn't it actually get made?

[01:14:17] Why was it only a concept?

[01:14:19] Well, Wayne says we spent about 250,000 Australian at the time on research and development, product

[01:14:26] development, artwork, programming, circuit boards, cabbages design, all sorts of things.

[01:14:32] Then unfortunately, Steve Irwin died.

[01:14:34] So it was paused for a little while.

[01:14:36] We found out that the best picture show company who owns the rights for Crocodile Hunter technically

[01:14:41] hired Steve Irwin to play that.

[01:14:43] So they own the rights of the Crocodile Hunter and just use Steve Irwin to be the face of

[01:14:47] that.

[01:14:48] We were stuck.

[01:14:49] We could proceed and build a pinball machine and call it Australia Zoo.

[01:14:53] We could use Steve Irwin's image on the machine, but we couldn't use anything to do with

[01:14:58] the Crocodile Hunter at all.

[01:14:59] Yeah.

[01:15:00] So it was the licensing that sunk this pinball machine.

[01:15:04] There were all these third party and companies involved.

[01:15:07] So there was like animal planet.

[01:15:09] There was the Discovery Channel.

[01:15:11] There was this licensing company.

[01:15:14] And apparently that this licensing company went bankrupt after coordinating the license

[01:15:19] for the Crocodile Hunter before Steve Irwin had passed.

[01:15:23] It was just a mess.

[01:15:25] Well Wayne says we just ended up writing it off.

[01:15:29] We got various cabinets, play fields and artwork, but the cost of bringing it to life

[01:15:33] was too much.

[01:15:34] I don't think the licensing is possible anymore.

[01:15:37] Yeah.

[01:15:38] Then there was also manufacturing in Australia.

[01:15:41] So in our other previous Australia episode where we spoke about Haggist pinball, we talked

[01:15:48] about a lot of the challenges trying to manufacture in Australia.

[01:15:53] And this is very much the same problem that Hankin had.

[01:15:56] That was just the cost of material.

[01:15:59] Yeah.

[01:16:00] Wayne says it's cheaper in the long run to order parts from overseas when they're made

[01:16:04] in the US.

[01:16:06] Otherwise you got a tool up for them in Australia and spend money on tooling plus the

[01:16:10] cost of manufacturing, which is too high here.

[01:16:13] I'll give you an example.

[01:16:15] I looked at getting pinball legs made in Australia.

[01:16:18] We needed a 200 ton press to make the legs out of cold, roll steel.

[01:16:22] The tool is about 40,000 Australian.

[01:16:25] If you wanted to run the legs, you had to run a minimum of 10,000 of them.

[01:16:29] And they're going to be about 10 bucks each.

[01:16:31] Nice and nice Australian.

[01:16:32] They were going to cost about $10 Australian each to plate them.

[01:16:36] You're up for a heap of money.

[01:16:38] I could buy the legs from America, from the original manufacturer for $6.50 already

[01:16:43] bladed.

[01:16:44] It just isn't economically feasible.

[01:16:47] He wants to build something close to home.

[01:16:50] Everybody wants to build Australian.

[01:16:53] We want to have great manufacturing.

[01:16:56] But here's the thing.

[01:16:57] It's going to be like triple the cost.

[01:16:59] So then the question becomes, well, is it really worth it at triple the cost?

[01:17:03] No.

[01:17:04] It's just cheaper to buy it from the US and bring it over.

[01:17:07] This happens with buying things from China and bringing it to the US.

[01:17:10] It's just cheaper to do it elsewhere.

[01:17:14] So you can do it at home, but it's going to cost more.

[01:17:16] And you have to accept the fact that you're going to have to pay for inflation.

[01:17:20] And you're going to have to pay for all of that other stuff if you just want to have it

[01:17:24] made locally.

[01:17:26] Now the WPC and the WPC 95 systems, now those are the board sets in those sort of 90s

[01:17:32] Valley Williams games.

[01:17:34] They needed the chips for those boards to be made.

[01:17:38] But the worst bit is if they were going to build these boards, if Wayne and his team were

[01:17:42] going to build these remanufactured these boards.

[01:17:45] A lot of the chips in them were now obsolete.

[01:17:48] And in fact, a lot of these chips were made with hazardous materials that weren't even

[01:17:53] available back then.

[01:17:55] This is much sooner than today's sort of revolution in manufacturing, a remanufacturing, a lot

[01:18:02] of these boards that are done overseas, right, where they're using new materials and

[01:18:07] new chips to do the same thing that those systems did.

[01:18:10] Back then they needed the original ones, right?

[01:18:13] Nobody was going to make a chip that was as good for a 90 something that was made in

[01:18:18] 1995 in 2005.

[01:18:19] Nobody's going to be like, I want to make a crappy chip.

[01:18:22] They all want to make the new chip.

[01:18:24] But enough time has passed now where we can sort of, you know, back date them.

[01:18:28] So they went a different route in 2006 when it came to games, didn't it?

[01:18:33] Didn't it or they didn't have.

[01:18:37] So in 2006, Chicago gaming linked up with Wayne to make medieval madness.

[01:18:46] Now they didn't just manufacture it.

[01:18:48] What happened was Wayne transferred the manufacturing license to planetary pinball.

[01:18:54] So he didn't just license the license.

[01:18:57] He just transferred it because he realized it was probably better to sell it and make some

[01:19:01] money.

[01:19:02] And it was to keep it and hold on for maybe to build on that.

[01:19:09] You know what I said, I correct things.

[01:19:11] That don't seem right because he made medieval madness.

[01:19:14] Wayne.

[01:19:15] I see.

[01:19:16] Yeah, but when Chicago gaming made the medieval madness is locally.

[01:19:19] Yeah, but that was like 10 years after this.

[01:19:23] Exactly.

[01:19:24] So wait a minute.

[01:19:25] So he gave them the license, but they set on for 10 years before they made anything.

[01:19:28] I think so.

[01:19:29] That's a good one, right?

[01:19:30] And I don't remember.

[01:19:31] I do not think that Rick at planetary had these in 2006.

[01:19:37] That seems too early.

[01:19:40] That maybe it was 16.

[01:19:42] Yeah, that sounds more like it because six doesn't sound because I mean Bruce used to go

[01:19:48] to his place when it was Bay Area musements when we would be there for like California

[01:19:53] extreme.

[01:19:54] Extra.

[01:19:55] That was probably after 2006.

[01:19:59] Well, he might have had the license.

[01:20:00] I don't think so.

[01:20:01] Didn't do anything.

[01:20:02] Had it yet.

[01:20:03] No.

[01:20:04] Yeah.

[01:20:05] Okay, maybe it was 16.

[01:20:06] If you know, shoot us an email, silver ball chronicles gmail.com.

[01:20:08] And I'll just friggin put it in the next.

[01:20:10] There we go.

[01:20:11] So we're just loaded with corrections here.

[01:20:12] It just didn't seem right.

[01:20:13] That's like, wait too early.

[01:20:16] But Wayne says the main reason we assign the license to planetary pinball was that I

[01:20:21] had to make a decision.

[01:20:22] I did not want to leave Australia, move to America, set up the business in America because

[01:20:27] all the parts are made there.

[01:20:28] All the tooling is over there.

[01:20:30] All the designers, everything that I just want to hold on to the license and just plot

[01:20:34] along and just make replacement parts.

[01:20:36] I decided that it was in the best interest of pinball for somebody in the US, whoever

[01:20:40] that may be, to do more with the license in the US.

[01:20:44] Pinball tends to be filled with a lot of hoarders.

[01:20:47] It's like this collecting hoarding mentality where some people would buy up a license and

[01:20:51] to just sit on it and be like, ah, my precious.

[01:20:55] But Wayne, I think, was smart enough to know, you know what?

[01:20:59] This is for the community.

[01:21:00] Let's just, I can't do anything with it here.

[01:21:02] Let's get it out.

[01:21:03] Which is so great of him.

[01:21:05] They have everything.

[01:21:06] Pinball news and I don't try to remember it was called planetary pinball then.

[01:21:12] Here we go.

[01:21:13] New company acquires rights.

[01:21:15] 2010.

[01:21:16] That sounds more like it.

[01:21:20] Yeah, there we go.

[01:21:22] Don't send me your correction email.

[01:21:24] I'm looking up.

[01:21:26] Thank you pinball news, you guys rule.

[01:21:28] Basically, yeah, we can, these rights have been sold to a new company planetary pinball supply.

[01:21:33] Yes, Rick, he, and he had very, Bay Area musaments.

[01:21:38] And for a while, he ran them both as like planetary pinball was the Williams parts off

[01:21:44] shoot and he still kept Bay Area musaments going, which was also parts.

[01:21:48] But he eventually just combined them.

[01:21:50] They're just planetary pinball now.

[01:21:52] But this was in 2010.

[01:21:54] Very good.

[01:21:55] Now, Mr. Pinball still very much active in Australia as one of the distributors.

[01:22:01] He, he throw him into your Google machine and look him up Australia and New Zealand.

[01:22:06] Mr. Pinball is probably the spot to go down under.

[01:22:11] And that's because coin giver in Australia has not opened yet, which is Zach Manie's

[01:22:18] Australian arm.

[01:22:19] Oh, I was about to look that up like I what?

[01:22:21] I never heard that before.

[01:22:24] Any other last words on Hanken and Mr. Pinball?

[01:22:29] Shark.

[01:22:30] I like shark.

[01:22:33] And they did the first license Star Wars pinball.

[01:22:37] No one could take that away from him.

[01:22:39] See, the thing is 1980 pinball was still kind of there.

[01:22:43] I mean, he had a lot of innovation going on to like 80 going into 81 and then it starts

[01:22:48] to go downhill.

[01:22:49] So you would think one of the American manufacturers would have been doing it.

[01:22:51] Like, ballet of all people.

[01:22:53] You think ballet would have done it because they were the licensing kings, but.

[01:22:59] And I mean, the biggest thing though was that they they kind of got out before things

[01:23:02] got real bad.

[01:23:03] Oh, yeah.

[01:23:04] Yeah, 1980 was the other last game and yeah.

[01:23:08] It would have been a mess if they stuck around trying to go through that sort of 81, 82,

[01:23:12] 84.

[01:23:13] You know what I mean?

[01:23:15] I think it's interesting.

[01:23:16] They started with regular size and then went to white body for the last few.

[01:23:20] No, you got to follow Atari.

[01:23:22] Atari knew all of it.

[01:23:24] Do not follow Atari.

[01:23:27] And it was oh this again.

[01:25:00] Oh, I know.

[01:25:01] You played them like recently.

[01:25:02] Yes.

[01:25:03] That's why I bumped it up the list.

[01:25:05] They kind of suck.

[01:25:07] And I talked to a couple of Aussies and they said the same thing.

[01:25:10] The game's kind of suck.

[01:25:11] The game's kind of suck, I.

[01:25:13] Yep.

[01:25:14] Yeah.

[01:25:16] And he said the following.

[01:25:20] Go ahead.

[01:25:23] Are you ready?

[01:25:24] OK.

[01:25:25] I'm so ready.

[01:25:27] Well, Michael said, dad and Uncle Judd sold Dave cop.

[01:25:32] Wow, I couldn't get past the first sense what I f***ed up.

[01:25:37] It says a hankin and company.

[01:25:39] We met all hankin and company.

[01:25:41] No, we ate hankin, I think.

[01:25:42] Oh, a.

[01:25:43] That's in the name.

[01:25:44] OK, I'll be trying it again.

[01:25:45] OK.
