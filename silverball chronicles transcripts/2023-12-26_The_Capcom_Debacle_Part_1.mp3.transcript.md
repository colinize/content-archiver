[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Turn a mom. Turn a mom. Oh, turn on those sad songs. Damageurzy, Jack.

[00:23] Is it good? I mean, it's Star Trek. It's the best Star Trek they've done.

[00:29] I like it.

[00:31] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[01:01] And with me is Ron Karate Champ Hallet. What's up fella?

[01:05] Hello, I like that name.

[01:07] Yeah, people might not know this Ron, but you were once a Karate Champ.

[01:13] Champ?

[01:14] Yeah, data east Karate Champ. I was a world record holder for nine years.

[01:17] World record holder.

[01:20] That encompasses the entire planet.

[01:22] The entire planet. Yes, I have the highest score of all time on Karate Champ.

[01:28] Wow.

[01:29] That blows my mind. You have a plaque and everything.

[01:31] I have a plaque. I did it during a tournament in public, so no Billy Micheling here.

[01:36] People actually witnessed it.

[01:38] Were you in the Guinness book that people get at Christmas time?

[01:42] I don't know if they put those in there anymore.

[01:45] Oh.

[01:46] But I was, I'm still listed on the Twin Galaxy site, but I'm second now.

[01:51] So how do you get back into first place?

[01:54] I'm too old.

[01:55] Too old.

[01:56] Can't do it.

[01:57] Too old to begin the training.

[01:58] I was in my 30s when I did it. I'm 50 now. It's not happening.

[02:02] Wow.

[02:03] Okay.

[02:04] Yeah.

[02:05] Some, some employee at Galloping Ghost Arcade beat it.

[02:08] Not fair.

[02:09] Screw that guy.

[02:10] Not fair.

[02:11] For Gal.

[02:13] So what have you been doing? You've been traveling?

[02:15] Have I been traveling?

[02:17] Oh, yeah.

[02:18] Well, I was trying to think the last time we recorded.

[02:20] Was it expo yet?

[02:21] Yeah. It was just about.

[02:22] Just about.

[02:23] Oh, it's before expo.

[02:24] Okay. So I went to expo.

[02:25] You're making this super easy this month for everybody, Ron.

[02:28] Yeah. I saw.

[02:29] You're gonna be so mad about how much crap they're gonna have to listen to before they

[02:31] get to the topic.

[02:32] I played every new game that I could possibly play.

[02:35] Your favorite was Elton John.

[02:37] Uh, of all the new games I played, yeah, yeah.

[02:39] I'd say that.

[02:40] Wow.

[02:41] I mean, as far as new games, I mean, Pulfix and I had already played.

[02:45] A lot of the games I had already played that were newer, like Galactic Tank Force, etc.

[02:50] I mean, the only two, I played Labyrinth.

[02:53] Elton John.

[02:55] Trying to think a completely new I had played yet.

[02:58] All there was that eight ball beyond home bird that was cool.

[03:02] Nice. Very good.

[03:04] Very good.

[03:04] So there's lots of goings on in the industry.

[03:07] Stern has released a couple of re-releases, which is really exciting this year.

[03:12] James Bond code has finally caught up to where the game is not a good chopping mess.

[03:17] You with your bond.

[03:19] It's been almost a year.

[03:21] What are you gonna do when the Goldfinger LE dish and comes out?

[03:24] I'll probably, I don't know, it depends on the price.

[03:28] That's pretty awesome, man.

[03:29] Goldfinger is a pretty epic, epic moment in my life when it comes to cinema history.

[03:36] I'll tell you that.

[03:37] Do you expect me to talk?

[03:38] No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to buy this game for a slight markup.

[03:43] A slight markup.

[03:44] I wanted to let everybody know we've added show notes to silverballacronicles.com.

[03:49] You can jump on over there, Ron.

[03:51] You can check out all of the show notes that we've put in there, all of the various topics

[03:57] that we talk about are listed.

[04:00] Then I have all the sources.

[04:01] You can take a look at all of that stuff.

[04:04] One thing that we have noticed is when we play some of the sources in the description of

[04:09] the podcast, it tends to mess up with the direct links and things.

[04:14] We've put them on to the website.

[04:17] I think we've improved the experience for everyone.

[04:21] As everybody knows, we have sold out two Patreon and we're only doing this for the money.

[04:28] Well, David is.

[04:30] That's right.

[04:31] That's right.

[04:32] Papa needs a new Porsche.

[04:34] The only way I'm going to get that is at $3 a month for probably what, $300,000 a month?

[04:41] If you'd like to pop in for a month or two, give us a $3 donation just to say thanks.

[04:48] Let us know that you're actually listening.

[04:51] Join us for some behind the scenes.

[04:53] Shit chat.

[04:55] We've had quite a few people just kind of come in for a month and go out and that is perfectly

[04:58] cool.

[04:59] That is cool with us.

[05:01] Nothing has changed on the podcast.

[05:02] It'll always be free on the TPN feed and our dedicated Silver Ball Chronicles feed.

[05:08] But if you want early ad-free access, you get that at $6 a month.

[05:14] If you stick around for three months, you get a sticker.

[05:19] Ron, big fan of stickers, aren't you?

[05:22] Yeah, I love stickers.

[05:23] Do you have a sticker book?

[05:24] I have like a sticker piece of my wall in my game room where I just put stickers because

[05:32] where else am I going to put them?

[05:33] You don't have any Silver Ball Chronicles stickers, do you?

[05:35] I don't think so.

[05:37] I don't think I gave you any stickers.

[05:38] Oh my God.

[05:39] Yeah, I got a lot of stickers.

[05:41] Hey!

[05:42] I'm thinking of stickers.

[05:44] If you stick around at the next tier for three months, our elitist tier, you get a free

[05:51] Silver Ball Chronicles t-shirt and it's tri blend.

[05:54] All three of the blends.

[05:56] That's better than dual blend.

[05:58] Yes.

[05:59] It is.

[06:00] It's a dual blend.

[06:02] Oh, why did I think that was funny?

[06:05] You know, we're still active at our Facebook page, which you can get to is facebook.com slash

[06:09] Silver Ball Chronicles.

[06:11] Join us over there.

[06:13] Leave us a five star review wherever you found us.

[06:15] If that's Apple Podcast, Google Podcast, your favorite podcast, or if it's on the internet,

[06:18] if it's on the IP DB database, if it's over on this week in Pitball's database, always

[06:24] leave us a five star review.

[06:25] Anything less than five stars and you're dead to run.

[06:27] What is it?

[06:28] Four stars is the max.

[06:29] They allow.

[06:30] Four stars the max.

[06:31] Don't leave us.

[06:32] Don't leave us a review.

[06:33] Oh, okay.

[06:34] Only five.

[06:36] If it's 10, 10 is okay.

[06:40] Anything less than five is not appropriate.

[06:42] But if it's a 10 star rating and you give us a five, you're also dead to run.

[06:46] There's also T-shirts.

[06:48] Hmm.

[06:49] We sold a T-shirt last month.

[06:51] Oh, we did.

[06:52] A T-shirt.

[06:53] Ah, cool.

[06:55] I think it went to like Virginia or something.

[06:57] Thank you, Virginia.

[06:59] Thank Virginia is for Chronicles Lovers.

[07:02] Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.

[07:05] This and corrections from the previous episode, speaking of Virginia, Virginia emailed us

[07:13] to Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[07:17] And they said that Bill Paxton and Bill Pullman look nothing alike.

[07:23] And then they also sent us a photo.

[07:24] But in this photo, this photo is skewed because Bill Pullman is much younger than Bill Paxton

[07:31] in this photo.

[07:33] Or is that Bill Paxton?

[07:34] No, no, no.

[07:35] See, you don't even know of, no, but it's Bill.

[07:37] Paxton's on the left and he doesn't look anything like Pullman.

[07:40] I agree.

[07:41] Yeah, because Pullman is older in this picture.

[07:43] His nose is completely different.

[07:46] Look at those eyes.

[07:47] Those endearing eyes, the hairline.

[07:49] The hairline's completely different.

[07:50] Yeah, you're right.

[07:52] No, it's exactly the same.

[07:53] No.

[07:54] No.

[07:55] Virginia, you are correct.

[07:56] This is...

[07:57] David is wrong.

[07:58] The entire state of Virginia is wrong.

[08:00] Hmm.

[08:01] Other than that, no corrections, which I think is pretty good.

[08:06] At most of the time, I think it's because anytime there's a correction, it's generally

[08:11] something kind of minor.

[08:13] But we do get lots of folk that will send us little links here and there of information

[08:17] that's like, hey, you should add this or you forgot to talk about that or whatever.

[08:21] We love those.

[08:23] Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[08:24] We love to take a look at those and do some reviews.

[08:28] I think we'll probably get a lot of emails about this month.

[08:31] It's a topic.

[08:32] What do you think?

[08:33] Yeah, like you missed this.

[08:34] You missed this because a lot of people were here for this one.

[08:37] Yeah.

[08:38] I was here for this one.

[08:39] At least the last part of it.

[08:41] This is a topic that I'm not particularly well versed in.

[08:47] This is something that I had to do a little more extra research and listening in.

[08:50] And when that happens, I always end up uncovering things that I'm like, how do I talk about this

[08:55] or do I not talk about this?

[08:57] And then the worst part is in like three months, I'll listen to something and they'll bring

[09:01] up.

[09:02] Oh, here's this fact about Capcom and I'll be like, frig, that was a good point.

[09:07] I can't go back and change that.

[09:10] I mean, I could, but I choose not to.

[09:13] You could just use AI and replicate us and add it.

[09:17] Yeah.

[09:18] So I did use AI a couple of episodes ago to help me write out the episode.

[09:23] I put a disclaimer in, everybody knows the disclaimer was at two or three episodes

[09:27] back.

[09:28] I have to say I'm not using it anymore because it kind of sucks.

[09:30] It's very wrong.

[09:31] And then it made my introductions to games away too long and I tried to cut it and mix

[09:36] it or it just, it was just, it just didn't work.

[09:39] So this is all on run this month, guys.

[09:43] Shall we begin?

[09:44] Sure.

[09:46] Capcom was a game company who wanted to get into the hustle and bustle of the pinball

[09:52] industry.

[09:53] They wanted to ride that wave of popularity.

[09:58] They wanted to jump on that rocket ship that was pinball in 1995.

[10:04] But sadly, they were the victim of wrong place, wrong time.

[10:09] Add to that a bunch of mismanagement, timelines that were too short and Python, Angelo.

[10:16] And you've got yourself a recipe for a big steam and pile.

[10:21] This month we stumble through the start up of a company, the failure of that company.

[10:28] We trip over a crazy collector or a dreamer, whatever the heck you want to call them.

[10:33] And then the sad demise of everything that we thought could have been this month, the

[10:41] Capcom debacle.

[10:43] Ron, what do you remember about Capcom?

[10:46] When I say Capcom, what do you think of?

[10:49] Oh, other than that Oscar worthy intro you just gave.

[10:52] Wow.

[10:53] Thank you.

[10:55] But Oscar, where they think you were going for an Oscar, I don't know if you're winning

[10:59] one.

[11:00] Capcom, when I think of Capcom, I think of mostly ex-Williams employees, they probably got paid

[11:06] more.

[11:07] Go to Capcom.

[11:08] I think of the mechs in the Capcom games are just awesome.

[11:13] They are so loud and just heavy duty.

[11:17] I think of the strongest flippers ever on a pinball machine.

[11:20] Wow.

[11:21] Okay.

[11:22] So when I think Capcom, I think of like Street Fighter and Resident Evil, those kind of

[11:32] things.

[11:33] And I also think about a terrible website.

[11:34] Do you see this website, this capcom.com website?

[11:39] It's terrible.

[11:40] And then you go to Capcom USA and it's very nice and pretty.

[11:43] But it's just, it's what a weird landing page.

[11:45] This is very 1999 or 2003 back there.

[11:49] That's very weird.

[11:51] But that's what I think.

[11:52] I think of something totally different when I think Capcom.

[11:55] Do you remember Mega Man?

[11:57] Mega Man was a Capcom property.

[12:00] Is that like an Nintendo?

[12:03] Yeah.

[12:04] What are you talking about?

[12:05] How do you not know these?

[12:06] You were a friggin karate champ champion.

[12:07] Yeah, in the 80s.

[12:09] Huh.

[12:10] All right.

[12:11] I was getting past my prime in the beginning of the NES era.

[12:16] Oh, I see.

[12:17] That was by peak.

[12:18] Although I do have a ton of NES games.

[12:20] Who does it?

[12:22] It was probably the last console I actually had a bunch of games for.

[12:26] Capcom, this company that's known mostly for Street Fighter, the absolute number one

[12:32] fighter of the 19 early 90s, right?

[12:35] Well, Street Fighter 2, right?

[12:38] OK, yeah.

[12:39] Street Fighter 2, the Street Fighter series.

[12:41] But there was also Mortal Kombat was in there.

[12:43] But I would say what?

[12:44] Street Fighter was really the tournament game of choice.

[12:49] It was probably amongst the biggest earners of all time in Koynop.

[12:55] Do you remember the craze around the fighting game?

[12:59] Not really.

[13:00] No need to do I.

[13:01] But if you do know about that, I have seen it in various documentaries, which could be

[13:06] propaganda.

[13:07] Anyway, it was a big time.

[13:09] They wanted to get deeper into Koynop and the way that you got more coins was you got

[13:15] into Pinball.

[13:16] And that's what a company called Data East did.

[13:18] Well, Gary Stern, Stern Pinball and Data East Pinball and Sega Pinball said, Capcom had

[13:26] decided in Japan to do this, probably looking at Data East success in Pinball.

[13:30] That was like that was it.

[13:32] Somebody in Japan in a boardroom was basically saying, well, Data East is building Pinball

[13:37] machines.

[13:37] Look at all the Pinball machines are selling.

[13:39] We could be doing the same thing.

[13:41] George Gomez also has a pretty smart insight into this as well.

[13:46] Now, George says the guy who convinced Capcom to get into the Pinball business didn't

[13:50] really know what they didn't know.

[13:51] They didn't understand the business.

[13:53] Oh, so there's a little bit of, let's say, politicking salesmanship perhaps on breaking

[14:03] in to that business.

[14:07] Who is that guy that George Gomez is talking about?

[14:11] Have we Python Angelo?

[14:13] We know him from what was that episode three, probably.

[14:17] That shit crazy.

[14:18] The Python Angelo story.

[14:20] This is like, you'll have to bleep out now.

[14:22] Oh, yeah.

[14:23] Well, that's how it goes.

[14:24] Well, how about a Jeff Powell?

[14:27] People know Jeff Powell.

[14:29] Jeff Powell worked for Capcom at the time, but what did he think about Python Angelo?

[14:34] He says, Python's got his detractors out there.

[14:37] People love him or hate him.

[14:39] I have to love him because he was one of the people responsible for hiring me a Capcom.

[14:43] Well, nobody's ever told me exactly you made the final decisions there.

[14:47] Yeah, I mean, I have to like Python Angelo because he hired me.

[14:52] You don't have to like somebody because they hired you, but I get what he means.

[14:57] Python was a charming guy.

[14:58] You can go back and listen to that episode, right?

[15:00] He was a salesman.

[15:01] He was a relationship person.

[15:03] He was pretty nutty and fun, but you can see that he is a very polarizing figure.

[15:10] Another person, Ward Pemberton, you may remember him as the designer of Bally's BMX Dungeons

[15:18] and Dragons.

[15:19] Fathom.

[15:20] And the only one that matters, Fathom.

[15:22] Oh, mouse in a round.

[15:24] And don't forget Golden Eye.

[15:25] Oh, yeah.

[15:26] That's a good one.

[15:27] The good bod game.

[15:28] The good bod.

[15:29] You b****.

[15:31] So what did Ward have to say about Python?

[15:35] He said he had some good stuff, but he was a little eccentric.

[15:38] Yeah, it's a good way to put it, a little eccentric.

[15:41] Yeah.

[15:42] All right.

[15:43] So, so let's draw back here.

[15:47] Okay.

[15:48] Python Angelo is having some trouble at Williams in the early 90s, right?

[15:52] He's doing Popeye.

[15:53] Well, he wanted to do Popeye.

[15:56] So that was his idea.

[15:59] He's coming off that smash hit a few years earlier of Bugs Bunny's birthday bash.

[16:06] It's been, I think it's Bugs Bunny's birthday ball.

[16:09] Whatever.

[16:10] It's a game anyway.

[16:12] No, no, you're getting the facts straight on our history podcast.

[16:15] Send your corrections to Silver Ball Chronicles.

[16:17] Okay.

[16:18] Okay.

[16:19] And I might read those corrections.

[16:22] Bill Paxton.

[16:23] Bill Pullman.

[16:24] He's having some trouble over there, right?

[16:26] You know, it's been a lot of years of crazy.

[16:29] Williams is getting a lot more corporate, but Daddy East has broken out to be a pretty

[16:35] substantial force.

[16:37] Now with the death of Valley, you know, Valley Midway, got leave is very diminished now that

[16:45] their premier technologies.

[16:47] There's a big change in that industry.

[16:49] Capcom looks back and says, well, we could get into coin up deeper with pinball, get

[16:54] more coins.

[16:56] And then they bump into somebody of a Python, Angela, who's like, oh, of course, it's super

[17:00] easy to build pinball.

[17:01] Here's what you need to do.

[17:03] And of course, it's a lot harder to build a pinball machine than it is to build a video

[17:07] capt it.

[17:08] Well, according to Python, he's actually, you should probably do this because you do a

[17:13] really good Python voice.

[17:14] All right.

[17:15] For the one and only time in the podcast, I'll do the money.

[17:17] Yeah.

[17:18] I'll do the Python voice.

[17:19] Okay.

[17:20] Here we go.

[17:21] Yes.

[17:22] When I left Williams, I knew they wouldn't do a pinball circus.

[17:24] That's why I left.

[17:25] Wait, are you sitting down?

[17:27] I took a 190 grand pay cut.

[17:29] Oh, okay.

[17:30] So what's pinball circus?

[17:33] That is the, it's in like a big arcade cabinet, upright cabinet, but it's got buttons

[17:41] on the side.

[17:43] And you basically, it's vertical pinball.

[17:46] You're trying to get the ball up to the top.

[17:49] It's a pinball with levels, Jerry.

[17:51] Levels.

[17:52] Pretty neat, but I mean, it wasn't, there was no way that thing was going to sell.

[17:57] It's a novelty again.

[17:58] And it cost a ton to make.

[17:59] There's no way Williams was going to make that.

[18:02] Yeah.

[18:03] So he had some big fight and pinball circus was probably one of those things.

[18:08] It probably wasn't the only thing and probably, but there was a lot of other things.

[18:12] And you know what?

[18:13] He left Williams.

[18:14] Now, I don't know if he left Williams or if he was asked to leave Williams either way

[18:22] apparently he made $190,000 pay cut, which I think is probably exaggerated.

[18:30] Oh, that's definitely exaggerated.

[18:32] He exaggerated a lot of things.

[18:34] Like $150,000 in 1995.

[18:39] That's like epic money.

[18:41] Yeah.

[18:42] Yeah, I, I, I, I thought I would have stories like how he was a spy for the government

[18:46] and all kinds of, he had a lot of crazy like Steve Richie talks about how he got pulled

[18:51] over in his Porsche, right?

[18:53] And Steve Richie is like the guy who sells everything.

[18:56] He gets royalties on all of his games, but he wasn't driving like a 9-11 Porsche.

[19:02] He was driving like a like the, the, the little one.

[19:07] The little one?

[19:08] Okay.

[19:09] Yeah, the 9-4-4 or 9-2-4.

[19:10] I mean, it was cool car nonetheless, but you know, people say Porsche and they immediately

[19:13] think like $300,000 a car.

[19:16] And that's the guy who sell them a hell of a lot more than Python, Angela, right?

[19:21] And that calm, getting a little bit deeper into the idea of really going forward into this

[19:27] pinball industry began shopping around because quite frankly, you can't just start up a pinball

[19:34] manufacturing company.

[19:35] We've seen a lot of that recently, but it was always best at the time to go and buy

[19:40] something.

[19:41] So they began looking for various manufacturers of pinball.

[19:46] The company that they bumped into in 1994 was a company called Game Star.

[19:51] What did Game Star do, Ron?

[19:53] Well, some of these names, Game Star, Pin Star, Game Star may ticket redemption games for

[19:59] places like Chucky Cheese.

[20:01] Remember them?

[20:02] No?

[20:03] No, we didn't have that.

[20:04] Oh, in Canada.

[20:05] And working there at the time was Ward, Pemberton.

[20:07] Good old Ward.

[20:08] Yeah, Chucky Cheese is, yeah, they had a one right by me.

[20:13] Used to go there all the time.

[20:14] What was it like?

[20:16] So we would always see Chucky Cheese and commercials here because in my part of the country, we get

[20:20] like the Boston PBS.

[20:22] As a kid, it was cool as hell.

[20:24] I'm sure it was a maze.

[20:26] The big animatronic Elvis they had there.

[20:29] And then didn't they have the heads would sing and they would be all like Elvis was a complete

[20:33] animatronic, like the entire body moved.

[20:37] Like Disney style?

[20:38] Like, like those movies where the animatronics come to life and kill people, that's, that

[20:43] was this thing.

[20:44] Cool.

[20:45] He was a lion because he was the king, get it?

[20:47] Elvis the king.

[20:49] And he sang actual Elvis songs, you know, and he had Elvis impersonator who was actually

[20:54] good, do the intros.

[20:55] Like when he would talk.

[20:57] Yeah, so cool.

[20:59] Well, Ward, Pemberton, when he had left Williams just after Gilligan's Island, he went

[21:07] back to being a firefighter, but he also sort of part time-ish would do these designs

[21:13] for Game Star.

[21:15] By the summer of 1995, Capcom took over the operation of Game Star and established Capcom

[21:24] Koynop, which was based in Chicago.

[21:29] So we're off to the races.

[21:32] But then they got a staff up.

[21:34] So if you got a bunch of guys that have done sort of redemption games, you know, you

[21:39] got Ward, Pemberton, who's made some okay designs.

[21:42] You still need to staff up.

[21:43] You need coders.

[21:45] You need mechanical guys and gals.

[21:48] You need some real designers.

[21:51] You need some pizzazz, some excitement.

[21:55] So what do you do?

[21:56] How do you get those people?

[21:57] Well, Gary Stern says they hired a lot of Williams people, whether they were unsuccessful

[22:02] because of their own practices or because the market had blipped and they missed the high

[22:05] point, I don't know.

[22:06] So Gary knows that they went after the Williams people.

[22:10] They all know Capcom is not around and it didn't go very well.

[22:13] And by the title of this episode called the Capcom debacle, we know that something's

[22:16] going on here, but they were unsuccessful.

[22:20] So they cobbled together some of these poached people and we'll get into some of the names

[22:24] in a moment.

[22:25] But the design teams, they got to work with what they did is they pulled in all these people,

[22:31] sit them together in teams, but then they pulled them in all different directions as

[22:34] to what they wanted to do, right?

[22:36] Like here's this theme and here's that theme.

[22:39] You know, here's this type of production and build this Mac and then choose that Mac.

[22:43] But they had to start all over again.

[22:44] They had to create a board set.

[22:46] They had to create controllers.

[22:48] They had to find parts and sourcing and all that stuff.

[22:53] They were really all over the place and it was incredibly confusing to begin with because

[22:57] they were in such a scramble to get started.

[23:01] Part of the problem is said that Python Angelo, who had a bit of a rough leadership style

[23:06] was really undisciplined and not much of a leader, which is why there was so much confusion

[23:12] and so many teams being pulled in so many different directions.

[23:15] Does that sound like something that, you know, would happen under Python's leadership?

[23:19] I could see that.

[23:20] Well, Jeff Powell says, whenever I worked with Python, I kind of have to pull the reins

[23:26] in and say, Python, here, sit down, tell me how you want this.

[23:30] And then it's up and Adam somewhere else.

[23:32] He's one of those types that's always bouncing off the walls.

[23:35] It's hard to nail him down on stuff, but certainly has a lot of great ideas.

[23:39] What can I say?

[23:40] Python is Python.

[23:41] A lot of guys have heard a lot of stories and they're always fun to hear his antics and

[23:45] misadventures and whatnot.

[23:47] Yeah.

[23:48] So, I mean, this is, this is top down, right?

[23:50] So by contrast, when we hear all these stories about Dad at East and when it was starting

[23:56] up, right, it was like Joe Cam and Cow and Gary Stern and their pinch in every penny,

[24:03] everything is calculated.

[24:05] That doesn't seem like Python's leadership style.

[24:08] It seems like he is flat out in a thousand different directions.

[24:12] You got to start somewhere and the first person to start on a machine was Ward Pemberton

[24:17] and he was working on a pinball machine which allegedly was mission impossible themed.

[24:23] And this isn't like the cool current day mission impossible.

[24:28] This was the old TV series style, mission impossible, which was also cool.

[24:32] Come on.

[24:33] It was cool, but it was different.

[24:35] Was it Tom Cruise?

[24:36] No, that Peter Graves.

[24:37] I'm Peter Graves.

[24:38] I remember Peter Graves from Airplane.

[24:41] Everyone does.

[24:42] So Ward Pemberton says, there was a lot of tension between Capcom and Williams.

[24:47] Capcom was all of a sudden afraid to do things because Mark Richie had a clause in his

[24:50] contract and he couldn't do any pinball for a certain amount of time once he left Williams.

[24:54] It was just a little hectic over there when it came to getting some of the Williams

[24:57] guys over to us.

[24:58] Got a little nerve wracking.

[25:00] Yeah, Mark Richie, Capcom got sued.

[25:03] Williams sued and made sure Mark couldn't do anything for a while over there.

[25:07] Oh, big time.

[25:08] That was actually part of I watched some, I can't remember what it was, the documentary

[25:12] about the video game department, but they had Neil Nakastro on there.

[25:16] He president of Williams and he mentioned that.

[25:19] Like we had an employee that tried to work for another company.

[25:21] We couldn't let that happen so we sued.

[25:24] And that's what he was referring to.

[25:26] Mark Richie.

[25:27] Joey, if you've ever been in a Turkish prison because Mark Richie left right as Indiana Jones

[25:35] came out.

[25:36] He might actually left before it was even released.

[25:38] Things were getting a bit messy.

[25:40] So words working on a machine, they're trying to staff up a little bit.

[25:43] They bring in this Mark Richie thing and the **** is going to hit the fan.

[25:48] And George Gomez says Williams retaliated.

[25:50] They sued everybody.

[25:51] That slowed the development process at Capcom and made the cost go through the roof.

[25:55] They had to turn on the money faucet.

[25:57] They were spending a lot of money before they were going to get anything back.

[26:00] See George Gomez, I think, is the kind of guy that respects loyalty.

[26:05] Williams is given Python and all those guys a lot of things.

[26:09] And you know what?

[26:10] That deserves a level of loyalty.

[26:12] Even though sure at this time they were hacking in slashing or beginning to hack in slasher

[26:17] Williams and lay it off people who'd been there forever.

[26:19] But yeah, yeah, screw that.

[26:21] It's a loyalty.

[26:24] Loyalty usually means a lot to a lot of people.

[26:27] And George Gomez is probably one of those individuals.

[26:31] So what do you do?

[26:32] You just sue everybody, right?

[26:33] You get a bunch of lawyers.

[26:35] And even though you may not have a case or maybe you do have a case, that, you know,

[26:38] you got to hire lawyers and you got to respond and you're freaking out.

[26:41] Now you're paying Mark Richie to sit on the sidelines.

[26:43] You can't do anything.

[26:45] That's not going to be something that Capcom wants.

[26:49] And that essentially meant that Capcom had to reinvent everything because they were so scared

[26:56] of taking any intellectual property from Williams and bumping into their patents.

[27:01] Everything from flipper mechs to bumper mechs.

[27:04] Everything had to be redesigned and totally different to avoid patent infringement.

[27:09] Unlike that, Ace, which just ripped off William system 11.

[27:13] Right.

[27:14] But I think, so what do you think the big difference was between Capcom and data east

[27:19] between between the two?

[27:21] Why are they getting treated differently?

[27:22] That's a good question.

[27:25] I'm sure Williams was very aware.

[27:26] I mean, data east did use different mechs and they did kind of slowly change their system.

[27:33] So it wasn't just a carbon copy of Williams system 11.

[27:38] But I always wondered why they, because there were instances where they either sued or

[27:43] were going to sue or they had, when Jurassic Park was on test locations, they had a Williams

[27:49] employee film it to see if they were ripping off their fun house, follow the ball technology.

[27:56] So they had to change that because they were kind of ripping it off.

[27:59] They had a patent on it.

[28:01] So they, so the dinosaur couldn't follow the ball anymore.

[28:05] So if I were a betten man, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to totally speculate

[28:09] here, which is the favorite part of everybody's bit when it comes to silver ball of chronicles.

[28:13] I'm going to say a couple of the things were one, Gary Stern and Joe Kamenkau may have

[28:18] ripped off some of the technology from Williams, but they probably remained calm.

[28:23] You know, they probably had relationships with the Williams people and they probably went

[28:27] back and forth and then they probably made various deals.

[28:31] And then as you said, they came off of that sort of theft of the system 11 system in their

[28:37] next few games.

[28:40] I would also say that maybe, you know, the commitment of a dad at East over a Capcom was

[28:46] probably another piece was that, I mean, Dad at East was a fairly large company and

[28:51] you can allow a few stumbles.

[28:54] I would say maybe the next thing is that Williams learned from maybe the mistakes that they

[28:58] did with Dad at East and they made sure that they went flat out with Capcom.

[29:04] So they weren't going to give them an inch where maybe they did with Dad at East.

[29:07] And the last thing would be that maybe Williams knew that the industry was on a downturn by

[29:13] now or going to start a downturn.

[29:15] They were very much defending their territory.

[29:18] Does any of those make sense?

[29:21] I'd go with that.

[29:23] Well, you know what, when things start to get crazy and frothy and cost go up, what do

[29:29] you got to do?

[29:30] You got to trim the fat.

[29:32] And the first thing they did was fire Ward Pemberton.

[29:36] Ward says, I had to run him with Python, Angela.

[29:40] Parker and Python were like a team.

[29:42] So I got let go.

[29:43] Python was one of these guys that always wanted to take credit for everything, even though

[29:47] credit wasn't do him.

[29:49] We just banged heads.

[29:50] One of those things.

[29:52] I wanted to really do another pinball machine there.

[29:55] Just it was one of those things where we had high hopes and I see nothing but dollar signs

[29:58] of potential.

[30:00] I was very sad to be let go over there.

[30:02] Ah, okay.

[30:04] So we're seeing some warring factions now, right?

[30:07] So when you're trying to upstart a little company here and you're trying to manufacture

[30:11] things, you don't want to have the old guard fighting the new guard, especially when the

[30:16] new guard, Mike Richie, has to sit on the sideline and can't do anything.

[30:19] You know what I mean?

[30:20] Or whoever.

[30:21] Like, Mark Richie and Python were a team in games like Taxi and Diner.

[30:26] Ooh, Diner.

[30:28] My favorite food-based pin.

[30:29] So I'm going to order up.

[30:30] We're going to need a sound guy.

[30:33] That's where they brought in Jeff Powell, who was currently struggling in radio.

[30:39] Jeff says, it's fiercely competitive everywhere in radio.

[30:42] I decided to make this decision as the which way do I go.

[30:45] I sent out this VHS tape to this blind ad and thought nothing of it.

[30:50] Two weeks later, I got a letterback saying, we'd like to interview you.

[30:53] I called up and walked in and interviewed with people like Python, Angelo, Mark Richie.

[30:57] Ultimately, I ended up interviewing at length with Mark Richie and he offered me the job.

[31:01] Yeah, so there you go.

[31:03] So now the new guard, they're starting to bring in their team members, guys like Jeff Powell,

[31:07] who's on the audio side.

[31:09] I think does a pretty stand-up job.

[31:12] But they're finally getting around to it and you know what?

[31:16] They're getting ready for that first pin, which is October of 1995.

[31:21] So Capcom started looking for somebody around mid-94.

[31:25] They found somebody at the beginning of 95.

[31:27] They cobbled together a team and they launched something at the end of the year.

[31:32] So we're getting some pretty good timelines here.

[31:36] That pin was called pinball magic.

[31:40] Magic.

[31:42] It sold 1,200 units.

[31:46] It was designed by Brian Hansen and Rob Hurtito.

[31:50] Hurtado.

[31:52] Mechanics by Michael Zhang and Rick Morgan.

[31:56] Dots by Scott Pilcusky.

[32:00] Pilcusky.

[32:02] Pil...what do you say? How do you say that?

[32:03] Wow. You're going to have the most butchered names ever in this episode.

[32:06] This is a bad one.

[32:07] But cool ski, I don't know.

[32:09] P-I-K-U-L-S-K-I.

[32:13] This one I got.

[32:14] Hugh Van Zanton and Jeff Bush.

[32:18] We know that name.

[32:19] Music and sound by Chris Granner and Jeff Powell.

[32:23] Chris Granner, another one of those poached names from Williams.

[32:27] These are a lot of names in here we don't know.

[32:31] Lot of names we don't know.

[32:32] We know Jeff Bush because he did a little bit of art for a couple of the other companies.

[32:37] And we know Chris Granner but we don't see any other names here, right?

[32:40] Mark Richie's not involved with this because he's tied up in sort of his legal thing with

[32:45] Williams.

[32:47] We got the new guy Jeff Powell.

[32:49] Well, don't forget the software you skipped his name.

[32:52] Oh, Sammy's there.

[32:53] Sammy's there.

[32:55] See that name I got?

[32:56] That's a hard one.

[32:57] Uh, he's missing a vowel.

[32:59] I got that one.

[33:01] But this is an original theme, magic theme.

[33:04] Yep, people love magic in pinball.

[33:07] It's nothing more magic than pinball itself.

[33:10] First thing we need to do is promote this pin, right?

[33:13] And people love the flyers.

[33:16] You got to sell it.

[33:17] Got to sell it.

[33:18] How do you sell it?

[33:19] Can you read that?

[33:20] It's pretty light.

[33:21] Nope, I can't read that.

[33:23] All the dazzling sights, sounds and sensational shots are choreographed to high-tech

[33:29] perfection to guarantee game quality and reliability.

[33:34] Mm-hmm.

[33:35] So they're talking about short circuit protection, line voltage, one coil type, adjustable

[33:43] flipper power, burned out lamp and solenoid detection, lamp warming, industry, most user-friendly

[33:51] diagnostic system.

[33:52] We're selling the platform and they're not kidding.

[33:56] I would make your recommendation.

[33:59] Go to YouTube.

[34:00] I got this video right now.

[34:02] Go to YouTube and look up Arcade, UK, one word, Capcom pinball.

[34:08] And there is a video that shows all the Capcom pinball features.

[34:12] And he's showing it on a pinball magic.

[34:14] So it ties into what we're, the game we're talking about.

[34:18] Their platform was very impressed.

[34:21] They have a driver board that is literally the size of the back box.

[34:24] It's huge.

[34:27] Because they had to redesign everything, they said, you know what, we're going to make

[34:30] this a Cadillac.

[34:31] A Cadillac.

[34:32] But it detects when things are broken and the things like one coil type for the entire

[34:38] game.

[34:39] You only need to have one coil.

[34:40] You don't need all kinds of different coils.

[34:42] It just takes one coil.

[34:44] And it adjusts the power up and down depending on what you need to be done.

[34:47] Yeah, speakers are like actually in enclosures.

[34:51] Try to get a little better sound.

[34:53] The play field mounting.

[34:54] When you pull the play field out, the way it comes up, high quality, like really heavy

[35:00] duty max.

[35:01] Listen to the drop targets on Capcom, on any Capcom game, but like pinball magic, they're

[35:06] so loud when they reset.

[35:09] So they're doing well here.

[35:10] They got the blippers in the industry.

[35:13] The art is great on pinball magic.

[35:18] It kind of looks a little bit like theater of magic.

[35:24] That's weird.

[35:25] We'll get into that in a second.

[35:29] Python demands you get into it now.

[35:31] No, we're going to go into design first.

[35:33] We're going to go into design first.

[35:35] So the design, we don't know who Brian Hansen is, right?

[35:40] Well, you know, I mean, you might remember him.

[35:42] He's done some of the designs over at Premiere, which was originally God-leab.

[35:52] OK.

[35:53] Brian Hansen, you might remember from Rescue 911.

[35:57] But where did pinball magic come from?

[35:59] Well, Python says pinball magic was not done in Capcom.

[36:02] That was done by Brian Hansen and me and Brian Hansen's garage.

[36:06] At the time, I didn't know Brian was hurting for money.

[36:08] He only did it because you want to get the F out of your uncle's servicing or repairing

[36:12] games.

[36:13] Brian Hansen's building the game in his garage.

[36:15] Python and Angelo knows Brian Hansen.

[36:18] They needed a game really quickly because they just fired word Pemberton and he was making

[36:22] a game.

[36:23] So they need to get something and slap it together.

[36:26] This was the game that they got.

[36:28] They designed, as you mentioned, a whole new board set.

[36:30] Well, they needed to do a whole new sound system.

[36:32] And they also had to do all of this while dealing with Python and Angelo.

[36:36] What does Jeff Powell say?

[36:38] He says, early in the pinball magic game, Python comes by my office door.

[36:42] People who know Python know he's a very animated person.

[36:45] He kind of flails his arms.

[36:46] He talked with his hands a lot.

[36:48] Just very flamboyant.

[36:50] His eyes are very big like horses eyes and he's dancing outside of my office going, Jeff,

[36:55] you have to vibrate the cabinet like this.

[36:58] Uh, okay.

[36:59] I guess that means we've got to stick more rumbling thunder into the game.

[37:03] Wow.

[37:04] Okay.

[37:05] So he's better base.

[37:06] Yeah.

[37:07] I mean, now they got to put these enclosures who we're talking about.

[37:10] You got to, you know, you got to kick more.

[37:12] But he's just like, how do you decode that craziness?

[37:15] Well, I mean, Jeff Powell figured it out.

[37:17] So good for him.

[37:19] Mark Richie is also one of those guys that was able to work with Python on a regular basis

[37:23] and pull things out of the fire and understand what the heck he was talking about.

[37:27] It was some pretty cool stuff.

[37:29] And Mark Richie's wife is the voice.

[37:31] Oh, yeah.

[37:32] That's right.

[37:33] Mark Richie's wife is the voice of the magic lady.

[37:36] So what about all these unknown names?

[37:39] So let's go, let's wind it back and talk about some of these unknown names.

[37:43] Well, Python says, when I joined Capcom, I said to them, I'm coming, but I have to bring

[37:47] this young new talent guys that live and breathe pinball.

[37:51] So basically what he means by the young talent is people not hired by Williams because quite

[37:56] frankly, the people working at Williams are probably pretty happy there.

[38:00] And they've got a long and extensive track record of hit games.

[38:04] So what was the team he brought in?

[38:07] Well, we talked about Brian Hanson, right?

[38:08] He actually worked with Rescue 911, but he also worked at J.J.P. years later on Wizard

[38:13] of Oz.

[38:14] We got this Rob Hurtado.

[38:16] Hurtado.

[38:17] I'm guessing Hurtado.

[38:18] Hurtado.

[38:19] Hurtado.

[38:20] Right.

[38:21] We've got Rob Hurtado.

[38:22] He was at Sega.

[38:23] Yeah.

[38:24] But he was really only there for a cup of coffee.

[38:27] He got Hugh Van Santon.

[38:29] He did three games at Capcom and that was it.

[38:32] So there you go.

[38:34] He got Jeff Bush.

[38:35] He did a lot of the art at Sega.

[38:38] He's actually done American pinball.

[38:40] He worked a lot with them and he's got like 10 games under his belt.

[38:44] So he did stick around.

[38:45] Okay.

[38:46] So he's a decent name.

[38:48] Michael Zhang.

[38:49] He only did pinball magic.

[38:51] That was his only game.

[38:54] Jeff Powell.

[38:55] He did all the Capcom games or most of them or worked on most of them.

[38:58] And he also did some work on Shrek from Stern.

[39:00] Remember that?

[39:01] Is he an all-star?

[39:04] Is he getting his game on?

[39:05] Oh, God.

[39:07] Rick Morgan.

[39:08] Okay.

[39:09] Big name and pinball.

[39:10] And by big name, I mean, he worked on pinball magic and that was his only game.

[39:14] Chris Granner.

[39:15] Huh?

[39:17] The legend.

[39:18] Yeah.

[39:19] Let it go on with Stern, Andrew Z.

[39:20] This Scott guy with the ski last name?

[39:24] Scott Pukolsky.

[39:26] Yes.

[39:27] And Sammy Zier.

[39:29] He was there.

[39:30] Yeah.

[39:31] So they only worked on pinball magic.

[39:32] So we can see here that these young, new talent that live and breathe pinball all basically

[39:40] came in just for this one thing.

[39:42] Except for all the other ones that didn't that you just mentioned.

[39:44] Well, it's either they were there forever, like three of them or like five of them just

[39:51] were there for a cup of coffee.

[39:54] And funny enough, the names that did stay forever were names that had already been there

[39:59] forever.

[40:00] You know what I mean?

[40:01] That's true.

[40:02] So what about the game itself?

[40:05] I like it.

[40:07] I've never seen what you've never played a pinball magic.

[40:11] No, no, I'm very well aware of pinball magic.

[40:14] Okay.

[40:15] So we're looking at the play field right now.

[40:18] It's got several really cool features.

[40:20] You got the wand where there's a magnet on the wand.

[40:23] So the ball will roll along the wand, like but underneath it.

[40:28] So it'll stick to a wand and it'll roll down.

[40:32] That hand moves.

[40:34] It diverts it.

[40:35] And then the stage, the stage will open up and there's a ball in there and it will levitate,

[40:41] like actually levitate.

[40:43] Like you'll see the ball go up.

[40:45] Wow.

[40:46] Yes.

[40:47] How does that work?

[40:48] Either it actually levitate.

[40:49] If you say magic, I'm going to or it either actually levitate sit with the magnet or

[40:55] it might have been like a, it might use a mirror and like rotate the mirror or something.

[40:59] So it looks like the balls levitate when it really isn't.

[41:01] I'm trying to remember how it works.

[41:04] Didn't John Papaduke try to make a levitating ball for magic girl?

[41:08] I played that at Expo.

[41:10] It didn't work.

[41:11] I don't even want to talk about that game.

[41:14] So yeah, this game worked.

[41:16] You see pinball magic.

[41:17] So it's already superior.

[41:20] Super cool skill shot that goes right into the hat, you know, the magic hat.

[41:26] Playfields kind of ugly.

[41:28] It's got that weird yellow that just doesn't seem to work on pinball.

[41:33] But it's cool, right?

[41:34] It's got the mechs and it works and it's solid.

[41:36] It's solid.

[41:37] And there's plenty of them that still work today.

[41:40] It's, you know, we're pretty happy about this, right?

[41:43] This is a pretty good game.

[41:44] Their dot matrix displays were pretty good.

[41:45] I always liked them.

[41:47] So cool.

[41:49] This is a very good first effort.

[41:51] I mean, it didn't sell a whole lot.

[41:53] It sold 1200 units, but it is the first game for the new company.

[41:55] You know, Williams had another magic theme game that came out the same time.

[42:01] Theater of magic, which everyone loves.

[42:03] So but theater magic came out first.

[42:05] They both came out the same year.

[42:07] Both came out the same time.

[42:09] Amazing how that works.

[42:11] That's so funny.

[42:12] Do you think there was probably some hurt feelings thing?

[42:14] Well, according to Python, he says, Williams had no plans to do a magic game.

[42:20] Right.

[42:21] Who did?

[42:22] Who did theater of magic?

[42:23] Papaduke.

[42:24] The guy doesn't even feel pinball.

[42:25] People do anything.

[42:27] He's a chameleon.

[42:28] Python is the king of snakes and I eat Papaduke for breakfast.

[42:31] I found out later from inside guys that love me for a long time.

[42:35] Someone said that Capcom are doing this.

[42:37] He said, OK, I'm doing a game with this theme.

[42:40] If someone told me, listen, our competition is doing a theme.

[42:43] Do it.

[42:44] You know what I do?

[42:45] I turn a desk upside down.

[42:47] I'd spit in their faces, turn around, pull my pants down.

[42:50] I don't have to do that.

[42:52] Why would I be a designer?

[42:53] I would say I come up with a better theme, something else.

[42:57] Oh, this is one of my favorite Python.

[43:00] Yeah, I really should have done that in the Python.

[43:04] So if you go back and on the sources at silverbalkronicles.com, you can take a look at this old

[43:11] top-cast interview with Python, which is a legendary interview, because he holds no

[43:17] punch.

[43:18] And that's the censored version.

[43:20] Yeah.

[43:21] So he's saying here, they were doing it.

[43:23] They were doing a magic theme.

[43:25] And then somebody at Williams told Papa Duke decided to make the theme as well.

[43:32] Which one of these games is better?

[43:34] I actually kind of like both of them.

[43:36] I mean, the theater magic is much smoother.

[43:38] Yeah, it's a better shooter.

[43:40] It's a smoother game.

[43:41] But yeah, Python hates Papa Duke.

[43:44] He hated Papa Duke.

[43:45] He's called him, yeah, Camillean.

[43:47] He called him a con man.

[43:49] He's called him many things.

[43:50] Needless to say, there was some hurt feelings there.

[43:53] But this is another way that Williams was willing to sink Capcom.

[43:59] So this is not an uncommon kind of thing.

[44:02] So if you think about Williams and Gottlieb in 1994, Williams had World Cup Soccer done

[44:08] by John Papa Duke his first game.

[44:11] Just before they released that game, Gottlieb released World Challenge Soccer.

[44:17] And they actually said we heard they were doing the theme.

[44:21] We made the theme faster and got some sales before they did.

[44:25] It's not uncommon in the industry, right?

[44:26] So maybe we should have some thick skin.

[44:28] Any other way they made it quickly is it's basically car hop.

[44:31] Yeah, they just took another design and sort of slapped something on it.

[44:34] Well, they got to do their follow up, right?

[44:36] The next big smash.

[44:39] And that's going to be airborne with this basically top gun.

[44:43] The deepest ramps in the history of pinball.

[44:46] Only Capcom flippers can make these ramps.

[44:50] This is a jet fighter theme.

[44:52] It's from March of 1996.

[44:55] So we're looking at, you know, about four months, five months later.

[44:58] It sells 1,350 units.

[45:01] So we're selling more units.

[45:02] This is designed by Claude Fernandez.

[45:05] So there's a name that people should know.

[45:07] The mechs were done by Michael Zhang and Rick Morgan.

[45:12] Dots by Scott What's his name?

[45:14] Dotsky.

[45:15] Art by Hugh Van Zanton.

[45:20] Music and Sound by Chris Granner.

[45:22] Software by Dan Markham and Jeff Marshall.

[45:27] So we see that there's some new names in here and some existing names that we've seen

[45:31] before.

[45:32] This is, this is, this is my kind of theme.

[45:34] This is a fire and fast and speed and wow.

[45:39] There's a lot of ramps in here.

[45:40] Well, Rhett, there's a lot of habitrails.

[45:43] There's a lot.

[45:44] A lot of habitrails in this game.

[45:46] Let's, let's talk about what's going on in this play field before we even get into

[45:49] the other stuff.

[45:50] It's a highway to the danger zone.

[45:53] Holy moly.

[45:54] There's a lot of like ten years after top gun.

[45:56] So yeah, the ramps are insanely, like anything other than full flipper power, even on

[46:03] a capcom and you're not making anything in this game.

[46:06] So in the middle, it's got those weird 360 ramps that are in the middle of the play field

[46:10] that zip up really quickly back to your right and left flipper on a habit trail.

[46:15] So you shoot it.

[46:16] It flips kind of at a 180.

[46:18] Comes right down to the, to the flippers, in lanes.

[46:22] But then you've got another ramp on the right side that sort of feeds like this weird

[46:26] diverter area.

[46:27] I'm not sure those are ramps from my memory.

[46:30] I think, are they?

[46:31] Are they up there?

[46:32] You hit it up there and look at the very top.

[46:34] There's like three lanes that can go in and it'll go in one of them and then it releases

[46:38] it through those habit trails to you.

[46:40] Yeah.

[46:41] I don't think there's 360 ramps.

[46:43] It's been a while since I played it.

[46:46] It's a pretty nuts looking thing here, right?

[46:49] They went to something to really impress everyone I think, right?

[46:52] Like Williams doesn't have this many habit trails.

[46:55] Yep, it's got a lot of habit trails.

[46:57] What's your favorite kind of habit trail?

[46:59] Is it a Ziggy Zaggy one or one that kind of just goes straight back?

[47:04] I like the kind that go in a circle like Lita Weapon 3 or Jurassic Park.

[47:10] Yeah, you like the gimmicks.

[47:12] Yeah, well, yeah.

[47:14] It looks cool.

[47:16] Like it doesn't have to go in a circle, but it does.

[47:18] Okay, well here's the flyer, which is not very big.

[47:21] No, I can't read it.

[47:23] Well, you apologize.

[47:24] We can't read the flyers.

[47:25] It's too small.

[47:27] Pilot, you're cleared for takeoff.

[47:30] Airboard from Capcom.

[47:32] It's got a great backlash though, eh?

[47:35] Taking on the Russians.

[47:37] Upside down in America.

[47:39] Upside down.

[47:40] Why is that to be America?

[47:41] He could be in Toronto for all, you know.

[47:43] That sort of looks like New York.

[47:45] Everything is in New York.

[47:47] Would you buy it?

[47:49] No.

[47:50] Well, you know what Capcom says?

[47:52] Put on your helmet, jump into the cockpit and buckle up.

[47:56] Roar with the blue angels and scream across the sky with airborne.

[48:01] Capcom coinop incorporated its newest pinball machine.

[48:04] Oh, an airborne players compete in a traveling international air show that takes place in

[48:10] America, France, Germany, Italy, England and Spain, but not Canada.

[48:15] And each country's air show announcers prop players to perform stunts and languages native

[48:21] to that country.

[48:22] How's that going to work?

[48:24] If he says something in Spanish, like, what did he say?

[48:26] What's done am I supposed to perform?

[48:28] The players perform realistic stunts such as one half barrel rolls, hammerhead stalls

[48:33] and and corkscrew spins.

[48:37] Okay.

[48:38] Okay.

[48:39] Wait a second.

[48:40] So this isn't like jet fighters shooting down the Russian.

[48:42] No, it's like an air show.

[48:44] Oh, that's a terrible thing.

[48:47] Oh.

[48:48] Nothing says cool like a freaking air show.

[48:50] All right, everybody.

[48:51] This is the part of the air show where you walk around and see the pilots and sit in

[48:55] a gut and sit in the cockpit.

[48:57] The game is very orange.

[48:59] Very orange and red, which means it will probably fade badly in any kind of sunlight.

[49:04] There's a pretty awesome German flyer in here too.

[49:09] What's this?

[49:10] End look.

[49:11] End lick.

[49:12] End lick.

[49:13] I don't know what that means.

[49:14] Let's look that out.

[49:15] Let's not say we did.

[49:17] Means finally.

[49:18] Finally, we have an air show related theme game.

[49:23] Oh, my goodness.

[49:24] Look who's manufacturing that in Germany.

[49:26] It's baly wolf.

[49:28] It says impulse fewer and young creative friends.

[49:33] Yeah, yeah.

[49:34] And you can send in all that angry German emails to silver ball chronicles at cheap.

[49:40] Well, okay, this is the game I have played.

[49:44] The third design by Capcom.

[49:47] Oh, yes.

[49:48] Actually, my favorite game of there.

[49:50] Really?

[49:51] Okay.

[49:52] Break shot.

[49:53] We're already cost savings three games in.

[49:57] That's your first that's your first clue that they wanted to do a throwback cheaper game.

[50:03] By May of 1996, they are, they are what a year and a half in.

[50:09] Uh oh.

[50:10] As Gomez had said, they turned on the money taps and they were bleeding, I think, here.

[50:15] They sold a thousand units.

[50:17] This game is designed by Greg Kameck, who did Zinnon, right?

[50:21] He worked at baly for years and years and he basically retired mechanics by Chuck Biddelcom,

[50:27] dots by Denise Walner, art by Stan Fuku, Fuku, uh, who I think was held in very high regard

[50:36] in the pinball industry.

[50:38] Music and sound by Jeff Powell and software by Tony DeFail.

[50:42] I can say that Italian name.

[50:45] Hey, it's Tony DeFail.

[50:46] Come over here and have a hot Italian sandwich.

[50:50] No comment.

[50:51] Uh, Mark Richie, he was working on another project at this time, uh, which would reign

[50:56] secret.

[50:57] We'll talk about that in just a second.

[50:59] Uh, how about this break shot?

[51:00] So it's a pool theme, Billiards, if you will.

[51:04] Okay.

[51:06] It has amazing art, I think.

[51:09] Uh, it's a little bit, uh, risky.

[51:12] It's totally.

[51:13] And so are the DMD animations.

[51:15] Yeah, it's clearly designed for a bar and to appeal towards kids.

[51:20] This clearly has the, uh, art direction of Python, Angelo.

[51:27] But women in there, you got smoking.

[51:29] There's like smoking.

[52:45] Yeah, smoking was still cool at around now.

[52:47] Really?

[52:47] OK.

[52:48] Yeah.

[52:49] Now it's not cool.

[52:50] Smoke is not cool.

[52:52] Vaping.

[52:53] Smoking not cool.

[52:57] This is a beautiful play field.

[53:00] Like it is really well designed.

[53:03] Like the bottom is is breaking pool balls.

[53:07] It's in this really cool purple.

[53:08] The it's a very comic bookie style.

[53:12] The ladies, although a bit suggestive and not particularly appropriate are actually

[53:18] like well, you know, illustrated, if you will.

[53:23] There's drop targets and then there's this really cool pocket.

[53:28] What's in the middle?

[53:29] What's it called?

[53:29] It has a name.

[53:31] No, come on.

[53:33] It's probably written to super cute.

[53:36] This super cute.

[53:37] For the super cute.

[53:39] Oh, yeah.

[53:40] Oh, how could you forget the super cute?

[53:43] Yes, introducing the Capcom classic pinball line.

[53:48] So it sounds like they were going to be making more of these classic classic style

[53:53] games designed specifically.

[53:56] Wait a minute.

[53:57] Yeah, classic style games specifically designed to appeal to all players.

[54:01] Sensational play field sounds and artwork all fit in an affordable package

[54:06] uncomplicated and fun to play.

[54:09] These games are great for your profits all the way around.

[54:13] Now this is pinball.

[54:16] Yeah, this sentence on the flyer scares the crap out of me.

[54:22] Doesn't it?

[54:22] Doesn't that just sound like, uh oh, this is not going well?

[54:28] Wait a second.

[54:29] Do you see that this?

[54:30] So there's a guy on the back glass.

[54:32] Okay.

[54:33] He's he's hit the pool ball and it is flown into the air and it is bounced off

[54:38] of a few things on the back glass.

[54:40] Okay.

[54:41] The first thing is it's bounced into this lady's hand and knocked her drink at a

[54:46] minute.

[54:46] Then it hit a moose.

[54:48] No, no, no, no.

[54:49] Let's take a look at these ice cubes here.

[54:51] Where?

[54:52] Look, look where these ice cubes are falling.

[54:55] Oh, yeah.

[54:56] This lady has caught the ice cubes, you know, with her chest in the middle of her

[55:03] chest.

[55:04] Like this is ridiculous.

[55:06] This is so so by the game was designed to appeal to all players, except for women.

[55:13] Right?

[55:14] Like, so then it bounces off the moose's nose and then it bounces off another lady's

[55:19] butt who's sitting on the pool table, which is not a very good place to sit.

[55:23] Because how is your ball supposed to bounce off the side if she's sitting on it?

[55:26] This is ridiculous.

[55:27] This is totally unrealistic.

[55:28] And then there's this really creepy guy in the background drinking a beer.

[55:34] It's really unusual.

[55:36] It's nice illustration, but it is a bit break shot for me.

[55:40] Break shot.

[55:41] It's it's a cool game.

[55:43] It's fun.

[55:44] It's very green.

[55:44] Green has a bit of a curse.

[55:46] Does it not in pinball?

[55:48] All games that are have a green back box or lots of green on the play field,

[55:52] tend to not sell very well for some reason.

[55:55] I think it's because green is a bit ugly on a cabinet.

[56:01] So what do you think of this game?

[56:02] You like this one?

[56:03] This is a winner.

[56:04] I said it's my favorite Capcom game.

[56:06] So so but but make what makes it the winner of your favorite game?

[56:10] It's another pool based theme with a cool little this super cue toy.

[56:17] It's a pretty cool max.

[56:18] So you lock balls in there, right?

[56:20] For kind of like a multi ball thing.

[56:21] But then they bounce around.

[56:23] It has a full orbit that goes all the way around.

[56:25] I'm a sucker for those.

[56:27] It's got the little mini flipper up top.

[56:30] Captive ball on the left side that bounces up into it's a captive ball into what do they call it?

[56:37] Newton ball, right?

[56:39] That's a good one too.

[56:41] It's got drop targets got a set of drop targets kind of an unusual play.

[56:45] This is a really great design by great comic like this is actually a really great play field.

[56:52] But it didn't sell very many units only a thousand yet.

[56:56] I've seen these like all over the place.

[56:59] I have to really weird.

[57:01] So may this may in 96 things are not good in may of 96 right?

[57:06] We're looking this is like when what's coming out around this time like attack for Mars?

[57:11] Is that coming out in 96?

[57:12] Oh, that was 95.

[57:15] 95 right and that didn't sell a whole on.

[57:17] No, nothing is selling.

[57:18] Even Williams is firing people and cost cutting at this point.

[57:24] Like things are in a bad way.

[57:25] So Capcom has come in.

[57:27] They've been sold a bag of goods of how easy pinball is.

[57:31] They've been sued a bunch of times.

[57:33] They've had I would say some some chaotic leadership in there.

[57:38] And they can see that they're not selling anything.

[57:41] But Mark Richie, he was going to save them.

[57:45] He was going to save the sales.

[57:46] He was going to knock it out of the park to use one of those awesome pinball cliches.

[57:52] He was making a game called Kingpin, which was a mafia themed pinball machine.

[57:57] And it was going to win.

[58:01] But what did the Capcom executive said?

[58:03] They said, no, we need a machine to get out quick.

[58:05] We need something fast and cheap.

[58:07] So they said, flipper football.

[58:09] That's what we're doing.

[58:11] Well, as the rumor goes, this story goes, big bang bar was supposed to be next,

[58:16] but Python pushed for flipper football.

[58:22] And flipper football, Python with hindsight, what he does is he spins it.

[58:28] That it was actually the executives at Capcom.

[58:30] Yeah.

[58:31] Yeah.

[58:32] I've heard the other story more than the executives won.

[58:36] Yeah.

[58:37] So this is another slap it together, kind of quick theme.

[58:40] This is a soccer theme from September of 96.

[58:42] So we're looking at six months later, sells 750 units.

[58:45] It's designed by Python, Angelo and Brian Hanson.

[58:49] It's got Arch by Huy Van Santon and Sound by Jeff Powell.

[58:54] This game was one that, you know, could have been better.

[59:00] It's got a smaller back box.

[59:01] It looks a little different.

[59:03] What have they done to this back box here, Ron?

[59:05] What they've done is they put the DMD under the glass in the play field.

[59:09] The back box itself has this weird trapezoid with the short end on the bottom.

[59:14] Put a soccer ball on the top.

[59:17] And they put a physical soccer ball.

[59:19] They stuck it to the, that's pretty smart.

[59:20] Pretty cool.

[59:22] It's a very Python idea.

[59:23] But when it comes to pinball, it looking very different is not a good thing.

[59:30] It was, we've learned, yeah, or last drop,

[59:32] it's down in the back and you score goals.

[59:34] Go.

[59:36] The thing I remember about it, it has a R rated mode.

[59:43] What?

[59:44] When it's an R rated mode, there's F bombs.

[59:47] The one guy moons you.

[59:49] Yeah.

[59:50] Someone had it at a show in the R rated mode.

[59:52] I'm like, did the game just F bomb me?

[59:54] Did the dude just move me?

[59:57] Like there's a dude who literally moons you.

[59:59] So at the top of the play field, there's a set of drop targets.

[01:00:01] There's two little flippers up there.

[01:00:02] You just sort of flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it.

[01:00:04] Kind of like the upper play field in Game of Thrones, you know,

[01:00:10] where it's got the two flippers up there.

[01:00:12] It's sort of like a little thing, but this is, this doesn't have an upper play field.

[01:00:14] It's the top part of the lower play field, right?

[01:00:17] There's, it's again, it's a single level machine.

[01:00:21] So there's no ramps in here.

[01:00:22] Remember all these ramps we were talking about?

[01:00:23] Well, they blew that budget back back with airborne and they don't have any more ramps to build.

[01:00:28] It's, it's a gimmick game and it gets old quickly.

[01:00:33] Cause you just keep scoring goals over and over.

[01:00:36] I mean, it does have a really cool DMD animations like when you score a goal,

[01:00:41] but it's like the same one and it replays it every time you score.

[01:00:44] Flipper football takes the most popular sport in the world and delivers it as a 12,

[01:00:49] a 12, a 20 inch by 46 inch coin operated electro mechanical replica.

[01:00:55] It is the first of a revolutionary new game based on the interplay display.

[01:01:01] For the first time ever in any game, we have achieved actual synchronized interactions

[01:01:09] between ball play and the interplay display trademark.

[01:01:14] A three dimensional ball is shot at a goal under the display located in the play field.

[01:01:21] And its progress is continued on the display with 2D animation.

[01:01:28] So you shoot the little targets in the back and it goes into the play field,

[01:01:34] you know, DMD display and it continues in the real in the fake world.

[01:01:38] This, this smaller back box is lighter and easier for disassembly and

[01:01:45] transformation.

[01:01:45] And you take it off your location because no one plays it.

[01:01:48] It might be lighter, but how is folding it down?

[01:01:52] This thing you literally have to take off.

[01:01:53] It doesn't fold.

[01:01:55] Go to the IPDB page.

[01:01:57] There was a thing about the R rated ROM on there.

[01:01:59] Speech includes an adult mode containing profanity and bodily noises.

[01:02:03] Oh, yeah, I think it farts too.

[01:02:05] Of course it does because farts are hilarious.

[01:02:08] To me, that's I just think of Python whenever I play this game.

[01:02:12] What was designed by Python with Brian Hansen doing the actual work.

[01:02:16] It's a world under glass that Python is well known for, right?

[01:02:19] If you look at taxi and those games where it looks like a highway and it looks like a

[01:02:24] I mean, this is literally looks like a football play.

[01:02:27] Yeah, I just see some eating or soccer.

[01:02:30] If we need to have an R rated ROM, we need, he needs to moon you because you got to have that

[01:02:34] because guys and bars love that stuff.

[01:02:36] And quite frankly, people weren't playing pinball in 96 and this very much accelerated,

[01:02:42] I would say, the death spiral of Capcom.

[01:02:45] This was, this was not, this was a half-baked product and I think you can really see that.

[01:02:50] What does Jeff Powell say about that?

[01:02:52] Jeff says, I remember in October of 96,

[01:02:55] they let the first wave of engineers go.

[01:02:58] I think there were 20 people let go.

[01:03:00] That was a pretty sad day.

[01:03:01] I remember company wide email saying, we need to pull together here guys.

[01:03:06] Paul Williams, you know, a little more of the insight stuff.

[01:03:08] Stop by my office one day and said,

[01:03:11] when Zouge Moto, which hopefully I'm at least close on that, the CEO of Capcom first set this up,

[01:03:17] they knew that they had to be prepared to go about 100 million in the red.

[01:03:20] At that point by October of 96, they were already about 60 million in the red.

[01:03:25] By December of that year, when they pulled the plug on a lot of the rest of us, it was a really dark day.

[01:03:31] So you can see that they were bleeding money.

[01:03:35] A hundred million dollars is a lot of money to lose in 1996.

[01:03:40] But they had this, they had these saviors, right?

[01:03:42] They had Big Bang Bar, the savior.

[01:03:46] Which was, you know, it was supposed to be out before,

[01:03:51] Flip or Fold.

[01:03:52] Right, it's been kicked around.

[01:03:53] Well, what is, every talks about this Big Bang Bar, right?

[01:03:56] Everybody, some people have probably, oh, I've heard of that, or they're well aware of that.

[01:04:00] But there's this legendary game.

[01:04:03] This outer space bar theme, it was designed somewhere in late 95 or through 96.

[01:04:09] There were 14 games produced or 14, you know, basically prototypes.

[01:04:13] It was designed by a gentleman named Rob Morrison.

[01:04:17] It has Mike Miller on mechanics and John Boydston on mechanics,

[01:04:24] Dots by Kevin Loza, Art by Paul Mazer and Stan Fukuada.

[01:04:33] And, wow, sorry Stan.

[01:04:37] And I know that I'm, this is not a joke, folks.

[01:04:40] I really legitimately try.

[01:04:42] I'll take the hard ones.

[01:04:45] Music is sound by Jeff Powell and software by Stephen King, not the author.

[01:04:49] Are you sure?

[01:04:50] I'm pretty sure.

[01:04:51] How come you got Jeff Powell or Stephen King?

[01:04:53] And I get Stan Fukuada.

[01:04:56] Yes.

[01:04:57] So, 14 units, I believe 13 are still in existence because I believe one was lost in a fire.

[01:05:03] So the theme here, right?

[01:05:04] So this is Capcom's Big Bang Bar.

[01:05:09] It's like a space bar, right?

[01:05:11] There's all these people in space and they're hanging out at the bar.

[01:05:15] This is like the, this is like the bar at the end of Space Balls.

[01:05:19] You know, they're all just hanging out, having a, having a drink in an area.

[01:05:23] There's all these weird characters floating around.

[01:05:26] It was designed to be released in 96, but as you say, it was delayed till February of 97,

[01:05:32] but Capcom closed in December of 96.

[01:05:36] So it doesn't have a flyer, but it has some flyer prototypes.

[01:05:41] So it's got like, this is what the flyer was going to look like.

[01:05:44] And then they were going to put the words around it.

[01:05:47] So I guess we have to make that up on our own.

[01:05:49] What kind of, what kind of things would they say about Big Bang Bar in...

[01:05:54] It's a bar in space.

[01:05:57] There's a tube and there's a lady with sunglasses from space.

[01:06:03] Don't forget, it's got raised ball bubbles.

[01:06:07] What do you think is going on here?

[01:06:08] I think this game is super cool.

[01:06:12] The art on the play field is like this light blue with these like,

[01:06:15] lady and this alien.

[01:06:17] It's laid out really well.

[01:06:20] Do you remember that game, Zombie Adventure?

[01:06:23] What was it called?

[01:06:24] Raza.

[01:06:25] Retro Zombie Atomic Adventure Land.

[01:06:29] Retro Atomic Zombie Adventure Land.

[01:06:31] Yeah, yeah.

[01:06:31] It's kind of got that bit of a vibe to it, right?

[01:06:34] That really kind of cool art style.

[01:06:36] And very much like that game, there was none of these really existed.

[01:06:40] But it's cool.

[01:06:41] I really like, I can see how this is very catchy.

[01:06:44] And this I think probably would have sold really well if it would have finally got out.

[01:06:48] It's risky, right?

[01:06:50] It's got beer and drinking and it's got a Uranus joke.

[01:06:55] Tube dancer.

[01:06:56] Yeah, there's a, okay, let's talk about the tube dancer.

[01:06:59] What's going on in there?

[01:07:00] She's in a tube and she's topless.

[01:07:03] And she spins, I guess, right?

[01:07:06] Yep.

[01:07:06] Or they spin.

[01:07:08] I don't know what gender a space alien would be.

[01:07:10] But it's got hair, a little bikini bottom thing.

[01:07:14] It's kind of neat.

[01:07:16] Right?

[01:07:16] I mean, I get what they're doing there as she's a stripper.

[01:07:21] In a tube.

[01:07:22] And there's a lot of

[01:07:25] double entendre, all kinds of stuff in the scale.

[01:07:27] If you drink quickly, it'll say it'll be like, wow, that didn't last long.

[01:07:32] Yeah, everybody loves a premature ejaculation joke.

[01:07:37] It's got really cool sculpts and molds and

[01:07:39] the habit trails are in this lime green.

[01:07:41] It's cool game.

[01:07:42] It looks, it's attention grabbing for sure.

[01:07:45] So Stan really, I think, killed it when it comes to the art here on this game.

[01:07:53] But there's some things around this game that, okay,

[01:07:56] well, here's some quotes from Stan.

[01:07:58] But what was Stan's last name again, Ron?

[01:08:01] Stan says, the challenge for me was to convey that message when someone first sees the

[01:08:05] backlash.

[01:08:06] I wanted the background to be dark like a nightclub or space,

[01:08:10] but also bright colors to convey the overall mood and fun of the game.

[01:08:13] Yeah, so he's going to a club.

[01:08:14] He's going to space club.

[01:08:16] The play field was designed by Rob Morrison.

[01:08:18] Now, this was his first play field.

[01:08:21] This is where he got his own, you know, all-in hands-on experience.

[01:08:25] We don't know a whole lot about Rob Morrison,

[01:08:27] but Jeff Powell can give us some information in there.

[01:08:30] He says, Rob, it's so many ideas that he couldn't incorporate everything into it.

[01:08:34] He basically threw the kitchen sink at the machine.

[01:08:36] That's probably what scared the CEO, or that's probably what scared the executives of Capcom.

[01:08:41] Was the price of this machine when we could do this flipper football.

[01:08:45] And we could do a break shot and we could make it that much simpler.

[01:08:49] Well, that's when the switch was hit.

[01:08:51] Well, Jeff Powell says, just before Big Bang Bar was ready to be manufactured,

[01:08:56] we had a bunch of German arcade owners come in.

[01:08:58] They saw flipper football, which had a soccer theme and soccer scoring,

[01:09:02] and they went nuts over it.

[01:09:03] Capcom jumped at that and pushed it forward.

[01:09:06] They thought that it would be a hit in Europe and saved the company.

[01:09:09] And we've heard this a bunch of times, right?

[01:09:11] The back in the 80s, when things were floundering,

[01:09:15] a lot of the folks over at Gotlib, they bent a lot to what the European distributors and

[01:09:22] European arcade owners wanted.

[01:09:24] And they wanted some of these kind of older themes again.

[01:09:27] They're the ones that are buying the game, right?

[01:09:29] The nowadays you and I, Ron are buying the game and enthusiasts have their own barcade.

[01:09:37] Back in the day, it was the big distributors that are buying those pins.

[01:09:41] You don't have to sell it to the end consumer.

[01:09:43] You just got to sell it to the distributor.

[01:09:45] And that's what they inevitably are looking to do here.

[01:09:48] But it was pinball expo in 1996 when Big Bang Bar was displayed and wowed the crowd.

[01:09:57] Well, they brought Capcom,

[01:09:58] brought flipper football and Big Bang Bar.

[01:10:01] Everybody loved flipper football.

[01:10:03] No, no one played flipper football.

[01:10:05] Oh, so they all played Big Bang Bar.

[01:10:07] Yes.

[01:10:08] So why would, okay?

[01:10:09] So then they still manufactured flipper football and it inevitably crashed, right?

[01:10:13] It's these guys come over from Europe and they're like,

[01:10:15] you need to make the football game and then they bought 750 units of them?

[01:10:21] Wow.

[01:10:22] Talk about stabbed in the back.

[01:10:24] After expo, which seems to be a theme in the pinball industry,

[01:10:28] let's go to expo and put on a smiley face and then when we come back,

[01:10:31] we're going to fire everybody.

[01:10:33] Yeah, pretty much.

[01:10:34] That's, yeah, like at least three times now.

[01:10:38] So you better watch out when you go to pinball expo.

[01:10:40] Yeah.

[01:10:41] Jeff Powell says, we had the thing finished and ready to go, meaning Big Bang Bar.

[01:10:45] We had prototypes out in bars and arcades.

[01:10:47] The artwork was done.

[01:10:48] Everything was done.

[01:10:49] It was a complete machine.

[01:10:51] I put a viewer work into Big Bang Bar.

[01:10:53] Then to not have it get out was just kind of crushingly frustrated.

[01:10:56] Oh, so sad.

[01:10:58] But they also had that other one.

[01:11:00] Kingpin, that was a gangster theme in 96.

[01:11:03] They had nine prototypes.

[01:11:04] This was designed by Mark Richey.

[01:11:06] He was poached in like late 94 or early 95.

[01:11:09] No, even sooner.

[01:11:10] Even sooner.

[01:11:11] Yeah, probably.

[01:11:12] Yeah, probably.

[01:11:13] He didn't actually get a game designed at all.

[01:11:17] He did like, I guess back office stuff, right?

[01:11:20] Like I guess he collected a paycheck.

[01:11:22] Well, they sued so he couldn't make a game.

[01:11:25] Right.

[01:11:25] So he's doing other things and collecting a paycheck.

[01:11:28] But he finally did get a design.

[01:11:29] He just never did release it.

[01:11:31] I always wondered how that was because his brother, Steve,

[01:11:35] is working at Williams.

[01:11:37] And he is working at Capcom and getting sued.

[01:11:40] That must be weird.

[01:11:41] That must have been weird.

[01:11:43] So I guess you put up with that because Steve Richey, Steve Richey,

[01:11:46] they needed him to design Star Trek over and over again.

[01:11:49] And nobody else is going to do that.

[01:11:51] Tony DeFaio, he would tell IPDB that at this point,

[01:11:56] in November of 96, he left Capcom.

[01:12:00] Steve King, he was already gone,

[01:12:03] who was one of the fellows working there.

[01:12:05] Then Bill Futzenrooter, who you will remember also from back in the day

[01:12:12] and working at Daddy East.

[01:12:14] Williams.

[01:12:16] I think he was a Williams.

[01:12:18] He was at Old Stern.

[01:12:20] He was around forever.

[01:12:21] He took over to finish and complete a lot of the gameplay for Kingpin.

[01:12:26] But by December the 9th, 1996, Capcom just let everybody go.

[01:12:32] Finally, they're dead.

[01:12:33] Now we can end the episode.

[01:12:35] Nothing else to talk about with Capcom.

[01:12:37] No, there's plenty to talk about.

[01:12:38] We didn't talk about Kingpin.

[01:12:39] Kingpin is awesome.

[01:12:41] Okay, well, let's talk a little more about Kingpin.

[01:12:42] They made nine of them, which I think eight remain because I think one of them

[01:12:47] got destroyed in the same fire that destroyed the big bang bar.

[01:12:51] Yes, I think someone had both.

[01:12:52] Boy, that sucks.

[01:12:54] Yeah.

[01:12:56] Oh, wait a minute.

[01:12:56] I have to read more stuff now.

[01:13:39] Oh, my.

[01:13:42] It had the fishtails like crisscross habit trail thing going.

[01:13:45] Okay.

[01:13:46] I'm going to talk about what spinners in front of both ramps, which makes it superior.

[01:13:49] Of course.

[01:13:49] Spinners make everything better.

[01:13:51] It's shot great.

[01:13:52] It's shot like fishtails.

[01:13:54] So it was good.

[01:13:55] Right.

[01:13:55] And this game in Big Bang Bar are similar in that

[01:14:00] they're like mode-based games.

[01:14:01] There's a shot to start the mode on Big Bang Bar.

[01:14:03] It's the Diyuthe ramp, which is so steep.

[01:14:06] Unique app conflictors to hit it.

[01:14:08] There's a story that Williams actually did a version of Big Bang Bar,

[01:14:12] but their flippers weren't strong enough to make the ramp.

[01:14:14] Wow.

[01:14:14] Okay.

[01:14:15] And on Kingpin, it's the Lex, which is the hotel on the left side.

[01:14:22] Yeah.

[01:14:22] And that kind of looks a little bit like the one that's in dirty hairy.

[01:14:25] The hotel Lex.

[01:14:27] And I just, I like the theme better because it's mob stuff.

[01:14:31] Like you hit the Lex.

[01:14:32] A bad guy gives you something to do.

[01:14:34] You do it.

[01:14:35] He says, good job.

[01:14:37] Now I got to kill you.

[01:14:38] He tries to kill you.

[01:14:39] You kill him and you take his place.

[01:14:42] Awesome.

[01:14:43] And you make your way up the crime meter.

[01:14:46] It had the whole power meter thing where the flippers get weaker.

[01:14:50] They tried that stuff.

[01:14:52] I don't know how well that works.

[01:14:54] So like if you're getting shot, you're losing health.

[01:14:57] By the time I played, at least the software iteration I did,

[01:15:00] you get to the end of the game and it has like the flippers get weaker and weaker and then you're dead.

[01:15:05] Okay.

[01:15:06] Okay.

[01:15:06] But it's a cool, it's cool.

[01:15:08] It's a good looking game.

[01:15:10] And we'll get into a little maybe a little more of this here in the future.

[01:15:12] But I mean, I don't know how far along the software was.

[01:15:15] The wizard, like the final thing was in it.

[01:15:18] Like I've I played both the Big Bang Bar and Kingpin and finished them

[01:15:22] because they each have their own like ending.

[01:15:25] Huh.

[01:15:26] I think in the current market they would be considered shallow.

[01:15:29] But in 96, they would have been, you know, the same as everything else.

[01:15:33] That's pretty cool.

[01:15:34] Now Greg Kameck, he was also working on a game called Red Line Fever.

[01:15:38] The worst kind of fever to have.

[01:15:41] And the game wasn't produced.

[01:15:42] They didn't really make anything but just a whitewood.

[01:15:46] It was based on a motorcycle theme.

[01:15:50] Well Greg says,

[01:15:51] Red Line Fever was designed to combine the real world experience of motorcycle racing

[01:15:55] with the symbolism of pinball by offering play field racing theme features

[01:15:59] in addition to handlebar flipper switches.

[01:16:02] The handlebar was mounted on the front of the cabinet.

[01:16:05] A few real world motorcyclist pinballers,

[01:16:08] that's a mouthful relay.

[01:16:09] They're approval to me of the game when it was shown.

[01:16:12] It was the best game I ever designed.

[01:16:14] It was the last game developed by Capcom before the door shut.

[01:16:17] It was scheduled to be Capcom's next game.

[01:16:20] There's only one prototype whitewood in existence.

[01:16:22] Ah, okay.

[01:16:23] Which I've never seen.

[01:16:24] Super cool.

[01:16:25] So this is on IPDB.

[01:16:28] So you can actually see this whitewood on there.

[01:16:33] It does look kind of cool but it never played it.

[01:16:36] Weird.

[01:16:36] Righteous.

[01:16:37] It says.

[01:16:38] Which is obviously the thing.

[01:16:39] There's a wonderful picture of Greg Kamek.

[01:16:42] Are not Greg Kamek.

[01:16:43] Is that Greg Kamek?

[01:16:45] That is Greg Kamek.

[01:16:46] I thought he was older than that.

[01:16:48] He's got handlebars.

[01:16:50] He doesn't have handlebars.

[01:16:51] It's got handlebars.

[01:16:52] That was out of show.

[01:16:53] And it was right next to the best data East Game ever made.

[01:16:55] Leith the weapon three.

[01:16:56] Yes.

[01:16:56] And Kingpin to the left of that.

[01:16:59] What do you think of the carpet in this hotel?

[01:17:01] Man, that's terrible carpet.

[01:17:04] Brown.

[01:17:04] Ugh.

[01:17:06] Anyway.

[01:17:06] So you can check that out on IPDB.

[01:17:09] It's kind of neat.

[01:17:11] The back ramp is like an orbit ramp thing unique.

[01:17:15] Looks neat.

[01:17:17] Apparently to Greg Kamek.

[01:17:18] This is better than any game he's ever made.

[01:17:21] Better than Zeyn'on.

[01:17:23] Better than break shot.

[01:17:24] It doesn't look better than break shot.

[01:17:26] No, this is hyperbole.

[01:17:27] He's totally lying.

[01:17:28] This doesn't look great.

[01:17:30] It looks okay.

[01:17:30] Well the thing is it's a prototype.

[01:17:33] I mean, I'm sure they can make that big red thing in the back.

[01:17:35] Look better.

[01:17:35] Yeah.

[01:17:36] Maybe.

[01:17:37] The best game I think.

[01:17:40] The best game that Capcom, I think, designed

[01:17:44] but was never released was a game called Zingy Bingy.

[01:17:47] Do you recall this game?

[01:17:50] Yes.

[01:17:50] I recall Zingy Bingy.

[01:17:53] As the story goes, the president of Capcom was visiting

[01:17:58] and saw this game.

[01:17:59] And that's when he decided like, yeah, we're shutting this down.

[01:18:02] That's how the story goes.

[01:18:04] So this is the adult sex theme game

[01:18:07] because we don't have enough of those.

[01:18:09] Yeah.

[01:18:09] It was designed in 96.

[01:18:11] There was only the whitewood produced.

[01:18:13] It was designed by Python Angelo and Brian Hanson

[01:18:16] and software by Bill Futzenruder.

[01:18:19] IPDB would say that Python came up with the concept of the game in 1985

[01:18:24] when he was working at Williams.

[01:18:26] And he signed a concept drawing from 1985

[01:18:30] which is in the IPDB section for Zingy Bingy.

[01:18:36] So he came up with this idea in 1985.

[01:18:39] And Williams looked at it and said no F and way.

[01:18:42] And Williams looked at it and said,

[01:18:44] you know what?

[01:18:45] Let's put that in the parking lot.

[01:18:47] This concept art, it looks a little bit like,

[01:18:52] like Jack bought kind of with a lady play field on the left side

[01:18:56] and then an upper male play field on the right side.

[01:18:59] And there is some jacking.

[01:19:00] Going on, but not jackpotting.

[01:19:02] His hands are full, but not of anything but himself.

[01:19:06] It's very weird.

[01:19:07] Go ahead and take a look at that.

[01:19:09] Don't look at it while you're driving.

[01:19:10] Or with children around.

[01:19:12] Don't look it up at church.

[01:19:13] So then also on IPDB, there are PDFs of the actual photos of the whitewood.

[01:19:21] Yeah.

[01:19:21] And what are we looking at here?

[01:19:23] I can't believe there's not better photos of this.

[01:19:24] I knew the guy who owned this.

[01:19:26] And I found out at the last expo,

[01:19:28] I guess he actually sold all his games so he doesn't have it anymore.

[01:19:30] So I have no idea who has it now.

[01:19:32] But he had the game and he had a party there like years ago

[01:19:35] where people actually got to play this thing.

[01:19:37] So we're looking at a play field with a DMD under the glass

[01:19:41] in the back of the play field.

[01:19:43] There's a lady's face on this plexiglass

[01:19:47] at the very back of the play field and a man's face.

[01:19:49] They're both gorgeous.

[01:19:51] Yeah, basically the top bumpers are her boobs.

[01:19:55] Right, because they're round.

[01:19:57] And the side flipper is the guy's penis, basically.

[01:20:00] Yeah, yeah, that's the man bit.

[01:20:03] And it's like an Adam and Eve theme here.

[01:20:07] Yeah, it's too much.

[01:20:10] It's a way too much.

[01:20:17] So what does Python say that little leadership team thought of this?

[01:20:20] He said they took polls with 138 women

[01:20:24] and it was approved unanimously.

[01:20:26] We did two play fields.

[01:20:28] It was a riot to play.

[01:20:29] Imagine a game where you can go with your girlfriend

[01:20:31] and have a blast because it does gender partners.

[01:20:34] Player one male, player two female.

[01:20:37] Imagine a game where you can have interaction.

[01:20:39] I mean, it's phenomenal, you know?

[01:20:40] Oh my god, great idea.

[01:20:42] It's a great idea, Ron.

[01:20:44] It was so great the president of Capcom said,

[01:20:46] shut this stuff down.

[01:20:47] When I look at this, this is the game I want,

[01:20:49] not only in my bar, but in my family room.

[01:20:53] Oh, definitely.

[01:20:54] Oh god, Python.

[01:20:56] Okay, so as you mentioned,

[01:20:58] the Capcom executives actually didn't like this theme at all.

[01:21:02] Yeah, Python tried to change the theme to Adam and Eve,

[01:21:04] but this did not help.

[01:21:06] Yeah, yeah.

[01:21:07] But Python had other ideas.

[01:21:09] Yeah, okay, okay.

[01:21:11] He said, I have sit down, pinball.

[01:21:13] Where you sit under a play field with your head in a bubble

[01:21:16] and flippers in front of your nose

[01:21:18] and balls fly around your head.

[01:21:19] But because the money man,

[01:21:21] oh, yeah, but because of the money man and the copycats

[01:21:24] and the bullshitters all over the industry.

[01:21:26] Yeah, that didn't happen because not that it was a bad idea

[01:21:29] and it wouldn't make money.

[01:21:32] It's because of the con men and those people, you know,

[01:21:36] pulling the strings and John Papaduke.

[01:21:40] Oh, yeah, he hates Python.

[01:21:41] Right, that's the reason that he couldn't do his sex theme game.

[01:21:47] It's ridiculous.

[01:21:48] It is literally ridiculous.

[01:21:50] In the end though, if he was still around,

[01:21:52] Python would be welcome with open arms

[01:21:54] at any pinball show and Papaduke would not.

[01:21:56] Yeah, how funny is that, eh?

[01:21:58] Yeah, think about that.

[01:21:59] That's pretty weird.

[01:22:00] Papaduke only sunk one company.

[01:22:02] Well, now I guess he sunk two.

[01:22:04] Okay, well, that's it.

[01:22:06] Capcom's dead and you can see why the leadership was terrible.

[01:22:10] The decisions were terrible.

[01:22:12] They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

[01:22:14] They started it way too late.

[01:22:16] They missed the peak.

[01:22:18] Yes, if they were in the late 80s, early 90s,

[01:22:21] they probably would have lasted longer.

[01:22:23] Was anybody surprised at what happened to Capcom?

[01:22:27] Well, George Gomez says,

[01:22:28] nobody gets it right 100% of the time.

[01:22:30] Capcom closing didn't surprise me.

[01:22:32] I saw the games were making and how they were struggling to sell them.

[01:22:36] I knew it was just a matter of time.

[01:22:38] No, no, no tears from George Gomez.

[01:22:41] What about Python, Angela?

[01:22:43] Yes, Capcom bulls**tied me.

[01:22:45] That's what he said.

[01:22:49] Anything to say in closing?

[01:22:51] Play some pinball magic.

[01:22:54] Play some airborne.

[01:22:55] You can find them.

[01:22:56] Especially play some wonderful break shot.
