[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:11] Am I too loud?

[00:15] I feel like I'm too loud.

[00:16] I don't know.

[00:17] You'll find me.

[00:18] I mean, except for the snowblower.

[00:20] Yeah, that.

[00:21] I don't know what I can help.

[00:22] Alright, I guess I'll just have to apologize for it.

[00:25] This is far more important than your snow.

[00:28] Sorry about the sound of the snowblower in the background because it's Canada and the

[00:33] winter and I'm recording a podcast.

[00:35] You can barely hear it.

[00:37] Okay, yeah, but as soon as I enhance the audio, it'll come in.

[00:40] It'll be just terrible.

[00:42] Oh, yeah.

[00:43] But that's how she rolls.

[00:44] That's how she's editing.

[00:45] Yeah, that's f***ing great.

[00:58] Hello, everyone.

[01:23] I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me is Ron Got to shovel

[01:29] that snow.

[01:30] How it?

[01:31] What's up, fella?

[01:32] How's it going?

[01:33] You're shoveling too, I hear.

[01:34] I am.

[01:35] I apologize, everybody, in case you hear snowblowers in the background because we just went

[01:38] through a big snow storm and my neighbors are out and a boot.

[01:43] Blow in the snow.

[01:44] We're in the northeast, so we have snow.

[01:47] That's how it goes.

[01:49] So what have you been doing?

[01:50] I guess you hosted the bells and chimes at level zero.

[01:53] Yeah, yesterday.

[01:54] Yeah, how'd that go?

[01:57] Went well.

[01:58] Did Bruce Knight and Gail place really high on that?

[02:01] Well, and he's not a bell, so no, he wasn't here.

[02:04] No.

[02:05] Oh, that's a shame.

[02:07] But you know, you can listen to Bruce on my other podcast, the Slamtail Podcast.

[02:12] Yeah.

[02:13] Super good, great podcast.

[02:15] Great podcast.

[02:16] 50% of it, better than the other 50%.

[02:19] Okay.

[02:20] Yeah, Scooby-Doo is also announced.

[02:23] Spooky pinball, Scooby-Doo.

[02:25] Killer license, that's what they know how to do, license an art.

[02:31] Dead silence.

[02:32] Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:34] Scooby-Doo, where are you?

[02:36] Rut-Row?

[02:37] Oh, yeah, I can't really do any Scooby characters.

[02:41] I'm sorry.

[02:42] I joined in on the pin-side secret Santa this year, like I do every year.

[02:49] Are you in on that run?

[02:51] Yeah, what's that?

[02:52] No, so basically on the pinball website, the pinball website, pin-side, you can sign up

[03:00] for a secret Santa gift giveaway and there's like a $30 limit and they'll parry up with

[03:05] somebody else in your country or area and you send them some Christmas gifts based around

[03:13] their pinball machines or their interests.

[03:16] It was, it was, it always is very fun this year.

[03:20] I sent my package out to Upper Canada, which is over in the GTA, the greater Toronto area.

[03:28] Loads of fun.

[03:29] And I also got just a wonderful heartwarming gift.

[03:33] I got a little Lego James Bond DB5 and some James Bond playing cards.

[03:41] This person really creeped me.

[03:42] They knew exactly what my interests were.

[03:45] So a great thank you.

[03:47] But you don't partake.

[03:49] I'm not typically on pin-side, so I was unaware of said thing.

[03:54] This is, this is probably the best thing all year that pin-side does.

[03:59] The best thing pin-sides, very heartwarming it.

[04:02] It warms the coccles of my heart.

[04:06] So thank you to my pin-side secret Santa.

[06:13] You gave the t-shirt to your dad?

[06:14] I think so.

[06:15] God you hate me.

[06:16] Yeah, I don't think I have a silver ball chronicles t-shirt.

[06:19] Actually, that brings me to the next thing, my friend.

[06:23] We have commissioned a very well-known pinball artist to do us a new logo and t-shirt design.

[06:31] We hopefully will get that out sometime in January because the artist is quite busy.

[06:37] Oh, this time of the year, wink wink.

[06:40] We're excited to bring that out for everybody.

[06:44] We have used our Patreon money and then some of my wife's money to pay for this artist.

[06:50] So thank you to all the patrons for helping us out on that.

[06:56] Swing on over to silverballswag.com.

[06:59] Click on the Silver Ball Chronicles logo and check out all of our hoodies, mugs and design

[07:06] choices.

[07:07] If you're a Canadian and you don't want to pay all of the shipping and possible duty from

[07:13] the shirts, shoot us an email at silverballcroniclesatgmail.com, shout out to Mike from British Columbia

[07:20] who picked up a shirt last month.

[07:22] I shipped it out to him and it smells of maple and leather bound books because it came directly

[07:28] from me.

[07:30] Ron, we've got some corrections from the last episode.

[07:32] I dropped the ball quite a few times here.

[07:34] Aw, fail.

[07:36] Some of them are actually quite embarrassing.

[07:38] Hmm.

[07:39] Where could people send corrections to?

[07:41] They can send that over to silverballcroniclesatgmail.com.

[07:46] Ah.

[07:47] Yes, Ben M did some follow up.

[07:49] He sent over quite a few emails.

[07:51] Some of them to do with the patent information on some of the older pinball stuff from that

[07:56] post-war era and solid state era.

[08:00] Very targets was one of the things that he sent over about that as well as he pointed

[08:03] out that we didn't spend very much time on Godly.

[08:06] Why is that Ron?

[08:07] It's because you hate Godly.

[08:10] Well, Godly were the leaders in the industry, but they didn't necessarily do everything first,

[08:16] I guess.

[08:17] So I mean, they did things like flippers and they had the spinners and things like that,

[08:22] but it wasn't specifically David Gottlieb that like sat up and came up with everything.

[08:27] That being said, we will have a deeper dive in the sort of Gottlieb wedgehead, EM1960's

[08:33] era stuff.

[08:34] It's just a matter of time before we get around to that.

[08:37] It's a lot harder to find my own content and primary sources, so sources of the people

[08:43] that were there at that time, as well as some of the sources that I was able to gleam

[08:49] from that area.

[08:51] They don't spend a whole lot of time on the content from the last episode.

[08:55] The pinball degenerate himself, Joe Chirovino.

[08:58] He pointed out in the last episode I made a joke about Vienna, like North Carolina or something,

[09:07] and I said it was in Italy.

[09:08] Well, he points out that Vienna is in Austria and not in Italy, which is actually quite

[09:15] embarrassing because I did actually know that.

[09:17] So that's a bummer.

[09:20] You could do this one if you want, because this is embarrassing for you because you should

[09:23] have known this one.

[09:24] All this is embarrassing for me.

[09:26] Yes, Ian points out that Wizard of Oz is not the first game at RGB LEDs.

[09:31] That's what we said.

[09:32] We said it was Wizard of Oz.

[09:34] They were the first one to show a pinball machine with RGB LEDs, but they weren't the first

[09:40] production.

[09:41] Yeah, because it took them like another year to actually come out with the game from

[09:46] the first time they showed it at a show.

[09:48] So ACDC was actually the first one.

[09:51] Yeah, specifically the LE premium model in the mood, stern design philosophy, which you

[09:57] would think I'd know being I have one.

[10:00] Oh, my.

[10:02] From that run from the original premium 2012 run.

[10:06] Yes.

[10:07] So I have failed.

[10:09] He also pointed out that there was a game called New Canesta, which was from some random

[10:13] European manufacturer that had a very low, small production run that actually had some

[10:17] RGB LEDs.

[10:18] But when we talked in our last episode, we were a little more, we tried to tighten up kind

[10:24] of it while it had to be an actual larger run production for us to sort of consider it.

[10:28] But granted again, we are not the ultimate authority of pinball history, specifically

[10:35] with a co-host like me, Ron.

[10:38] But ACDC was the first game that they did their three models, the pro, the premium and the

[10:44] LE, which Stern has been doing ever since.

[10:47] But the pro just had regular incandescence.

[10:50] But the production run was so long and they did so many different runs of ACDC, they eventually

[10:54] had a pro run with LEDs.

[10:57] Really?

[10:58] The swinging bell, the original pro just had the static bell.

[11:01] Yeah, there's so many.

[11:04] If you go to ipdb.org, great resource, you'll see there's at least six or seven different

[11:09] additions of ACDC.

[11:11] The topic today, this is a topic which we have revisited quite a few times.

[11:18] It is the pinball is dying series.

[11:22] Your favorite.

[11:23] For around the holidays, we're supposed to be in a good mood and you're going to do this.

[11:27] That's right, I'm going to do a topic which is all about destroying something.

[11:31] Oh.

[11:32] And it's usually the hopes and dreams of anybody who wants anything slightly different from

[11:38] the status quo.

[11:40] So status quo, weren't they?

[11:42] They were the first band at Live Aid.

[11:44] I thought I'm pretty sure they were the first, the first band.

[11:48] That's like an answer to a trivia question.

[11:50] It perfect.

[11:51] Perfect.

[11:52] There you go, everybody.

[11:53] This ongoing series is made to depress and delight all of our listeners.

[12:00] And what do I mean by that?

[12:01] Well, the pinball industry and the hobby around it has always been on fragile footing.

[12:09] It has ups and downs which during its history have swung violently.

[12:15] Brilliant minds have come and gone in pinball.

[12:18] Penny have been crushed by the emotional weight of competition or tempted away by actual

[12:25] jobs with less stress from impending layoffs.

[12:30] But pinball has always endured.

[12:32] This is the happy part, Ron.

[12:34] It has carried on.

[12:36] Great designers held on.

[12:38] Some went away and some returned.

[12:42] With every death spiral, pinball kept chugging along.

[12:46] So join us again this month.

[12:49] As we talk, pinball is dying.

[12:51] Part three, bali midway in the 1980s.

[12:55] As David Dennis goes for an Academy Award.

[12:57] That was deep.

[12:58] You know, the peak of bali.

[13:03] And we talked about this way back in the archives in our original sort of earlier episodes.

[13:09] These class of 1981 was really the absolute peak.

[13:14] 8081, isn't that right?

[13:17] Yes, that is right.

[13:18] What did they bring?

[13:19] What were some of the top sort of things that happened in 8081?

[13:24] Centaur, eight ball deluxe.

[13:27] Frontier if we want to go back to 1980 because I just love frontier.

[13:32] Xenon, not an amazing player but a stunning art package, a great sound package.

[13:38] Really cutting edge stuff.

[13:40] Well, by 1981, the tumble had started.

[13:44] And this was due to the fact that all the money was rushing into video.

[13:50] Video was cheaper.

[13:51] It had less maintenance.

[13:53] It was easier to do.

[13:54] And the game just went on and on and on and on.

[13:57] Where pinball had stock balls.

[14:00] It had production issues.

[14:02] It had flippers that would stop working all of that stuff.

[14:06] That tumble really started to pick up speed in 1982.

[14:12] You remember Spectrum, right, Ron?

[14:14] I remember Spectrum.

[14:16] Margaret Hudson, the artist on that pinball machine, would say that it was her baby.

[14:21] She also did the art on eight ball deluxe.

[14:23] But of course, Paul Ferris did most of the art direction of eight ball deluxe.

[14:28] She just drew the art.

[14:29] This was the machine that she had total free reign on.

[14:32] A beautiful machine, but a terrible player.

[14:36] What do you think?

[14:37] Was it a good player?

[14:39] You're saying it is fact.

[14:41] Yeah, exactly.

[14:42] I mean, I gotta say, when it comes to the class of 81, it doesn't stack up to those games.

[14:50] It's, it's masterminds.

[14:52] Yeah.

[14:53] And the code was where it was in an extremely complicate well.

[14:57] It has a saucer that you can just keep hitting over and getting clues, which kind of

[15:02] defeats the purpose.

[15:03] But the actual masterminds part is it's going to go over most people's heads, I think,

[15:09] playing it the rules.

[15:11] Yeah.

[15:12] I get you there.

[15:13] But a beautiful pin.

[15:15] Wonderful to look at.

[15:16] An absolute stunner looks good, I think, in any lineup.

[15:19] And very talkative.

[15:20] It talks a lot.

[15:22] One of the, one of the few major talkers sort of in this era when it started to go away.

[15:29] So after Spectrum's 994 unit sadness release here, we had Speak Easy, which had two different

[15:38] versions.

[15:39] There's the domestic version of Speak Easy with 3000 units.

[15:44] And Speak Easy 4, the export unit with 1000.

[15:47] So let's talk 4000 units.

[15:49] So the turbulence is beginning.

[15:51] We haven't fallen off of a cliff here, Ron.

[15:53] But there is turbulence.

[15:55] Speak Easy 4 has got to be rare, because even I haven't seen one.

[15:58] There, if you've got one of those in Europe, it's probably worth millions.

[16:01] The last great hit, the last greatest hit of Bally Manufacturing Corporation was, and

[16:10] this is an odd one, Baby Pac-Man from 1982, 7,000 units.

[16:18] So we're still holding it down here.

[16:20] Isn't that the combo video game pinball machine?

[16:23] That was.

[16:24] Now we'll talk about this some other time.

[16:26] But you've got a small play field with a Pac-Man sort of component in the video head part

[16:34] of it.

[16:35] It's not quite pinball, it's not quite video, but it speaks to the brand that was Pac-Man

[16:42] in the 1980s.

[16:43] It was just an absolute license to print money.

[16:48] But the last Bally Manufacturing Corporation game was BMX.

[16:55] Yes, the bike thing.

[16:58] Yes, it is a biking theme, where today we would call it X Games.

[17:03] This is January of 1983, it sells 406 units, designed by Ward Pemberton, and we'll remember

[17:12] him, Ron, from Thatham.

[17:15] Art by Greg Ferrares, Kevin O'Connor, Margaret Hudson, Pat McMan, and Uncredited Software.

[17:22] So the Chicago Expo 2012 presentation, Greg Ferrares stated that the game started out

[17:28] as ET.

[17:30] Remember that movie?

[17:31] Yes.

[17:32] Home home, but they couldn't get the license.

[17:35] So then the four in-house artists collaborated on the game.

[17:38] Greg Ferrares did the back glass, Kevin O'Connor did the play field, Margaret Hudson did the

[17:42] plastics, and Pat McMan did the cabinet.

[17:45] Yes, so with this was an all hands-on deck, let's get this thing done.

[17:50] But it only sells 406 units.

[17:52] So again, this turbulence in the early 1980s was really, they'd had a hit of 7,000 units,

[18:00] and then they couldn't get 400 units out of the door.

[18:03] 4,000 units, but they had like their hit and miss.

[18:06] It's really kind of a rough bit.

[18:08] But of course, we remember Ward Pemberton from Thatham fame, he designed Valley Manufacturing

[18:13] companies last pin while he was still a junior associate designer, and this was under Jim

[18:19] Patla.

[18:20] He didn't even have a full time contract.

[18:23] So at this time, they were kind of keeping people on junior roles, except for those senior

[18:29] team members like Jim Patla and Greg Ferrares and guys like that.

[18:33] So Ward says, I got laid off before BMX even went into production.

[18:37] It was just a very down time at Valley.

[18:40] I wasn't under contract, so they weren't losing anything getting rid of me.

[18:44] A couple of guys there felt really bad that I was laid off.

[18:47] Jim Patla was one of them.

[18:48] Yeah, so the cuts are starting, right?

[18:51] Things are going a bit of an upheaval, so you got to find what the, you know, like

[18:54] efficiencies have to cut the fat, right?

[18:58] And unfortunately, because Ward wasn't a full time employee, they were able to sort of

[19:05] cut him out easily, and he is very aware of that.

[19:08] A lot of Ward's comments come from his really wonderful appearance on Topcast in the early

[19:14] 2000s.

[19:15] Well, where did Ward end up?

[19:17] This is an amazing story.

[19:19] Well Ward says, you know what I did?

[19:21] I worked out for a while, and then I got to try out with the White Sox, the Chicago White

[19:25] Sox in 1983.

[19:27] They signed me up, and I went down to spring training, and then got released, never officially

[19:31] made the roster.

[19:32] I think I was only down there for about three weeks.

[19:35] It was another exciting time in my life, you know.

[19:37] I had a shot at the White Sox.

[19:39] That's amazing.

[19:40] Isn't that amazing?

[19:41] That's pretty cool.

[19:42] So don't play Ward Pemberton in the company softball game.

[19:46] You want him on your team?

[19:48] Exactly.

[19:49] Exactly.

[19:50] Draft him first.

[19:51] Well, so from 1932 to 1983, Valley was considered the Valley Manufacturing Corporation.

[19:59] But no more.

[20:00] But no more.

[20:01] The end has come.

[20:03] This turbulence of the post-1981 class of 81 era has come to an end with a significant

[20:11] change in Valley Manufacturing Corporation.

[20:15] It is now known as Valley Midway Manufacturing Company.

[20:18] So what's Midway?

[20:20] The new era has begun.

[20:21] Well, I mean, from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, Midway was the leading producer

[20:28] in video games in the United States.

[20:32] At this time, Midway was licensing and distributing in the United States Pac-Man from 1980, and

[20:39] it's sequel, which was huge, Miss Pac-Man in 1982.

[20:45] Arcade games were on a massive high through 1980 and 1983.

[20:51] You can see when you look at all of the information on IPDB and through some Google searches,

[20:59] that pinball really started to fall off a cliff and Midway became Valley Midway Manufacturing

[21:07] when Valley merged the pinball division with the video game Midway division in late

[21:13] 82.

[21:14] This was a corporate strategy to save money and to weather the recession of the mid-1980s.

[21:22] Do you remember that time, Ron?

[21:24] Were you aware of these changes in, you know, pinball in an arcade?

[21:30] 10 years old.

[21:31] I don't remember these changes.

[21:34] And where I was, there wasn't that much pinball.

[21:36] It was mostly video games.

[21:38] So there were three major games that were released in that year.

[21:42] One of them, including Satan's Hollow from George Gomez.

[21:46] I love that game.

[21:48] There was, it was the first game to feature the new brand of Valley Midway.

[21:55] So George Gomez says, we're in this horrible mode.

[21:59] We have been bought.

[22:00] Senior management of Valley had changed hands.

[22:03] They brought in a bunch of these GE management guys.

[22:06] They were all about acquisitions.

[22:08] It was the buzzword of the 80s.

[22:09] They basically took and squandered the video game war chest.

[22:13] In 1982, the Midway division was a $500 million company.

[22:17] If you just looked at the Midway division without anything else, they were bigger than

[22:21] the mother company.

[22:22] Yet, the mother company was holding the purse strings and calling the shots.

[22:26] These GE guys wanted to buy and they went out and bought all kinds of silly stuff.

[22:31] Mergers and acquisitions, right?

[22:32] If you're not buying anything, you're dying.

[22:35] So they spent a lot of time there.

[22:37] Now George Gomez was not in pinball at this time.

[22:41] George Gomez was not in the higher echelon of Midway at the time, like he is now at Stern

[22:48] pinball.

[22:49] He did have a lot of insight because he was in sort of a middle management design role.

[22:54] And that's where a lot of these quotes come from.

[22:57] What is GE's general electric?

[22:58] General electric.

[22:59] It is GE, okay.

[23:00] So what did management buy with all of the Midway video game money?

[23:05] They bought Lancer Yachts.

[23:07] They bought six flags over America and health clubs and fitness health equipment.

[23:12] Valley fitness.

[23:14] This is terrible.

[23:15] So basically the idea was that that Valley Midway was an entertainment company.

[23:21] So they try to find all these different ways to be entertainment.

[23:26] Well, go in with your family to six flags as entertainment, working out as entertainment.

[23:31] You know, rich people are entertained by fancy Yachts.

[23:35] And when you're a, you know, a big deal GE executive, you probably want to have a yacht

[23:40] because, you know, sometimes you get bored of your 1980s Porsche.

[23:44] So they basically had squandered that entire war chest on as George Gomez says, all kinds

[23:49] of silly stuff.

[23:50] So Grand Slam was the first pinball game under the Valley Midway brand.

[23:56] He was a baseball theme as the name would indicate from January of 1983.

[24:02] It sells a thousand units designed by Greg Kameck, art by Doug Watson and software by

[24:08] Raymond Merchant.

[24:09] So Greg Kameck told IPDB that Grand Slam was made as an economy game, meaning there wasn't

[24:15] a lot of extra money put into the game, neither in design or promotion.

[24:20] Originally, a two player was made, but they were not selling well.

[24:23] So Valley made the last part of the production run as a four player.

[24:27] So let me bring this up for your Ron, some of the images of this.

[24:32] Yeah.

[24:33] And I've seen all of these.

[24:34] I played all of these games.

[24:37] So you have spent a great deal of time playing some of these greatest hits of Valley Midway.

[24:44] So I think we're going to have a lot of fun with your insight here.

[24:49] Well, I mean, some of them are fun.

[24:52] It's interesting to see we're looking at the flyer because we love flyers.

[24:57] And it's curious how they're going to sell this to us now with this new company.

[25:02] So the flyer basically has baseball trivia on it.

[25:05] Interesting.

[25:06] Everybody loves trivia.

[25:07] I'm a big trivia fan.

[25:08] You know, play ball.

[25:10] It's the bottom of the knife and the heats on.

[25:13] You so enter up to the plate and get a tight grip on your flippers.

[25:17] Oh, God.

[25:18] Anything that happened.

[25:19] You could drive a single.

[25:21] It's a lug a man to second power house a homer blow your way to a win.

[25:26] Oh, no, that's not what it says.

[25:28] Oh, God, it's even worse.

[25:30] Plow your way to a win.

[25:32] Here's the wind up.

[25:33] Your hands are tightly clenched.

[25:36] Your face flushed in anticipation.

[25:38] I feel dirty reading this.

[25:41] You meet the ball with courage.

[25:43] Your swing is solid.

[25:44] It's a hit.

[25:45] The scoreboard shines.

[25:47] The bass is light.

[25:48] The path to victory, whether you're a rookie or a pinball pro, all the major league excitement

[25:53] of baseball comes alive and grand slam.

[25:57] Wow.

[25:58] Wow.

[25:59] And they have a picture of Hank Aaron on the flyer and Babe Ruth.

[26:04] I wonder if either of them gave their okay for that.

[26:08] What an odd thing.

[26:11] There's nothing on this flyer about the gameplay, about the features, about it's just

[26:17] it's going to be in a bar.

[26:19] People like baseball, especially in the US, right?

[26:21] Like America's pastime kind of thing.

[26:24] It's pulling on that and less to do with, hey, this game is good.

[26:28] I just think it's amazing.

[26:29] They have Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron on it.

[26:31] Well, it's just sort of a chubby guy and old clothing.

[26:35] It's Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron.

[26:38] So this has the flip up card cards that we saw on speed easy.

[26:46] So it's like a drop target, but instead of it dropping into the play field, it flips

[26:50] up like horizontally.

[26:52] Yep.

[26:53] Pretty cool.

[26:54] It does have an orbit spinner, but that orbit spinner ends up into the pop bumpers, which

[26:57] is kind of a bit of a, right?

[26:59] But it's clearly baseball.

[27:00] It has a baseball diamond in the middle.

[27:03] It's got your lanes on the top.

[27:04] It's got orbits.

[27:05] It seems like an okay game, but it is a stripped down version of pinball because we are in

[27:10] this era now of survival.

[27:13] But we still have cabinet art.

[27:15] Yeah.

[27:16] In fact, you know, it's a baseball player on the side.

[27:19] It's stencil, but it is pretty.

[27:21] The play field, it's really difficult, I think, all the time when it comes to play fields,

[27:26] it's always been an issue with football or baseball or soccer or whatever is trying to

[27:30] get that world under glass.

[27:32] It always just looks unusual, which is a bit annoying.

[27:36] But you know, it's still a nice looking pin, right?

[27:39] It still seems fun, but it is stripped down.

[27:42] And you've played one and you loved it every minute of it.

[27:45] It's all right.

[27:47] The greatest of all time, right?

[27:49] Again, it's also the era.

[27:51] I don't believe it has speech.

[27:53] That would cost too much.

[27:54] This used the Bali 2518-35 board set, which is the same as Baby Pac-Man.

[28:02] I find that unusual because it's like they just have this stock laying around and they

[28:06] got to get rid of it because it's surprising that Baby Pac-Man, which was the mix of pinball

[28:12] and video, would have a similar board to a stripped down machine because Baby Pac-Man

[28:17] doesn't seem like it was stripped down.

[28:20] This brings us to Centaur II, the sequel.

[28:24] Not really.

[28:25] It's the same game.

[28:26] Yeah.

[28:27] This is the fantasy big motorcycle Pigman theme.

[28:31] It's from June of 1983.

[28:33] It sells 1,550 units, which is a far cry from the Class of 1981 Centaur, which sold

[28:41] 3,700 units.

[28:44] These were technically considered Ellie's.

[28:46] It's Centaur II and you had Eightball Deluxe.

[28:49] Designed by Jim Patler, Art by Paul Ferris, probably his best art package and mechanics

[28:55] by Irv Grable.

[28:57] It was the exact same play field as Centaur 81.

[29:01] Had the Say It Again Reverb board on the Squawk and Talk speech card, which I think is

[29:06] amazing.

[29:07] It's a separate board.

[29:09] That board makes it reverberate, which is what makes the story.

[29:13] It's a reverb board.

[29:14] I just love that they call it Say It Again.

[29:17] Because it's reverberating.

[29:19] It is literally saying it destroys Centaur.

[29:23] And then it had the ball launch, the ball launch, you know, thing underneath basically an

[29:27] auto launcher before an auto launcher existed, which was based on the inspiration from 1956.

[29:33] Balls are poppin', which you'll remember from our last episode, which had a lot of

[29:37] launchers in 1956.

[29:40] Mindboggling.

[29:41] Yeah, this is where they were using their rapid fire cabinets.

[29:44] Yeah, so it's just, it's like all the best parts of Centaur.

[29:48] It just looks strange.

[29:50] It wrap up.

[29:51] Which is kind of disappointing.

[29:52] Rapid fire was the copy of Hyperball that they ripped off from Williams.

[29:57] And it bombed just like Hyperball did for Williams.

[29:59] So they were left with cabinets left over just like Williams was.

[30:03] Yeah, they're trying to tap into...

[30:06] They're trying to tap into video game-ness at this time.

[30:10] All that money is flowing into video games.

[30:13] Well, they're trying to tap into that.

[30:15] And they just are struggling a lot.

[30:19] It's really kind of strange.

[30:20] But some of the really amazing stuff in here is like the pre-production artwork.

[30:25] If you look at IPDB, it's just beautiful.

[30:27] It still looks great.

[30:29] The disappointing fact is that the back glass, which is so amazing, is smaller in Centaur

[30:35] 2 because of the size of that rapid fire cabinet.

[30:39] I know people who prefer this version.

[30:41] Really, yes.

[30:42] Is it because it's like easier to move or something?

[30:44] I don't know.

[30:45] I mean, I wouldn't.

[30:46] And to think about the rapid fire, the back glass is just the glass.

[30:50] There's no scoring displays.

[30:52] The scoring displays are actually below it to have their own section.

[30:55] So I guess it's more, more art focused, I guess, than function.

[31:00] This shit really hits the fan in 1982 and early 83.

[31:04] That's when both pinball and video games start to sort of spiral downward.

[31:11] There's oversaturation in the market.

[31:13] The quality of video has started to just decline.

[31:16] The new management is looking to save money.

[31:19] And they do that by combining the pinball and arcade divisions in one facility in Franklin

[31:25] Park outside of Chicago.

[31:27] They're downsizing and trying to cut costs.

[31:31] Paul Ferris says the industry in about 1983 was at almost its lowest M.

[31:36] They started downsizing a lot of the ballet product.

[31:39] There was actually talk at that point of not even doing pinball anymore.

[31:42] Balli not doing pinball seems almost like blasphemy, doesn't it?

[31:47] Balli is synonymous with pinball, especially back then when they were actually a manufacturer.

[31:54] It's just depressing to even think of that.

[31:57] The art in those times and Paul Ferris is really as the art director in that class of 1981,

[32:05] he was brought on because art sold pinball machines.

[32:10] Well by 1983, they are looking at ways to cut costs.

[32:17] So Paul Ferris says almost everybody had gone from the art department.

[32:22] That's when I knew that we could see that the end was coming.

[32:25] It was going to be very, very tough to keep doing the things we had done before.

[32:29] This was my first experience with this.

[32:31] Things could go up, but they also can go down.

[32:34] Even if you're doing all the right things, the market is what controls all that.

[32:38] So then I did leave.

[32:40] And I think they kept maybe two or three people just to kind of run a skeleton crew in the

[32:44] art department.

[32:45] You can really start to see in the next games that we run through here, Braun.

[32:49] I guess the creative quality of those pinball machines has really started to fall off a cliff,

[32:56] which is really a bummer.

[32:59] So let me share Gold Ball with you, Ron.

[33:03] Gold Ball.

[33:04] Gold Ball.

[33:05] Yes.

[33:06] The famous James Bond villain.

[33:08] No.

[33:11] This is a, I want to say like a fantasy theme of some sort.

[33:17] This is from June of 83.

[33:19] So we've gone, you know, almost five months here between pins in 83.

[33:24] So even the manufacturing of production has slowed down.

[33:27] This is designed by George Christian, art by Tony Ramuni, and software by Raymond Merchant.

[33:34] So let's take a look at this flyer.

[33:37] Because I think this is peak Gold Ball.

[33:39] The time now.

[33:42] The event, a fantastic adventure in futuristic pinball, the game Gold Ball.

[33:50] And it's got a guy that kind of looks like the silver ball mania dude.

[33:53] Yeah, really sort of ripped and bald and he's reaching out towards the player.

[33:59] A new age of pinball.

[34:01] It does have a cool gimmick.

[34:03] So what is the gimmick here?

[34:04] What is the, what is the thing that's supposed to catch you?

[34:07] The gimmick is it has, it has two balls in it.

[34:11] It has regular pinball, but then it also has a gold ball.

[34:16] Yes.

[34:17] And here's the funny thing about this.

[34:19] The Gold Ball does something special, right?

[34:21] I think it's three times play field when you get the gold ball triple play field values.

[34:26] And originally it was just a percentage.

[34:28] The operator would choose how often the gold ball would come out.

[34:31] And then they changed it and made it a skill based.

[34:34] So there's, there's different ROM reversions for this game.

[34:36] The thing that's interesting is if you find one of these, the gold ball will still be

[34:41] gold, you know, 40 years later.

[34:43] Wow.

[34:44] Yet today, whenever anyone tries to make like a gold plated ball, the plating always comes

[34:49] off.

[34:50] It's, it's another one of those things.

[34:52] It's like, how did they make this gold ball?

[34:54] The thing lasts forever and they can't make these now.

[34:58] Like this, the plating falls off of it.

[35:00] What was the secret?

[35:01] It's, it's probably dangerous chemical.

[35:04] Oh, dangerous.

[35:05] But yeah, it's, it's a neat little gimmick.

[35:07] It has the ball like in a separate area below the apron that it just, it comes out.

[35:14] So all of a sudden it just goes in the shooter lane and you got a gold ball.

[35:17] But there's, yeah, it's, it's no real rhyme or reason, which is, which is kind of the

[35:21] bummer, right?

[35:22] Well, it's, it's percentage.

[35:24] But then they changed the ROM.

[35:26] So it actually is skill based.

[35:28] So there's two versions of it.

[35:29] So we're in June of 83.

[35:32] The next game doesn't come out until 1984.

[35:38] So we go basically six months, six in a few months and we get eight ball deluxe limited

[35:46] edition.

[35:47] No, that's, that's not, this is not a limited edition.

[35:49] The limited edition is the one in the rapid fire cabinet.

[35:52] There's like three, there's three versions of eight ball deluxe.

[35:55] That's right.

[35:56] That's right.

[35:57] I'm sorry.

[35:58] I'm not ahead looking in my notes here, folks.

[36:01] This version of eight ball deluxe is exactly like the original version, except there are

[36:06] a few minor differences.

[36:08] So take a look at your eight ball deluxe cabinet because you might think this is actually

[36:13] manufactured from the class of 81, but it might actually be from the, oh my God, we

[36:18] need a good game that we know how to manufacture very cheaply in 1984 version.

[36:23] Some of the differences include the apron is black and says, ballet midway.

[36:28] I think the original one was like gold.

[36:30] The entire front of the cabinet is black.

[36:33] Side edges of the back box are beveled.

[36:36] Cabinet art is decals, play field lamps are mounted on PCB boards instead of individual

[36:42] light sockets.

[36:43] There's a slightly smaller hinged back less that swings out and the coin door stickers

[36:47] says ballet midway instead of ballet.

[36:50] Yeah.

[36:51] So check your pin.

[36:52] You might actually find out.

[36:53] So it's a little bit different.

[36:54] The light mounted, the light mounted.

[36:57] The PCB boards for the lights are actually a little better than the individual sockets.

[37:02] It's like the newer style that you would, you would have saw in like a Williams game in

[37:06] the 90s with the twist things.

[37:08] So some people, I've seen a person had a project where they combined like the best elements

[37:14] of the 81 eight ball deluxe with the 84 eight ball deluxe to get the ultimate eight ball

[37:20] deluxe.

[37:21] Yes.

[37:22] The Frankenstein of eight ball deluxe.

[37:25] I play a lot of eight ball deluxe in my league.

[37:27] I really, there's something about the design of that game.

[37:31] I don't know what it is, but it's just so challenging and fun and interesting.

[37:36] It really has great.

[37:38] So the next thing we do is we have to innovate again and we're playing granny and the

[37:43] gators.

[37:44] Yes.

[37:45] Because we waited six months to get eight ball deluxe again.

[37:47] So we need something new.

[37:50] This is the Geriatric Safari Wildlife theme.

[37:54] It is from January of 1984.

[37:57] We're unsure how many units it sold, but it is designed by Claude Fernandez, art by

[38:02] Pat McMan and Margaret Hudson.

[38:05] Software is uncredited.

[38:08] What are we looking at here, Ron?

[38:11] I think I've only played Granny and the Gators make like maybe once.

[38:14] It is baby pack again with a TV monitor in the back glass and a shortened odd looking

[38:23] play field down below.

[38:25] Haven't played it.

[38:26] I have seen it.

[38:28] The art is pretty great.

[38:29] I'm not going to lie.

[38:30] Margaret Hudson, you know, tip of the hat to you.

[38:34] It is very, very neat.

[38:36] It's again, it's not pinball.

[38:38] It's not video games.

[38:39] Is it like a two-player?

[38:41] Yeah.

[38:43] Check out this fly.

[38:44] I love your Geriatric.

[38:45] What did you call it?

[38:46] The theme.

[38:47] Geriatric Safari Wildlife.

[38:49] You think that's all.

[38:51] Yes, Bally, Midway's, Granny and the Gators trademarked.

[38:56] Are you spunky enough to keep up with Granny?

[39:00] Find out when she takes on the Gators in a splashy new video pinball voyage.

[39:06] Navigate Granny past rough waters to steer clear of danger.

[39:10] Oh, my.

[39:11] Yeah.

[39:12] Oh, my God.

[39:14] But the art on this flyer is amazing, huh?

[39:16] Oh, yeah.

[39:17] It's like Granny in combat boots with a bunch of money and an alligator.

[39:23] And there's like a smoking.

[39:25] What is that?

[39:26] A bird, a some sort with a cigar.

[39:29] It's pretty great here.

[39:30] It's pretty great.

[39:32] But like, what is it?

[39:35] Is it pinball?

[39:36] Is it a video game?

[39:37] What is it?

[39:38] It's both help Granny paddle towards a pinball detour.

[39:45] This Granny Globe trotstords various points across the river.

[39:48] She will approach pinball entrances.

[39:51] Once she can news into the entrance, she'll leave the video world behind and encounter

[39:55] the pinball play field.

[39:57] Here Granny can accumulate a few souvenirs, including ammunition, gold and additional points.

[40:03] There you go.

[40:04] So in a nutshell, you're playing a bit of a video game.

[40:08] You're canoeing up a river.

[40:10] You end up in a spot and then the ball pops out on the play field.

[40:14] You play a little pinball and then you're back on the screen.

[40:16] It's all the power to you.

[40:19] I think it's pretty cool.

[40:20] I think it's fun that they tried it again.

[40:23] But this game and Baby Pac-Man are often referenced in what not to do.

[40:30] George Gomez, Pat Lawler, all those individuals, when they're talking about pinball 2000, you

[40:36] know, 20 years after this, are basically saying like, we couldn't

[40:40] make it like Granny and the Gators.

[40:42] We couldn't make it like Baby Pac-Man because it did not go over well.

[40:47] But the sales were okay on these machines, which is unusual.

[40:50] Let's continue on our journey down the river, which is Valley Midway.

[40:56] And that brings us to X's and O's, which is a board game, I think, time travel theme.

[41:03] It is later January of 84.

[41:06] It sells 3,300 units.

[41:08] So we got something here, something hit with this machine.

[41:13] It is George Christian on design, Pat McMahon and Margaret Hudson on art.

[41:19] And again, software by Raymond Merchant.

[41:21] You can see the cost cutting here, the skeleton crew of the art team, the same software designer,

[41:28] the same senior game designer for years and years.

[41:33] Margaret Hudson, this would be her last Valley game.

[41:36] You would disappear from the industry for years until 1987 at Data East.

[41:43] And then again, she disappeared and returned to Stern in the 2000s.

[41:48] X's and O's, this is a game that people actually really, really enjoy.

[41:52] They do?

[41:53] I think so.

[41:54] It's Tick-Tack-Toe.

[41:55] It's another great game.

[41:56] And it has the skillshot that if you're in a multi-person game, you have to run up when

[42:01] it's your turn because it's times out within like five seconds or something.

[42:06] You have five to ten seconds.

[42:08] I think it's five seconds.

[42:10] But it goes over well, right?

[42:11] The code is the thing that sort of sets this game apart as being like original and neat,

[42:16] isn't that right?

[42:17] I like it.

[42:18] And for some reason, this game just kind of hits like, oh, this is kind of fun.

[42:22] This is different.

[42:23] But it's like a caveman backlash, which is really cool, but like unusual.

[42:30] It's very cartoony.

[42:32] It's like the invention of Tick-Tack-Toe across different eras.

[42:36] There's like Greek gentleman in there.

[42:39] There's cowboys in there.

[42:41] There's like a space man.

[42:43] I don't know what is going on, but it is fun.

[42:46] It's a fun-looking game.

[42:48] What do you think about this play field?

[42:49] We're looking at the play field now.

[42:51] Right directly in the middle is a Tick-Tack-Toe grid.

[42:55] Yep.

[42:56] It's like Mystic.

[42:59] It's got the same grid.

[43:00] Yeah.

[43:01] It's the same target's except instead of drop targets, they're now stand-ups again,

[43:05] less money.

[43:06] Yeah.

[43:07] More challenging gameplay though.

[43:09] And to me, it's like an updated Mystic.

[43:12] With a cool skill shot, it's got a flipper up on top with actual drops.

[43:18] Like I said, the skill shot is extremely difficult.

[43:22] And you have five seconds to attempt it before the timer runs out.

[43:26] Yeah.

[43:27] And then you can go left side into like a really kind of unusual end of the pops, but

[43:32] it's got three sort of different exits you can take into the pops or into the air.

[43:37] It's like a really fun looking play field.

[43:41] Really fun looking play field.

[43:42] The left has the outlane is the in lane, the in lane is the outlane thing.

[43:45] That ballie love to do.

[43:46] And then the bump on the other side, you can nudge the outlane back into the in lane.

[43:51] So it's really, it's a really creative play field by George Christian.

[43:54] And I think that's why it's sold well.

[43:57] It's quirky, it's original, it's not granny in the gators, it's not stripped down or

[44:04] at least it doesn't look stripped down.

[44:06] It's cool.

[44:07] I'd play one.

[44:08] I'd play one 100% if I could see it.

[44:11] Just beautiful, but it doesn't have multiple.

[44:13] It does.

[44:14] You're going to find almost a lot of these are not going to have multiple because again,

[44:18] saving money.

[44:19] I've mentioned George Christian a couple of times.

[44:21] And he was the designer behind the greatest selling pinball machine of all time.

[44:26] Adams family, Till Adams family.

[44:29] And that was ballie's eight ball from 1977.

[44:32] It sold a billion units.

[44:34] That's all that's the one.

[44:35] Wow.

[44:36] Wow.

[44:37] Wow.

[44:38] Wow.

[44:39] That's a lot of fun on it.

[44:40] We might we might get a correction on that one.

[44:41] I'm thinking.

[44:42] Yeah.

[44:43] And they're just using him to bang out quick, cheap and interesting designs.

[44:48] Because he's a pro.

[44:49] He knows how to do this.

[44:50] He knows how to get a play field out.

[44:52] And that is the one thing that those designers from the 70s and 60s, they just they just banged

[44:59] out play fields like you would not believe it was absolutely amazing.

[45:03] What about King's of Steel?

[45:06] Ah.

[45:07] Kings of Steel.

[45:08] This is this is a card game theme.

[45:11] It's from March of 84.

[45:12] So we can see that at least now our releases are coming together a little bit quicker.

[45:16] sells 2,900 units.

[45:18] So again, we're popping a number.

[45:19] That's a good number to see.

[45:21] This is the design by Greg Kameck.

[45:23] You'll remember him from Xenon.

[45:25] Art by Doug Watson and software by Raymond Merchant.

[45:29] I like the art.

[45:31] It's got the dueling kings on the back glass.

[45:34] It is not Greg Ferris.

[45:36] It is not Paul Ferris.

[45:38] But at the same time, it is unusual and interesting and kind of fun.

[45:43] But we're in a different era of art in these times.

[45:47] They've got like two knights face to face on the back glass.

[45:51] They're kings.

[45:52] They're not knights.

[45:53] They're kings of Steel.

[45:54] Yes.

[45:55] Because it's card games, right?

[45:57] The King of Hearts and the King of Spades or something and they're facing off.

[46:01] It's a very busy back glass, but it comes together really well.

[46:04] I really like this.

[46:06] Beautiful.

[46:07] Just beautiful.

[46:08] It's not Centaur craziness.

[46:09] It's not Xenon space, weirdness, but it is cool.

[46:13] Where I think it goes, it goes awry or the playfields in this era.

[46:19] They use a lot of oranges, a lot of like blues and things.

[46:25] It's a bit muddled on the playfield, but it's not the end of the world, right?

[46:30] It's not the end of the world.

[46:32] This one also has the unusual out lanes.

[46:35] It has a gate on the right side.

[46:37] So it has two in lanes unless the gate is disengaged and then you lose your ball out

[46:41] with the out lane.

[46:43] What do we want to call that left side out lane where the out lane is the in lane and

[46:47] it comes through a gate?

[46:48] What do we want to call that?

[46:49] I call it the Bally out lane in lane.

[46:52] It also has the Bally saucer up top.

[46:54] They love that too.

[46:56] Everybody.

[46:57] Everybody loves the saucer.

[46:59] And I mean, that's Greg Kamek, right?

[47:01] Greg Kamek, almost all of his games have a f***ing saucer at the top.

[47:05] Now this game for the tournament crowd.

[47:09] This is one of the worst games you could have because you hit the top, the stand up

[47:13] target on the right and that's it.

[47:16] That's all you hit.

[47:17] Yeah, it's like a dead end, it's like a dead end stand up target shot.

[47:20] You ignore everything else in the game and if you hit that enough times, you will win.

[47:25] Drop targets on the left, ignore them.

[47:27] Stand up targets with the small flipper on the top.

[47:30] Oddly enough, every time there is a top saucer that the object is to shoot that saucer,

[47:35] not in this game.

[47:36] They've had multiple games too with that upper left flipper with the targets up there.

[47:42] Fireball too has the exact same thing.

[47:44] And it has a swinging target, a sucker target in the center that swings, right?

[47:49] That's like shoot me in the middle.

[47:50] Shoot me super dangerous.

[47:52] I don't think that swings.

[47:53] I'm sorry, I mean a standard target.

[47:55] Yeah, that should also be a Bally thing.

[47:57] The stand up target directly in the center in front of you.

[48:00] That's like hit me.

[48:02] And if you do, it probably won't register and you'll drain anyway.

[48:05] How are they trying to sell this to me?

[48:07] How are they selling Kings of Steel?

[48:09] Enjoy a test of champions on the Playfield of Combat in Bally Midway's exciting new four-player

[48:16] pinball, Kings of Steel.

[48:18] Oh, exciting.

[48:20] It actually does sound pretty, pretty good.

[48:23] Now Ron, does Kings of Steel still have the old school cabinet?

[48:28] When did they move to the new crappy cabinet?

[48:31] Uh, oh, you mean the one that's made out of cardboard?

[48:35] It's cardboard.

[48:36] Well, we haven't got to this 68 or 3's yet, I don't think.

[48:41] So basically what I'm what I'm leading us to here is eventually they go from the sort

[48:45] of the old school solid kind of birch or wood cabinets to like a like a fiber board,

[48:52] melamine kind of weird cabinets, again, to cut costs.

[48:56] Yep.

[48:57] And even on Kings of Steel, it doesn't use the Squawk and Talkboard.

[49:00] It uses the cheap Squawkboard, which is the seller I've ever I've ever heard of.

[49:05] Cheap Squawk.

[49:06] Cheap Squawk.

[49:07] Or cheap squeak.

[49:10] Yeah.

[49:11] Just a squeak or cheap squawk.

[49:12] I don't know.

[49:13] It must be cheap squeak because that sounds more fun.

[49:16] Yeah.

[49:17] The next game in 1984 is in July.

[49:20] So the production is quicker all of a sudden, right?

[49:24] We're at least trying to bang out some games here on a more regular basis.

[49:28] We're less in cost-cutting survival mode like we were about a year ago or two years

[49:35] ago and now we're just sort of like, okay, let's just be consistent with quality here.

[49:39] George Christiansen with another play field.

[49:41] This is Black Pyramid.

[49:43] It is like a what is what is this theme like a sort of venture or theme?

[49:48] Yeah, it's like adventure Amazon pyramid thing.

[49:55] Like you know the guy in Jungle Hunt?

[49:56] Yeah.

[49:57] That's like he's in pyramids now.

[49:59] That's what it is.

[50:00] There you go.

[50:01] R.G. 500 units.

[50:03] Art by Greg Ferrera.

[50:04] So he's sticking around.

[50:05] Software by Raymond Merchand.

[50:08] Again, he's just doing all the software, which is why some of the games are better than others.

[50:13] Now, this game comes out as a July of 1984.

[50:17] Do you remember what came out in May of 1984?

[50:22] Well, if I wasn't looking at your notes, no, but looking at your notes, Temple of Doom.

[50:26] Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

[50:30] So I think we are trying to piggyback on that sort of adventure kind of mystery fun theme.

[50:38] And Indiana Jones is pretty awesome.

[50:40] Not gonna like, except for which we don't talk about.

[50:44] But they're all pretty good movies.

[50:46] This is the legend of the Black Pyramid.

[50:49] It all began thousands of miles beyond the mouth of the Nile River in a fertile region

[50:54] known today as Bally Midway.

[50:56] Oh, God.

[50:57] That's terrible.

[50:58] That's terrible.

[50:59] I can't read this.

[51:00] I'll get to the end.

[51:01] At least it wasn't upon the majesty of its flashing lights, the gleaming opulence of its

[51:07] regal flippers.

[51:09] Now from the far corners of Bally Midway, the legend known as Black Pyramid lives again.

[51:16] I mean, I guess.

[51:18] Wow.

[51:19] Yeah.

[51:20] That's the fun thing about Bally, eh?

[51:21] Is they go all in on the emotional connection?

[51:23] All in on the fiction.

[51:24] Yeah.

[51:25] It's not the gameplay that gets you.

[51:27] It's the fan fiction.

[51:28] It's not definitely not in this game.

[51:30] Basically Black Pyramid, it has the swinging target in the center that goes back and forth

[51:34] that you never hit.

[51:36] It has the saucer up top, of course.

[51:39] And this is the orbit game.

[51:40] If it's on the right flipper, hit the left orbit.

[51:43] Left flipper, hit the right orbit.

[51:44] That's it.

[51:45] That's it.

[51:46] Don't hit anything else.

[51:47] Don't do anything else.

[51:48] It's got to stand up in line, drop targets on the right orbit, which we love the two

[51:51] times three times five.

[51:52] Well, they know people.

[51:53] They know people.

[51:54] They know people.

[51:55] They know it.

[51:56] We love in line, drop targets.

[51:58] We knock them all down and then you just go up top.

[52:00] Playfield's very Egyptian theme.

[52:01] Yep.

[52:02] It's got some snakes.

[52:03] It's got a Black Pyramid in the middle.

[52:06] As it should.

[52:07] It's the name of the game.

[52:08] Yeah.

[52:09] That'd be literal.

[52:10] I never mind playing this game because I just, I want to see how many orbits I can hit.

[52:13] How about, how about, how about 1984, October of 1984, Spy Hunter?

[52:19] The video game Spy Car theme, I love Spy Hunter.

[52:24] It sells 2,300 units, another decent seller.

[52:28] Greg Kamek, Tony Ramuni on art, software by Raymond Merchant.

[52:34] Bali used the same name and the same design of the video game, which was released in 1983.

[52:42] Spy Hunter is the driving game designed by the George Gomez at Midway in the video game

[52:49] department.

[52:50] But they added an interesting piece to the pinball machine, which was crazy play field layout.

[53:00] Yeah.

[53:01] You know, wouldn't they bring in a George Gomez to work on this?

[53:04] Wouldn't they, they had a certified hit in 1983 with Spy Hunter?

[53:09] Well, George said, with the success of Spy Hunter, the company wanted to leverage the

[53:13] property.

[53:14] And they said, you know, let's make 500 pinballs.

[53:16] The pinball guys didn't know who I was or cared.

[53:20] They were basically the first rock star designers in our business, which is interesting coming

[53:24] from a modern rock star legend in the industry.

[53:28] They're going to bring in Greg Kamek, who did Zinon, right?

[53:32] Who did a lot of those big sort of smash hit games in 8081, spin around forever, and

[53:39] they're going to param up with George Gomez, right?

[53:42] George Gomez is going to come in and help design this because I mean, it's his property.

[53:44] He literally invented it.

[53:46] So George says, so I walk into Greg's office, and I may have said two words to the guy.

[53:51] I got the chilliest reception I've ever gotten.

[53:54] So I walked out of there going, okay, this isn't going to happen.

[53:57] You know, this guy's not going to let me do anything relative to pinball.

[54:01] I regret that to this day.

[54:03] I would love to do a Spy Hunter pinball.

[54:05] There, there.

[54:07] Here's an Easter egg.

[54:08] There is an agent GK on some of the targets there, which refers to the game designer, Greg

[54:13] Kamek.

[54:14] Let's dive into Spy Hunter, the design of this game because it is something else.

[54:25] Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do I don't think it placed

[54:28] the Peter gum music.

[54:29] Of course it wouldn't right like that would be just too nice.

[54:32] The Peter gum music that they had to use because they couldn't get the Bond theme music.

[54:37] Who could get all those years later Gomez got the Dubon Spy Hunter hot on the heels

[54:43] of Valley Midways popular video game Spy Hunter comes in super charged pinball counterpart.

[54:50] Spy Hunter pinball provides twice the espionage excitement with a double arsenal of two built

[54:55] in game options.

[54:56] Ooh top secret Spy Hunter code that you switch style play from random bonus feature to

[55:02] skill with a flick of a switch.

[55:04] You can add suspense and heightened the challenge of Spy Hunter's basic gameplay to extend player

[55:10] interest.

[55:11] Whether players track down bonus points with a random or skill play feature the challenge

[55:16] is thrilling.

[55:17] The stakes are high.

[55:18] The pace is deadly.

[55:19] I'm going to go out on a limb here Ron.

[55:22] I'm going to say I don't think Reeman merchant is going to revolutionize the code here.

[55:30] He's banging out a new pinball machine every like three months.

[55:34] I think they're over promising on the excitement of this pinball code.

[55:39] I like on this game how the back glass and the side are the same.

[55:43] It is cool art on on the back glass though.

[55:46] It's like a jet and a car and a motorcycle and a boat and a rocket and a gorgeous spy man

[55:53] and a beautiful woman.

[55:55] It's a cool back glass.

[55:56] The play field falls apart.

[56:00] It's interesting.

[56:01] I'll say that.

[56:02] They really threw a lot at it.

[56:04] You can tell I think that they had a hot property and they said let's give it a little

[56:08] extra.

[56:09] Maybe it's gold wings.

[56:11] It does remind me of gold.

[56:12] The main flippers are way over to the right.

[56:14] Got leave gold wing from the 1980 B era in the late 80s.

[56:22] It is really unusual.

[56:24] It's got the flippers are offset.

[56:26] It's got a whole almost like mini game on the left side with the out lanes and everything.

[56:32] They do try to tie things to the video game.

[56:34] It's got smoke screens, oil slicks.

[56:37] That stuff.

[56:38] I haven't played one.

[56:39] Yes.

[56:40] Thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs in a minute.

[56:41] It plays as weird as it looks.

[56:44] And you're all about gameplay, right?

[56:46] That is your first tier.

[56:47] It's got to pass the gameplay tier before it goes anywhere else.

[56:50] This is too weird.

[56:51] Too weird.

[56:52] It's almost got like a bag of towel on the left side.

[56:54] And I actually don't, I like gold wings.

[56:57] Oh, and that's weird, but this is like too weird.

[56:59] It's tough to describe.

[57:01] You got to look it up.

[57:02] Yes, so, is it right?

[57:03] No, the other games like this one.

[57:05] Let's put it that way.

[57:06] Yeah, the closest is gold wings.

[57:08] But it's pretty bad when an ADB with an unusual layout is the better design.

[57:16] The stress at Bali Midway was starting to add up.

[57:20] During this time, the young George Gomez was not happy at Midway.

[57:25] He was over in the arcade and video game division, but he was calling around looking for work

[57:30] in other places.

[57:32] And we would know that he would end up at Marvin Glass, which is a think tank in the

[57:38] Chicago area where they came up with legendary board games and children's toys.

[57:45] Gomez would say, every 30 days my boss would call me and his office and say, listen, you

[57:49] got to find X amount of dollars in your budget, which basically meant I had to lay off some

[57:53] people.

[57:54] Then the layoff would happen and we'd have a pizza party.

[57:57] Let's rally everybody and we're back in it.

[57:59] After you do that three or four times, it starts getting old.

[58:02] So the stress adds up.

[58:04] You can't keep doing that.

[58:06] There's only so many pizzas that you can give people to rally the troops.

[58:11] And people are like, you used that quote already.

[58:13] Yes, we did in the George Gomez episode.

[58:15] I think we've used it probably like a bunch of times, but it's very telling about the

[58:21] atmosphere at Bali at that time.

[58:24] The next game was hot shots.

[58:27] Now this only had six units.

[58:29] It was not actually released.

[58:31] It was a billiard game.

[58:32] This is in 1985.

[58:34] But the reason I bring it up is that it was designed by a new individual called Dan Langley.

[58:41] It had the concept art done by Greg Ferris and unknown software.

[58:46] Basically it was an experiment to try to maybe boost sales, strip it down, make it a bit

[58:52] different and unusual.

[58:54] It was almost in a rapid fire cabinet without the back glass.

[58:58] It was really small, wide open play field.

[59:01] And it had like these unusual like full size billiard balls that you would hit with the pinball,

[59:07] which would then fall into a pocket and then pop.

[59:10] It was really weird.

[59:11] It looks almost like exactly like a small billiard table.

[59:15] The game did terrible in test locations.

[59:18] It was it was later brought back as cue ball was there.

[59:21] No, it did so bad on those test locations.

[59:24] It just did diva go any further than that.

[59:27] So this is a game I have played a lot of fire ball classic.

[59:34] My guilty pleasure game.

[59:36] It is a guilty pleasure game.

[59:38] This is the fantasy fire demon theme.

[59:41] This is February of 1985 sells 2000 units designed by George Christiansen.

[59:46] It's basically the exact same design as his original EM 1972 fire ball.

[59:53] It just has added a couple of minor rule changes, some sound, a digital board set instead

[01:00:00] of the sort of the EM boards underneath.

[01:00:04] And it didn't have zipper flippers, which are the flippers that move in and out.

[01:00:08] Yeah, the original one had two inch zipper flippers.

[01:00:10] This just says three inch flippers.

[01:00:12] Yeah.

[01:00:13] It's got great sound.

[01:00:14] I think it's fun.

[01:00:15] It's got great weird sound.

[01:00:18] Very weird.

[01:00:19] It's a wonderful game, not because it's like an epic all time shooter, not because it's

[01:00:26] like the greatest game of all time, but it's just fun and unusual.

[01:00:32] I love the lock stealing.

[01:00:34] The lock stealing is great, right?

[01:00:35] So you lock balls back in this era for multi ball.

[01:00:38] It doesn't auto launch in most games.

[01:00:40] You got to lock it in a thing you drain out.

[01:00:42] Well, the next person can release that.

[01:00:44] Yep.

[01:00:45] What about the marketing on this?

[01:00:46] This is a good one.

[01:00:47] Got the game on the bottom.

[01:00:49] Really small, really tiny, beautiful art, but it has a gentleman in a tuxedo with a flaming

[01:00:55] ball on a like a like a silver platter.

[01:00:58] It is a silver platter.

[01:01:00] Fireball classic.

[01:01:02] What's new and improved on the Balli Midway menu?

[01:01:05] Just the thing to satisfy those pinball cravings.

[01:01:09] Fireball combines all the award-winning ingredients that have made it an authentic classic with

[01:01:14] a few tasty new touches to spice up the action from fresh graphics to a subtle spark

[01:01:20] of play field garnishes.

[01:01:22] Once again, Balli Midway is serving up excitement with its most sizzling pinball creation.

[01:01:27] Get them while they're hot.

[01:01:28] Man, these are weird.

[01:01:30] They are weird.

[01:01:31] They are really weird ways to, uh, it's red hot.

[01:01:36] It's red.

[01:01:37] It's red hot, Ron.

[01:01:38] It's red hot.

[01:01:39] And, you know, look this one up.

[01:01:41] It's got a beautiful skill shot and interesting skill shot mechanic in the back.

[01:01:45] Same as the original Fireball.

[01:01:46] Same as the original.

[01:01:47] No inlays.

[01:01:48] So, it is, uh, you've got your flippers are more or less mounted directly to the slingshot.

[01:01:55] So to cradle up that ball and to stop the ball movement is really hard.

[01:01:59] But in addition, it has a really grippy, spinny pad in the middle of the play field which

[01:02:04] makes playing this game hell.

[01:02:06] Spinning disc.

[01:02:07] It's great.

[01:02:08] Great game.

[01:02:09] Great game.

[01:02:10] Hell worth your quarters if you ever see it.

[01:02:13] Tons of fun.

[01:02:14] And hopefully you don't play it in a tournament against a really good player because they won't

[01:02:17] lock anything.

[01:02:18] They're no fun.

[01:02:19] Yeah, they're the, the devil.

[01:02:22] It has been reported, this is on IPDP, that there was a mixture of a bunch of different

[01:02:28] board sets with this game.

[01:02:31] So there's the 6,800 and the 6,800, uh, 6,800, oh two board set.

[01:02:36] Instead of the, the normal slash 35, sounds like they ran out of them.

[01:02:40] Yeah.

[01:02:41] So here's a great quote from Alan Resman, who is the engineer lab supervisor in Valley

[01:02:46] from 1977 to 83.

[01:02:49] Alan says, I remember discussing this with Doug McDonald when the 35 board was revised.

[01:02:55] That was like the dash 35 board was what they used through most of the early 80s, late

[01:03:01] 70s.

[01:03:02] The original 6,800 based MPUs developed in the mid 70s.

[01:03:05] After 10 years, some of the key components, including the MC 6,800 chip itself were becoming

[01:03:09] hard to obtain or discontinued.

[01:03:12] I had left Valley at the time, but over coffee one morning, Doug told me they went to place

[01:03:16] orders for upcoming production and were surprised when some chips were no longer available.

[01:03:20] They wound up starting production with the dash 35 boards until the components were

[01:03:24] exhausted, then put the 6,800 to board into production as a direct replacement as needed.

[01:03:29] Oh, so we're running into parts issues here.

[01:03:31] The slow down in the coin op industry started to have a lot of far reaching issues.

[01:03:37] Well, plus the fact that the stuff was old, it was old at that time.

[01:03:41] If you're cut and cost, you are not going to want to build a new board set and to continue

[01:03:45] to innovate.

[01:03:47] Over at Williams, that's inevitably what they would do is they kept reiterating and

[01:03:51] updating their board sets until they got to the system 11 system, which really was a

[01:03:56] rocket ship, but they were making minor changes.

[01:03:59] Over at Valley, they didn't want to make any changes at all of these boards, but the

[01:04:03] chips were now being produced at a lower rate and the stockpiles that they had built up

[01:04:08] were starting to dwindle.

[01:04:10] That huge expansion in the 80s wasn't happening anymore.

[01:04:13] Alan Reisman says, when pinball production was in its heyday in the late 70s, Midway

[01:04:17] placed a huge order for components like displays and chips.

[01:04:21] After production died down in the early 80s, it was thought they had a lifetime supply

[01:04:24] of some things like six inch displays.

[01:04:26] It was thought the new technology platform were to place the original board set before

[01:04:30] the chips ran out, but apparently not all the chips were available by the end.

[01:04:34] Now there's no design credit on the remake of Fireball, but they've remade a few games

[01:04:41] now and they've given zero design credit to guys like George Christian, which if you're

[01:04:47] cracking out an all time classic amazing design, don't you want to throw them a bone?

[01:04:53] They were doing that over at Stern.

[01:04:56] Well George Gomez, well, Stern was out of business by this point, but which is the reason

[01:05:01] they are at a business is because they put design credits on.

[01:05:04] No, that's the reason.

[01:05:05] George Gomez said Midway in the 80s was run by manufacturing guys, guys that came from

[01:05:10] the factory side of the world.

[01:05:12] They were not real keen on giving designers credit.

[01:05:15] I think they were very concerned that we would become rock stars or something.

[01:05:18] They were very touchy about design credit.

[01:05:21] So you do what Gomez did when you design a joystick, you just have your initials put

[01:05:25] in the artwork on the joystick.

[01:05:28] You just secretly hide it for later on.

[01:05:30] GG.

[01:05:31] So people who are doing podcasts in the future can tell those amazing.

[01:05:35] That's the whole reason they did it.

[01:05:37] Didn't even know it was coming.

[01:05:38] That's how good George Gomez is.

[01:05:40] Or you're like really tight with the artist and he just puts initials in the back glass,

[01:05:44] hides them somewhere for you.

[01:05:46] Exactly.

[01:05:47] Cybernaught was the next theme.

[01:05:48] This is a sci-fi theme of May of 1985.

[01:05:52] So we've got a bit of a delay here when it comes to releasing games.

[01:05:56] It sells 900 units.

[01:05:58] This is not good.

[01:06:00] Designed by Greg Kamek and Art by Doug Watson.

[01:06:03] No software credit on this one.

[01:06:06] When I look at this pinball machine called cybernaught, I see a reverse Xenon.

[01:06:12] Do you?

[01:06:13] Uh.

[01:06:14] With a third flipper.

[01:06:15] Let me see if I get a better picture of the entire play field.

[01:06:19] It's got that weird thing in the upper right if I remember.

[01:06:21] Yeah.

[01:06:22] It's got the shot into the tube down the ramp into the capture hole.

[01:06:27] Yes.

[01:06:28] That part is a reverse Xenon.

[01:06:29] Nothing else is Xenon.

[01:06:31] But it's got the top there.

[01:06:34] It's got the sols or lowvers.

[01:06:37] But it's got a whole different section with a grid that goes up.

[01:06:41] That goes up by the way.

[01:06:43] That's not flat.

[01:06:44] Oh, very cool.

[01:06:45] Yeah.

[01:06:46] Think, what's the daddy's game?

[01:06:48] Is it Phantom of the Opera?

[01:06:49] Yes.

[01:06:50] I'm going to go up.

[01:06:51] That's what that reminds me of.

[01:06:52] Super cool.

[01:06:53] It's a neat, it's a neat looking design.

[01:06:56] We haven't got quite into the whole quote unquote flow era, right?

[01:07:00] Where you're shooting in the ball is smoothly coming back to the flippers.

[01:07:04] It's we're still in the era of you're shooting it up there and doing stuff.

[01:07:07] The art is neat.

[01:07:10] You know, I'm a sucker for sci-fi stuff.

[01:07:12] So it's pretty cool.

[01:07:13] It's not Xenon though.

[01:07:15] Let's put it that way, right?

[01:07:16] Have you seen one of these?

[01:07:17] Of course I have.

[01:07:19] Oh, really?

[01:07:20] What do you think of that backlash?

[01:07:22] It's good backlash.

[01:07:24] What do you describe what you see there?

[01:07:25] Pain is a word picture.

[01:07:26] It's a woman who's obviously partners with some robot.

[01:07:30] Yeah, they both got guns.

[01:07:32] Yep.

[01:07:33] She's got her protective space thigh highs on.

[01:07:36] Yep.

[01:07:37] The robot's cool.

[01:07:38] It's got a really neat design.

[01:07:40] It's very like fish like.

[01:07:42] It's got abs.

[01:07:43] It's got lots of abs.

[01:07:44] It's cool.

[01:07:45] It's weird, but it's cool.

[01:07:47] Yeah.

[01:07:48] It's got 900 units.

[01:07:49] It doesn't play particularly well.

[01:07:51] That's probably why.

[01:07:52] Not a huge fan.

[01:07:54] Now, this had three different board sets.

[01:07:56] It had the 6,800, the 6,802, and the 6,803.

[01:08:01] They only have 900 units and they use three different board

[01:08:04] sets.

[01:08:04] This game was also produced by a company

[01:08:07] called Bally Wolf, W-U-L-F-F-Vulph.

[01:08:12] I think that's how you say it with the German accent.

[01:08:14] Yeah, that sounds German to me.

[01:08:16] He's the German verb.

[01:08:18] Well, it's Bally Wolf.

[01:08:19] Yeah.

[01:08:20] And Bally Wolf was a whole other thing.

[01:08:27] So I've got some interesting information on Bally Wolf.

[01:08:32] Try to read this one.

[01:08:33] You can read this one.

[01:08:34] Oh, God.

[01:08:35] Gunter Wolf.

[01:08:36] I have no idea what that last word is.

[01:08:38] Apparatus, which I think is apparatus in German.

[01:08:41] Ah, so I'll just say Gunter Wolf.

[01:08:43] Company was found in a 1950 in Berlin, Germany

[01:08:46] as a manufacturer.

[01:08:47] In 1972, the US Slot Machine and Pinball Manufacturer Bally

[01:08:50] took over the company, which from then on operated

[01:08:53] under the name of Bally Wolf as the German office for Bally.

[01:08:57] By 1985, they began manufacturing Bally games in Europe

[01:09:00] to reduce costs.

[01:09:02] Bally separated from the company in 1991.

[01:09:05] And Bally Wolf, well, it's probably not Bally Wolf.

[01:09:08] It's just Wolf.

[01:09:09] It's still in operation today.

[01:09:11] It actually is still Bally Wolf.

[01:09:14] It is still using that name today, which is super unusual.

[01:09:17] And they're like a small time manufacturer there.

[01:09:20] I think they are about to be bought out

[01:09:22] or in the midst of something.

[01:09:23] I was able to find an interesting quote from Norm Clark

[01:09:27] from his original conversation with Clay Herald

[01:09:31] over on Topcast.

[01:09:33] Now, Norm Clark in the early 2000s was suffering

[01:09:37] after a stroke.

[01:09:39] So his speech was very much impacted in this conversation.

[01:09:43] It was tough to pull the quote, but the knowledge

[01:09:48] that this man still had at that time and the insight

[01:09:51] that he had was wonderful.

[01:09:54] Who was Norm Clark?

[01:09:55] He was president of Bally from 1975 to 1985.

[01:09:59] And Norm says, well, the supplier of ours had come to me

[01:10:02] and said they were considering starting

[01:10:03] up a pinball department.

[01:10:05] Of course, pinball companies had their own designers.

[01:10:07] We were tempted to help a company in Europe

[01:10:09] to design games they wanted to get over there.

[01:10:11] But our price wasn't what they wanted to pay.

[01:10:14] Yeah, they were trying to find ways

[01:10:16] to make their dollar go further and they were still

[01:10:19] at this time deep in the German market.

[01:10:23] With all the cutting and all the corporate changes,

[01:10:26] the pressure, Norm Clark would leave Bally in 1985.

[01:10:31] But not, but it was this game, a game that Ron,

[01:10:36] I can't believe you don't have in your collection,

[01:10:40] eight ball champ, which lit the world on fire.

[01:10:43] It has one of those really bad cabinets.

[01:10:44] That's probably why.

[01:10:45] There. So now we're finally getting into the cardboard cabinets.

[01:10:50] Yeah, this is eight ball champ.

[01:10:52] The third of the eight ball series,

[01:10:55] you have eight ball, eight ball deluxe, and eight ball champ.

[01:10:58] In my opinion, the best of the eight ball series,

[01:11:00] which no one agrees with, but I don't care.

[01:11:02] Wow, this is August of 85.

[01:11:04] It sells 1,500 units.

[01:11:05] George Christensen on design, art by Tony Ramoney,

[01:11:08] software again by Raymond Merchant.

[01:11:10] The back glass looks like he had a day to do it.

[01:11:13] It's, it's bad.

[01:11:14] He's done much better.

[01:11:16] He has done much better, but you can tell they're going

[01:11:18] for a really like old, timey billiards game.

[01:11:22] Yeah, old timey, single ball, tight pants,

[01:11:25] but has lots of speech.

[01:11:26] The eight ball guy is back, shock up.

[01:11:28] And I think he gets on your case too,

[01:11:30] if he just don't plunge for a while,

[01:11:32] he starts yelling at you.

[01:11:33] Perfect.

[01:11:33] Shock up excitement in a game of pinball pool.

[01:11:36] Well, actually, pinball pools another game.

[01:11:39] Gottlieb's going to sue you, where the stakes are high

[01:11:41] and winner takes all.

[01:11:42] He's shrewd, scheming, a master at his game.

[01:11:46] He's a cutting pinball hustler taunting anyone

[01:11:48] across this his flashing path.

[01:11:50] This crosses his flight.

[01:11:52] That's literally what it says.

[01:11:53] That's so weird.

[01:11:53] There's only one way to find out if he's bluffing.

[01:11:56] Take on eight ball champ at his own game.

[01:11:59] Balli Midway's newest pinball edition features

[01:12:02] a challenging play field and enhanced sound system.

[01:12:05] Sure to shock up points with players.

[01:12:07] So do you agree with that?

[01:12:08] Well, by enhanced, it sounds like an older balli

[01:12:11] when they sounded good.

[01:12:12] I mean, if that's what they mean by enhanced.

[01:12:14] So why does this game, why is this game the best

[01:12:18] in your opinion of the eight ball games?

[01:12:22] Eight ball deluxe, all the balls are on one side and one bank.

[01:12:25] This forces you to go all over the play field.

[01:12:28] And you have to hit drop, you have to hit standup targets

[01:12:30] behind the drop target to bring it back up again.

[01:12:32] So you can hit it down again.

[01:12:35] It rips off the whole top is ripped off from fathom.

[01:12:38] So they reuse that on a much better game.

[01:12:42] Literally the entire top is fathom.

[01:12:44] It has the same.

[01:12:45] The left, the left orbit goes around into a lock

[01:12:48] down into a gate into the lane.

[01:12:52] It's got the spinners in exact same spot.

[01:12:54] Like literally, it is taken directly from fathom

[01:12:56] except it doesn't have the inline drops up there.

[01:12:59] It just goes directly to a saucer.

[01:13:01] It's got five single drop targets

[01:13:04] with a standup behind it around in basically mimicking

[01:13:08] the six or the five, five of the six pockets in a pool table.

[01:13:14] I said before creating the world under glass

[01:13:17] when it came to sports was difficult,

[01:13:18] but for some reason, this one is beautiful.

[01:13:21] It's got this old, timey kind of look of billiards

[01:13:25] and it nails it.

[01:13:26] It's gorgeous.

[01:13:27] Just a shame it was made in a cardboard.

[01:13:29] I'm a fan.

[01:13:30] Big fan.

[01:13:31] Why don't you have one of these though?

[01:13:32] I just hasn't happened.

[01:13:34] But you know, if I was gonna get a eight ball game,

[01:13:37] this is the one I would get over eight ball deluxe.

[01:13:40] This is the one.

[01:13:41] And generally it's cheaper

[01:13:42] because everyone wants eight ball deluxe,

[01:13:44] class of 81, et cetera.

[01:13:46] But hardly anyone wants this one.

[01:13:48] The next game was beat the clock.

[01:13:50] Ah yes.

[01:13:51] November of 85.

[01:13:52] So we're closer together in production here.

[01:13:55] It only sells 500 units.

[01:13:57] George Christiansen again, Tony Ramuni again,

[01:14:00] software by Raymond Merchant again.

[01:14:03] This game is, I think cooler than it deserves to be.

[01:14:08] It's got a really cool back glass.

[01:14:11] It's got like a Formula One car and a motorcycle

[01:14:14] and a stopwatch and a guy skiing

[01:14:17] and a football player and a bike.

[01:14:20] And you know, it was a fan of this game?

[01:14:21] I'm pretty sure.

[01:14:22] I think a Stern designer Keith L.

[01:14:24] One is a big fan of this game.

[01:14:25] Of beat the clock?

[01:14:26] Beat the clock.

[01:14:27] Wow.

[01:14:28] I think he said once they had this in their office,

[01:14:30] it's Stern weird.

[01:14:32] The stopwatch never lies, my friend.

[01:14:34] And they go all out.

[01:14:35] The thing that will set people off on it

[01:14:38] is the fact that it doesn't have a standard rule set.

[01:14:42] It's time-based.

[01:14:44] It's literally what it says.

[01:14:45] Beat the clock.

[01:14:47] You add time units.

[01:14:49] And when you run out of time, you know,

[01:14:51] you run out of time.

[01:14:52] You've got to beat the clock.

[01:14:54] People generally don't like time-based games

[01:14:56] or anything that does stuff like that.

[01:14:59] I mean, we talked about the James Bond game

[01:15:01] back in our ADB episode, which had a very similar issue.

[01:15:05] You mean the time-based game where Gotley,

[01:15:06] who never ever would have a revised rom,

[01:15:09] had a revised rom to remove that and make it a three ball game?

[01:15:13] It was that bad.

[01:15:14] It went over that bad.

[01:15:15] But they're trying to do something different.

[01:15:18] All the manufacturers are trying to do something different.

[01:15:21] With the exception of Williams,

[01:15:22] who just doubles down on doing what works.

[01:15:24] I'm trying to remember,

[01:15:25] I don't think it kills the flippers or anything

[01:15:26] when you run out of time.

[01:15:27] If I remember, I think it's just like

[01:15:29] when you drain after you've run out of time, that's it.

[01:15:32] But as long as you have time units, you can just keep playing.

[01:15:35] What about Lady Luck?

[01:15:36] This is the next one in March of 86.

[01:15:38] So we've gone from November of 85 with 500 units

[01:15:42] all the way till March with a game that does another 500 units.

[01:15:48] George Christensen, Art by Greg Ferris,

[01:15:50] Software by Raymond Merchant.

[01:15:54] Lady Luck.

[01:15:55] This one I had never heard of

[01:15:57] until I had done this research.

[01:15:58] Oh, really?

[01:15:59] It's...

[01:16:00] I don't know why.

[01:16:01] The backlash seems familiar,

[01:16:03] but I don't remember this game at all.

[01:16:06] It's got, we're getting to the point now where the cabinets

[01:16:09] just say Bally Midway on them.

[01:16:11] Where we're saving money there.

[01:16:12] It's the same cabinet we're just throwing

[01:16:14] at different playfielders.

[01:16:15] Yes.

[01:16:16] This one, this is a do the thing game if I remember.

[01:16:19] It has like a 10X scoring thing, I think.

[01:16:23] Yeah, it's got...

[01:16:24] Yeah, the insert in the middle playfield.

[01:16:26] You've got to do a series of things to get the 10X scoring.

[01:16:30] And then you...

[01:16:31] It's something like you increase the value of the spinner.

[01:16:33] You get the 10X scoring going

[01:16:35] and then you hit the spinner

[01:16:36] and you get obscene points, like just instantly.

[01:16:40] Like if you get it going, it's easy to turn over.

[01:16:42] And it has multiplier targets right in the middle,

[01:16:45] as opposed to the standard sort of Bally Midway inline drops.

[01:16:51] It's got them left to right.

[01:16:53] And it has a very similar lower playfield to A-ball champ,

[01:16:57] except it doesn't have the drop targets

[01:16:59] in front of the stand-up targets.

[01:17:01] Yeah, I'm trying to remember the exact pattern.

[01:17:03] It's something like maybe the captive ball

[01:17:05] increases the spinner value.

[01:17:07] Then you got to complete something once.

[01:17:08] Then there's a star.

[01:17:09] You got to hit the star.

[01:17:11] And then you get 10X scoring for a brief period of time.

[01:17:14] And then you hit the spinner.

[01:17:16] 500 units after waiting from November to March.

[01:17:20] That's got to be pretty disappointing though.

[01:17:22] Well, it has winning features

[01:17:24] that will have your players dealing themselves in again and again.

[01:17:27] I like when I actually remember something's correctly.

[01:17:30] It says hitting the trapped ball, that's the captive ball,

[01:17:33] increases the spinner value,

[01:17:34] shooting the ball through the star roll over scores

[01:17:37] and increases the lane value,

[01:17:39] completing poker increases the value of the bonus multiplier,

[01:17:43] where's the thing where it says get 10X?

[01:17:46] You need countdown features activated,

[01:17:47] hitting both flashing star targets

[01:17:50] while the timer's running and all drop targets are down.

[01:17:53] Yeah, so you got to hit all the drop targets down

[01:17:55] and you hit the stars and then all play field target values

[01:17:59] are multiplied 10 times for a brief period.

[01:18:04] That is quite the thing, Ron.

[01:18:05] That's a lot of thing.

[01:18:06] It's a lot of thing.

[01:18:07] And it's still got the cool like bally sound stuff going on.

[01:18:10] We are in a bit of a death spiral here.

[01:18:14] You can see in 1985.

[01:18:17] Well, for them anyway, meanwhile Williams

[01:18:19] is they're coming out with games like high speed.

[01:18:23] Well, that's where the money's going, right?

[01:18:25] You know, capital or money, it moves

[01:18:28] and it goes where it has to go.

[01:18:30] And you can see through 1984,

[01:18:33] we're still selling 25 hundred units per game, right?

[01:18:36] Like that's still a pretty good measure of sales.

[01:18:41] But now when you've got things like F14 or high speed

[01:18:44] or any of those games, the money has moved.

[01:18:46] There's the same amount of money

[01:18:48] is just moving somewhere else.

[01:18:49] And you can see by the sales of something like high speed,

[01:18:53] the number that they hit with that.

[01:18:54] It's a big change.

[01:18:56] So there's a different design philosophy here

[01:18:59] at bally midway rather than innovating

[01:19:04] and trying to come up with something new and fancy.

[01:19:07] They're gonna go all in on wild designs

[01:19:10] to get some attention.

[01:19:11] And that's where they first won Black Belt of June of 1986.

[01:19:16] It's 600 units, not a good seller.

[01:19:19] It's designed by Dan Langellois.

[01:19:21] Remember, he made that weird billiard game for test.

[01:19:25] Art by Greg Ferres, sound by Michael Bartlow

[01:19:29] and software by Raymond Merchant and Howard Shree.

[01:19:32] So he's at least got some help on this game.

[01:19:36] Let's, let me bring up an image of this one here.

[01:19:39] Ron, and I want you to give me your first impression

[01:19:43] when you see this.

[01:19:44] I've seen it.

[01:19:45] What is going on on the top of this play field?

[01:19:48] It's got a flipper on the upper right

[01:19:51] that actually you hit like the opposite.

[01:19:53] You hit it, it's weird.

[01:19:55] It's coming towards the play.

[01:19:57] Yes.

[01:19:57] You shoot the ball towards the play

[01:19:59] instead of up the play field.

[01:20:01] This is way up in the top corner.

[01:20:03] So it's not like it's going to come at you.

[01:20:04] But it goes up a ramp and then around what is going on?

[01:20:10] It is really, really weird.

[01:20:12] And let's talk about in the middle of the play field

[01:20:16] with this like, what is he like a sensei

[01:20:19] or a fighting ninja Black Belt guy?

[01:20:22] You shoot him right in the nads.

[01:20:24] Pretty much yes.

[01:20:25] So his legs are open and their stand-up targets

[01:20:28] on one leg stand-up targets on the other leg.

[01:20:31] And then there's like a saucer kind of in between his legs.

[01:20:35] Like what?

[01:20:36] What were they thinking?

[01:20:38] It just is silly.

[01:20:40] Yeah, I played this.

[01:20:41] This was at the New York City pinball championships.

[01:20:43] This was one of the games.

[01:20:44] I got to play this a lot.

[01:20:45] Is it fun?

[01:20:47] I got into it after a while trying to do.

[01:20:49] It's, it was like do the thing,

[01:20:51] which I can't, I already forgot what the thing is.

[01:20:53] That's probably why my tournament skills and the best.

[01:20:56] But I just remember playing it over and over

[01:20:59] trying to do the thing.

[01:21:00] So it interested me enough to do that.

[01:21:02] And you know, this is the next trend.

[01:21:04] Trademarked.

[01:21:05] This is their branding at the time was the next trend.

[01:21:08] Yeah.

[01:21:09] TNT exploding from 54 years of pinball leadership.

[01:21:15] But it's not the same company anymore, right?

[01:21:16] Like 1932 to 1983.

[01:21:19] It's no longer Balli Manufacturing Company.

[01:21:22] It's Balli Midway Manufacturing.

[01:21:24] It's the easiest and best diagnostics package.

[01:21:26] It permits manual feed, freeze testing,

[01:21:30] factory installed Mylar on key wear points.

[01:21:34] Built in play field inclination.

[01:21:38] Interesting.

[01:21:38] Now we're at 6803's now.

[01:21:40] So we have the wonderful number pad.

[01:21:42] Oh, this is, this is, we're in, we're in deep now.

[01:21:45] We're into a wacky play field.

[01:21:48] We're into a terrible set of boards.

[01:21:52] They're not suit.

[01:21:53] The, the number pad is terrible.

[01:21:55] If that number pad gets broken, you're doing, yeah,

[01:21:58] get another one.

[01:21:58] Yeah, get a, aftermarket one.

[01:22:00] Basically what we're talking about is the 6803 board set.

[01:22:03] They had a number pad.

[01:22:05] So use the number pad to like get it, change settings and stuff.

[01:22:08] It's like if you went and you bought one of those LED strips

[01:22:11] off of Amazon or AliExpress and it comes with those weird

[01:22:15] plastic button controls.

[01:22:17] Yeah, just think that this, you have this pad,

[01:22:20] but if you lose this pad, you can't change any settings

[01:22:23] on your game.

[01:22:24] You're done, that's it.

[01:22:25] So, but what it did give you the ability to do is it could,

[01:22:28] if I remember, it, it could control way more lights

[01:22:32] than their old system did.

[01:22:34] So they took advantage of that.

[01:22:35] A lot of these games of this era were getting to the mid late 80s.

[01:22:38] Have a ton of lights, ton of controlled lights.

[01:22:42] Yeah, they, they went with a lot of sizzle and less steak.

[01:22:46] Now this game had some changes for Europe.

[01:22:48] So remember we had mentioned that Europe

[01:22:50] has a really big market for pinball.

[01:22:52] So it was produced in Bali, Midway,

[01:22:55] but it was called Karate fight.

[01:22:57] Artist Greg Ferres had to change the name on the back glass

[01:23:00] from Black Belt to Karate fight

[01:23:02] at the request of the European distributor.

[01:23:05] Ferres didn't recall the specific reason the distributor

[01:23:09] had asked for the name change.

[01:23:11] Although Zachariah in 1986 had Black Belt

[01:23:16] and that was released a few months prior.

[01:23:18] So maybe it was to avoid confusion of the branding.

[01:23:22] We would also, an IPDB,

[01:23:24] presumes that there's about 600 or so games

[01:23:27] included in the run that had Karate fight back glasses

[01:23:31] rather than Black Belt.

[01:23:33] And I've never seen one.

[01:23:34] Yeah, they would likely all be in Europe.

[01:23:36] This was also Bali's first game with self-percentaging.

[01:23:42] Yeah, they were behind there.

[01:23:43] High speed already.

[01:23:44] High speed already had, not way behind.

[01:23:46] Maybe because that's kind of a lot of time.

[01:23:48] No, no.

[01:23:49] Oh, I guess we're in 85 now.

[01:23:51] No, we're in 86 now.

[01:23:52] Well, yeah, that's right.

[01:23:54] So it probably was right after Williams,

[01:23:57] but Williams did have it first in high speed.

[01:23:59] But what is self-percentaging?

[01:24:01] What does that mean?

[01:24:02] I have no idea.

[01:24:03] Before you had self-percentaging,

[01:24:06] the operator would set what score you needed

[01:24:09] to get a high score.

[01:24:10] And that was it.

[01:24:11] It was a fixed score.

[01:24:13] So if you put it on a location where a bunch of good players

[01:24:15] could get free games all over the place.

[01:24:17] And then if you cranked it up high,

[01:24:19] then none of the lesser players would ever get a free game.

[01:24:21] And they would get pissed.

[01:24:23] So with high speed, they created the auto-percentaging,

[01:24:29] or Bali calls it self-percentaging,

[01:24:31] where you put it out and it will change the high score needed

[01:24:35] to get a replay depending on how many times it gets hit.

[01:24:38] You don't want to be given away things for free,

[01:24:40] but you want that carrot to be there, right?

[01:24:42] Yes.

[01:24:42] You just want to keep moving that carrot slightly further.

[01:24:45] Operators were concerned this was like one of the biggest

[01:24:49] new features that came around 86

[01:24:51] was the ability to do this.

[01:24:53] Wow.

[01:24:54] OK.

[01:24:55] As players, we probably like some of the other features.

[01:24:57] Operators, they were live in that feature.

[01:24:59] Well, they wanted to, you know, pit mall machines

[01:25:01] are designed to make money.

[01:25:03] They are.

[01:25:03] Unless they're made for the home like now.

[01:25:05] Yeah.

[01:25:06] Raymond Merchant would tell IPDB that Howard Sheer

[01:25:09] took over the software programming

[01:25:11] because Raymond went on to another project.

[01:25:14] That project would be Motor Dome.

[01:25:17] Motor Dome.

[01:25:19] I don't think that's how that goes.

[01:25:20] Oh, there was another game called Motor Show.

[01:25:24] I remember it was Motor Dome.

[01:25:25] Motor Show.

[01:25:26] Really?

[01:25:27] Yeah.

[01:25:27] Motor Show is a bizarre, I think it's a European game.

[01:25:31] It was that like Papa.

[01:25:33] That's the only one I've ever seen.

[01:25:35] Motor Dome is June of 86.

[01:25:37] It sells 2,000 units.

[01:25:39] So oh my goodness, we finally have something going on here.

[01:25:41] Greg Kamek on design, Tony Ramuni on art, software,

[01:25:45] on Raymond Merchant.

[01:25:46] And this is another sort of, you know,

[01:25:49] wild and interesting play field.

[01:25:51] Something very ungrig Kamek.

[01:25:54] He's out of his comfort zone here.

[01:25:56] The play field does not have a saucer up on the top,

[01:26:01] which must be really, really difficult

[01:26:04] for Greg Kamek to design around.

[01:26:06] But what is going on here?

[01:26:08] We're here to the plastic era.

[01:26:10] We're finally moving into vacuum sealed

[01:26:12] or vacuum created plastic ramps.

[01:26:16] And this thing, what is going on here, Ron?

[01:26:21] Yeah.

[01:26:22] And it has the bizarre thing.

[01:26:23] When you start a game, it asks you what level you want.

[01:26:27] Level one, two, or three.

[01:26:29] I don't know.

[01:26:30] And you have to remember to pick three.

[01:26:31] You have to remember to pick three.

[01:26:33] It's something like, it's harder, but everything's worth more.

[01:26:36] If you ever play an tournament, David,

[01:26:38] always pick level three.

[01:26:40] Although I don't know if you'll ever see it in an tournament.

[01:26:43] So this game, they're trying to compete with high speed.

[01:26:47] They're trying to compete with something

[01:26:48] that is completely different in the world of pinball.

[01:26:52] You know, so much plastic.

[01:26:54] What's going on?

[01:26:55] OK, so there's a ramp on the right side.

[01:26:58] There's a drop target.

[01:26:59] You shoot the drop target.

[01:27:00] It goes down.

[01:27:00] Then you go on a long swooping ramp

[01:27:04] that comes up to almost an upper play field

[01:27:08] into a two-inch flipper that then flips the ball back up

[01:27:12] the play field across the ramp, across the top of the pump

[01:27:15] bumpers into a capture hole in the top right corner.

[01:27:20] But if you don't flip that two-inch flipper,

[01:27:24] it rolls back down to the left flipper

[01:27:28] at the bottom of the play field.

[01:27:30] If you brick the shot up the play field,

[01:27:35] it comes back down and crosses to the right flipper.

[01:27:39] It's, oh my god, it is a mess.

[01:27:42] But is it fun?

[01:27:43] Uh, I...

[01:27:46] Because they haven't had ramps, right?

[01:27:47] That ramps have not been a thing.

[01:27:49] They haven't quite figured out swooping ramps.

[01:27:50] They haven't quite figured out flow.

[01:27:52] They're just like, let's throw some ramps

[01:27:53] and see what works.

[01:27:55] I don't know.

[01:27:56] I only played it a few times, and it's foggy.

[01:27:59] Which basically says, ah, and also,

[01:28:02] even though the art on the play field is crazy,

[01:28:04] and that the cabinet we still have the just ballie midway.

[01:28:08] Yep, it's got four flippers.

[01:28:10] It's got that one two-inch flipper on the upper play field.

[01:28:12] It's got a standard flipper down on the bottom.

[01:28:15] But it definitely appears like when you look at this,

[01:28:17] like, ah, they put some more money into this.

[01:28:19] I mean, man, there's way more crap on the play field.

[01:28:22] Yeah, I think you look at it and you go,

[01:28:23] hey, this is kind of cool.

[01:28:24] I think this is kind of fun.

[01:28:25] And then you probably play it and you're like, oh, yeah, well.

[01:28:27] But I betcha, I betcha, it's kind of fun.

[01:28:30] I betcha, it's kind of fun.

[01:28:31] Revolutionary, but I betcha it's fun.

[01:28:32] Moda don't.

[01:28:34] Now, do you know what had come out in 1985

[01:28:38] that I think that they might have ripped off

[01:28:40] for this pinball machine?

[01:28:41] Uh, a Mad Max movie.

[01:28:43] Mad Max Beyond.

[01:28:45] Thunder No Home.

[01:28:46] See, I think I get bad Max Beyond Thunder No.

[01:28:49] Well, they weren't the only ones to do that.

[01:28:51] That's what Road Kings is basically.

[01:28:53] Yeah.

[01:28:54] Road Kings.

[01:28:55] The donor game of the future.

[01:28:56] I love Road Kings.

[01:28:57] I love Road Kings.

[01:28:58] After this, they've also brought in, um,

[01:29:01] Valley, uh, Valley Midway has brought in Dennis Nordman.

[01:29:05] And we, we go that the Dennis Nordman, uh,

[01:29:08] let's talk about your ramps episode back in the archives.

[01:29:10] You can check that out over at silverballcronacles.com

[01:29:14] in the archive.

[01:29:15] We're not going to talk about Special Force,

[01:29:16] but we're getting into vacuum, you know, ramps,

[01:29:19] we're getting into unusual designs

[01:29:21] and we're bringing in fresh blood.

[01:29:24] It's a fun game, right?

[01:29:25] Remember Special Force?

[01:29:26] Yep.

[01:29:26] I remember it.

[01:29:27] It was very green.

[01:29:28] Very green.

[01:29:29] And mountainy.

[01:29:30] Very mountainy.

[01:29:31] Strange science.

[01:29:32] Oh, boy.

[01:29:33] Yeah.

[01:29:34] That's a whole game.

[01:29:35] It's a fantasy science theme.

[01:29:37] It's from June of 1986.

[01:29:39] Uh, this game is a decent seller at 3,000.

[01:29:44] I'm sorry, at 2,350.

[01:29:46] It's designed by Dan Langloy.

[01:29:49] So he's the guy that's doing all the weird designs.

[01:29:52] Greg Freire is on art and software by Howard Sheer.

[01:29:55] Weird science, I think, was that, was that a movie in 85?

[01:29:59] Yep.

[01:30:00] Yeah.

[01:30:00] I think that's the one with, oh, God, who was in that?

[01:30:03] Is that the one with Kelly LeBrock?

[01:30:06] I think so.

[01:30:07] I remember the inventor or whatever.

[01:30:10] Yeah.

[01:30:12] Was it Anthony Michael, oh, God.

[01:30:13] Now I gotta look this up.

[01:30:15] I don't think I've actually seen the movie.

[01:30:16] I just remember, yeah, Anthony Michael Hall,

[01:30:18] Kelly LeBrock, yeah, and any other guy who I don't remember.

[01:30:21] So I don't think I've ever seen it either.

[01:30:23] Whoa, Robert Downey was in that?

[01:30:25] Okay, maybe I'll have to watch that.

[01:30:27] I love Robert Downey Jr.

[01:30:28] But you have not seen Iron Man.

[01:30:31] Oh, no, I've seen Iron Man.

[01:30:32] Really?

[01:30:33] I didn't think you've seen any of those in the movie.

[01:30:34] Nope, I saw Iron Man.

[01:30:35] Iron Man's amazing.

[01:30:37] I had to see it.

[01:30:38] Robert Downey Jr was in it.

[01:30:39] He was in, have you seen the second one?

[01:30:41] I saw the first with Whiplash.

[01:30:43] 15 minutes and that was it.

[01:30:44] And I didn't see the third one.

[01:30:46] The second one was good.

[01:30:47] The third one was decent.

[01:30:48] The second one was awesome.

[01:30:49] So good.

[01:30:50] So strange science.

[01:30:51] It's pretty cool.

[01:30:52] It has a cool neon topper.

[01:30:55] He's looking at pictures of it here on IPDB

[01:30:57] that it got to be like 30 years old.

[01:30:59] Oh my God, they're so,

[01:31:00] and the worst part is the play field is really messy.

[01:31:02] So it's really tough to pick it out.

[01:31:05] Oh, I see.

[01:31:05] I think I find a better picture.

[01:31:07] Ron, talk me through this

[01:31:08] because I've never seen this game.

[01:31:09] Great art, great frarist, great, just killer art.

[01:31:13] Absolutely insane.

[01:31:14] One of his best packages.

[01:31:15] Like I said, it's got the awesome neon topper thing,

[01:31:18] like mad scientist.

[01:31:20] Basically it's a mad scientist theme.

[01:31:22] He's like transferring brains between a monkey and a woman

[01:31:25] or something like that.

[01:31:26] It's on the play field.

[01:31:28] There's like a dude with a guitar for some reason.

[01:31:31] You can kind of see that the art is very the style

[01:31:35] that he'll use later for games like party animal.

[01:31:38] You know, party zone, doctor dude.

[01:31:40] It's that style.

[01:31:42] It's got a crazy lock shot

[01:31:45] with a flipper that hits it up.

[01:31:49] There's really steep short ramp

[01:31:51] that comes up into the Adam smasher.

[01:31:54] It's called, which they would use the Adam smasher

[01:31:57] again on other games.

[01:31:58] I think even I think

[01:32:02] on Keith L. Wentz Archer design,

[01:32:04] he had the Adam smasher in there somewhere.

[01:32:08] It's got extra buttons just to do the lane change,

[01:32:11] which is weird.

[01:32:13] I don't know why they did that.

[01:32:14] Why not, man?

[01:32:15] Just throw anything at the wall.

[01:32:16] It's got cool sound.

[01:32:19] It has a five or six ball multi ball.

[01:32:24] You keep hitting these balls into the Adam smasher

[01:32:27] until you get them all in there

[01:32:28] and it starts multi ball.

[01:32:30] You're also supposed to be able to hit the balls

[01:32:32] while they're in the Adam smasher and get them out.

[01:32:34] But in reality, the flippers are always too weak

[01:32:37] because these are the horrific bally linear flippers

[01:32:39] that suck bad as far as power goes.

[01:32:44] It's a 6803, so it's got all these lights.

[01:32:47] It just got awesome light shows.

[01:32:49] It's shallow play

[01:32:51] because you're just gonna be trying to lock the ball

[01:32:53] and just get the multi ball.

[01:32:54] All you're gonna really do,

[01:32:56] but there's lots of it.

[01:32:57] But it looks so good.

[01:32:58] This is worth it to look it up on ITB, IPDB

[01:33:02] because there's the flyer in there

[01:33:03] and there's like a whole comic book

[01:33:05] that Greg Ferrer has had created about the story behind

[01:33:09] the mad scientist and the woman and the monkey.

[01:33:12] It's well worth it.

[01:33:13] I mean, it's not podcast content

[01:33:15] because it's hard to talk about that.

[01:33:17] But this is a pretty unique game

[01:33:19] and you can see that it has popped a number

[01:33:21] of about 2000 units.

[01:33:22] So that's something to see.

[01:33:24] Now we've brought up Dan Langloy a few times,

[01:33:27] but he is an interesting individual.

[01:33:31] He was brought into ballet midway at this time

[01:33:35] to shake things up.

[01:33:36] He was, you know, he, his specific goal was to just go nuts

[01:33:41] on his play fields and change things up

[01:33:43] and by goodness, he did it.

[01:33:45] But he's really difficult to find any history about.

[01:33:49] I've, I've tried multiple ways

[01:33:51] to get information about Dan Langloy and it is tough.

[01:33:55] Now I did find an article and I've included it

[01:33:58] in the show notes about Stern Video Games Dark Planet

[01:34:03] from 1983.

[01:34:05] He worked with a Dan Langloy worked with a gentleman

[01:34:08] named Eric Erickson with the most lazy parents

[01:34:12] when it came to names I've ever heard.

[01:34:15] Says David Dennis, yes.

[01:34:18] It's basically an asteroid type game.

[01:34:21] Dan also worked on Gilligan's Island

[01:34:25] after his ballet midway tenure

[01:34:27] when he was tragically killed in May of 1991.

[01:34:31] He was struck by a car leaving a bar

[01:34:35] where the game was being tested.

[01:34:37] He died at the age of 33 and we would know

[01:34:41] that word Pemberton would actually be brought back

[01:34:44] on contract to finish up Gilligan's Island.

[01:34:48] So Dan, who I think is one of these unsung,

[01:34:52] unusual folk in Pinball tragically taken to young.

[01:34:57] City Slickers was March of 1987.

[01:35:01] No, it wasn't.

[01:35:02] It was City Slickers.

[01:35:03] I'm sorry, City Slick Er, the one.

[01:35:05] Now this is a train rack sells 300 units,

[01:35:08] which is not great.

[01:35:10] Gangster theme, Greg Kamehk, Art by Pat McMahon,

[01:35:13] Reem and Merchant.

[01:35:14] This was the original name City Slicker

[01:35:17] was the original name for the $6 million man in 1978.

[01:35:22] Yeah, Greg says, back in 1978,

[01:35:24] the designers named the Whitewoods whatever they wanted to.

[01:35:27] And I always liked the name City Slicker.

[01:35:29] I got the name from a 70s contemporary clothing store

[01:35:31] named City Slicker here in Chicago area.

[01:35:34] During the 1970s, the Whitewood names were always changed

[01:35:37] by the marketing department once the game was released

[01:35:39] for artwork, which is interesting.

[01:35:41] Because back then, they didn't really have that.

[01:35:43] They'd do the Whitewood first

[01:35:44] and then just make the art whatever the theme was supposed to be.

[01:35:46] Yeah.

[01:35:47] So the marketing department would be like,

[01:35:48] this game is the $6 million man.

[01:35:50] But by 1987, the industry had changed to the point

[01:35:52] where the theme was decided first.

[01:35:54] And then the Whitewood was designed to the theme.

[01:35:57] I still like the name City Slicker.

[01:35:59] So the theme became a nostalgic,

[01:36:00] roaring 20s bank robbery theme

[01:36:02] with two players shooting it out

[01:36:03] on the play field at the same time.

[01:36:05] I had a new interactive pinball game concept

[01:36:07] I wanted to try out.

[01:36:08] This is inevitably why the game was a bit of a sales flop.

[01:36:12] It was an adventure to basically boost sales.

[01:36:16] The initial concept was there were two sample games

[01:36:19] of City Slicker created that had a six foot cable

[01:36:23] and a switch that was triggered by a second player at the,

[01:36:29] so they were, quote unquote, playing at the same time

[01:36:32] as the first player.

[01:36:34] So the standard bottom flippers on the play field

[01:36:36] were controlled by the player in a normal fashion.

[01:36:39] There were two additional flippers in the upper

[01:36:42] and the middle of the play field that were controlled

[01:36:45] by this opposing player with their cable and their button.

[01:36:50] Hmm, that's just a, so Greg says it was truly

[01:36:52] a shootout feeling.

[01:36:53] It was really interactive.

[01:36:55] But Valley Management changed the game back

[01:36:57] to the standard one player to time sequence

[01:36:59] for the production run.

[01:37:00] That was a big mistake.

[01:37:01] Valley Management removed the attached cable and gun

[01:37:04] and replaced the top left flipper with a thumper bumper,

[01:37:07] which made no sense and had the circuit control

[01:37:10] the middle flipper to shoot the ball towards the two

[01:37:12] lower standard flippers, which made even less sense.

[01:37:15] So the game became muddled.

[01:37:17] So maybe that's why the game sucked.

[01:37:19] When I played it, I'm with us like, wow, this sucks.

[01:37:21] I had no idea that I was supposed

[01:37:22] to have all that other stuff in it.

[01:37:24] Man, we need someone to like retrofit that stuff

[01:37:26] back in to see what it would have played like.

[01:37:28] What it would have been like.

[01:37:29] It probably would have been pretty cool, I think.

[01:37:31] Let's dive into what I think is a pretty unique

[01:37:36] and unusual game, hard body.

[01:37:39] This is a body builder theme from April of 1987.

[01:37:43] It sells 2000 units.

[01:37:44] So again, a pretty good seller designed by Ward Pemberton,

[01:37:49] Art by Pat McMan and Software by Raymond Merchant.

[01:37:52] So Ward is back on contract.

[01:37:56] He was brought back to design this pin,

[01:37:59] but at the same time, because he's not

[01:38:01] at the White Sox anymore, he's working

[01:38:03] as a firefighter in Chicago.

[01:38:05] So this guy, this guy's had one crazy life, man.

[01:38:09] He's designing pinball machines.

[01:38:10] He's playing baseball for the White Sox.

[01:38:12] He's a Chicago firefighter, something else.

[01:38:15] So the theme here, Ron, do you remember Rachel Mclish?

[01:38:19] I do not remember Rachel Mclish, no.

[01:38:21] Neither do I.

[01:38:22] I had to look this up.

[01:38:23] So Rachel Mclish endorsed this pinball machine.

[01:38:27] Well, in 1980, Rachel was the first ever,

[01:38:30] IFBB Miss Olympia contest winner.

[01:38:34] After her 1980 win, no woman appeared on more magazine covers

[01:38:40] for the next five years than Rachel.

[01:38:42] She lost the title in 1981, but then regained it in 1982.

[01:38:48] These breakthrough victories in bodybuilding,

[01:38:50] together with her visual appeal,

[01:38:52] brought women's bodybuilding further attention

[01:38:57] than it had ever had before.

[01:38:59] She never placed lower than third in any contest she entered.

[01:39:04] After she finished second in the 1984,

[01:39:07] IFBB Miss Olympia Mclish retired from competitive bodybuilding.

[01:39:11] She's actually still incredibly active online today

[01:39:15] with various workout programs and a YouTube channel.

[01:39:20] But why the heck would they go with a Miss Olympia pinball?

[01:39:25] Because they have ballet fitness health clubs.

[01:39:28] Oh my goodness.

[01:39:29] Yes, Ward Pepper 10 tells us,

[01:39:30] ballet was in health and fitness clubs now.

[01:39:32] Rachel Mclish signed with the fitness department

[01:39:34] and they wanted to do a pinball machine for that.

[01:39:37] Sure enough, that's what we did.

[01:39:39] We changed BMX a little and made it hard body.

[01:39:42] So there you go.

[01:39:43] You got a machine that didn't really sell very well,

[01:39:45] so we're gonna mix it up and we're gonna make it hard.

[01:39:48] And I don't know so people will like it.

[01:39:50] They prefer this over BMX.

[01:39:52] I think they swapped some of the drop targets out for standups.

[01:39:56] They removed one of the magnets,

[01:39:59] but it's pretty much BMX.

[01:40:01] I have a friend that has one of these.

[01:40:04] I've never been to his place to play it,

[01:40:06] but he like loves this game.

[01:40:09] Legitimately is like, this is a great game.

[01:40:11] I don't know what people complain about.

[01:40:13] I mean, the theme is a bit weird, bodybuilding and such,

[01:40:16] but he thinks the play field is pretty unique.

[01:40:20] The translate though is screaming 80s.

[01:40:24] It's just photos of Rachel McLeish.

[01:40:26] Yeah, in her various poses and lifting things.

[01:40:30] In its photo realistic, which is not a traditional

[01:40:33] ballet thing that was more of a got-leab thing,

[01:40:36] where it was like a photo translate.

[01:40:38] I mean, it is designed to bring teenage boys into play it,

[01:40:41] right?

[01:40:42] That's kind of what pinball was at this time.

[01:40:45] We still have the generic cabinet art.

[01:40:47] This has the awesome reflex saves.

[01:40:50] You love those, right?

[01:40:51] They are the worst.

[01:40:52] So can you explain that?

[01:40:53] This is a terrible, terrible design idea,

[01:40:56] but please explain this, Rod.

[01:40:57] Picture a situation where there is no inlaying.

[01:41:00] There is an outlaying, and you have to save the ball

[01:41:02] every time it goes there.

[01:41:03] There is a second cabinet, but not each side

[01:41:06] that you push to have a, it,

[01:41:09] there's like a thing that comes up so you can't drain,

[01:41:12] but you have to time it.

[01:41:14] And you only have so many and so much,

[01:41:16] so many times you can do that.

[01:41:18] Depending on the game.

[01:41:19] Before it just, oh, just different,

[01:41:22] like I think BMX, you could just,

[01:41:25] you could only do it.

[01:41:26] You couldn't do it consecutive times within a certain period,

[01:41:30] but you always had them, and you had to do it every time.

[01:41:34] And then I think some later designs they made it,

[01:41:36] so it would do it for you, at least a few times,

[01:41:40] so you didn't like just drain instantly.

[01:41:43] Yeah, and you have to be on the,

[01:41:47] mine the pun here, you have to be on the ball enough

[01:41:49] that when you're going out the outlaying,

[01:41:50] you got to shift your mind to move your hand

[01:41:53] down to the other button to hit it,

[01:41:55] to save your ball from going to the outside,

[01:41:57] because it will always 100% of the time

[01:41:59] drain unless you do something,

[01:42:01] which is, I think a terrible design,

[01:42:03] but a lot of people really like it.

[01:42:05] They think it's really cool.

[01:42:06] Yeah, they did it with BMX.

[01:42:07] It's on this.

[01:42:08] Tensions and dragons, which is going to come up soon.

[01:42:10] Those are the ones I can think of,

[01:42:11] all word Pemberton games.

[01:42:13] The, it has an upper play field,

[01:42:15] which is not a bally staple,

[01:42:18] and in that upper play field,

[01:42:19] you're basically shooting stand up targets,

[01:42:21] drop targets, in line drop targets,

[01:42:23] and those are like workout stations, right?

[01:42:27] Like you're working chest in one area,

[01:42:29] you're working arms in another area.

[01:42:31] I have been to a gym in a long time,

[01:42:33] so I assume that's what you do in a gym.

[01:42:35] So then we come into party animal.

[01:42:37] We talked about that in our Dennis Nordman episode as well.

[01:42:39] Amazing art on that one.

[01:42:41] There's not much more else we can talk about.

[01:42:43] How amazing that is,

[01:42:44] but the one we're going to jump into next

[01:42:46] is heavy metal meltdown.

[01:42:48] This is the heavy metal music theme,

[01:42:50] August of 87,

[01:42:52] 1600 units designed by Dan Langloy,

[01:42:55] art by Tony Ramuni,

[01:42:58] software by Raymond Merchant,

[01:42:59] because like literally this is all he does is code.

[01:43:02] He must be completely insane.

[01:43:03] This is the only,

[01:43:05] there's the only music in this game

[01:43:07] is a drum track and a bass line.

[01:43:10] While the player is left to fill in the lead guitar riff

[01:43:14] by hitting shots,

[01:43:15] every switch triggers part of the riff.

[01:43:18] The duration of the ball sounds

[01:43:20] extends the guitar solo.

[01:43:22] It's as awesome as it sounds.

[01:43:24] I don't know if it is.

[01:43:26] 100%.

[01:43:27] Is it?

[01:43:27] You start the game,

[01:43:28] and the first thing it says is heavy metal meltdown.

[01:43:33] And then it's got extra buttons on the side.

[01:43:35] And when you hit them,

[01:43:35] it'll say heavy, heavy,

[01:43:37] metal, metal, heavy, heavy.

[01:43:39] That's, that does sound good.

[01:43:40] It has a huge boom box topper.

[01:43:44] Yeah, so the back in the 80s,

[01:43:45] you all had to have a sweet stereo.

[01:43:48] And the cabinet is total crap.

[01:43:51] It's horrible.

[01:43:52] So I've seen these with the topper,

[01:43:54] like, is weighing down the back box.

[01:43:57] It's like drooping.

[01:43:58] It's because it's fiberboard.

[01:44:00] It's like glued together fiberboard.

[01:44:02] If you look at it, look what's on the cabinet.

[01:44:04] Ah!

[01:44:04] Arts!

[01:44:05] It doesn't say just ballet midway.

[01:44:07] It actually says heavy metal meltdown.

[01:44:09] And it is really cool art.

[01:44:11] Like, we're getting better.

[01:44:13] You're right.

[01:44:14] We talked about rock,

[01:44:15] which was a rock game, obviously.

[01:44:18] From the system 80 era over at Gottlieb,

[01:44:21] and they did the photo realistic 80s thing.

[01:44:24] Well, this is similar, but it just is cooler,

[01:44:27] because of the art.

[01:44:28] The art is beautiful.

[01:44:30] Now, the gameplay on this is somewhat shallow.

[01:44:33] There is a ramp,

[01:44:34] and that's what you try to do is hit the ramp.

[01:44:37] That's all you try to do is hit the ramp.

[01:44:39] People love ramps,

[01:44:41] where you lock the balls,

[01:44:43] and you start multi-ball, repeat.

[01:44:45] It has the Adam's Masha,

[01:44:47] from strange science.

[01:44:49] They brought it back.

[01:44:51] I don't think they call it an Adam's Masha,

[01:44:52] I don't remember what they call it,

[01:44:53] but it literally is the same thing.

[01:44:54] That's what the balls get locked into.

[01:44:56] The power amp.

[01:44:57] Power amp.

[01:44:58] Yup.

[01:44:59] And it's the same thing.

[01:45:00] You should be able to hit the ball in front,

[01:45:01] knock it out, but that never works.

[01:45:02] But, yeah, I'm a fan.

[01:45:05] I used to play this at a pop-up back in the day.

[01:45:08] He just tried to hit the ramp,

[01:45:10] and start multi-ball,

[01:45:11] and enjoy the music.

[01:45:13] Heavy metal meltdown!

[01:45:17] One of the things that they are promoting

[01:45:19] in the flyer here is the solid construction

[01:45:25] of the cabinets.

[01:45:27] No.

[01:45:28] Cabnets are rock solid using

[01:45:30] miter joint construction,

[01:45:32] and 65% more plywood.

[01:45:35] No.

[01:45:36] And sizzling graphics to finish off

[01:45:39] the perfect pinball cabinet.

[01:45:41] Lies.

[01:45:42] The house lights go down.

[01:45:43] The crowd cheers,

[01:45:44] and the drummer lays down a backbeat

[01:45:46] that just won't quit.

[01:45:47] You'll pull the plunger.

[01:45:48] The ball screams to the top

[01:45:50] and the stage is set for your first pinball concert experience.

[01:45:54] It's a total concert package.

[01:45:56] Long before Guns n' Roses,

[01:45:59] there was heavy metal meltdown.

[01:46:01] What's cooler than rock n' roll

[01:46:03] and heavy metal music, Ron?

[01:46:05] Crank up your profits.

[01:46:06] That's another one I like down.

[01:46:07] Crank up your profits.

[01:46:09] But you know what?

[01:46:10] You know what, though?

[01:46:11] The next game we're gonna talk about

[01:46:13] has better music,

[01:46:14] even better than heavy metal meltdown.

[01:46:16] Well, I mean, they're the only thing cooler than

[01:46:18] then hard rock and 80s metal

[01:46:21] is Dungeons and Dragons

[01:46:23] from October of 1987.

[01:46:25] This is the fantasy nerd theme 2000 units.

[01:46:29] Ward Pemberton back again on contract

[01:46:32] to do a second game,

[01:46:33] Art by Pat McMan,

[01:46:34] an uncredited software.

[01:46:35] But if I were a gambling man,

[01:46:37] I'd probably say it was Reman Merchant.

[01:46:39] It has, it has even a more insane topper.

[01:46:42] I think that's even taller,

[01:46:44] the dragon topper.

[01:46:45] Might be like the tallest thing ever.

[01:46:47] I mean, other than big guns or something.

[01:46:49] Like when you put the back box,

[01:46:51] the topper extends just out over everything.

[01:46:54] It's ridiculous.

[01:46:56] It has this music that does not match the theme at all.

[01:47:00] You would think Dungeons and Dragons,

[01:47:01] I would think, you know, medieval

[01:47:03] orchestral music,

[01:47:05] that's what I would think.

[01:47:06] No, no.

[01:47:07] It's like the funky soundtrack ever.

[01:47:10] It's so good.

[01:47:11] And the more balls you lock,

[01:47:13] the slower and funnier it gets.

[01:47:16] I used it for my podcast,

[01:47:19] the slam to a podcast.

[01:47:20] We originally used the multi ball theme,

[01:47:25] the multi ball music for our theme music.

[01:47:27] It was so good.

[01:47:29] It has another unusual play field.

[01:47:31] And that again ties back into sort of Ward Pemberton,

[01:47:35] Dan Langloy, all those guys that are like,

[01:47:37] hey, we gotta create weird, unique layouts

[01:47:39] because we have to be different than Williams.

[01:47:41] Then we have to be different than God Leib.

[01:47:44] Ward Pemberton would say that every game

[01:47:46] takes about a year to design.

[01:47:48] That's why they had always different game designers

[01:47:52] in between games.

[01:47:54] Even in the contract,

[01:47:56] it would pretty much state that you had one year

[01:47:59] to do a game.

[01:48:00] And you can see that with that 12 month turnover,

[01:48:04] you're getting a lot of recycling.

[01:48:06] And in this game,

[01:48:07] we are getting those flex save.

[01:48:09] Yeah.

[01:48:11] Flex save.

[01:48:12] We got the carrot flippers.

[01:48:14] There are eighth inch longer.

[01:48:17] So there what, what would that be?

[01:48:18] Three and an eighth inch flippers.

[01:48:20] It has a ramp that leads to the in line drop targets.

[01:48:25] I see only time I've ever seen that.

[01:48:28] Ton of lights, ton of lights.

[01:48:30] So when the fire, the dragon breeze fire,

[01:48:33] it looks really cool because they use like the center

[01:48:36] of the play field is the fire coming down.

[01:48:38] The ball goes in behind the backboard and around

[01:48:40] on the left and right side,

[01:48:42] which is really neat.

[01:48:44] Unconventional pop bumper in the middle of the play field.

[01:48:46] What do you think of the Dungeons and Dragons theme?

[01:48:49] It seems like a good theme for pinball, doesn't it?

[01:48:51] Yeah, sure.

[01:48:52] I've never played it.

[01:48:53] The, that game.

[01:48:55] I played the pinball machine.

[01:48:56] Now the artist, Larry Elmore,

[01:48:59] he threw in his signature in the bottom of the translate,

[01:49:02] which you'll see on a piece of the stone down there.

[01:49:07] So that's a nice little Easter egg in there.

[01:49:09] I have played this game.

[01:49:10] I think it's pretty cool.

[01:49:11] And that's the thing, right?

[01:49:12] Like sometimes I'm like harsh on games,

[01:49:14] but I'm just teasing sometimes.

[01:49:17] So you know, like every pinball is generally good pinball.

[01:49:20] I mean, not even, I mean, except for Halloween.

[01:49:24] But all of them are all pretty great games.

[01:49:26] I'm just joking about that one too.

[01:49:27] Calm down, calm down.

[01:49:29] Don't send your hate mail to me.

[01:49:30] You could send your hate mail to Silverball Chronicles

[01:49:34] at gmail.com.

[01:49:35] And this is an unusual game,

[01:49:36] but I think it works.

[01:49:38] Just don't play it at a show where you can't hear it.

[01:49:40] Although that's probably the only place you'll ever see it.

[01:49:42] But if you can play it somewhere else,

[01:49:44] just tell them to crank up the freaking sound.

[01:49:46] Crank up that music and listen

[01:49:48] and listen to the brilliance.

[01:49:50] So good.

[01:49:51] Blackwater 100 was the Dennis Nordman game after this.

[01:49:55] We talk about that in the Dennis Nordman music.

[01:49:56] Speaking of plastic.

[01:49:58] But we're coming to a watershed moment

[01:50:02] in the pinball industry.

[01:50:04] We are coming to the actual death of Valley Mewa.

[01:50:10] So that's what we're getting into.

[01:50:11] 1989, well, were you aware of Aladdin's castle?

[01:50:15] I've heard of Aladdin's castle.

[01:50:17] I've heard of it, but I didn't know of it back then.

[01:50:19] But a lot of people have a lot of amazing fond memories

[01:50:23] of Aladdin's castle.

[01:50:24] Aladdin's castle was a shopping mall arcade chain

[01:50:27] that began as American amusement

[01:50:28] incorporated in the early 70s.

[01:50:31] It was purchased and renamed Aladdin's castle

[01:50:33] by Valley in 1974.

[01:50:35] The number of store locations grew from 20 in 1974

[01:50:38] to 221 in 1980.

[01:50:40] It was 360 of them when the chain was spun off in 1989.

[01:50:44] Yeah.

[01:50:45] So we had talked about the dwindling of the war chest,

[01:50:48] all of the dumb spending that they had done

[01:50:51] with the video game money.

[01:50:53] They didn't invest it in pinball.

[01:50:54] They didn't invest it in gaming.

[01:50:56] They bought silly things and they expanded silly things.

[01:51:00] Aladdin castle would be one of them.

[01:51:01] But Aladdin's castle was quite smart

[01:51:03] because you're manufacturing the game,

[01:51:05] you're operating the game on location

[01:51:08] and you're buying the game to put on locations.

[01:51:11] Very smart, sort of vertical integration,

[01:51:13] they call it with corporate stuff.

[01:51:16] But by 1989, the Luster was very much off of Valley Midway.

[01:51:22] All the money was now apparently in yachts

[01:51:25] and fitness equipment.

[01:51:28] Another quote here from George Gomez.

[01:51:30] The notion of selling off a land's castle

[01:51:32] and selling off distribution

[01:51:33] when you basically had it going on all ends.

[01:51:36] If you walked into an era where Atari had a hit in asteroids,

[01:51:39] Valley was profiting because Valley was operating the game

[01:51:42] and they were distributing the game.

[01:51:44] It's nice when you have a Valley Midway game like Pac-Man,

[01:51:46] but what about when you don't?

[01:51:48] Well, guess what?

[01:51:48] Sega's got something or view got missile command.

[01:51:52] Guess what, you're distributing and you're operating.

[01:51:54] Who would shoot this golden goose?

[01:51:56] I mean, what kind of idiocy is that?

[01:51:58] So eventually, the Valley Midway executives

[01:52:02] would see this profitable arm

[01:52:04] and they needed to raise money and they would send it out.

[01:52:06] Why would you do that?

[01:52:08] That's terrible.

[01:52:10] Then the big day, the sale of Valley Midway two Williams.

[01:52:17] Wow.

[01:52:18] Pinball's dead, Ron.

[01:52:19] That brings us to the end.

[01:52:20] Pinball is dead.

[01:52:23] The funny thing about that is from the video game side.

[01:52:25] Midway was a much more known name than Williams.

[01:52:30] So even though Williams bought Valley Midway,

[01:52:33] Williams then took the Midway name

[01:52:35] as the name of their video game arm,

[01:52:37] which pissed off most of the employees there.

[01:52:39] It's like, hey, we won.

[01:52:40] We bought them and we're using their name.

[01:52:42] What the hell?

[01:52:43] Midway, the name Midway would stick around well into the 2000s

[01:52:48] until it wasn't around anymore.

[01:52:51] Yeah, George Gomez ended up, he was working there.

[01:52:53] Yeah.

[01:52:54] So I mean, Midway was a powerhouse, right?

[01:52:55] They would eventually under the Valley Williams Midway sort

[01:53:02] of umbrella would come up with the amazing smash hit

[01:53:06] of Mortal Kombat, which I think changed video games

[01:53:09] in quite a unique way.

[01:53:11] Speaking of powerhouses, yeah, Williams, Pinball,

[01:53:15] they now have the Valley name and they would use it.

[01:53:18] Now in the industry, we have Gottlieb Premiere

[01:53:22] with their System 80, 80B, 80C era,

[01:53:27] who is moving into System 3.

[01:53:29] And you've got basically a Valley Williams Midway.

[01:53:34] You got Daddy East, you got Daddy East.

[01:53:36] But those are the three menu manufacturers.

[01:53:38] One of the pillars of early Pinball, 1930s, right?

[01:53:42] Ballyhoo, you know, gone and absorbed

[01:53:46] into their largest competitor.

[01:53:48] Wow, Pinball's dead, Ron, it is.

[01:53:50] Dead, that's not a positive way to end the podcast.

[01:53:55] Well, spin this in a positive way.

[01:53:57] Ah, the Valley name got to live on on really good games.

[01:54:01] They buy Williams.

[01:54:02] Ha, ha, ha.

[01:55:45] Right after that, we get into Speak Easy 4.

[01:55:48] Oh, hold on.

[01:55:49] I don't think it's called Speak Easy 4.

[01:55:52] That's what it said on IPDB.

[01:55:53] That's what it said.

[01:55:54] I've heard of Speak Easy.

[01:55:55] I've never heard Speak Easy 4.

[01:55:57] IPDB right now.

[01:56:00] Wow, I've never heard of that.

[01:56:03] I heard Speak Easy.

[01:56:05] Okay, it was Speak Easy and then they made

[01:56:07] for export Speak Easy 4, which I have,

[01:56:11] that's why I've never heard of it.

[01:56:13] Interesting.

[01:56:14] What about the hell, does it actually say

[01:56:15] that on the back glass?

[01:56:16] I have to look now.

[01:56:18] It does, holy Toledo.

[01:56:21] Wow.

[01:56:22] This is the hard hitting research that I do run.

[01:56:44] Valley Management changed the game back

[01:56:46] to the standard one player at a time sequence.

[01:56:48] Valley Management changed the game back to the standard.

[01:56:51] Tch.

[01:56:52] Hhhhh.

[01:56:54] Valley Management changed the game.
