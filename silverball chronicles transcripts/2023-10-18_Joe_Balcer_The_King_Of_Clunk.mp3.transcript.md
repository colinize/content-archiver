[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Is this Mr. Ron Hallett? No, it's Mrs.

[00:18] Oh, hello!

[00:22] I love Mrs. Dodefire. Never seen it. And that sexy, sexy Pierce Brosnan.

[00:27] Hmm.

[00:58] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me is Ron

[01:05] Stomp Hallett. How you doing? I'm doing just fantastic. Fantastic. You are living it up and

[01:14] mighty over in upstate New York. Are you not? Beautiful upstate New York, yes.

[01:20] Coming off your big stomp win. I didn't win. I didn't even play in it.

[01:25] Stomp of course being the slam tilt, oh my pinball tournament thing. Yeah.

[01:32] So it'd be stomped.

[01:34] It's pretty to think about it that hard. Actually a listener came up with the name so very good.

[01:40] And it was it was the the almighty tournament player of Joe Lemire who won the championship

[01:48] belt this year. Yeah, we had a belt. It was cool.

[01:51] It was a little bit absurd by your other podcast. The slam tilt podcast.

[01:56] Hosted by yourself and Bruce Knight and Gale. Nice to see we got that plug right out of the way.

[02:01] I'm sure Bruce will be happy. Yes. Anything planned? You've been doing anything?

[02:05] Plan is probably expo. Yeah, that's exciting. There's some exciting stuff coming up at expo I think.

[02:12] Probably probably some pinball there and probably a tournament.

[02:16] I'm hoping it's pinball expo. I sure help sure hope there's pinball there. That would be pretty

[02:21] weird if there wasn't pinball there. But yeah, Ron, I just want to zip through

[05:03] We've got some reviews over at this weekend pinballs promoter database.

[05:07] The first one is from.

[05:09] Oh god it's forker.

[05:12] It's forker. That's a cool.

[05:14] It's forker.

[05:15] Yeah there is I think he's missing an oomlaut in there.

[05:19] It's a good one nonetheless.

[05:22] Yes.

[05:23] Forker says I love your podcast the silver ball chronicles bought one of your mugs today.

[05:28] Ooh we have mugs.

[05:30] We do and they are hottest seller.

[05:33] Wow.

[05:34] Oh god.

[05:36] That silver ball swag all the way to Sweden.

[05:39] Your podcast is a great spurtin to learn all kinds of things history related in pinball.

[05:45] The dynamic between the two hosts Javan and Ron is great.

[05:49] Especially Ron.

[05:50] It doesn't say that part.

[05:51] I added that.

[05:52] Oh.

[05:53] I love the way they interact and how they mostly Dave mispronounces most of the names and

[05:58] all the bickering a boot the Canadian American stuff gags and jokes.

[06:03] I hate that person.

[06:05] I find that kind of things hilarious.

[06:08] Yes I find hilarious too when he miss spells words and adds extra vowels and spells check weird things like that.

[06:15] Let's see the show is a nice mix of history full of tons of anecdotes, obscure facts and humor that keeps the show going.

[06:23] Keep up the good work guys.

[06:25] He spelled tons correctly.

[06:27] Good for you Spurker.

[06:28] Oh is that how they spell in Canada too?

[06:30] That's how they spets that's a metric ton.

[06:32] Oh well that's okay.

[06:34] Did I say spurtin right?

[06:36] I think I said that right.

[06:37] I think so.

[06:38] Okay that's a good word of the podcast.

[06:41] Spurtin.

[06:42] Spurtin.

[06:43] But this one from Mike we got another one.

[06:46] I'll look at all these stars.

[06:48] So many stars I think they're just falling out of my hand.

[06:51] My other podcast never gets this many stars.

[06:53] Damn.

[06:54] I've been listening my way through past episodes and having a great time as someone new to the hobby.

[06:59] This podcast is deep in my interest and I've learned so many things that I wouldn't have otherwise.

[07:04] The episodes take a lot longer for me to get through than others because I'm constantly stopping to look up the games mentioned.

[07:10] So I have a frame of reference.

[07:12] Don't do that while you're doing it.

[07:13] Yeah I was going to say hopefully he's not driving when he's doing it.

[07:15] Sure occasionally one of the hosts inserts extra use into words where they should be.

[07:20] I'll come on.

[07:21] But no one's perfect.

[07:22] Keep up the great work.

[07:24] I got to preview these before I ask you to read them.

[07:27] Is it a great?

[07:28] They just love making fun of Canadians.

[07:30] How about over at Apple Podcast somebody left us a review and Apple Podcasts?

[07:36] Really? Wow.

[07:37] It's mope.

[07:38] Mope?

[07:39] Let's see it says great overview of popular points in pinball history.

[07:44] Just enough information to keep me interested.

[07:46] Not overloaded with random details.

[07:48] Keep up the great work.

[07:50] I will listen to all of your episodes.

[07:52] Yeah be careful the first couple are pretty rocky.

[07:55] You know is there a single podcast that doesn't say that?

[07:58] Um we all I want to see a podcast that's been around 100 episodes and yes listen to our first episodes.

[08:05] There's some of our best work.

[08:07] They're the better ones.

[08:08] They're the better ones.

[08:09] We went downhill after that.

[08:11] And you uh cronies out there you can let us know whether you want to be called cronies or cronies.

[08:19] You say cronies.

[08:20] That's it.

[08:21] We're not getting your name into more of this Ron.

[08:24] Okay.

[08:25] If you enjoy the show you can also swing on over to silverballswag.com.

[08:30] Thanks so much to Will Odding.

[08:32] He's uh everybody knows him from twip.

[08:34] He does a lot of fantastic work for all of the content creators out there who want to have a silverball swag store.

[08:41] He does all of the work.

[08:42] Sends you all the shirts and does all that stuff.

[08:45] And then he throws us a kickback.

[08:48] We have no real corrections or comments from our previous episode.

[08:53] Hmm.

[08:54] We're on a roll here.

[08:55] I don't know if it's because people hate us and they don't want to send us messages or.

[09:00] No one's listening so there's nothing to correct.

[09:03] There could be nobody listening.

[09:05] We could just be talking to ourselves here.

[09:07] Well our episode topic today is an interesting one.

[09:11] Joe Balser is a name that some people know and some people don't.

[09:16] Joe spent his early beginnings at Sega pinball.

[09:20] Then Stern pinball basically helped start Jersey Jack pinball.

[09:25] He left Jersey Jack pinball.

[09:27] And then he started up another company called American pinball.

[09:32] Joe has been around.

[09:33] He's worked for many bosses and many companies.

[09:36] And he's made some pretty memorable layouts.

[09:40] Joe's not necessarily known as a high flow quick ball movement kind of guy.

[09:46] His designs tend to be more stop and go.

[09:50] Or some people like to call him the king of clunk.

[09:54] Oh.

[09:56] This month.

[09:57] Joe Balser.

[09:58] The king of clunk.

[09:59] That's not very nice.

[10:01] The king of clunk.

[10:02] What?

[10:03] His shots are kind of clunky.

[10:05] Hey, there's always Baywatch.

[10:07] Everybody always does that.

[10:08] They're like, yeah, but what about Baywatch?

[10:10] Okay, okay.

[10:11] What about Godzilla?

[10:12] Super flow in that one.

[10:13] Wasn't that Keith L. Wynne?

[10:14] No.

[10:15] The original Godzilla.

[10:16] The one based off the horrifically bad 1998 film.

[10:20] Oh, we'll get to that.

[10:21] Ooh.

[10:22] Well, let's wind it back.

[10:24] Let's talk about Joe's early life.

[10:26] Joe grew up in Cicero, Illinois.

[10:29] The town of Cicero, Illinois.

[10:31] Known for nothing.

[10:34] You ever heard of that town?

[10:36] And you might be saying it wrong.

[10:37] Who knows?

[10:38] Yeah.

[10:39] If it's like weird upstate towns where Cairo.

[10:42] It's spelled Cairo, but it's Cairo.

[10:44] I think it's stuff you would never know unless you were from there.

[10:47] Yeah, totally.

[10:48] So you know, you know,

[10:49] you never know unless you were from there.

[10:50] Yeah, totally.

[10:51] So he might have completely butchered that.

[10:53] Now, Joe wasn't a big pinball person when he was younger.

[10:56] In fact, he wasn't even a video game person when he was younger.

[11:00] Usually that's where a lot of the designers and programmers and stuff

[11:04] kind of get their start when they're a kid.

[11:05] They like to play a little pinball or video games.

[11:08] Joe was just another kid hanging around the neighborhoods of Illinois.

[11:12] You know, as a young scrapper.

[11:17] He played a lot of sports and he wasn't really into gaming at all as a kid.

[11:22] There was one time where Joe would stop into a hotel and they had a restaurant in that hotel.

[11:28] And they had some flipperless games.

[11:31] And he'd play for 10 cents at a time.

[11:34] But this wasn't until he was a teenager.

[11:37] Then he learned that he could make money on a flipperless game.

[11:42] Joe says, I'd put one dollar in that game, which was 10 games.

[11:46] And he would win games.

[11:47] Then he'd walk up to the bar and say, hey, I got 100 games up there.

[11:50] They'd say, okay, and then he'd hit a little button under the bar that would click down to zero.

[11:55] And the bartender would give you the money that you want.

[11:57] Pinball for me started out as a little place to make a few bucks

[12:00] because it would pay us over the bar counter.

[12:03] Wait a second. That sounds like gambling.

[12:06] Yeah, it's just a payoff. You earned those.

[12:10] Oh my goodness. Okay. So here's Joe ball.

[12:12] So all every, this is why Joe Balls are awesome.

[12:15] Every other designer that we've ever been is like, I love the game.

[12:20] And it was fun. And whatever Joe's like, I can make money on this.

[12:23] Right? This is awesome. Okay.

[12:26] At 19, Joe got a job at General Motors as a tool maker and a model maker.

[12:32] And they called him the setup man.

[12:36] So what are like, what's like a tool maker or a model maker, Ron?

[12:42] I assume he made tools that they used to make cars.

[12:45] Yeah, basically, right? He's not making a wrench exactly,

[12:48] but he's making like a jig or some sort of measurement piece and things like that.

[12:54] When you're redesigning changing cars, things like that, you know, like the wheel moves.

[12:59] You got to change the way the arch is.

[13:01] You got to have a tool to do that.

[13:02] Is a pretty highly skilled and fancy kind of job.

[13:05] Well, sadly, Joe was laid off and he began to work as a part time mechanic for more job stability.

[13:13] One day, one of his customers said he had a nephew who was looking for a few guys in a tool room.

[13:19] And Joe, having tool making experience, was interested.

[13:23] So he went to go see about the job.

[13:26] Joe travels out to a place called Midway manufacturing in Franklin Park, Illinois.

[13:31] Joe says this big white building that has a Pac-Man up front and it says home of Pac-Man.

[13:38] I had heard of Pac-Man. I knew what it was. I never really played it.

[13:42] I walked in and there was a black sign with white letters.

[13:45] And it said, Midway manufacturing welcomes Joe Balser.

[13:49] I nearly fell down when I saw it.

[13:51] Wow, how cool is that? This is actually something Ron, we do for all of my clientele here.

[13:56] Everybody has a welcome sign when they arrive.

[13:59] And the impact of that sign to make them feel like they're recognized and welcome is a big deal.

[14:05] And you can see the impression that it left on Joe Balser because this was what, like, 40 years ago.

[14:11] And he still remembers this story.

[14:14] Joe walked through the building with Kenny Addison to the tool room.

[14:18] They were running flat out with Pac-Man and eight ball deluxe.

[14:21] He was hired to join Midway.

[14:23] There you go. So we, I think it was, was it the George Gomez episode where George was talking about he was walking into Midway.

[14:31] In one end was like, Mitt Romaterials and out the other end where Pac-Man machines and how busy it was.

[14:38] So it must have been a really crazy first impression when you walk through a factory like that, especially in those days.

[14:44] Joe was moved into engineering and worked with Claude Fernandez on test fixtures for games like Granny and the Gators.

[14:50] Oh, God.

[14:51] What?

[14:52] So it's Joe Balser's fault.

[14:54] You had a great time learning on the job and working on X's and O's, Spy Hunter and eight ball champ to name a few.

[15:01] Yeah, some cool games in there, but this is kind of that weird, you know, bali midway kind of.

[15:07] Yeah, yeah, I can't one good game, eight ball champ.

[15:10] Right. Like it's like they're really kind of on that part thing.

[15:14] But after spending that much time there, Joe really did catch that pinball bug.

[15:19] He kind of understood why it was fun and interesting and all the exciting, you know, bits and pieces that made pinball pinball.

[15:27] Joe was an engineer.

[15:29] He began working with various companies in the 1980s.

[15:32] And it was tough getting started because as I mentioned, this is that weird time at bali.

[15:37] There were a bunch of layoffs in 1982 in which Joe was caught up on.

[15:43] However, he was a bit lucky because he did end up getting a job at WICO and he helped build the game Aftor.

[15:50] Ah, Aftor.

[15:51] You remember Aftor?

[15:52] I remember Aftor.

[15:53] I think that might be first alpha numeric display.

[15:57] First alpha numeric display again.

[15:59] And metal back box, which Stern does now.

[16:03] They were just early.

[16:04] That's what they say in my, in my financial business.

[16:06] Oh, they were just early.

[16:08] They're call.

[16:09] And then they were just early.

[16:10] But really Aftor was the only thing that WICO made of any notable.

[16:14] They made parts.

[16:15] That was their one game.

[16:16] Exactly, exactly.

[16:18] Joe spent time at bali midway, WICO, and even premier technology, which was formerly myelstar, and which was formerly gotleab.

[16:26] Then came the big hire.

[16:28] Joe says, I was hired at Data East.

[16:31] Joe Kamenkow brought me in.

[16:33] My career kind of started out with Data East where I really got into it.

[16:37] I'm glad the Joe brought me in.

[16:40] Data East, of course, was a lot less corporate and structured than those other companies he had been at a WICO aside.

[16:47] But if you looked at midway, premier, they were much more stuffy, I think, more corporate.

[16:56] Where Data East was tight.

[16:59] They were tight on timelines.

[17:01] They had shoestring budgets.

[17:03] And people wore a lot of hats at Data East.

[17:07] So let's get into some of the games that Joe finally started working on, the more notable ones.

[17:13] So the first one is one where there's one unit.

[17:16] That's right.

[17:18] Aaron Spelling.

[17:20] The showmaker, the guy who did Love Boat in fantasy island and all those shows.

[17:24] Yeah, the TV producer theme.

[17:27] Yeah.

[17:28] This is a design by Ed Sabula, Joe Kamenkow, Joe Balser and Lonnie Rob.

[17:34] Mechanics by Joe Balser, John Linden, John Borg, Art by Mark Rothkrands.

[17:42] You can remember him from Jurassic Park and the nubby fingers of Nedry.

[17:50] Yes, that's the greatest thing that Marcus did for pinball.

[17:54] Music and sound by Brian Schmidt and software by Lonnie Rob.

[17:58] So the theme you had touched on this is based on Aaron Spelling.

[18:02] Now, he was the American television film producer, really got his big start in the 1970s.

[18:09] But went all the way through into the 1990s.

[18:13] And really, there has been no bigger TV producer in history.

[18:18] He did shows like Charlie Zangel's, The Love Boat and Dynasty, which were huge.

[18:23] Remember the Hills 90210, Melrose Place, Seventh Heaven Encharmed?

[18:28] Everything Aaron's Spelling touched basically turned to gold in that period.

[18:33] Well, Joe Balser says, I remember Joe Kamenkow was running our engineering department.

[18:37] It called everybody together and said, we just got a call from Miss Aaron Spelling.

[18:41] And she wanted a custom pinball machine for her husband, a man that has everything.

[18:45] Apparently Kamenkow threw a number out there.

[18:47] I don't know what the number might have been, but it was pretty large.

[18:50] And she said, who do I write the check to?

[18:53] Holy moly, money is no object.

[18:55] That's right.

[18:56] And the worst part is I think if you throw it a number and somebody bites in sales, your number was too low.

[19:03] Yeah.

[19:04] Unless they counteroffer, you have offered too low.

[19:09] But I bet it was a pretty nutty number for one one machine.

[19:12] Basically, what they did is they modified lethal weapon three from 1992.

[19:18] Mostly cosmetic, but they changed, I think a couple of targets.

[19:23] And they added a picture of Tory Spelling, who was the daughter of Aaron Spelling.

[19:29] And when you hit a specific target, she would say, I love you, Daddy.

[19:33] Yes, I played this game.

[19:36] You've played this game.

[19:37] Yes.

[19:38] There's only one of them.

[19:39] Yes.

[19:40] Oh, do tell.

[19:41] It was an expo.

[19:43] How did they get it?

[19:44] I mean, when I played it, I just looked at it.

[19:47] Oh, it's lethal weapon three.

[19:49] They were spelling themed.

[19:51] Wow.

[19:52] Yeah.

[19:53] Imagine.

[19:55] Well, this was one of those all hands on deck games.

[19:59] This is where everybody had to get on it and get it done.

[20:03] Joe Balser would say that that's where I got my opportunity to learn design.

[20:08] Joe Kamenkao had a real passion for what pinball design was about.

[20:13] And I was able to take all that in.

[20:16] Very, very, very cool.

[20:18] But this brought in the next amazing game.

[20:21] I never thought about that.

[20:22] The fact that if it was Aaron Spelling, how did I play it?

[20:25] Did he just like lend it out or did he just have it after a certain point of the guy we don't want this anymore?

[20:31] So Richie Rich was the next game.

[20:33] That's from 94.

[20:34] There was only one unit of that.

[20:36] Yeah, that was a Tommy.

[20:38] Same group.

[20:39] Same group of folk working on it.

[20:40] And it was actually made as a movie prop.

[20:42] So it wasn't made specifically for an individual.

[20:46] It was made for a prop in a movie.

[20:48] Now Richie Rich is based on the comic book character of the same name created by Alfred Harvey and Warren Kramer.

[20:55] The pinball machine was used in the 1994 movie Richie Rich.

[21:00] And that star.

[21:02] The Hummelown kid.

[21:04] McCulley Culkin.

[21:05] I saw this movie when I was a kid.

[21:07] I thought it was pretty fun.

[21:08] Richie Rich Jr.

[21:10] I'm sorry, Richard Richie Rich Jr.

[21:14] Is the world's richest boy.

[21:16] He lives in Chicago and he has billionaire parents of Richard senior and Regina.

[21:22] Under the care of his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury.

[21:26] Scientist professor Keenbein and his dog named Dollar.

[21:30] Richie enjoys a luxurious but lonely life.

[21:34] Now the joke kind of in the comic strips and the movie is that Richie is so wealthy.

[21:40] That he can kind of have anything and he can have a one of a kind pinball machine themed around himself.

[21:46] It's sort of like that professional wrestler Matt Hardy with his custom pin the quest for gold.

[21:52] But this was a custom pin in the 1990s, which is like a really big deal back then.

[21:58] Well, Jill Balser says it was just a new artwork package and we played with the rules a little bit and made these people happy.

[22:03] And that's kind of how it came about.

[22:05] Some of the things I've noticed when looking at the pictures on IPDB.

[22:08] The card at the bottom that tells you how much to play like a dollar per game.

[22:12] It says a million dollars per play.

[22:15] Yeah, it does.

[22:16] It has all gold ramps because gold is fancy.

[22:19] It has on the back glass a photo of his mom, his dad, his butler, his dog, and the dad at East Logo.

[22:26] How authentic is that? Right?

[22:28] Because it's like literally like a pinball machine that you would see in an arcade in the early 90s.

[22:33] Awesome.

[22:34] And the cabinet is designed, it sort of is colored and it looks like sort of like white and gold marble.

[22:39] It kind of looks like something under the washroom at Mar-a-Lago.

[22:42] Or a bathroom for those Americans.

[22:44] And yes, I played this one too.

[22:46] What?

[22:47] It was an expo one here.

[22:48] What is going on?

[22:49] I got to get to expo.

[22:50] He's got these things at pinball expo.

[22:52] Yes, it's Richie Rich.

[22:53] And yes, it's million play all gold.

[22:56] Yeah, it was Tommy.

[22:57] Yeah, it was basically a multi-ball and the Tommy ramp rule.

[23:01] They pretty much just slapped some art on it.

[23:04] Well, good for them because it made them some money.

[23:06] But what was Joe's first designed game?

[23:09] A home run in my opinion.

[23:11] Baywatch.

[23:12] Man, oh man, okay.

[23:14] Home run.

[23:15] I haven't played Baywatch, but I have heard good things.

[23:17] It is excellent.

[23:18] So the theme is based on Baywatch.

[23:21] Hasselhoff.

[23:22] Yeah.

[23:23] Very big show.

[23:25] This debuted really in 1989.

[23:29] It debuted in 1989?

[23:31] Yeah.

[23:32] And it ran all the way to 99.

[23:35] Yep.

[23:36] That's insanity.

[23:38] It was on NBC.

[23:41] It was a big, big deal this show.

[23:44] Basically, it was around, you know, David Hasselhoff,

[23:48] who everybody remembers from Knight Rider.

[23:52] This was his next big thing.

[23:54] Yeah.

[23:55] Which is quite a bit later, but actually, if it started in 1989,

[23:58] it wasn't that much later.

[24:00] And don't forget Baywatch Knights.

[24:02] That didn't last very long.

[24:03] Yeah.

[24:04] So basically what, like in a nutshell,

[24:07] David Hasselhoff is like the lead lifeguard.

[24:09] With all these lifeguards, they're hanging out in a beach in California.

[24:13] People are drowning.

[24:14] And then various ladies run across the beach to save other people.

[24:19] There's like love interests and things like that.

[24:22] It was actually canceled after its first season.

[24:25] But because of syndication and popularity, it came back.

[24:30] And you mentioned Baywatch Knights from 95 to 97.

[24:35] And there was actually a feature film adaptation in 2017.

[24:39] But Baywatch was kind of a big cultural thing.

[24:41] Didn't do it for me.

[24:43] But a lot of people liked it.

[24:45] Did I go through who designed it?

[24:47] No.

[24:48] No, I didn't.

[24:49] Okay, well the game itself, that's from February of 95.

[24:52] We don't know how many units were produced.

[24:54] It was designed by Joe Balser and Joe Kamenkao.

[24:57] The Joe's.

[24:58] Art by Marcus Rothkanz and Jeff.

[25:01] And Jeff.

[25:02] Kran's.

[25:03] Kran's.

[25:04] Rothkran's.

[25:05] I believe he's got a KR there.

[25:06] Yeah.

[25:07] And Jeff Bush.

[25:08] And he did a lot of those Sega games as well.

[25:11] Not too much the data east games, but the Sega games later on.

[25:14] Music and sound by Brian Schmidt.

[25:16] Software by Neil Faulkner, Lonnie Robin, or in day.

[25:20] Let's jump into the flyer.

[25:22] Because I think the flyer says it all here, Ron.

[25:24] Oh, we love reading flyers here.

[25:26] We've got something that's going to make some waves.

[25:30] Yes!

[25:31] Baywatch!

[25:33] Love in the puns.

[25:34] Featuring custom speech by the man himself, David Hasselhoff.

[25:39] Yeah.

[25:40] David Hasselhoff.

[25:41] Got his gorgeous.

[25:42] The Hoth.

[25:43] It's a pretty straightforward game when it comes to just sort of looking at it.

[25:48] But one thing that does really stick out is that extra large DMD.

[25:53] Yes, can it display increased earnings?

[25:56] We think so.

[25:57] Of course it can.

[26:00] But it's got like pictures of the Hoth carrying like a person

[26:05] when out of the water is the jackpot.

[26:08] It's got Pamela Anderson kind of fixing her hair when there's a 50 million, right?

[26:15] Like it's, you know, we're playing up a bit of the sex appeal here on this thing.

[26:20] The side art.

[26:21] That's where they really, let's say, play up the sexuality of the pin.

[26:27] Isn't that right?

[26:28] You mean the butts?

[26:29] The butts.

[26:30] One of them there.

[26:31] It's got a little bit of moose knuckle.

[26:34] No.

[26:35] I don't know what that means.

[26:37] Yeah.

[26:38] It's like a Canadian term.

[26:40] It sounds like it with moose.

[26:41] It is.

[26:42] It is the Canadian, it's the Canadian thing.

[26:44] Mm-hmm.

[26:45] Joe Ballsler says,

[26:46] Baywatch was the first full-size pinball I was assigned to lay out.

[26:49] And we got to go a little crazy with that ladder ramp.

[26:52] Miss direction with the ball.

[26:53] It just felt like a good layout.

[26:55] They're watching it being built and come up to speed and everything working.

[26:59] That, imagine that feeling, that first pin.

[27:02] On the line.

[27:03] It is.

[27:04] I'm going to gather.

[27:05] Packed.

[27:06] It is packed.

[27:07] It is packed.

[27:08] Do you want to talk about the layout just a little bit here?

[27:10] Uh, it's awesome.

[27:12] It's a three-flipper layout.

[27:13] Yeah.

[27:14] Correct.

[27:15] So it's got the side ramp that everybody loves.

[27:17] It's got a lot of stuff in there.

[27:19] It's got a lot of stuff.

[27:20] The one skill shot when you hit it, it's like a three-stage thing.

[27:24] Which, when you think about Houdini, which we'll get to later,

[27:27] you can kind of see the beginnings of that.

[27:29] Like, it goes to one place, fires it to another place,

[27:31] and fires it around, so like an upper flipper.

[27:33] Like a multi-stage thing.

[27:35] Lots of a, and stand-ups.

[27:37] He loves his stand-ups.

[27:38] The skinny stand-ups.

[27:39] Tons of those.

[27:40] The shark flipper.

[27:42] You got to love the shark flipper.

[27:44] Big time.

[27:45] Now there's a watchtower lock, which is the left ramp.

[27:47] Yep.

[27:48] Uh, right way in the back, on the left side.

[27:50] You kind of shoot the ball up the ramp,

[27:52] and then it kind of gets locked up inside there.

[27:54] And then it'll pop it out down to a habit trail on the other side.

[27:58] Oh no, it's a four-flipper game, isn't it?

[28:00] You forgot the shark flipper.

[28:01] That's right, the shark flipper.

[28:03] It's a four-flipper game.

[28:04] And the thing is, it's so packed, I always thought this was a wide body.

[28:07] Until I saw, like, wait a minute, it's not a wide body?

[28:09] I don't know how he got away with it.

[28:11] But how about that, let's talk about that shark flipper then.

[28:14] Oh, you mean, yeah, you mean thing flipper?

[28:17] Yeah.

[28:18] Well, Joe, well, Joe says,

[28:20] we were messing with that area of the play field,

[28:22] and then ended up finding this small flipper that went right across the play field.

[28:25] Then we found that we could control it.

[28:27] Once we started to get the timing, it just became this automatic flip.

[28:31] Where that came from, I don't know.

[28:33] Yeah, that idea, I think, probably came from Adam's family.

[28:37] Yes, think flipper, how's family?

[28:39] From their competitor.

[28:40] Yes, they did a lot of that.

[28:41] It's fine.

[28:42] I don't know where that idea came from.

[28:44] It's not famous in any way.

[28:46] I would rather play Baywatch than Adam's family.

[28:48] Oh my goodness.

[28:50] It shoots better.

[28:51] That's a hot one, folks.

[28:52] It's coming in hot.

[28:53] I find it more fun.

[28:54] Now, Joe had a lot of passion on his first game,

[28:57] and he would say that I had three or four guys working with me at the time

[29:02] to do some of the mechanics and things.

[29:04] But that first layout, those first lines and circles that turn into pinball,

[29:10] that was an amazing feeling for me.

[29:13] It got me at that point.

[29:15] It started to be a lot of fun.

[29:17] Once you're going to work, and it's fun, it's not work anymore.

[29:22] Wow.

[29:23] That's an awesome quote from Joe Belser.

[29:25] I had to put that in there.

[29:27] Because it speaks to him as a person and his passion for pinball.

[29:32] And that comes, of course, from his top cast episode,

[29:36] which is in the show notes.

[29:38] Well worth the listen.

[29:40] Because it's giving context at that time.

[29:44] It's not giving foresight.

[29:45] It's very cool.

[29:46] Really like that.

[29:48] But that brings him into Apollo 13, right?

[29:51] Apollo 13, yes.

[29:52] That's it.

[29:54] You just say Apollo 13, yes.

[29:56] That's no Baywatch.

[29:57] Baywatch is like my favorite Sega game.

[29:59] Sega.

[30:01] We talked a little bit about Apollo 13 on our first John Borg episode.

[30:05] Because John did a lot of the mechanics on the play field.

[30:10] Apollo 13 is based on the film Apollo 13, which was from 1995.

[30:16] It was a docu-drama directed by Ron Howard,

[30:19] starred Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, or was it Bill Pullman?

[30:24] Oh, Bill Paxton.

[30:25] They both look exactly the same.

[30:27] Yeah, Ed Harris and Gary Seneese.

[30:30] I thought it was a really good film.

[30:32] I really kind of enjoyed this film.

[30:34] I didn't see it.

[30:35] $52 million budget, $355 million.

[30:38] Is that the Houston we have a problem movie?

[30:40] Houston we have a problem.

[30:42] That's where that theme came from.

[30:45] So now when people go Houston, we have a problem.

[30:47] That's literally where this came from.

[30:50] Well, it came from the actual event where they said it,

[30:52] but the movie made that popular, that line.

[30:55] Amazing story.

[30:57] Joe was among a group of people from Sega who personally delivered a game to Jim Lovell,

[31:05] who was a crew member of Apollo 13.

[31:08] Joe had his own Apollo 13 back glass and Saturn V rocket signed by Jim.

[31:16] Imagine.

[31:17] Wow, movie made a ton of money.

[31:20] Like a $50 million and it made $350 million.

[31:23] Wow.

[31:24] Yeah.

[31:25] And back then, you know, when you've got hundreds of million dollar movie,

[31:28] that was a big deal.

[31:29] It's over two and a half hours long.

[31:31] Jeff Bush, yeah, it is a long movie.

[31:34] Jeff Bush though, he was really great when it came to the art of this film.

[31:39] I think it looks really wonderful.

[31:41] Some of the little neat little bits in the art is the Joe Balser's name is on the name

[31:46] tag of the main astronaut on the back glass.

[31:49] I thought it says rec lab.

[31:50] It does say rec lab, but that's Balser backwards.

[31:54] Oh, now I get it.

[31:57] Isn't that cool?

[31:58] This is why people tune in to silver ball chronicles.

[32:02] Because they want to hear about 13 ball multi balls.

[32:05] Because they get to get all these little Easter eggs and silliness, you know,

[32:11] rec lab.

[32:12] On that back glass, why is there a main astronaut with rec lab written on them?

[32:17] You mean as opposed to showing his face?

[32:19] Yeah.

[32:20] Yeah, it's Tom Hanks, but he's in the suit.

[32:22] But why isn't Tom Hanks' face on there?

[32:24] Because we can't show him.

[32:25] He didn't want to be on a pinball machine, but Gary Sinesis on there.

[32:28] I thought we had one of the other people that actually didn't get their permission to be on there.

[32:33] I think it might have been, I'm trying to remember which one of them.

[32:37] And when they showed in the game, he was like, oh, great.

[32:40] Look, I'm on a pinball machine.

[32:42] Was it Lieutenant Diane?

[32:44] Because Lieutenant Diane is on there.

[32:46] He's wearing a tie.

[32:47] Yeah.

[32:48] I think I might be in this game.

[32:51] Or maybe I'm thinking of another game.

[32:53] Actually, I think I think I'm in another game.

[32:56] So the 13 ball multi ball.

[32:58] You hinted on that.

[32:59] Now, how did they actually get that to where I mean you talk about, oh, 13 ball multi ball.

[33:04] That's cool.

[33:05] But how does it actually work from an engineering stand?

[33:07] Well, Cornia Joel Bolser.

[33:09] It was amazing to be able to stage that many pinballs and control it.

[33:12] The main issue with the game was how do we load and reload pinballs and program us at the game knows where the balls are at all times.

[33:19] When we came up with the eight ball trop up in the left corner and we had five down in the main trop, it was a matter of how to get them there.

[33:28] With that.

[33:29] It was a matter of how to get them there without interrupting gameplay to try to load.

[33:34] We had basically a diverter at the top of the play field that would either load balls into the eight ball trop or let the balls go back into play on the top lanes.

[33:41] Once we got that down and it was consistent, then it was off to the races.

[33:45] We could make this happen.

[33:47] So there's an actual ball trough up there.

[33:50] Yeah, and they would just like under the bottom of the front of the play field.

[33:53] And they redo this for Indiana Jones.

[33:56] The second one.

[33:57] Cool.

[33:58] This one also has the extra large.

[34:00] No, it doesn't.

[34:01] And that's a smaller one.

[34:02] They say it was used in the what what 94 192 by 64 super large displays.

[34:09] But then they went back Apollo 13.

[34:11] They went back to the regular size DMD.

[34:13] I guess between the 13 ball multi balls.

[34:15] It's like, we don't need a big display on this one.

[34:17] It was the cost.

[34:19] I would say, right?

[34:20] Like you're probably was the cost.

[34:22] So how did Apollo 13 do when it was released?

[34:25] Well, Joe says we brought a pilot of one of the arcades that we were working with as a test location.

[34:31] I'll never forget we were sitting there.

[34:33] We put the game up and this woman and her son walked up to the game to play it.

[34:37] We said it on the 13 ball multi ball.

[34:40] So it was just one shot away.

[34:41] And when she hit the shot and eight balls dumped on top of the five balls that were already there.

[34:46] It was total chaos.

[34:47] There was no controlling that.

[34:48] It's just flipping away, flailing away as much as you can to keep the ball some draining.

[34:53] She let out a scream in her son started crying.

[34:56] You knew you had something special when that happened.

[34:58] Wow, it made a kid cry.

[35:00] I kind of like the game more now.

[35:02] It was so scary, right?

[35:03] It was like, what's going on?

[35:05] That's amazing.

[35:06] It is.

[35:07] That's a great story.

[35:08] It is a gimmick.

[35:09] If you ever actually play it like the there's so many balls, the flippers are weighed down by them though.

[35:15] You can't keep the flippers up.

[35:16] It basically you just lift the flipper and it moves the balls enough to drain.

[35:21] Yeah.

[35:22] It is cool though.

[35:23] I mean, it's tough to have something like that and not having to be cool.

[35:27] Space Jam.

[35:28] This is the licensed looney tune basketball theme from December of 1996.

[35:35] It's done by the Joe's Joe Balser, Joe Kamenkao, mechanics, Joe Balser, art, Jeff Bush, Morgan Weissley, he does the back last, Westling, Weistling, and Mark Reinez, Reinez, cabinet and some of the production elements.

[35:54] DOS by Jack Linden, Music and Sound, Brian Schmidt, Lonnie Rob and Orrin Day on software.

[36:01] Well, this theme, let's talk about this theme.

[36:08] Another movie I haven't seen.

[36:10] You haven't seen Space Jam.

[36:12] You want to hear a funny story?

[36:14] Sure.

[36:16] Michael Jordan tried to act.

[36:18] No.

[36:19] Let me take you back.

[36:21] The year is 1996.

[36:24] This American live-action animated sports film starring Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan, where Michael Jordan gets sucked into the world of the looney tunes and is brought on the looney tunes basketball team to help save the looney tunes world.

[36:45] You're in a theater.

[36:48] It's 1996, you're eating popcorn.

[36:51] David Dennis is on his first date when he was in grade six.

[36:56] The lady Melanie was there, and I held her hand.

[37:01] It was so scary.

[37:03] So scary, Rod.

[37:05] Are you right? This is scary.

[37:10] That was my first date.

[37:12] Space Jam, 1996.

[37:14] They don't have that theater anymore. It was so long ago they tore that theater down.

[37:19] Anyway, there was also a sequel called Space Jam a new legacy, which started LeBron James.

[37:25] It was not as good. It was missing the charm.

[37:28] It also didn't have Bill Murray.

[37:30] Bill Murray played a cameo, and it was amazing.

[37:33] What did Joe Ballsor think about the theme?

[37:35] Well, he said Joe Kamikam was sending up all of our licenses.

[37:38] He talked about this movie coming out called Space Jam.

[37:41] We didn't know anything about it.

[37:43] We didn't see parts of the movie, and reading what was going to be all about.

[37:47] We were thinking it was a really cool basketball theme game.

[37:50] Of course, it's going to be a really cool basketball theme game, Joe.

[37:54] That's what the movie's about.

[37:56] Well, the cool thing is they actually got to read scripts and do this stuff before the movie came out.

[38:01] No one does that anymore.

[38:03] No one gets any of that stuff anymore.

[38:05] They have to do it after the game that movies out now.

[38:08] We've mentioned this a few times, but I don't think people appreciate it.

[38:14] We're getting scripts. It hasn't been made yet.

[38:17] Could you imagine somebody just reading through some of the new Marvel scripts?

[38:21] Not a two. They recorded Arnold on set.

[38:25] As they're filming the movie, did you not get that access anymore?

[38:30] I think I've only played this a few times.

[38:33] I can't really make an opinion.

[38:35] Other than it's got, when Sega started using the curved back box, the Showcase back box,

[38:43] well, according to the flyer, this must have been the first one because it says featuring new Sega Showcase back box.

[38:51] I love the Looney Tunes.

[38:54] I absolutely love the Looney Tunes.

[38:56] Everything to do about the Looney Tunes.

[38:58] When I was a kid, I watched them.

[39:00] I still watch them with my kids today.

[39:02] All the vintage ones are the best.

[39:04] It's so awesome, so much better than Disney.

[39:08] This machine really appeals to me from a theme standpoint.

[39:14] I really love this movie. It's a very fun movie.

[39:17] I love Michael Jordan, who doesn't.

[39:20] Did you know this game is custom speech by Michael Jordan?

[39:24] And stadium announcer Ray Clay.

[39:27] Many of your Looney Tunes favorites.

[39:29] We won't say who he actually just avoids his form, including Bugs Bunny, Duffy Duck, Porky Pig,

[39:33] and Tweety. I hate Tweety.

[39:35] I love Tweety.

[39:37] I wish self-ester would eat him.

[39:39] That's the thing.

[39:41] Yes.

[39:42] The funny thing is when you think about it, you have Williams.

[39:46] They had fast break.

[39:48] You know, NBA fast break.

[39:50] And they have all the players except Jordan.

[39:54] Yeah, how true is that?

[39:55] So Jordan, like, no, I'm having my own game.

[39:58] Yeah, he gets his, because he's Michael Jordan.

[40:00] I'm bigger than the game.

[40:02] I'm gonna get my own game.

[40:04] Awesome skill shot into the hoop.

[40:07] It's got the ball lock basket ball.

[40:10] It has the most amazing backboard magnet catching thing onto a ramp.

[40:15] So it's like a jump ramp.

[40:17] And then there's a magnet on the backboard that catches it and then drops it into a hoop.

[40:21] Which they would redo with an NBA.

[40:23] Yeah, this is awesome. It's an awesome game.

[40:25] It's got a lot of drop targets, though.

[40:27] You want to talk about the drop targets?

[40:29] Drop targets.

[40:30] It's got a lot of standup targets.

[40:32] That's what Joe's known for.

[40:34] Joe Ballsor says, if we could use drop targets as a designer everywhere, I think I would.

[40:38] Just because of the mechanical aspect of drop targets.

[40:41] It comes down to space and cost.

[40:43] The standup target serves as purpose.

[40:45] You're gonna hit the target.

[40:46] You're gonna score.

[40:47] It's not dropping out of your way, which I'd love to see more on.

[40:50] But you start getting into four or five or six bank drop targets.

[40:54] And you're going into a nice chunk of change on your bill of materials.

[40:57] Which takes away from something else in the game.

[40:59] I'd rather have more targets to shoot at than not.

[41:01] That would be a good way to put it.

[41:03] I mean, his point is that it just costs too much money to do drop targets.

[41:07] And this is something that a theme that comes up time and time again over and over and over is that.

[41:11] Yeah, right.

[41:12] Is it just these mechanics are expensive?

[41:14] And do you want a cool toy or more ramps or do you want drop targets?

[41:18] Data East worked with Michael Jordan's people because he has people.

[41:22] And they actually presented the game to Michael at the Make a Wish Foundation.

[41:28] Where all the design team got to meet Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing.

[41:34] But mostly, mostly people over there to see Michael Jordan.

[41:38] Joe Balser would say, I never thought that I would be that connected.

[41:42] It was just fun being part of pinball and being a part of all these different events

[41:48] because of the games that you did.

[41:50] That's cool.

[41:51] Well, if you want a, if you want a bigger license than Michael Jordan,

[41:55] Star Wars trilogy special edition.

[41:58] So you remember the special edition trilogies were on.

[42:01] Oh, yes.

[42:03] Yes, I do.

[42:04] Yeah, it's a Star Wars theme.

[42:06] From March of 97, we don't know how many units were made by the Joe's.

[42:10] Yeah, but Joe Balser, Joe Cam and Cal.

[42:12] I didn't realize this was timed with that until just now.

[42:16] And really, and 97 is when they re-released them in theaters,

[42:20] but they were all the horrific special editions with all the change crap.

[42:25] Yeah.

[42:26] So there's some change crap I'm okay with.

[42:28] Some of it not some...

[42:29] No, don't change any of it.

[42:31] It's perfect. No need to change it.

[42:33] George Lucas's vision, man.

[42:34] It's his movie.

[42:35] You can do whatever he wants to.

[42:37] He can sell it to Disney and run it into the ground.

[42:39] He can do whatever he wants.

[42:41] So let's jump into the flyer here.

[42:44] You are father wanted you to have this when you were old enough.

[42:48] Oh, it says that.

[42:49] Okay, that's pretty good.

[42:51] That's pretty good.

[42:52] That's pretty good.

[42:53] Featuring the exclusive Sega Showcase Backbox and hand-sournings with this optional 3D back glass

[43:01] a pinball industry first, which it probably is.

[43:04] If you have the lenticular back glass on that, you have the fancy version.

[43:08] Wow.

[43:09] You got to relive the magic with a whole new generation.

[43:12] Yeah.

[43:13] Ron, I saw a new hope special edition in the theater.

[43:18] Three times.

[43:19] I pity you.

[43:21] I did.

[43:22] And I loved every minute of it.

[43:23] I saw it once.

[43:25] The new edition.

[43:27] That was a big deal for me because I never seen the original Star Wars in the theater because I was like three.

[43:31] Yeah.

[43:32] I'd only seen, I saw Empire in Return of the Jedi.

[43:35] So I was so psyched about seeing Star Wars.

[43:38] And then right before I walk into theater, I hear people talking about it.

[43:42] Yeah, they put some new stuff in it.

[43:44] And then there's like this, this like wave thing that comes out of the Death Star when it blows up now.

[43:49] And I'm like, what?

[43:50] What were they talking about?

[43:52] And then I washed with horror as they ruined my movie.

[43:54] This was when computers were a big thing, much more of a thing when it came to film.

[44:01] And George Lucas revisited his original trilogy, made some tweaks.

[44:05] Some of them very good, in my opinion.

[44:07] Like what?

[44:08] So for example, in the Empire Strikes Back, they took out a lot of those black lines that were around the green screen stuff when they're in the snow speeder scene.

[44:18] So much better.

[44:19] Because back in the day, you were in a green screen, you had these thick black lines around kind of the image.

[44:26] And then the actual like proper or something.

[44:29] It looked terrible.

[44:30] Some of that stuff.

[44:32] They cleaned up some of the, some of the strings that you would see or some of the like weird colors that were not strings.

[44:39] I'm joking, but there's colors and things.

[44:41] I thought they did really, really well.

[44:42] You know, the force is strong with this one.

[44:44] Watch out.

[44:45] Blast from turbo lasers will divert balls from the ramp into the X-wing cannon or the left in lane.

[44:51] It's cool.

[44:52] I'm not going to lie.

[44:53] It's this thing on the ramp, it goes up.

[44:55] And then it has these turbo lasers that move in and out.

[45:00] It has a really cool X-wing fighter thing on the left ramp where it's basically the crossbow from the walking dead or the cannon from T2.

[45:09] It shoots across the play field into a bunch of tie fighters.

[45:14] It has the Sarlac pit on the right side, I think, right?

[45:17] Or not the Sarlac pit, the, from the Empire Strikes Back where they freeze them, the carbonite chamber.

[45:23] The hole's a bit too big, I think.

[45:26] Well, Jov ulcer says on the visual side, the game really came together nicely.

[45:30] We had a couple of really neat toys on it and worked out to make a fun game.

[45:34] License games were all we were doing then.

[45:36] We got a lot of content with license themes, but then there are walls up around you too.

[45:40] You have to do things the right way to get them approved.

[45:43] Star Wars trilogy being this whole Star Wars thing, you really had to do things right for them.

[45:48] Yeah, and they talked about this a lot in the Phantom Menace, right?

[45:52] Where they really struggled with the licenser.

[45:56] Well, I'm sure they had something similar here.

[45:58] One thing that they didn't struggle with was the God-awful art.

[46:02] Do you mean the sections art?

[46:03] It's like every different section.

[46:05] I like the one with the 20 tie fighters, all in one small area.

[46:09] So the bottom third, okay, it's got like Vader in the middle and it's got the characters.

[46:14] That's cool.

[46:15] And then once you get above the bottom third, it just is a friggin train wreck of a mess.

[46:21] It's all purple and yellows and oranges and they do have Vader.

[46:25] They do have Vader.

[46:26] Big Vader.

[46:27] That's always good.

[46:28] That's the best part.

[46:29] But it just it just it just falls apart a little bit.

[46:32] So do you know there was a collector's edition of this game?

[46:34] No, I didn't.

[46:35] I didn't know this.

[46:36] Or in day, once stated that Neiman Marcus, the high end retailer,

[46:40] sold a collector's edition of this Star Wars trilogy in their fall catalog of 1997.

[46:45] Can't find any pictures or anything about that, but apparently it was in the

[46:50] fall catalog.

[46:51] So if you've got one of those and you're listening to this, send us an email,

[46:56] silverballcrontacles at gmail.com.

[46:58] What about this one?

[47:00] Starship troopers.

[47:01] Another movie I haven't seen.

[47:04] That one I actually want to see.

[47:05] Starship troopers.

[47:06] I watched it again recently for some reason.

[47:10] It's directed by the guy who did RoboCops.

[47:12] And you can certainly tell.

[47:15] This is from December of 1997.

[47:17] It's a space movie theme.

[47:21] It's done by the Joe's, Joe Balcer, Joe Kamenkow, art by Morgan West.

[47:26] What is the name?

[47:27] Weistling.

[47:28] Weistling.

[47:29] Music by Brian Schmidt, software Indian Faulkner, or in day.

[47:33] This is based on the film.

[47:35] So Starship troopers.

[47:36] I remember this in 1997 when it came out when I was in middle school.

[47:41] And it was very controversial, I guess, around that time, because it was directed by Paul Verhoeven.

[47:51] It did RoboCops.

[47:53] I think he did fatal attraction.

[47:56] I think he did.

[47:58] Did he do a total recall too?

[48:00] You did a lot of good movies.

[48:02] Yeah, but his movies are really weird and over the top and hyper-violent.

[48:08] But they also have this odd social commentary.

[48:12] So basically, Starship troopers is, you know, the world is being invaded.

[48:18] Or was attacked by a bunch of bug like creatures.

[48:22] Humans have gone into space to destroy these bugs.

[48:25] And it's a very fascist kind of society.

[48:28] And they're all fighting against things.

[48:30] But it's like the acting is kind of iffy.

[48:33] And everything is like really over the top.

[48:36] But if you took RoboCop and turned it up just a little bit, which is kind of hard,

[48:42] because RoboCop is pretty crazy as it is, and put it in space, that's basically where this is.

[48:47] But it was targeted sort of towards teenagers, because they're young kids

[48:51] and they're, you know, they're Denise Richards, who was big at the time, and Casper Van Dean,

[48:56] an early Neil Patrick Harris.

[48:58] Super cool.

[48:59] It's kind of a neat movie, but I watched it again.

[49:01] I'm like, geez, this movie is much worse than I remember.

[49:04] It had a hundred million dollar budget.

[49:06] It did a hundred and twenty one million at the box office.

[49:09] So pretty much a flop.

[49:11] It's a cult film now though.

[49:12] Yeah, it's one of those cult kind of films.

[49:14] But even to me, it's still not a good cult film.

[49:16] It's, I don't know, I don't get it.

[49:18] If you get it, silverball chronicles at gmail.com.

[49:21] Well, the toys, the toys.

[49:23] Joe Balser says, I think the industry looks for custom toys now.

[49:26] Back then, we would work with toy manufacturers.

[49:28] We would get catalogs or samples of everything that was coming out for starship troopers or whatever.

[49:33] We would have a relationship with the toy manufacturers, and we would get all the samples

[49:37] and try to adapt them to the game.

[49:39] Starship troopers is a real good example of that because there are a lot of toys there.

[49:43] But these were not custom toys.

[49:45] We bought them in bulk, and we fit them to the mechanisms.

[49:48] Starship troopers was, starship troopers was just a lot of ready-made toys that we built into the game.

[49:52] Let's just put it that way.

[49:54] Yeah, so what he's saying is...

[49:56] They got off the shelf toys and put it in the game.

[49:58] Which they did that a lot.

[50:00] That really didn't...

[50:02] They did that all the way up into the mid-2000s.

[50:05] Yeah, they did that in the Simpsons pinball.

[50:07] I mean, Iron Munger is a toy that they cut the feet off of and put in for Iron Man.

[50:12] And the movie flopped.

[50:14] So I guarantee they had a lot of these extra toys just laying around.

[50:17] But it's not a bad game.

[50:19] It's got a cool double flipper thing on the right side with two flipper buttons.

[50:23] So this is like one of those games...

[50:26] This is one of the ones where like Sega, Daddy's, where people are like,

[50:29] this is actually like a really good game.

[50:31] And a lot of that comes from the design and the rules, right?

[50:34] Like together they come together quite well.

[50:36] My podcast mate on the Slap Toe podcast, Bruce, he loves this game.

[50:39] Huh!

[50:40] The thing is, I like you can hold the right flipper up, the main flipper.

[50:45] So then you have the little...

[50:46] It falls onto the little mini flipper.

[50:48] You use the second button and then hit that and it will...

[50:51] If it's adjusted right, it'll almost go...

[50:53] Always go into the saucer.

[50:55] And the upper left, that's hard to hit.

[50:57] There's like a bash toy that like rises up front of the ramp.

[51:01] He's like the brain bug, which is like the smart bug of some sort.

[51:06] It's kind of neat.

[51:07] It's kind of a neat game.

[51:08] The artism.

[51:09] It's a friggin' mess.

[51:12] It's terror...

[51:14] Like we joke about Daddy Easton's second art.

[51:18] But this is on a whole other level of terrible.

[51:21] Your comments to David Dennis could be sent to Silver Ball Chronicles at E-mail.com.

[51:26] Even the art on the...

[51:29] On the...

[51:30] The flyer is terrible.

[51:31] Oh, I wonder if they...

[51:32] Oh, I wonder if they trademark this.

[51:34] New tri-flipper action.

[51:37] Tri-flipper.

[51:38] I don't see the little register trademark symbol next to it.

[51:41] So I think it's time to trademark that sucker right there.

[51:45] Do you want to know more?

[51:46] Another high action, high powered adrenaline pumping pinball from the team

[51:51] that brought you space jam and the Star Wars special edition.

[51:54] Yeah.

[51:55] The adrenaline pumping space jam.

[51:58] Be a trooper.

[52:01] Moving life, fire warrior, bug assault battle simulator.

[52:06] Come on, you apes.

[52:07] Do you want to live forever?

[52:09] That must be in the movie somewhere.

[52:11] It does, yeah.

[52:12] So I'm gonna say that the game does very much feel and look like the actual movie.

[52:23] Like, you know what I mean?

[52:24] Like it is over the top.

[52:25] It's silly.

[52:26] There's a lot of the toys and the whole thing.

[52:28] It has family adjustments.

[52:31] I take it that means like a family mode of some kind.

[52:33] What is that mean?

[52:34] Yeah, the swearing bass.

[52:35] Less blood or something.

[52:36] Less swearing.

[52:37] So the movie was quite over the top.

[52:39] Well, this brings us to...

[52:41] And you had mentioned it before.

[52:42] Godzilla.

[52:43] The licensed radioactive monster theme.

[52:46] 1998.

[52:47] Joe's.

[52:48] Joe Balser and Kamenkao.

[52:50] It's basically the same team that did the last one.

[52:53] This is based on the film, Godzilla.

[52:58] Has he used Godzilla fan myself watching that movie is painful.

[53:02] I remember seeing this film once and being like, eh, wasn't that great.

[53:05] It did have a decent cast.

[53:07] Matthew Broderick.

[53:09] Jay Rennell.

[53:10] It didn't serve one purpose.

[53:11] And that people, a lot of people don't realize they think Godzilla movies,

[53:14] they just think of all the campy 60s, 70s, Godzilla movies.

[53:17] They were making them in the 90s.

[53:19] And there's some of the best Godzilla movies they ever made.

[53:22] In the 90s.

[53:23] And then they cut it off.

[53:24] Right.

[53:25] Because they even told all wanted to have an American-made Godzilla to see what the US, you know,

[53:31] the premier filmmakers of the universe could do with their property.

[53:35] So they kind of ended their 90s series.

[53:38] And then we made this horrible film.

[53:41] Yeah, well, TriStar had announced that it planned on making a trilogy of Godzilla films.

[53:47] But this was the only one that made-

[53:49] But because this movie was so bad, and the guy did the movie didn't even like Godzilla.

[53:52] That's a fun thing.

[53:53] But it's because this movie was so bad,

[53:55] we got the Toho Millennium series where they brought Godzilla back.

[53:59] It's like, you guys totally f this up.

[54:01] So we're just gonna make our own Godzilla movies again.

[54:04] I mean, it had a budget of about 130, 150 million.

[54:07] And it did 380 million in the boss.

[54:09] So it made money.

[54:11] I don't care.

[54:12] It's terrible.

[54:13] I just remember at the end that Godzilla laid eggs in Madison Square Garden.

[54:18] I just, I just remember they're chasing him and he's running away.

[54:22] And then they lose him in New York City.

[54:24] We lost him.

[54:25] Where did he go?

[54:26] Really?

[54:27] How do you lose Godzilla?

[54:28] How do you lose so stupid?

[54:29] He was more dinosaur-y.

[54:31] Yes.

[54:32] I do remember that as opposed to Godzilla lizard-like thing.

[54:37] The game on the other hand.

[54:38] Super mega awesome.

[54:40] I like the game.

[54:41] Never played it.

[54:42] I like all these different multi balls.

[54:44] I'm trying to remember what they were all called.

[54:46] They all have specific names.

[54:49] 45 years of Godzilla history.

[54:52] We're gonna take a big steaming dump on.

[54:55] Now, the one thing about this game is though that it only has one ramp.

[55:00] It looks like it has a lot of stuff in it when it really doesn't.

[55:03] It doesn't have stuff that really interacts in any way.

[55:06] So we're in 97 now.

[55:08] I'm sorry, we're in 98 now.

[55:10] And this is where we are on almost a full death story.

[55:13] Yeah, they're hurting.

[55:14] Everyone's hurting.

[55:15] Joe would say that we went into the mindset on Godzilla to make more of a street friendly game

[55:19] where he didn't have a lot of max on it or a lot of things to fail or to maintain.

[55:24] It turned out to be a pretty good shooting game.

[55:26] I do get a lot of good comments on Godzilla.

[55:29] And here we are 20 years later and people still enjoy shooting Godzilla.

[55:32] It was made more for a downsized game, even though it looked loaded.

[55:36] So they were able to make it, they put some stuff in there, but that stuff doesn't actually move and do it.

[55:41] Yeah, it's got a cool Godzilla head.

[55:42] Yeah, and that toy is really nice.

[55:44] It sits up there really, really well.

[55:46] And it's got the big green ramp.

[55:48] It just sort of like loops around right to left.

[55:51] It's kind of weird.

[55:52] Oh, I'm sorry, it left and then it kind of zig-zags back.

[55:56] Well, it's got monster ramps.

[55:58] It says so.

[55:59] Yeah, but it's only one ramp.

[56:01] Feel the rumble.

[56:02] That must have a shaker motor in it.

[56:04] It says the movie didn't do all that great.

[56:06] So a lot of the times the game doesn't do the numbers you thought it was.

[56:10] You thought it would because the movie didn't do the numbers you thought it would.

[56:15] So Godzilla might be a good example of that.

[56:18] Yeah, I was trying to tell you it flopped.

[56:20] I don't care how much money it made.

[56:22] It was not light at all.

[56:24] You can tell how good a movie is by like the second weekend.

[56:28] Because the first people from the first weekend will go back to school or work or with their friends.

[56:32] They'll be like, you have to see this movie.

[56:35] And then people in the second week will go to see even more than maybe than the first week or at least remain the same.

[56:41] When that second week just falls off a cliff, you know you're in trouble.

[56:45] And that's very much what happened to Godzilla.

[56:47] Go watch it if you want to waste a couple hours of your life.

[56:50] Matthew Broderick's pretty good though.

[56:52] But it was South Park though.

[56:53] That's a killer theme.

[56:54] That was a killer.

[56:55] February of 99.

[56:57] This is a big deal.

[56:58] Now I remember, I was again, I was in middle school during this time.

[57:01] This is really at the beginning of South Park.

[57:04] I think there were probably two seasons in.

[57:06] Yeah, they were early into it.

[57:08] IPDB says that there's 2,200 units sold of this.

[57:11] I don't know how they know that.

[57:13] This is Joe Kamenkao, Joe Balcer again, art by David Lincoln, Jason Dominic.

[57:17] Music and sound by Kyle Johnson, software and eel falconer, Orin Day and Lonnie Rob.

[57:23] So these guys, there's some new names on here.

[57:27] You can tell by the art, super, super good.

[57:30] This is based on South Park.

[57:33] The animated film from, was it Cartoon Network?

[57:36] No, the animated show.

[57:38] Right, I'm sorry, the animated show.

[57:40] I don't think the movie was out yet.

[57:42] It was created by Tray Parker and Matt Stone.

[57:45] And it was developed for Comedy Central.

[57:48] It stars three kids, Stan Kyle, Eric and Kenny.

[57:53] And they live in a small town in Colorado.

[57:56] You all know what South Park is.

[57:58] If you're listening to this, you don't know what South Park is.

[58:00] You might as well watch it.

[58:01] You can skip the first couple of seasons because they're not really that great.

[58:04] They're more vulgar.

[58:05] When they get into sort of that middle seasons, kind of somewhere around like post 2006,

[58:12] it really takes off with social commentary and some amazing characters that you'll always remember.

[58:18] Good, you guys.

[58:19] I'm Gary Han.

[58:20] Big fan of South Park.

[58:21] Didn't quite get it when I was younger, but now that I'm older, I definitely, definitely get it.

[58:26] This game was a struggle to make.

[58:28] Gary Stern did not want to make South Park.

[58:31] It was difficult because it's cartoons, it's vulgar.

[58:37] He wanted, Joe Balser wanted a toilet on the play field.

[58:41] That was pretty hard to get by Gary Stern.

[58:43] Not a fan of the poop jokes, I think.

[58:45] Not just a toilet, but a literal piece of like a turd comes out of the toilet.

[58:50] Mr. Hankey.

[58:51] They had a hard time with the Simpsons.

[58:53] Simpsons was very like, ooh, risk A.

[58:56] And then you moved into, how do you up the Simpsons?

[58:59] You up the Simpsons with South Park?

[59:01] And then how do you up sort of the Simpsons and South Park while you try family guy?

[59:06] Then you move on to the next level.

[59:07] It's Rick and Morty.

[59:08] Yeah.

[59:09] Things are escalating quite a bit here over the 90s.

[59:12] Well, there was some really cool bits and pieces about South Park.

[59:16] Joe Balser would say, we had a blast putting South Park together.

[59:20] There are these parts in the game that are right over the line.

[59:23] It's the first and more likely the last game to have a talking poop on the play field.

[59:29] So Mr. Hankey pops out of the play field.

[59:34] Yes, he does.

[59:35] One thing I do want to talk about Ron, brown inserts.

[59:38] Yeah, if you're gonna have, you're gonna have poo.

[59:40] You need some brown inserts, don't you?

[59:42] So they had to go to a plastic provider and ask specifically for brown inserts.

[59:47] They don't just make brown inserts.

[59:49] You know what I mean?

[59:50] Like that red or green or blue or purple.

[59:52] Apparently this really confused the plastic provider, but they were able to get them their brown inserts.

[59:57] They had to custom make the brown inserts.

[01:00:00] So the flyer here, how are they promoting this game on the flyer?

[01:00:07] It's pretty weak, honestly.

[01:00:09] They just got stock stuff from the show.

[01:00:13] Then it's safe home adjustments.

[01:00:15] I guess that means you can change stuff so it's safe for the home.

[01:00:20] Yeah, a little less risk A but I mean the poop is still there.

[01:00:23] Custom speech just for this game.

[01:00:26] Hilarious soundtrack and lots of fun, multi ball play.

[01:00:30] I like the topper.

[01:00:31] Topper is great.

[01:00:33] It's Cartman and then it has the disclaimer.

[01:00:36] Yeah, which it says like this game should not be played by anyone.

[01:00:39] Yeah, yeah.

[01:00:40] This game still earns on location.

[01:00:43] Sega's and data east in general, so that reiteration before stern today.

[01:00:49] Probably their best earning game of all time.

[01:00:51] Shrape Parker, Matt Stone, Custom speech, and Isekase Custom speech.

[01:00:57] So much fun.

[01:00:58] Now the operator and the owner can change it to a G rating, a TV 14 rating, or a TV MA for adults.

[01:01:08] So that's what they're talking about on the thing there by adding that adult mode.

[01:01:11] Now around this time Williams was working on pinball 2000.

[01:01:16] South Park came out around pinball 2000 and they thought Joe Balser thought they did a hell of a job with pinball 2000.

[01:01:24] It was quite brilliant in fact.

[01:01:26] So what they did is they would always check play meter and they would check coin up magazine.

[01:01:31] Now these were industry magazines that had sales numbers and things like that.

[01:01:35] What's this coin app magazines?

[01:01:38] So like any coin app magazine?

[01:01:40] Right, exactly.

[01:01:41] So they would look for these sales numbers and game ratings and reviews because that's kind of what you would do before the internet times.

[01:01:49] You know, you would you would go out hunting and you'd bring home the play meter magazine and you'd sit at home and start a fire in your living room.

[01:01:58] And South Park came out as number one and Sega was the small guy.

[01:02:04] So to say the least Joe Balser and the team were really, really happy that they were to out shoot something as cool and new as pinball 2000.

[01:02:12] And I'm sure Joe Camicabal will remind you of this every opportunity over and over.

[01:02:18] It will be on his tombstone. Remember that time we killed Williams.

[01:02:21] We beat Williams. We're still around. They're not. We win.

[01:02:25] Staker extreme was the next game. Now this was the the Stern pinball ink game and it's not licensed.

[01:02:33] Yeah, it's the first turn game and there's to make it known everything's stern stern.

[01:02:38] I think the guys weren't a stern shirt lots of stern.

[01:02:45] Okay, all right. Where do I start the top here?

[01:02:49] Yes. Okay. Becoming a pro cronies the perfect way to say thanks and it starts at $3 a month.

[01:02:55] Want to get early access to episodes before everyone else? Have a strange love for stickers?

[01:03:00] Do you know what a discord is? Interested in having your comments and questions take priority on our episodes?

[01:03:05] Jump on. Wait a minute. This is on twice.

[01:03:08] Idiot.

[01:03:09] Oh boy. You can't what you paid for. I guess. All right. Hold on.

[01:03:12] Jump on is $6 a month premium crony. What all the other perks and a shirt after three months join us at 20 bucks a month as an Ellie

[01:03:21] Needest crony. Wow. Can I buy money now?

[01:03:29] We spoke about this game in the Keith P Johnson episode because this was Keith's first game at Stern.

[01:03:36] So you can find out all about it there, but it was originally called soccer explosion 2000.

[01:03:41] And you thought soccer extreme or striker extreme was a bad name soccer explosion 2000s even worse.

[01:03:48] This is around that era where everything was like 2000 and millennia because we're getting close to the millennium.

[01:03:55] I like strike your extreme name. I like that name. You like that name? I like that.

[01:03:59] This is the first newly designed pinball machine under the Stern pinball ink banner. Joe had no idea, but he originally designed it to be a theme of October fast.

[01:04:12] Joe had the game fully laid out ready to go. Gary Stern came to in a meeting one day and said Joe we really need you to make a soccer theme.

[01:04:21] There's one thing that Americans love is soccer. We do. I know they just needed to make a soccer.

[01:04:28] So Joe added some elements to change the theme from October fest to striker extreme.

[01:04:34] Yeah, the soccer goalie was originally the October fest bar.

[01:04:37] Oh, well, we'll get to that in a little while. How about the next one? High roller casino. I've played high roller casino.

[01:04:45] It's okay. It's got that it's got that weird early Stern thing. It's very weird. We don't know how many units. This was from January of 2001.

[01:04:54] This is designed by John Norris Joe Balser and Keith Johnson, art by Kevin O'Connor and John Yousey. Music and sound by Kyle Johnson, software Lonnie Rob, Dwight Sullivan, Keith P. Johnson.

[01:05:06] Well, it was just it was designed by John Norris until he left. Right. So this is a John Norris game and basically finished up by Joe Balser.

[01:05:14] And Joe Balser says when John left, the game was slated to be one of the next games up for production. When we looked at it and engineering, there were issues with the layout mechanically, the way the ball flowed, the way things were working on the initial layout.

[01:05:26] We saw some issues as a group and said, you know what? Let's clean it up for production. That's pretty much what my job was. Ouch! You kind of craps on it there, doesn't it?

[01:05:34] What's saying it didn't really work? Yeah, it was like, it's not really that good of a game. So we just cleaned it up for production. Now I would be interested to know how much of that has been and how much of that is actually.

[01:05:44] You always have to clean a game up for production, right? That's not unusual that you have to make this target a little smaller, this one a little bigger, whatever.

[01:05:52] But I mean, that sounds like there's a little bit of shade being thrown there. What do you think?

[01:05:57] Soccer is not really a thing in the States, but the NFL is. That's one thing I know. They re-themed Striker Extreme to be NFL and you could pick your own team.

[01:06:05] Okay, so that's basically what it is. That's from November of 2001. This is where we get into what really matters, though.

[01:06:11] Oh boy.

[01:06:12] The Simpsons Pinball Party.

[01:06:15] February of 2003 based on the famous license Simpsons cartoon.

[01:06:21] Joe Balser, Keith P. Johnson on design, art by Kevin O'Connor and Margaret Hudson, use a can sound Chris Granner, software Keith P. Johnson.

[01:06:30] We spoke about this game at length in our Keith Johnson episode. So you're going to want to go over there to get a real deep dive.

[01:06:38] I want to get some stuff here from Joe's perspective because as much as this is Keith's baby, it's also Joe's baby.

[01:06:45] This is where I would bring in Joe is a bit of the king of clunk because this is a clunky game, but it is fun nonetheless.

[01:06:51] What about the theme? What does he think about the theme? Let's start there.

[01:06:54] Well, Joe says we really spent a good amount of time on trying to get the elements right.

[01:06:58] We had to have the couch to have the beginning of every episode where you go into the house and end up on the couch.

[01:07:03] We had to have itchie and scratchy in there, the cookie mark. Keith Johnson was a huge Simpsons guy. He had a lot that he wanted to put in the game.

[01:07:11] There you go. Again, Joe is giving all the credit to Keith, just like how on Lord of the Rings, a lot of the credit from George Gomez goes to Keith.

[01:07:20] This was Keith's vision and it was Joe working with him that brought it all together.

[01:07:26] And I would say in a very, very game, very good game. Would you say that the Simpsons is the ultimate clunker?

[01:07:33] No, because the upper playfield is good.

[01:07:36] The upper playfield is phenomenal. The ramp around the bar, the the the the Duffman ramp.

[01:07:46] Duffman. I really like that. The orbits are pretty good. It's just kind of the center middle kind of get.

[01:07:53] It gets a little stop and go clunky there.

[01:07:56] Delphi again, the crusty spinner.

[01:07:57] Oh, yeah, the crusty spinner is awesome, but that left side ramp is terrible.

[01:08:03] This is not and I repeat not the side ramps of Joe Balcer's first game.

[01:08:10] No, at all.

[01:08:12] No, this is not a Baywatch side ramp. I didn't even know there was a side ramp.

[01:08:16] You just hit it and it kind of disappears if it actually works.

[01:08:21] But Joe says it's one of my favorite games I ever got to put together.

[01:08:25] You know how good a game is when you shoot the whitewood and it's fun.

[01:08:28] That's a big tell from the design sign. No art, no sound, no light shows.

[01:08:32] You're just shooting a ball around on a whitewood.

[01:08:34] I just felt that and so did a lot of guys in engineering that this was going to be a good one.

[01:08:38] And it just got better.

[01:08:40] I mean, it's a fun layout. It's just clunky. Like not every that's the thing, right?

[01:08:44] Everybody thinks clunky is like this negative thing.

[01:08:47] They're going to be like, oh, Joe Balcer, the king of clunk, Dave is throwing some shade here.

[01:08:52] Look at that. Like tell, trust me, it not every game has to be flowy and this and that to be a fun and good game.

[01:09:00] The Simpsons is an example of that.

[01:09:03] The Simpsons is probably one of the greatest games ever made, but it is clunky nonetheless.

[01:09:09] But it was around this time the Joe actually leaves pinball.

[01:09:13] The Simpsons was 90, about 95% done when Joe decided to move on from Stern pinball.

[01:09:19] He went out and started a company that was still in coin up, but it was away from pinball.

[01:09:25] Did a lot of like redemption games stuff? You want to say it?

[01:09:29] No, there may have been other reasons he stepped away from pinball.

[01:09:33] Joe had some personal issues that he wanted to take care of and he decided the best thing to do was to take some time away.

[01:09:38] Which we will not get into here.

[01:09:41] So it was a few years and Joe ended up coming back to pinball.

[01:09:45] Well, he had heard that there was this company coming around, started by Jack Gwynnary, who is known as Jersey Jack.

[01:09:54] And that's where we get into Jersey Jack pinball, the pinball company.

[01:09:58] Joe says, Jack had been in touch with me and that was one of his first hires to come over and start Jersey Jack pinball with him.

[01:10:04] One night we went to dinner with a couple others and it been with the company since the beginning.

[01:10:08] Jack said he had a surprise for me that night.

[01:10:11] We're sitting there just before dinner and I turn around and there's Keith Johnson.

[01:10:15] Jack was putting together what he thought was the best team.

[01:10:18] Jack knew the success of Simpsons. There were some hugs and here we were. Again going to do something great.

[01:10:24] If we were sitting down you and I and said, Ron, I got a surprise for you.

[01:10:28] I'd run and you turned around and you saw Keith Johnson.

[01:10:33] How would you react? I'd be like, I hope you're not mad about our episode.

[01:10:38] I love Keith Johnson. I think Keith Johnson is an amazing guy.

[01:10:43] And trust me, at this time, if you're telling me that you're getting the band back together that made probably one of the best games ever in the Simpsons pinball party,

[01:10:52] come on. And it was Wizard of Oz that would come out of this. Now there's probably somewhere around what like 3000 dish.

[01:10:59] There's a lot of them. They made so many runs of this game. There's a lot of them.

[01:11:03] So we had talked in the Keith Johnson episode about how this game was not necessarily made for me.

[01:11:08] It was not necessarily made for location. I did play it on my way down to Fantastic this year in a bar called Arcadia in Portland, Maine.

[01:11:19] Definitely go to this bar. It is awesome. I spent a good deal of time playing it there.

[01:11:24] And you know what? You do kind of got to get into it a little more as opposed to kind of just flipping it in a really loud room at a convention.

[01:11:34] Awesome. This is April of 2013. So it's been quite a few years since Joe has released a design.

[01:11:41] Art by Jerry Vanderselt, Greg Ferres and Matt Rice.

[01:11:48] Sorry, Matt.

[01:11:50] I'm going to go to that.

[01:11:53] Rice is stir.

[01:11:55] Rice stir.

[01:11:56] Music is sound by Chris Granner and Rob Barry.

[01:11:59] Oh, yeah, you get Chris Granner and Rob Barry. And I get Jerry Vanderselt and animation by Jean Paul DeWin.

[01:12:05] Jean Paul.

[01:12:06] Jean Paul.

[01:12:07] Say it like that.

[01:12:08] Software by Keith Johnson.

[01:12:09] Jean Paul DeWin.

[01:12:10] Ted Estes, Alex, Levy, Joe Katz, and JT Harkey.

[01:12:15] Yeah, I get the herd names. Good stuff. Anyway, Wizard of Oz. Come on. We all know Wizard of Oz.

[01:12:19] Dorothy, the dog, the witch movie. Yes. Guy behind a screen.

[01:12:23] Wizard of Oz was never going to be a small game.

[01:12:26] Jack wanted bigger. He wanted better. He wanted packed. He wanted lots of code. He wanted an LCD screen.

[01:12:33] Jack threw it all on the table.

[01:12:37] Yeah, Joe Bolster says pretty much everything we did. I spent time trying to talk him down.

[01:12:42] Do we really want to have a game with an upper play field on our as our first game?

[01:12:46] No, we want a game with two upper play fields. We want to go LED display.

[01:12:51] How big is the biggest one we can fit? What about RGB LED lighting?

[01:12:55] Yeah, let's put that in there. How about RGB LED GI? There were no limits.

[01:13:01] I think that's why they lost a ton of money and almost went bankrupt after two games.

[01:13:05] Yeah, I think that's why Jack had to sell some of his company to somebody else.

[01:13:10] Yes.

[01:13:11] But I do appreciate the attitude though.

[01:13:14] But this game is one of the games in the pinball awards Hall of Fame voted by just the regular community

[01:13:21] because people understand that this game changed the industry.

[01:13:26] It really, really did. And it's fun. It's cool. It's unique.

[01:13:30] Jersey Jack doesn't really make games like this anymore, sadly.

[01:13:33] Yes, they do. All their games are packed. Come on.

[01:13:37] It's not like this.

[01:13:39] The thing is they might have the RGB idea first, but because it took two years to make the game,

[01:13:45] I think ACDC beat it with RGB lighting.

[01:13:49] Yeah.

[01:13:50] But it was so different. It had so much more in it.

[01:13:54] And it did change the game also in pricing.

[01:13:58] Yeah, which itself is still too low.

[01:14:00] But like the play field, so if you look at the play field and the way it's structured,

[01:14:06] it's not particularly flowy.

[01:14:09] No, no.

[01:14:10] So for example, let's break down the play field in general.

[01:14:13] It's a wide body. So wide bodies tend to be floaty in general.

[01:14:17] The reason they went wide body is because you can fit more crap on the play field.

[01:14:20] The bottom third, it has like this weird kind of out-laying state fair pop bumper thing.

[01:14:29] And that was designed by Nordman.

[01:14:33] And it's kind of like a mini game to save your ball, which is really cool.

[01:14:38] There's the Toto Rollovers on the outside, which is another mini game.

[01:14:42] Then it's fairly kind of standard, but there's lots packed in there.

[01:14:46] And because there's lots packed in specifically on the left side of the play field,

[01:14:50] it's hard to get the ball kind of moving and flowing back to the flippers.

[01:14:56] There is the main one ramp in the middle.

[01:14:59] You shoot that and it kind of flows around through what is it like?

[01:15:02] Like Munchkin Town, Munchkinville, Munchkin Bird.

[01:15:07] This game was built to be the anti-stern because Darcy Jack with pinball sales is other company.

[01:15:15] Was the top Stern distributor.

[01:15:17] And he didn't like their direction.

[01:15:19] They went with the stripped down games.

[01:15:22] So his whole gimmick was we're going to have just everything in this thing.

[01:15:26] And this is probably why you see Stern not having any mega dealers anymore.

[01:15:31] Dealers tend to be big, but not mega dealers.

[01:15:33] The thing is, I mean, even things like all the sculpts in the game are custom.

[01:15:37] There's nothing off a store rack in this game.

[01:15:41] Yeah.

[01:15:42] The pop-upers have trees that are holding apples, my favorite part of the game.

[01:15:45] I bring that up every time, but I just think it's the cutest thing.

[01:15:48] How would you like it if someone took an apple off you?

[01:15:51] Love those stuff.

[01:15:52] I will say both upper play fields play great.

[01:15:55] Hey, pinheads.

[01:15:56] I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not doing this podcast and making bad jokes,

[01:16:00] I'm Dave, the financial guy.

[01:16:56] And those are again all kind of the hands of Joe Balser, right?

[01:17:02] But it's clunky.

[01:17:03] But it's not a bad game because it's clunky.

[01:17:06] Flowey games, I think, probably do better on location and are much more forgiving

[01:17:10] because you can kind of pick it up and be like, I'm a pinball superstar.

[01:17:14] This one, you got to be a good pinball player to really get a lot out of it.

[01:17:18] And that's okay.

[01:17:19] Yeah, I know people play this forever. I never could.

[01:17:21] This game would destroy me.

[01:17:23] It's, yeah, it's because you got to stop it and hold it and be precise with your shots

[01:17:27] and things like that.

[01:17:29] When it comes to adding a little more open play field,

[01:17:34] that's where we get into the Hobbit.

[01:17:36] This is the licensed fantasy film theme from April of 2013.

[01:17:41] Wonderful, wonderful game.

[01:17:43] It's Joe Balser, Jean Paul DeWin, Eric Minier on Mechanics.

[01:17:48] And he's somebody that'll pop up way in the future.

[01:17:51] Music by two steps from hell.

[01:17:54] There's a private production music company.

[01:17:58] Yeah.

[01:17:59] They actually did really well considering there are no Chris Granner or a David Thiel.

[01:18:03] But it's still pretty good.

[01:18:05] It's still pretty good.

[01:18:06] Software Keith Johnson, Ted Estes, Alex Levy, Joe Katz, JT Harkeley.

[01:18:10] Very, very cool.

[01:18:12] They did make a lot of changes to the style in this game.

[01:18:18] So for example, on the Hobbit, they went in a bit of a different direction than they had with Wizard of Oz.

[01:18:26] They went for something with a little more open play field and a lot less clunky.

[01:18:30] But because it's his wide body, the ball does lumber around.

[01:18:34] It doesn't it?

[01:18:35] Is that a good way to put it?

[01:18:36] It just kind of lazily makes its way around the play field.

[01:18:39] The drop targets are weird and so loud.

[01:18:42] The drop targets are weird.

[01:18:43] Now these are all individually controlled drop targets.

[01:18:46] So it's not just the bank.

[01:18:48] It's like each one can come up and down.

[01:18:50] So that means each one needs a coil.

[01:18:52] It's got four of these play field troll style pop ups, which I think are actually very cool.

[01:18:57] I really kind of like those.

[01:18:58] So you roll through an in lane and it pops up a certain troll.

[01:19:02] It's kind of like a hurry up.

[01:19:03] It's really neat.

[01:19:04] Stern's version of a hurry up is like shoot this ramp or shoot this target.

[01:19:08] Where Jersey Jack was like, no, no, no, no.

[01:19:10] Each one is going to have a pop up and each one is going to be hurry up.

[01:19:13] It's very cool.

[01:19:14] It tends to end up in a bunch of multi balls at the same time, which is a bit unfortunate.

[01:19:19] But the play field itself is kind of neat.

[01:19:21] What do you think?

[01:19:22] Just the layout.

[01:19:23] Let's talk about the Joe balls or stuff.

[01:19:25] Um.

[01:19:26] It's okay.

[01:19:28] Okay.

[01:19:29] So the upper flipper.

[01:19:31] People complain about the upper right flipper that shoots into the dwarf drop targets.

[01:19:36] Yeah.

[01:19:37] So it's over by smell.

[01:19:38] I know someone on a forum there.

[01:19:39] Their forum name was Hobbit's upper flipper or something.

[01:19:42] I thought that was like growing the greatest names ever.

[01:19:45] Yeah.

[01:19:46] Pretty useless guy.

[01:19:47] Pretty useless on the forums.

[01:19:48] Well, speaking of upper flippers, according to Joe Balser, he says we changed the game and got rid of the upper left flipper.

[01:19:55] So it's supposed to have four flippers.

[01:19:57] They would have two upper flippers that are completely one thing that I thought of that never made into programming was if you use the flippers like two different swords.

[01:20:05] Because the game is all about different swords.

[01:20:07] If you made that shot, the kill shot from the upper right flipper, it would be worth big money compared to if you just made the shot when you weren't qualified.

[01:20:15] It had more meaning in my head than how it came out as a final product.

[01:20:19] I guess that's probably the best way to put it.

[01:20:21] You can see that it just didn't come together.

[01:20:23] Whatever they had planned for that flipper just didn't come together.

[01:20:26] So I mean, as much as it is kind of useless and a waste of build of materials, I mean, I get it.

[01:20:32] Hobbit has clunk, but it's a different kind of clunk. Is that fair?

[01:20:35] Yeah, I guess you could say that.

[01:20:37] I mean, it's got smog.

[01:20:39] He's cool.

[01:20:40] I like the ramps in the middle. It's kind of neat how it works.

[01:20:43] It's kind of, I wish one of the ramps was more to the right and maybe forward.

[01:20:46] I wish there was maybe another ramp instead of two vertical upkickers on either side.

[01:20:51] Like there's some things that I would change, but it's fine and it's unique and different, which is Joe's kind of call sign.

[01:20:58] All of his playfields are like different.

[01:21:00] And it's heavy. It's ridiculously heavy because all those troll max it has so heavy.

[01:21:06] Brutal. It's a good thing they didn't put that other flipper in there.

[01:21:08] You literally would need a forklift.

[01:21:10] Joe would leave Jersey Jack right around the release of this game and he became a plant manager

[01:21:16] at an assembly plant completely outside of the coin op industry.

[01:21:20] Joe would once again take some time away from pinball, but he would eventually be lured back.

[01:21:26] This is where I think we get into the part of Joe Balser that few people really know about.

[01:21:34] This is the bread and butter Ron.

[01:21:37] Well, what does Joe say? Joe says I always had the bug to get back.

[01:21:41] And I had an opportunity with this new company called American Pinball to finish a project.

[01:21:46] Yeah. So the so American pinball is this company that kind of came up at a nowhere.

[01:21:52] They all kind of wanted to everybody for some reason had noticed that that pinball was on an upswing.

[01:22:00] And some people wanted to get in on that upswing.

[01:22:04] So American pinball is a company located in the Chicago metropolitan area, which is of course the pinball capital of the world.

[01:22:13] American pinball is a company whose sole mission is to provide the highest quality pinball machines in the world.

[01:22:20] Everything they do at American pinball is done with their customer in mind and to produce a product that will that the customer will fall in love with and enjoy for a lifetime.

[01:22:32] And this may or may not be from their website.

[01:22:34] It's just right from the corporate website.

[01:22:36] The American pinball team has been listening to the pinball community and is driven to design pinball machines that appeal to the collector, the pinball player, and the commercial operator.

[01:22:46] Everybody with a heartbeat, I guess is what they mean there.

[01:22:49] American pinball prides themselves in delivering a quality product that can meet the demand and expectations of their clients.

[01:22:56] Wow.

[01:22:57] That's where the magic happens.

[01:23:00] That's where the magic happens.

[01:23:03] It was in the end of 2016 when the team at American pinball kind of decided to wade in.

[01:23:13] So if we actually go into what American pinball is, it really is a small pinball manufacturer and it was launched in 2015 by by devil Vassani.

[01:23:23] He really stepped into rescue John Papaduke over his whole zidware implosion.

[01:23:29] They would start to work with Papaduke on Houdini on a concept pinball machine.

[01:23:34] The pinball trends at the time were really starting on the upswing and he picked the wrong guy though.

[01:23:42] Did he ever ask?

[01:23:43] Let's talk about that a little bit.

[01:23:45] So we talked about John Papaduke in American pinball and Houdini in our John Papaduke episode.

[01:23:50] But let's go through just a kind of a brief refresher here.

[01:23:54] Basically, there was an original Houdini and John Papaduke ran into some problems with his company zidware and to generate some money and to help manufacture his magic girl pinball machine.

[01:24:11] Papaduke started working with American pinball when the John Papaduke American pinball relationship collapsed.

[01:24:19] It was Joe Balser who was brought in to try to salvage John Papaduke's design on Houdini and make it profitable.

[01:24:26] Joe said, I came to find out they had a big black cloud over their head early on.

[01:24:31] There's a lot of issues working with John Papaduke trying to get his game out to customers.

[01:24:36] Once I found out a lot of the history of that, there was only one way to go start over with American pinball with a game quickly, something that people enjoy.

[01:24:44] Basically, they're like, hey, Joe Balser, you're a great pinball designer.

[01:24:49] You've got some experience with Jersey Jack helping them start up a pinball company.

[01:24:54] We were working with John Papaduke and it has gone very poorly.

[01:24:58] Can you come in here try to salvage this product?

[01:25:02] Joe Balser sits back and goes, oh my god, this is crap. We got to start all over again.

[01:25:06] Yeah, Joe said there was a layoff for Houdini, but honestly, the shots didn't go anywhere.

[01:25:10] It was more kind of put together for more of a show me type of thing for the artwork, not for an actual mechanical working game.

[01:25:17] Ownership insisted on bringing it to a show.

[01:25:20] The wheels kind of were falling off because people were looking at the play field and knowing it wasn't really a complete play field.

[01:25:25] I remember that, you know, one show they brought it to.

[01:25:28] It was behind ropes and stuff so you couldn't get too close to it.

[01:25:31] Probably because they knew it didn't work.

[01:25:33] Go in and look at the sources on our website for the John Papaduke episode.

[01:25:38] There's where you've got links to the old Houdini images.

[01:25:41] And you can find those at SilverballCronicles.com.

[01:25:44] Can you know what the crazy thing is?

[01:25:46] After this whole thing with Papaduke, he still got hired by Deep Root to get hired by Deep Root.

[01:25:52] It's amazing.

[01:25:54] The show had met with American pinball owners and they wanted to start all over again.

[01:25:59] He said he could save the money on tooling by using the same ramps.

[01:26:03] But he wanted to staff up to get Houdini out of the door from November and get it ready to show at the Texas pinball festival the following March.

[01:26:14] Ron, that's a five month turner for a brand new design.

[01:26:18] Manufacturer of the game, staff up.

[01:26:21] The ownership actually told Joe that there must be something wrong with him because there's no way they could do it in five months.

[01:26:27] Joe would say we had a factory with no line.

[01:26:30] We had no employees. That was a pretty aggressive thing to say.

[01:26:33] I mean, we are building everything but we don't have a line.

[01:26:36] We didn't have a lot of things set up.

[01:26:38] We didn't have a front office. No procurement. Nothing was there.

[01:26:41] We had seen over the last few years company taking two, three, four, five years to get that game to market.

[01:26:47] I mean, his other company, Jersey Jack, they took, I think about two years.

[01:26:52] Two years.

[01:26:53] And they stumbled along the way. Like Joe is basically saying no, we're getting everything up.

[01:26:57] I don't think he gets a lot of credit for this.

[01:26:59] Joe Balser is only seen as the guy who made the games at American pinball, which are okay.

[01:27:06] And the guy who did the Simpson's pinball already.

[01:27:08] He does not get enough credit for being really the man that brought API, American pinball to what it is.

[01:27:16] And I hope that this episode, you know, even though his designs are clunky, he gets some credit because he deserves it.

[01:27:23] It was really, really difficult to get talent at this time. I don't think people understand that.

[01:27:28] If you're going to get engineers or production managers or programmers, I mean, everyone is at Stern that you'd want.

[01:27:34] And everybody who's not at Stern who you'd want is at Jersey Jack.

[01:27:39] All these companies have been together for 15, 20 years, big companies.

[01:27:44] And they're just going to start at a nowhere.

[01:27:47] Well, one of the names that they brought in was a guy named Josh Kugler.

[01:27:51] Josh says the truth of the matter is that Joe knows a lot of people.

[01:27:55] And he got a lot of people to do favors and bend over backwards and break rules to do things to help us get Houdini down in four months.

[01:28:02] As he undersells it, pinball is not as easy as people think. It's hard to find people who know what they're doing.

[01:28:08] He called in the favors. Well, Texas pinball festival 2016 rolled around and Houdini was revealed.

[01:28:17] Yeah, remember that.

[01:28:18] Here's a funny story. Three Houdinis arrive at Texas pinball festival.

[01:28:23] They had tons and tons of extra parts, right? Because you're scared that stuff's going to break.

[01:28:28] You want to get it fixed? They forgot pinballs. They didn't bring any pinballs.

[01:28:34] So they literally had to rush over and buy them from Marco specialties.

[01:28:39] Yeah, Marco Sputh. I was there for that. That was charming. It's endearing.

[01:28:43] You know, they played though. All the games played fine.

[01:28:46] They didn't completely fall apart. They didn't either parts.

[01:28:49] American pinball told customers they were going to ship in 2017 and on December 30th, 2017, they shipped three Houdini pinball.

[01:28:56] I mean, that's stretching it a little bit.

[01:28:59] Yeah, I remember. Yeah, they it's like, what we got them out? We got them out.

[01:29:02] You know, you got two days. You got three machines out for two days.

[01:29:06] But you know, good for them. That's, you know, it's nice. They did it.

[01:29:11] They struggled a bit, but they did it. It's pretty impressive.

[01:29:14] Now Houdini Master of Mystery that of course came out in December of 17, but really 2018.

[01:29:20] We don't know how many units were made. It's designed by Joe Balser, art by Jeff Bush, and Matt Rister, or animation by Ish Rannis.

[01:29:29] Music and Sound by Matt Kern and software by Josh Kugler.

[01:29:34] I've played, I wouldn't say a lot of Houdini. I've played, I've played Houdini a few times.

[01:29:39] It's okay. The theme, well, it's, it's an unlicensed theme, but it's based on basically some open intellectual property.

[01:29:47] It's named after Harry Houdini. Harry Houdini or Eric Weiss from 1874 to 1926

[01:29:57] was an Hungarian American scape artist, illusionist and stunt performer.

[01:30:03] He did a lot of really cool magicie stuff back in the day.

[01:30:07] So what they did is they basically took all of his famous magicie stuff and made each one of those kind of a mode around the game.

[01:30:15] Which I think is actually quite ingenious because you don't have to pay for a license and you can kind of do what you want.

[01:30:21] So it's licensed-ish theme.

[01:30:24] And they had a custom back box with a weird like curvy shape.

[01:30:28] Yeah, the art's pretty good. I mean, it's not as cool as J-pop's original sort of art, but it's cool. I kind of like it.

[01:30:35] Yeah, but this game actually works.

[01:30:37] The one thing though about this game is that it is clunky.

[01:30:42] It's really hard to shoot.

[01:30:45] It's really tight shots.

[01:30:47] Why did they change the art package? Why don't they just keep the art package?

[01:30:51] Well, Josh Kugler said, from my perspective, I think it was important to really separate it from John.

[01:30:56] Obviously, he was pretty toxic at that point. Joe was making changes to the play field.

[01:31:01] The art was going to require some changes.

[01:31:03] It was more about wanting to ensure that this Udini was our Houdini.

[01:31:07] Clean slate.

[01:31:08] Now people talk about the tightness on this game as tight, but findable.

[01:31:15] Did you agree?

[01:31:16] It's tight.

[01:31:17] Yeah, it rattles around a lot of those shots.

[01:31:21] But it has, when I was talking about Baywatch, the multi-stage skill shot thing.

[01:31:25] This has that in the coolest feature, which is the trunk.

[01:31:30] Oh, so cool.

[01:31:32] You shoot the ball. It goes into like a sorcery, juxtapose it over to the left side of the play field, which it goes into a catapult, and then it fires it into a trunk.

[01:31:39] And it goes from literally like the bottom left flip flipper all the way to the back corner.

[01:31:46] Like 20 inches. It's impressive.

[01:31:49] It is super cool.

[01:31:50] And it pretty much, every time I've tried it, it actually worked.

[01:31:54] So that's always a good thing.

[01:31:56] It's pretty impressive.

[01:31:57] The issue is though that there are so many shots, and they're so tight, that the rails on the machine are not like your regular kind of metal rails you see in stern.

[01:32:10] They're like literally metal like walls, because it needs to be that thin to fit all of the shots in.

[01:32:17] It's got some subway shots in there and stuff.

[01:32:19] What does Joe Balls or say about the tight shots?

[01:32:22] Well, he says, who Dean, he had this thing about tight shots.

[01:32:25] A couple of tight shots.

[01:32:26] All of them being tight shots.

[01:32:28] Tight shots are not bad shots.

[01:32:30] A tight shot is very meaningful shot.

[01:32:33] When you make it, it feels good.

[01:32:36] I mean, I know you think it's tight shots, but then the next guy you see playing, it hits a three or four times in a row.

[01:32:41] You know what? It's not that tight.

[01:32:43] You're just having a bad day.

[01:32:44] What do you think?

[01:32:45] He's saying play better.

[01:32:46] I like it.

[01:32:47] Play better.

[01:32:48] Well, can you imagine who Deany with tighter shots?

[01:32:50] Well, it originally had them.

[01:32:51] That's right.

[01:32:52] Joe Balls or would say early on, it had about half inch targets.

[01:32:57] I changed them all through the suggestion by one of my good friends.

[01:33:01] We picked an eighth of an inch of all of the shots.

[01:33:05] Every shot that had anything to do with a narrow target at each side.

[01:33:09] The shots grew.

[01:33:10] They didn't get tighter.

[01:33:12] So they took an eighth of an inch off the targets.

[01:33:15] Yeah. He has his own custom stand-up set or even narrower.

[01:33:18] So it can put more of a man.

[01:33:20] Just make one less shot.

[01:33:23] Just one.

[01:33:24] God, it's clunky.

[01:33:26] I wish this game was a little better.

[01:33:27] Also, the animations are pretty crap.

[01:33:30] Wow.

[01:33:31] Such opinions.

[01:33:32] We're here about history, not opinions.

[01:33:34] It's all opinions.

[01:33:36] Well, Josh Kugler says, it only amazes me more to look back at what we accomplished.

[01:33:40] From like November 15th to March 20th when we showed it at Texas.

[01:33:44] It's just mind-boggling to me still.

[01:33:46] What I know and now is that we actually were able to do that and pull it off

[01:33:50] and have that game where it was at that point in time.

[01:33:53] A lot of that was Joe knowing how to get things done quickly.

[01:33:57] Who to call and where to get the right help.

[01:34:00] Joe deserves the credit.

[01:34:02] And I think we're giving them some of that credit.

[01:34:05] I think if you want a game that looks pretty but may not work,

[01:34:08] John Papuadoke is your guy.

[01:34:10] If you want a game that actually can get built and we'll get built,

[01:34:13] Joe Paul serves your guy.

[01:34:14] Yeah, that's right.

[01:34:15] But it's going to be clunky.

[01:34:17] That's fine.

[01:34:18] Doesn't mean it's not fun.

[01:34:19] I think Houdini is lots of fun.

[01:34:21] I have lots of fun playing Houdini.

[01:34:23] But it is a challenging game.

[01:34:25] You got to be good.

[01:34:26] Well, Joel, Joel's thoughts on design philosophy.

[01:34:29] Joe says, my main objective as a layout designer of a game

[01:34:32] is to do the best I can to make the ball move

[01:34:35] and make the shots work to the best of my ability

[01:34:38] to fit with the game rules themselves.

[01:34:40] When it comes down to a crew designing a game,

[01:34:42] I feel much more comfortable.

[01:34:44] Not necessarily as a delegator,

[01:34:46] but you have your job to do so do it.

[01:34:48] The artist has this job to do, the sound guy, the mechanical guys.

[01:34:51] Everyone has a job to do.

[01:34:53] If you let people do their job, the final product will come out

[01:34:55] beyond your expectations.

[01:34:58] Go get crazy.

[01:34:59] That's what pinball is developed into these days.

[01:35:01] I just have a little tear.

[01:35:03] Just give me a second, Ron.

[01:35:04] Go crazy.

[01:35:05] That's the Joel Balls Earth and go get crazy.

[01:35:07] Go get crazy.

[01:35:08] Pinball developed under those days.

[01:35:10] So go get crazy.

[01:35:11] So that proves Prince is the next game coming out.

[01:35:14] Well, if you want to talk about going crazy,

[01:35:18] I guess we got to talk about October Fest.

[01:35:20] October Fest.

[01:35:22] Remember, he wanted to do October Fest.

[01:35:24] That's what Striker Extreme is originally going to be.

[01:35:26] Now he finally got to do it.

[01:35:28] It's the amusement park harvest festival theme

[01:35:31] based around October Fest from over there in the Germany's.

[01:35:36] From March of 2019,

[01:35:38] this is the first launch of American pinball

[01:35:41] of which I was in the hobby.

[01:35:43] It's your same crew working on design and stuff.

[01:35:46] But software, we've added a fellow named Joe Schrober.

[01:35:49] Joe Schrober.

[01:35:50] Schrober.

[01:35:51] Schrober.

[01:35:52] Joe Schrober.

[01:35:53] You know what I think of when I think of October Fest?

[01:35:55] A monkey.

[01:35:56] No.

[01:35:57] I think of the movie Pink Panther Strikes Again.

[01:36:01] Oh, no.

[01:36:02] One of my favorites.

[01:36:03] You ever see that one?

[01:36:04] No, no.

[01:36:05] I do.

[01:36:06] I expect to close so all that.

[01:36:07] Well, there's a scene where all the assassins are trying to kill him

[01:36:10] in October Fest.

[01:36:11] So he's at October Fest and all the assassins are trying to kill him

[01:36:14] in its hilarious.

[01:36:15] Highly recommended.

[01:36:16] The Pink Panther Strikes Again.

[01:36:18] There you go.

[01:36:19] If you need a movie recommendations,

[01:36:21] Ron is your guy because he's seen all the good movies, you know,

[01:36:24] 30 years ago.

[01:36:25] No, that was more like 50 years ago, bro.

[01:36:28] So what about the theme?

[01:36:29] Is it a good theme?

[01:36:31] Some people say that this is the worst theme in pinball history.

[01:36:33] I disagree.

[01:36:34] It's not great.

[01:36:35] But I think it's cool.

[01:36:36] Well, Joe says everybody wasn't on board.

[01:36:38] But once we got everyone to understand that it's more like a big, gigantic family party

[01:36:43] that happens all around the world, people bought in.

[01:36:46] There's an aha moment on every idea, no matter what it is.

[01:36:49] But when it comes down to game theme, you need that.

[01:36:52] Is it a good theme?

[01:36:53] Hmm.

[01:36:54] I mean, it is a party and there is beer.

[01:36:56] I mean, if it had like a beerstein on the back box or something, that would have been

[01:37:00] being.

[01:37:01] I think it's a good theme.

[01:37:02] I don't think it's a great theme.

[01:37:03] So here's the thing.

[01:37:04] People talk about theme selling pinball machines.

[01:37:06] They are 100% right about theme selling pinball machines.

[01:37:09] If your objective is to sell 5,000 machines, you buy the Star Wars license.

[01:37:14] If your objective is to sell 500, choose whatever the heck you want.

[01:37:18] We all assume everybody wants to sell 5,000 machines.

[01:37:21] Well, that might not be the case.

[01:37:23] Uh, spooky doesn't.

[01:37:24] They say that straight out.

[01:37:26] Yeah.

[01:37:27] They literally say we don't want to be the big guy.

[01:37:29] We only sell this much and we move on to the next game.

[01:37:32] And their themes are usually pretty good.

[01:37:34] Yeah, so he's taken it back.

[01:37:35] I just blew away his logic completely.

[01:37:37] It did, however, have a very rocky beginning.

[01:37:40] Did it not?

[01:37:41] October, Fest.

[01:37:42] It took a lot of crap in the beginning.

[01:37:43] It had the offensive monkey pick.

[01:37:45] So the monkey, this offensive monkey.

[01:37:47] So on the original backlash,

[01:37:49] there was two frow lines on the, on there.

[01:37:53] And you can see this over at IPDB.

[01:37:55] And they're waiting to get into the October Fest,

[01:37:58] Beer Garden Festival thing.

[01:38:00] And the monkey is groping them.

[01:38:02] And the monkey's got one hand on a butt and one hand like, up a skirt.

[01:38:06] Which the monkey, I think, was supposed to be, he was going to be like there.

[01:38:09] They were going to have him in the art of all their games.

[01:38:12] Yeah, he was like a mascot.

[01:38:13] He's into Dini.

[01:38:14] He was going to be kind of the American pinball mascot.

[01:38:16] The funny thing is this, this was at expo and no one notices.

[01:38:19] But when somebody noticed, then, oh my,

[01:38:21] Oh my, yeah, then it hit the fans.

[01:38:23] Oh my goodness.

[01:38:24] And I mean, it is, it was a poor choice to do.

[01:38:29] I mean, you can have the monkey flirting with the ladies,

[01:38:31] but to be sexually assaulting them.

[01:38:34] Now, there was also another prototype backlash.

[01:38:37] And that one is Otto, who is the sort of the American,

[01:38:41] who is the October Fest Beer guy.

[01:38:45] He's holding a Stein in his left hand.

[01:38:47] And Inga, who is the frowline, is empty handed.

[01:38:51] It also had a prototype cabinet where each side of the cabinet just has the name,

[01:38:56] October Fest, partially obscured by Otto and Inga.

[01:39:01] However, in the final production backlash,

[01:39:04] Otto was holding the Stein in his right hand.

[01:39:06] Inga is holding a string of festival carnival tickets in her right.

[01:39:10] And the production cabinet has October Fest fully visible.

[01:39:14] So you could tell they kind of struggled out of the gate a little bit to kind of,

[01:39:17] oh, the prototypes, we got to figure that out.

[01:39:20] This kind of underlines a lot of issues when it comes to pinball companies,

[01:39:24] when they launch things that aren't quite ready for production,

[01:39:28] just to kind of tease people to show them what we're doing.

[01:39:31] Like, yeah, well, one of the worst that was Jersey Jack,

[01:39:34] because they would always take two years plus per game.

[01:39:37] So they would have early prototype versions that shows.

[01:39:40] And we mentioned the Hobbit earlier, when they, when they had that at Expo,

[01:39:45] everyone hated the art.

[01:39:47] It just got panned.

[01:39:49] And it wasn't bad arts.

[01:39:50] It wasn't that bad.

[01:39:51] But they literally redid the entire art package because of the feedback they got at that show.

[01:39:56] Now, this is a three flipper game.

[01:39:58] I think, you know what, I think this is probably a fun game.

[01:40:01] But it runs into a couple of those Joe Balser issues.

[01:40:05] One of them is a third flipper that can't quite make a side ramp,

[01:40:10] which is in a weird location.

[01:40:12] It has what I call it the Steve Richie shot, the high-speed shot,

[01:40:17] where you can hit left orbit, comes around to the upper flipper,

[01:40:19] and you're supposed to hit the side ramp, except you can never hit side ramp.

[01:40:23] It even has a magnet in front of it to stop it to give you a nice clean feed.

[01:40:27] And I could still never hit this thing.

[01:40:29] I played this head of show.

[01:40:31] We had like four of us on it.

[01:40:33] And the only thing we were trying to do, like, okay, someone needs to hit the side ramp.

[01:40:36] No one could hit it.

[01:40:38] Yeah.

[01:40:39] And that's a shame because so they even went through programming, changes to increase the power.

[01:40:45] They did that on the bottom right flipper because the left ramp is hard to make.

[01:40:50] So at certain points, they will increase the power on the lower right flipper

[01:40:54] so you can actually make the super steep left ramp.

[01:40:57] Yeah.

[01:40:58] The game kind of runs into a couple of almost crippling issues.

[01:41:02] It's still fun.

[01:41:03] It's very good.

[01:41:04] The games that are made now have addressed a lot of these issues.

[01:41:08] They've changed coils.

[01:41:09] They've done some things.

[01:41:10] Even though they had these problems when they kind of first got out of the way,

[01:41:13] they're not problems now.

[01:41:15] So if you want a better one, get a later build.

[01:41:17] But what does Joe say about the sales of this game?

[01:41:21] He says, that's a fully loaded model.

[01:41:23] That is a company we agree on moving forward.

[01:41:25] I don't think it hit the right market at the time.

[01:41:28] I don't think it was pushed in the right direction at the right time.

[01:41:31] I think it's still open for that game to move.

[01:41:33] It still has legs to move.

[01:41:35] Josh and Joe did an incredible job.

[01:41:37] Joe there being Joe Schrober.

[01:41:39] Yeah.

[01:41:40] Not himself.

[01:41:41] He's not talking about himself of the third person.

[01:41:42] That'd be weird.

[01:41:43] Yeah, it would be weird.

[01:41:44] But this game is, if you look at Houdini, Houdini's got some cool stuff.

[01:41:48] But this thing is loaded.

[01:41:49] It's loaded.

[01:41:50] It's loaded.

[01:41:51] It's got a beer barrel ball lock, which I think is awesome.

[01:41:54] A cool habit trail thing that reminds me of roller coaster tycoon.

[01:41:58] Yeah.

[01:41:59] I think it's awesome habit trail off the corkscrew.

[01:42:02] When I played it, that's what everyone wanted to do.

[01:42:04] They wanted to hit that and see that.

[01:42:05] Right.

[01:42:06] But it's like impossible to hit the damn thing.

[01:42:08] Or it was.

[01:42:09] And you know, it's got a flip up ramp.

[01:42:11] And it's got bumper cars on the top of the pop bumpers that are custom molded.

[01:42:16] And lots of standoffs.

[01:42:18] Lots of standoffs.

[01:42:20] Millions of standoffs.

[01:42:21] Like, it's not a, it's great.

[01:42:23] It's pretty cool.

[01:42:24] It's lots of fun.

[01:42:26] But it's not, it's not a knockout theme.

[01:42:29] It's not a knockout design.

[01:42:30] It is a bit clunky still.

[01:42:32] I, I, I give it, give it a shot.

[01:42:34] Throw your quarters in.

[01:42:35] It's fun.

[01:42:36] You'll have fun.

[01:42:37] Trust me.

[01:42:38] Give everything a shot.

[01:42:39] Yeah.

[01:42:40] You'll have fun when you play this game.

[01:42:41] Oh, now we go to my favorite.

[01:42:43] Your favorite hot wheels.

[01:42:46] My favorite American game, yes.

[01:42:47] It's the toy race car play game theme from June of 2020.

[01:42:53] Joe Balser on design art by Jeff Bush.

[01:42:57] Animation by Ish Reynas.

[01:43:00] Music and sound by Matt Kern.

[01:43:02] Software by Josh Kuhler and Joe Schober.

[01:43:05] What about this for a theme, huh?

[01:43:07] Hot Wheels.

[01:43:08] Everybody had hot wheels.

[01:43:09] Joe says we were looking to do a driving theme.

[01:43:12] And once we started to talk with Roger Sharp, we found out that the hot wheels license was available.

[01:43:17] We moved in that direction.

[01:43:19] We wanted to do a license theme with a better price point.

[01:43:22] You get a win-win to the customer and to the end user.

[01:43:25] A game that plays well, make it a good shooter, keep it more of a non-clutter play field.

[01:43:30] Not a super lot going on.

[01:43:32] So this is going to be a scaled back game, which it is.

[01:43:36] Right.

[01:43:37] So they put in so much stuff into October Fest and it didn't pay off.

[01:43:40] They're going to put less in hot wheels and hope it pays off.

[01:43:44] I literally have a hot wheels car in front of me on my desk.

[01:43:47] And I said, Mattel was awesome to deal with.

[01:43:50] They also provided a cool YouTube show called Hot Wheels City for the Animations, which is great.

[01:43:54] Multiple companies that pursued the Hot Wheels license.

[01:43:57] One apparently was Deep RuPinball.

[01:43:59] Ooh, gross.

[01:44:01] But one of the best things about it is that that YouTube show.

[01:44:04] It has the robot chicken animation and it's hilarious.

[01:44:08] It's so good.

[01:44:09] And they integrated it well.

[01:44:11] And it's fun.

[01:44:13] It's unfortunately the lack of toys kind of makes for a bit of a boring game.

[01:44:19] Now I like it.

[01:44:21] Also the sound can be a bit annoying.

[01:44:23] Nope.

[01:44:24] Wrong.

[01:44:25] When you miss, when you break a shot into one of those targets, you get this like ding-ding.

[01:44:29] Like you're crossing a full service gas station thing.

[01:44:34] And just hearing that ding-ding, ding-ding.

[01:44:37] Like over and over and over again, drives me nutty.

[01:44:40] It really does.

[01:44:42] So in here we don't have a big ball lock mech.

[01:44:45] We don't have a whole lot of stuff.

[01:44:47] A whole lot of stuff.

[01:44:48] We don't have a whole lot of stuff.

[01:44:49] But we do have a lot of stuff.

[01:44:50] Yeah.

[01:44:51] So why don't you talk about red line there?

[01:44:52] There's these stand-ups.

[01:44:53] You hit them enough times.

[01:44:54] It goes into red line mode.

[01:44:56] Where the whole game goes dead and everything turns red.

[01:44:58] So the main toy of the game are offset stand-up targets.

[01:45:01] It's kind of boring.

[01:45:02] Yeah.

[01:45:03] Yeah.

[01:45:04] It's fun.

[01:45:05] There's no physical ball lock.

[01:45:06] There's no loop-de-loop.

[01:45:07] I like it.

[01:45:08] I feel like you could almost put this theme on any...

[01:45:11] I feel like this playfield was pretty much like you could put anything on it, unfortunately.

[01:45:16] It's funny.

[01:45:17] Like you remove all the toys and all that stuff and make it shoot better.

[01:45:20] And I immediately like it more.

[01:45:22] Okay.

[01:45:23] It's just a taste thing.

[01:45:24] I really think it's this case.

[01:45:26] This is not a clunky game.

[01:45:27] This is a flow game.

[01:45:28] I saw a shot good.

[01:45:29] Joe can do it.

[01:45:30] The shots.

[01:45:31] Not too tight.

[01:45:32] Not a bunch of stuff in there that makes the ball just kind of clunk around.

[01:45:35] One thing we didn't really mention.

[01:45:36] I think one of the reasons they were able to get games like Houdini when they did that in five months.

[01:45:42] Unlike at Jersey Jack where they just started from scratch with everything.

[01:45:47] At American Pinball they used the P-Rock.

[01:45:51] Yeah.

[01:45:52] Boardset.

[01:45:53] So they didn't have to screw with just creating a whole new framework.

[01:45:57] They didn't have to reinvent the wheel.

[01:45:58] They just had to build all the other stuff.

[01:46:00] But at least they didn't have to worry about that part.

[01:46:02] The game itself.

[01:46:04] Joe took a very group approach to the layout.

[01:46:08] He added more of the play field elements than he'd consult the rest of the engineering team and the programming people

[01:46:13] and change the layout a little bit.

[01:46:15] But unfortunately I feel like this was a bit of an over correction from the two previous games which were particularly expensive.

[01:46:20] It didn't really sell gangbusters.

[01:46:22] Yeah.

[01:46:23] You're wrong.

[01:46:24] The other issue that this has is that it was released.

[01:46:27] Kind of secretly to a test group at a convention at a New Orleans.

[01:46:34] Yeah.

[01:46:35] Like a non-pinball thing.

[01:46:36] Yeah.

[01:46:37] And then unfortunately what happened was people with their potato cameras leaked some of these images.

[01:46:42] And people were like really kind of let down because what they saw was just like pixelated yuck.

[01:46:48] Yeah.

[01:46:49] But they were supposed to have the big reveal at Texas Pinball Festival.

[01:46:52] Yeah.

[01:46:53] In 2020.

[01:46:54] Yeah.

[01:46:55] So you know what happened there.

[01:46:56] This little thing called COVID.

[01:46:58] Yeah.

[01:46:59] This was the first launched pandemic pinball machine.

[01:47:01] Yeah.

[01:47:03] Josh Kuhler says,

[01:47:04] Joe was most upset about TPF being canceled because I know he was so excited that the presence we were going to have there.

[01:47:10] We had plans for two full size hot wheels cars there.

[01:47:13] I think it was rip rod and bone crusher.

[01:47:15] These full size cars.

[01:47:17] Those are hot wheels originals.

[01:47:19] Yeah.

[01:47:20] They had this huge launch.

[01:47:21] They were like, here we are.

[01:47:22] We're moving into a theme.

[01:47:23] More than any other game.

[01:47:25] I think the pandemic hurt hot wheels.

[01:47:27] I totally agree.

[01:47:29] There was a lot of marketing snafu as they did too on it.

[01:47:31] They did a lot of things that kind of really hurt it.

[01:47:34] They did a stream and the stream heads because of course they can't reveal it in person because it's a pandemic.

[01:47:41] Right?

[01:47:42] We're literally separated and everybody's working from home.

[01:47:45] So they did an online stream on Twitch.

[01:47:48] And it didn't go particularly well because they had internet issues and things were up and down.

[01:47:53] And of course you couldn't stand next to each other because Chicago made everybody say a separate rooms.

[01:47:59] So they had audio issues.

[01:48:01] So the initial first impression really cut the legs out from under hot wheels.

[01:48:05] I have a friend of mine here in the province that has a hot wheels.

[01:48:09] I've played it quite a few times.

[01:48:11] And I really like it.

[01:48:12] It's not.

[01:48:13] I wish it had a little more.

[01:48:15] I wish it had like a really cool physical ball lock.

[01:48:18] I think that would really like make the game just like one step up because I feel like it's a lot of money for kind of not much.

[01:48:24] The digging annoys me.

[01:48:26] Other than that great game.

[01:48:28] So it was around this time that we heard that American pinball was starting to lock down various themes.

[01:48:37] And you could have seen these back in the day from trademark filings.

[01:48:41] Some of those trademark filings were Robin Hood, Sherlock Holmes, which I think is actually a really good theme.

[01:48:47] Valkaris and poker run, which is like a car kind of theme.

[01:48:52] Yeah, that confused me.

[01:48:53] Yeah, I heard it was a car thing.

[01:48:55] It doesn't have something to do with poker.

[01:48:57] Yeah.

[01:48:58] So what it is is it's sort of like cannonball run.

[01:49:00] Oh, so it's Jackie Chan in it.

[01:49:02] That'll be awesome.

[01:49:03] God.

[01:49:04] What?

[01:49:05] You drive from location to location and you get a poker card.

[01:49:08] And then at the end, whoever has the best poker card wins the poker run.

[01:49:12] It's kind of cool.

[01:49:13] Did you know a cannonball run too?

[01:49:14] It was Jackie Chan and Richard Keel in one of the cars.

[01:49:17] There was a second one.

[01:49:19] There was a second one.

[01:49:20] I love cannonball run.

[01:49:22] I just love that.

[01:49:23] Just that visual.

[01:49:24] Richard Keel and Jackie Chan.

[01:49:25] So Joe was let go, unfortunately, from American pinball.

[01:49:30] This was when David Fix was brought in.

[01:49:32] You want to do it?

[01:49:33] That's right, baby.

[01:49:34] He was brought in on the American dream of American pinball.

[01:49:37] David Fith, baby.

[01:49:38] So who is David Fix?

[01:49:40] David Fix is a guy from Buffalo who worked for ice.

[01:49:43] You know ice?

[01:49:44] No.

[01:49:45] They make like a...

[01:49:47] I thought they make like the Czechs hockey games.

[01:49:49] Oh, right.

[01:49:50] Basically, he was in gaming for years and years and years with ice.

[01:49:54] Very cool.

[01:49:55] David Fix is also one of the people with pinball expos.

[01:49:58] Yes.

[01:49:59] He's one of the main organizers of pinball expos.

[01:50:01] Yeah.

[01:50:02] So there's been a regime change at American pinball.

[01:50:05] And part of that change in the leadership, Joe was... Joe left.

[01:50:10] He would actually go for a cup of coffee to a company called Home Pin.

[01:50:15] And I think it was only a virtual cup of coffee.

[01:50:18] I don't think they actually met.

[01:50:20] No.

[01:50:21] I think this... he probably wanted someone to get a lineup and make it so they could actually build games.

[01:50:29] Which, who better than Joe Balser?

[01:50:31] He did it twice.

[01:50:32] Exactly.

[01:50:33] It didn't... it did not happen.

[01:50:35] It did not pan out.

[01:50:37] Currently, Joe Balser sitting on the sidelines of pinball design and pinball.

[01:50:43] Sad to hear.

[01:50:45] How would you wrap up Joe Balser's career in pinball run?

[01:50:50] He was a guy that got games made.

[01:50:52] He got games out the door.

[01:50:55] He made companies.

[01:50:57] Set up lines.

[01:50:58] Had all the contacts and manufacturing to get the stuff actually built.

[01:51:02] That's his superpower.

[01:51:04] You know, building pinballs really hard.

[01:51:06] He was a guy that could actually do it.

[01:51:08] Joe Balser was not a perfect individual just like everybody else.

[01:51:11] I'm perfect.

[01:51:13] Everybody except Ronald.

[01:51:15] Thank you.

[01:51:16] Thank you.

[01:51:17] And we have to say that Joe has worked his way through his career.

[01:51:21] He's given us a lot of happiness.

[01:51:24] I think what people need to remember about Joe is that this guy built companies.

[01:51:32] And he doesn't get any credit for that, especially American pinball.

[01:51:36] He basically gets crap for the design of Houdini and some of his clunkiness.

[01:51:42] But he's much more than that.

[01:51:45] How about this awesome quote that I got from Joe Balser?

[01:51:48] Joe says.

[01:51:49] I just picked up a space jam recently.

[01:51:51] I only have four games in my collection.

[01:51:53] I've had many more games at one time in my life.

[01:51:56] But you go through a couple of divorces and a few pinball machines kind of disappear.

[01:52:00] Oh, and make sure you go out and play some Baywatch.

[01:52:05] I'll just say and Simpson's pinball party.

[01:52:09] I mean, I don't want to play it.

[01:52:10] But everyone else loves it.

[01:52:12] So play Houdini.

[01:52:13] It's fun.

[01:52:14] It is a good game.

[01:52:15] Play Hot Wheels.

[01:54:05] Your podcast sucks.

[01:54:55] During our episode on...

[01:54:58] So we spoke about Apollo 13 on our first episode of...

[01:55:04] What the f*** is his name?

[01:55:07] We've had too many episodes.

[01:55:10] You're already forgetting.

[01:55:11] Oh my god.

[01:55:12] What episode should we talk about that on?

[01:55:17] Ty for another t-

[01:55:18] My throat is just killing me here.

[01:55:20] Oh, I'm having throat pain.

[01:55:23] We'll be right there, Mr. Dennis.

[01:55:26] But once we got seen...

[01:55:28] But once we got in seeing parts of the movie and reading what was going to be in it.

[01:55:32] But once we got in...

[01:55:34] But once we got in seeing parts...

[01:55:37] But once we got...

[01:55:40] But once we got in seeing parts of the movie and reading what it was going to be about,

[01:55:43] we thought it's going to be a...

[01:55:45] Just get the last sentence.

[01:55:47] No, no, I'm doing this, dammit.

[01:55:50] You with your washrooms or tea.

[01:55:52] You spelled check wrong in this.

[01:55:54] I had to fix that.

[01:55:55] I thought you changed that.

[01:55:57] I'm like, I don't spell check that way.

[01:55:58] No, I just spoke the proper way.

[01:56:00] No, you see H-E-Q-E-Check.

[01:56:03] No, no, it's talking that way.

[01:56:04] Not here.

[01:56:05] Check.

[01:56:06] I looked at that.

[01:56:07] I'm like, Jesus, I didn't...

[01:56:08] Why did I spell this?

[01:56:09] I saw somewhere someone mentioned a rubber check.

[01:56:11] And I'm like, what the hell is that?

[01:56:12] I had to look that up.

[01:56:13] It means bounce check.

[01:56:14] Like, I've never heard that term.

[01:56:16] I've never heard that before.

[01:56:17] I've never heard that before.

[01:56:18] Check.

[01:56:19] Huh.

[01:56:20] Weird.

[01:56:21] So we had a surprise for me.

[01:56:23] Ah.

[01:56:24] A lot of f***ing clicks there.

[01:56:28] Alright.

[01:56:29] From the top.
