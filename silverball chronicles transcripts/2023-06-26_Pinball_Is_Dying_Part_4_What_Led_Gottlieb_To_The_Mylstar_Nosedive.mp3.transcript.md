[03:03] I'll have to get a different co host I guess that's that's right so reviews and corrections so let me just jump into one of these reviews Hans help me.

[03:13] This is over on Apple reviews I didn't see the thing is I don't usually go in there because I don't use an Apple device but eventually I do and I bring up some wonderful review is it it's not even iTunes anymore isn't like it's Apple podcast now they did away with the iTunes name I wonder why I don't know I don't know.

[03:33] Branding well Hans help me says pinball history in a whole lot more I've only listened to a couple of episodes and really enjoy this podcast a lot it seems most pinball podcast are all about the current news and machines but this one deals with history and in depth stories I appreciate them going down rabbit holes as this hobby has so many characters and fascinating stories keep it up boys.

[03:57] Yeah, so we might have actually done this review previously in another episode so if this has been repeated I'm really sorry but I saw this this morning yeah so this one says is from Tim 27 Tim 27 says grade school content this may be the most annoying podcast I have ever heard constant Sulu and be this jokes it's cringeworthy they are a podcast root canal steer clear I'm sorry.

[04:24] No way to yeah this is this is a review of slant that's correct your other podcast yes and they spelled be this wrong I mean I lost they've lost all credibility with me as a reviewer that point cheese oh well boy that how did that get in there huh and you can listen to that other podcast with Bruce night and game yeah they have a much better review than that actually this is this is just probably this is the worst one and the most funny one I can guess.

[04:54] We are active over on Facebook that's Facebook dot com slash silver ball chronicles leave us a five star review wherever you found us on any pod catcher so more people can find our awesome pinball content.

[05:07] If you enjoy the show don't want any big commitments and just want a shirt or hoodie or a mug or a sticker anything like that your place to go is silver ball swag dot com do you have any comments or corrections from our last episode on pinballs sent to narrow.

[05:24] I'm not a fan of the Korean Wayne Nions I don't think we had any no no major corrections but I did have a heck a lot of fun recording that episode loads of fun I learned some really cool stuff about Wayne Nions who I didn't really know much about except that he was really really old do you know

[06:18] the forward through it in the silver ball chronicles mail bag we did have a couple of interesting emails this month one from Mike he says hey there I discovered your podcast a few months ago when I'm catching up on episodes by listening from the beginning.

[06:33] Unfortunately that means I'll break even sometime next year for all I know Ron and David no longer the hosts.

[06:40] We still are and the show is now a rewatch podcast of Al.

[06:47] Wow there's a dated 80s reference either way as someone new to the hobby this podcast has been amazing please keep up the good work or reunite as a host of this podcast depending on what's going on in the present.

[06:59] David what is Al stand for Al.

[07:03] Oh yeah he's the he's the cute little alien dude what is the Al stand for stands for something I have no

[07:08] alien life form.

[07:11] There you go.

[07:13] Holy frig.

[07:15] Totally Ben M also sent us an email he said you missed two really important games with Wayne Nions the first one being knock out which is a great game I recall.

[07:26] Be being knock out.

[07:27] Yeah.

[07:28] What did I say knock out?

[07:29] It's a knock out.

[07:30] It's not out.

[07:33] Boy that never gets never gets old.

[07:35] It's never gets old.

[07:37] And then a coronation which Wayne designed around the celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth and her crowning.

[07:45] Very topical wow that was like 53.

[07:49] Damn yeah wow can't believe you knew that I think that's right our queen I can't believe you knew the date of our queens coronation over there is.

[07:59] Trees and town USA.

[08:02] Also I just wanted to let everybody know that we've added all of our show notes to silver ball chronicles dot com so if you check out there there is a new link at the top of the page you can review all of the sources for every single episode with direct links to those sources.

[08:17] And kudos to David Dennis for all the work because he does it all.

[08:21] I'm a tool I do nothing but talk I'm a tool I'm a tool I just make comments and stuff commentary.

[08:28] Let's jump into today's topic got leave is viewed as the romantic electro mechanical giant to many the pinball machine a top the coin op pedestal for all other manufacturers to reach for.

[08:44] But it was its god tier status in the 1960s and early 70s which would ultimately lead to its epic cratering by the mid 1980s.

[08:56] What led got leave to the myle star knows dive was it the lack of leadership was it corporate chaos was it the recession in the early 80s or was it just a lack of creative freedom and a sense of adventure in their product will join us this month as we talk about pinball is dying part four.

[09:17] What led got leave to the myle star knows dive and there's a lot of pinball dying were like how long is it take for it to die part four but we're going to call it myle star I've heard it called mill star.

[09:31] Yes I'm not sure what the official pronunciation is but I've always heard myle star yes so we're going with myle star but please feel free to send your corrections to silver ball chronicles at gmail dot com.

[09:43] And if you were former god leave employee we will say however you say it was supposed to be said we've done a few pinball dying episodes run I think you're getting you're getting to hear yes part one was episode 12 Williams in the early 80s they recovered part two.

[09:58] Episode 18 Valley Williams in the 1990s didn't recover part three.

[10:04] Episode 28.

[10:07] 1980s Valley midway also didn't recover this episode I want to talk about all the compounding issues which led to the formation of myle star it's ultimate failure.

[10:21] And just about sort of myle star in this games in general the fall from grace in god leave was more than just what happened in 1983 and 84.

[10:32] It's it's a big big sort of issue at hand and I thought it deserved its own episode this episode will have a little bit less of the let's talk about the game stuff so if you're looking for more of that this is not the episode for you all.

[10:47] No fires you've already started listening you can't turn it off now there's no possible way to stop a pop up.

[10:54] No so let's let's wind the clock back got lead in the end of the 70s right so they were going full tilt flat out apparently through all of the research I've done which is mostly just some quick Google searches and being about as lazy as possible.

[11:14] God leave was selling three machines to every other cat competitor combined selling one three to one ratio that's pretty big deal Ron.

[11:25] God leave worth the champs the gold standard in fact we had previously mentioned that Steve Richie as a young pinball player at a local bowling alley he was around probably 10 years of age.

[11:38] Yeah he walked in one day and he saw the tech there working on the machines and the tech told him you know what this is a god leave the Cadillac of the industry and then he did this thing he did like put his hand on it and tapped it like twice and then Steve Richie said play better.

[11:55] They probably didn't say that and then he smiled in like his teeth were like because they were so shiny mm-hmm well because of this because of their good build quality being the Cadillac.

[12:08] Because of the size of their industry the company was going through a rapid expansion and this really peaked out in the 1970s when Nions and Harry Mabbs couldn't keep up with demand for all of these new designs.

[12:23] So they brought in a new designer by the name of Ed Crinsky in 1965 and he was a air quotes here folk younger guy.

[12:35] And he was able to learn from Wayne and Harry Mabbs he was the third person to keep up with those designs got leaves leadership at the time knew that they had a serious issue and the company head to start its generational transition.

[12:53] Wayne Nions said we needed new designers and the old days nobody designed anything everyone copied everyone else then we got no more complex games and then we got into designing.

[13:03] Harry Mabbs was our designer and he was getting old I was there and I was getting older and we got Crinsky and well he started getting old too.

[13:11] The leadership of Gottlieb is very much aware of the situation they're in the business is getting more complex right so Ron a lot of the critiques of Wayne Nions and the guys in that generation were that they would just move the dropped targets to the other side of the play field and it would be a totally different game.

[13:31] Well eventually that you know people start demanding more and demanding more and more complexity and you know less of a what do they call that a mirrored or asymmetrical play field or a symmetrical playfield right so they didn't want any of that stuff.

[13:48] Here's a really cool quote from John Osborne just about how crazy it was with the age of all of the employees at Gottlieb.

[13:58] Yeah John said when I passed my 10 year anniversary there was nothing no acknowledgement at all at the 25 year parties they would ask everybody and stand up it would been there 25 years and over half the room would stand up.

[14:11] Everybody there had been there since the beginning.

[14:13] Gottlieb had grown together they had grown as a company and because of that it was very obvious that everybody there was getting very long in the tooth.

[14:22] That comes with strengths and weaknesses.

[14:24] The strengths are they know how to do their job in and out.

[14:28] But they've also got you know they run into that phenomenon I'm sure a lot of employees know what that is which is this is the way we've always done it.

[14:35] And you kind of have a hard time thinking quote unquote outside of the box even though I hate that term well Ed Crinsky this is somebody who is really really difficult to find information about.

[14:48] In fact I also had been asked by somebody to do some specific research on Ed Crinsky because they heard through the rumor mill that Ed Crinsky wasn't a real person.

[15:00] But actually three or four people that just use the name Ed Crinsky.

[15:05] Conspiracy what did you find out.

[15:08] I found out that Ed Crinsky was three different people that no I didn't well he was a gentleman and he served in the US Navy during the second.

[15:17] World War as most of the designers and engineers of this era they had spent a lot of the 1940s supporting the war effort or fighting in the war effort as most of North America and Europe did Ed Crinsky started in the industry in 1956 with a company called Keeney.

[15:39] Keeney was short for J H Keeney and company incorporated and operated from 1934 to 1964 Keeney was focused on the rising popularity of jute boxes in America at the time specifically those wall style ones that you would see in diners.

[16:00] Yeah wall boxes right you'd stick them in and you you and you gal would sit down and put in a dime into the machine and you'd listen to I needed a little yeah are you news real guy again.

[16:12] Yeah news real guy.

[16:14] So World War II would bring wall boxes to a halt when they reopened after the war they expanded into electro mechanical devices including things called uprights.

[16:28] We would call uprights nowadays basically slot machines they got into flipperless games one balls and eventually a few pinball games.

[16:39] They also dabbled in some computing systems for the US government computing systems right computer that took up an entire room probably right it was basically a room size calculator.

[16:51] Crinsky now he would work on the gambling devices and it said in the pinball compendium which is this phenomenal resource that I use for a lot of my research and cross reference because there's a lot of wonderful primary sources.

[17:06] The first pinball compendium is 1930 to the 1960s the author Michael Michael Shaloube he would say that the laws that were changed in the early 1960s against gambling devices.

[17:20] Made it hard for Keeney to continue its product line specifically the upright machines after a testifying several trials about these devices yes he left Keeney and began working for godly godly was a company known for inshrewing gambling machines and not wanting to be dirty gambling.

[17:44] Mafiosa stuff in shrewing I don't know what that means basically they didn't like gambling devices neither did Williams Valley on the other hand.

[17:54] Crinsky he would refer to the Eastland bill from October of 62 that was what outlawed the interstate transportation of gambling devices and we spoke about that in another podcast.

[18:06] Crinsky implied undoubtedly Keeney was hit hard by this new legislation as was Valley you just mentioned that and they only stayed afloat for about a year or so because they started selling more items in the UK.

[18:21] But unfortunately their business model built primarily around uprights didn't survive and they would ultimately close their doors.

[18:30] Ed's last game at Keeney was arrowhead but little was known about its sales or production numbers because at the time there was quite a bit of chaos at Keeney and as they began to collapse your well aware of Keeney's arrowhead run not really know now neither am I you can search it on the on the IP DB it's good.

[18:52] As mentioned and joy got leave in 65 and he immediately made how many games seven games five months five months.

[19:02] It's not insane yes it is.

[19:04] He's just like I'll just show up here and draw a couple of things seven games I'm going to go see you later guys will be back in the first games for Dodge City which is a cowboy theme and bankable another pool theme.

[19:15] Soling a combined 6,575 units just showed up phone and it in 6,575 units wow what was Ed like he was on the quiet side had his own design room in the back of engineering it got late which he would close up and work quietly.

[19:34] Wayne nine says Ed never associated with anybody he was a loner he was quiet and he never liked to play pinball machines which is very odd.

[19:42] He didn't play for amusement you can never expect to meet a nicer guy that Ed Crinsky that's why we can't find anything about Ed Crinsky it was just a quiet.

[19:51] God so weird he didn't play any games he didn't it's like it was like his job job is the design games but you never play pinball machines it's so weird yeah he's like he's like here's a design.

[20:00] Pass it on to the next person. I think what did he had to play whitewoods I mean did he just make him and say like yeah I'm sure it shoots good.

[20:06] Yeah well you know what he probably played it twice but it's not like he would go to a bar and play or he'd hang it with the the staff and play he just made games it was a job to him and what's crazy about that is that quote unquote job to him Ed would design 220 games over his career got lead many of which were actually reused a second time when they went into solid state and they ran into trouble in the 1980s so his popular designs were so big.

[20:36] They reused them again in solid state a guy who probably only played all of those games like 300 times somewhere in 1984 Ed Crinsky would leave Milestar on a sour note the family run got lead company was no more after years of change and Ed's job was no longer fun and it was no longer about entertainment it was solely about heartless corporate profit.

[21:06] So Ed would leave Ed was from the old school and he certainly didn't like where pinball was heading in 1984 we got pinball Hall of Fame 2003 off the year before I started going so I would have missed this one let's see Michael Shalube author of the pinball compendium and an article from pinball news 2004 wrote.

[21:27] Okay I assume this was Michael Shalube was asked to present Ed Crinsky with his induction into the pinball Hall of Fame this was a great honor for me as a majority of the games I play growing up were his designs I had organized its family to be there supporting this true legend as he's recovering from two strokes and two heart attacks and had no idea what was going on as far as he was concerned it was late and he wanted to go home so there I was doing a presentation for another great in the industry I started by telling people that very few realize that Ed Crinsky designed more games and.

[21:57] Any other designer he had designed over 220 games so at this time in 2003 Ed's health is failing he's been retired for many years and quite frankly it's not that big a deal to him you know he's getting the pinball you know the pinball expo Hall of Fame induction there's somebody up there talking about how great is there's all these people about how much they love his designs and how much happiness he gave them.

[22:26] And he's not that interested there could be reasons for that right it could be that he's a terrible person it could be that he's older and he's not feeling well it could be that maybe Ed suffers from like a lot of like social anxiety.

[22:42] Either way I still think it's pretty amazing that this guy made so many games enjoyed by so many people and he's just sort of like me.

[22:51] Yeah I mean Ed would pass away in November of 2004 the following year from pneumonia as a result of late stage lung cancer now let's go back let's wind that back now that we've cleaned up who Ed Crinsky is now there was this concern over this generational change at Godleap.

[23:12] Godleap's leadership who noticed that they needed to bring in another generation of designers and engineers they also started to need things called a programmer so when they would move into solid state they would need programmers as well.

[23:25] One day the Godleap plant super intended became very ill and went home in fact Wayne nine said he was so ill he didn't return to work.

[23:35] The chief engineer of the plant was moved to the new superintendent role leaving a space for chief engineer Wayne would move into that designing role and became the head of engineering this is the time that he was finishing off Ron's favorite game Paul Bunyan's good I played that after our episode I'm there I was pointing to it Harry that's from our episode check it out Paul Bunyan that's way nine's last game.

[24:03] And that's good it's good it's good it's it.

[24:09] It became obvious that there was a gap growing within the corporate structure that they were missing this younger group of designers and engineers to help them with their production and design but it's more than just sort of throw somebody in and get them to build something because the older generation from the 30s and 40s had sort of grown up in engineering and design.

[24:34] Now you needed to bring somebody in who came from university or from a specific skill and then train them how you do things so it's kind of the other direction the other way around so Wayne Nions would say we figured we needed another designer to study with Khrinsky someone to come up behind him.

[24:52] Then here comes Johnny just as we're talking about it we get a letter we knew we had to bring in some young kid who can learn the business and become a designer and be a free thinker break them in here.

[25:02] And that Johnny was John Osborne.

[25:05] John Osborne we touched on him a few times in our system 80 episode because he worked a lot at Gottlieb there but I was able to get some really cool sources with John so I'm going to add a little more context to him here in this episode.

[25:18] He was sending letters to Bally and Williams and Gottlieb asking about employment since he was just starting to he was just getting ready to graduate from university.

[25:27] John had been sending various letters to Wayne Nions for quite a few months. He was asking him about design he was asking about the hobby he was showing him pictures of his collection of wood rails and he would ask Wayne for advice on repairing some items.

[25:45] They basically became pen pals.

[25:48] You remember pen pals Ron?

[25:49] Sure back when you had your quill.

[25:52] Yeah when I had my quill you dip your you dip your quill and your ink well and you design something and then you would you would give it to the kingsman and he would ride his horse out about.

[26:02] Drop off the letter and then he would sing Louis Louis kingsman get it.

[26:08] Where was John Osborne from why was he sending letters instead of just picking up the phone and call it from Fresno California which is pretty far away from Chicago Illinois.

[26:19] John can remember his father holding him up to the glass on a pinball machine watching the ball fall down the play field.

[26:24] His father had a pre flipper game called Bally Vogue.

[26:28] He attended Fresno University and took engineering.

[26:31] His senior project was building a pinball game.

[26:33] He called it South Paul because the plunger was on the left side.

[26:36] He had also amassed quite a collection of wood rail and EM games.

[26:40] He didn't hear from Bally Williams told him to talk to the local distributor and Wayne replied with a letter requesting an interview.

[26:47] This included airfare hotel and transportation because you that isn't that amazing.

[26:52] You're your your pen pals with you know the Wayne Nions and you're asking them all these questions and

[26:59] you sort of get blown off by Bally and Williams tells you to go talk to the local distro because they don't have time for you.

[27:06] And then Wayne says hey well fly all the way here.

[27:10] We'll put you in a hotel and we'll get you to and from the interview.

[27:13] You know nowadays getting airfare anywhere is like even in your own job is almost impossible.

[27:19] Especially since the whole post covid Skype stuff that we do.

[27:25] What John Osborne would say this was new territory for me.

[27:29] I asked my mother and she said for beginning engineer I should ask for maybe 10k a year.

[27:33] My school counselor in Fresno said oh you'll never get that maybe 8500 if you're lucky.

[27:38] I thought all they can do is say no.

[27:40] So when we had our meeting I said I'm thinking around 10k and Wayne said well we started engineers at 10

[27:48] four. Wow this was my kind of company.

[27:51] It's very similar to when I graduated university I did my financial licenses and then I did an

[27:56] interview and they offered me I think it was $45,000 Canadian and I was like I totally bluffed.

[28:05] Wow okay that sounds great and then I left the meeting room and I'm like holy crap.

[28:10] That's the most money I could have possibly imagined.

[28:14] Oh man when you're a kid right it's so funny to think of this.

[28:18] And 45,000 Canadian is what 200 American or something?

[28:22] Yeah it's about that.

[28:23] But it's 200 plus six people.

[28:26] Oh yes.

[28:27] Yes.

[28:28] Yes.

[28:28] When John arrived in Chicago Wayne picked him up at the hotel and drove him to Steven's

[28:35] steakhouse for just a brief chat and supper.

[28:40] Sorry you guys may call that dinner.

[28:41] These ghosts would call it supper.

[28:43] The following day they went for the formal interview at the Gottlieb plant.

[28:48] In an interview with John Osborne chatting with Wayne Nions that's in the show notes.

[28:55] You can see those show notes at silverballcrontacles.com or in the description on Facebook.

[29:04] I've included a link to the John Osborne and Wayne Nions chat on YouTube.

[29:10] One of the questions they asked John which I thought was kind of an odd question but

[29:15] actually made a lot of sense was are you color blind?

[29:20] Why would they ask that Ron?

[29:21] Because you need to see the colors on the wires.

[29:24] Oh my goodness.

[29:25] Of course.

[29:26] You got to know the cut at first you'd be like well that's kind of a weird question but it actually

[29:31] makes a lot of sense.

[29:32] It's almost as weird as your spelling of colors.

[29:35] Never gets old.

[29:37] The Queen's English.

[29:38] I guess he got leaves like that.

[29:43] So John Osborne started at Gottlieb in 1972 and his first project was to rewrite the

[29:48] Gottlieb service manual.

[29:50] He sat in Wayne Nions office with a typewriter.

[29:53] He built light box test fixtures and then took over the responsibilities of modifying games

[29:57] for the foreign markets.

[29:59] After a few years John ended up in the engineering department building the whitewoods,

[30:03] cabling and running this commodities for the games.

[30:06] He worked very closely with Ed Khrinsky.

[30:08] Yeah they make him work hard.

[30:10] They're giving him all that stuff.

[30:11] Here make the manuals.

[30:12] Here build this whitewood.

[30:14] Here do this.

[30:15] And he's making $10,400 American in like the 1960s and he's just 72 and he's loving it.

[30:23] I'd be like what could I design a game?

[30:25] What could I design a game?

[30:26] Wouldn't it be great if you shot this target and it started a two times multiplier

[30:30] and then you touched the lock down.

[30:32] Yeah okay.

[30:35] John would say Ed would bring a game into the playing room and we'd play it.

[30:39] Do all the wiring and paperwork and then we decide if we need to change this feature or that

[30:43] a little bit I'd say this is a great game but it's a little dull over there.

[30:47] How about we put a kick target or something and Ed would say yeah go ahead and do it and I would.

[30:52] There you go.

[30:53] Ed Khrinsky right the ultimate delegator.

[30:56] I'd be like I get co-design credit right?

[30:58] That's what I'd be saying.

[31:00] And he'd be like no.

[31:03] And then he'd go to his room and just close the door and design 12 games at lunch.

[31:07] Well how busy was Gottlieb at the time David?

[31:10] This is cool.

[31:11] This is cool.

[31:12] I really loved all this is all this.

[31:13] This is the stuff that I love.

[31:15] Wayne Nions would say we were going gangbusters with all the games in that era.

[31:22] We had three factories going.

[31:24] We had hundreds of people working.

[31:27] We had maybe four to five hundred games a day.

[31:30] Wow.

[31:31] Now that's one game every 15 to 20 seconds.

[31:36] It was fantastic.

[31:38] It was just a madhouse.

[31:40] You'll never see that kind of stuff again.

[31:43] No one's making four to five hundred games a day anymore.

[31:47] So like what Stern probably makes four or five hundred a week?

[31:51] I'm trying to remember they gave away they said before like when they're going good how many a day

[31:56] they can make.

[31:57] Is that probably high?

[31:58] That's right.

[31:59] Even that would be high.

[32:00] Four or five hundred a week is probably high.

[32:02] For example in 1975,

[32:04] Gottlieb sold 46,139 units.

[32:08] Holy moly.

[32:10] Atlantis sells 2,225 supersockers which I've played a lot of in his a friggin awesome game.

[32:19] 7,130.

[32:21] Unfortunately the sequel soccer was not quite as big a seller.

[32:24] Only 29 hundred.

[32:27] That's because it wasn't super.

[32:29] This is regular soccer.

[32:30] That's the problem.

[32:32] El Dorado sells 2,875 units.

[32:36] Another big one which I haven't played but I hear is an awesome game is fast draw with 8,045

[32:44] units.

[32:44] Really haven't played that one.

[32:45] I haven't played that one and that's a pretty popular game.

[32:47] That's the one I think Texas used to use as their logo.

[32:50] It's got that guy shooting the gun on it.

[32:51] It's also Ed Robertson's like favorite game of all time.

[32:54] Uh, the Canadian connection.

[32:56] Very good.

[32:57] This is a very good yes.

[32:59] Pin up sells 715 units.

[33:01] That's a bad one.

[33:03] Quick draw which is I think the four player version of fast draw is 202,660.

[33:13] Spin out which I think is a cool game is 2850.

[33:18] 300 which is a bowling game.

[33:21] That sells 7,925 units which I don't get but I guess it's got those two cool spinners in the

[33:30] middle so I think that's probably the back box animation with balls.

[33:35] Right the same thing as Super Sons.

[33:36] The rock maker that good one and it's got cool ours say world underglow.

[33:40] I'm a sucker for all back box animation.

[33:42] Yeah that's true.

[33:43] That's true.

[33:44] Tiger sells 1,100 units.

[33:47] Top score sells 3,200 units.

[33:50] Another one that people talk about pretty you know pretty big is Abracadabra.

[33:55] Two thousand.

[33:56] Based on the Steve Miller saw.

[33:58] Actually it's not but

[34:01] Gold strikes sells 675 and Lucky Strike 2014.

[34:08] So they are just bang and okay and that's 19 that's just 1970 killing it.

[34:12] That's not 74 76 that's not 65 that is just one year and people are going nuts about how big

[34:19] Godzilla is selling.

[34:20] You know.

[34:21] So let's talk about a crazy example of the gangbusters that they are.

[34:28] Yeah we mentioned this on our last episode.

[34:30] The Spirit of 76.

[34:32] This is a history patriotic theme from December of 1975.

[34:38] Cells 10,569 units designed by Ed Kinsky and the art by Gordon Morrison.

[34:45] So 1976 was the United States by Centennial.

[34:49] So what does that mean Ron?

[34:50] A bison.

[34:51] That means we were 200 years old.

[34:53] America was 200 years old.

[35:00] What does that what does Wayne say?

[35:02] Wayne says and about 72 or 73 I got thinking about this thing the bison

[35:07] 10.

[35:08] It's going to be a big deal in this country.

[35:09] Everything is going to be red, white and blue.

[35:11] You're going to be flags all over.

[35:14] The United States by Centennial was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-70s.

[35:19] That pay tribute to the historical events leading up to the creation of the United States of America

[35:23] as an independent republic.

[35:25] Breaking away from England.

[35:27] It was a central event in the memory of the American Revolution.

[35:30] The bison 10.

[35:31] He culminated on Sunday, July 4th, 1976 with a 200th anniversary of the adoption of the

[35:37] Declaration of Independence by the founding father delegates of the second continental

[35:42] Congress.

[35:43] You got that?

[35:44] America.

[35:45] The grand celebration of treason against the greed.

[35:50] Well it's actually it was king then.

[35:53] Get your history.

[35:53] Which king?

[35:56] George.

[35:56] It was George this it was George this something.

[35:58] I think the third or something like that.

[36:00] Probably.

[36:01] It's a good name.

[36:02] George is a good name.

[36:02] It's a good strong name.

[36:03] Oh no.

[36:04] You got trivia for me.

[36:05] Oh god.

[36:06] I've got the bison 10.

[36:08] Trivia from a Canadian to an American.

[36:11] Are you ready for this, Ron?

[36:12] I'm ready.

[36:13] Who was the president of the United States during the 1976 events?

[36:18] Uh, well let's see.

[36:20] Carter was elected in 76 but didn't start until January 77 so I had to be forward.

[36:25] That's correct.

[36:26] Gerald Ford.

[36:28] NASA unveiled the first space shuttle which was which they were planning on calling the

[36:34] Constitution for the bison 10.

[36:36] No but it was named after what fictional TV space.

[36:40] Enterprise.

[36:41] That's right.

[36:42] Which famous boxing movie?

[36:45] Roger.

[36:45] Multiple references.

[36:46] Damn it.

[36:47] This didn't go well.

[36:48] All right.

[36:48] Here's a better one then.

[36:49] I've also included.

[36:50] Oh no.

[36:51] False questions.

[36:53] The bison 10.

[36:54] No wagon train Pilgrimbridge began a journey from

[36:58] Blaine Washington in June of 1975 and concluded at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania on July 4th, 1976

[37:10] where 13 people died of dysentery on the Oregon trail leg of the tritz.

[37:15] Sounds really that is true.

[37:18] That is indeed false.

[37:20] Damn.

[37:21] No one died.

[37:23] Nobody died of dysentery on the.

[37:25] Okay.

[37:26] Which popular American Bob hosted the bison 10.

[37:31] Old star-spangled spectacular on NBC?

[37:34] Has to be Bob.

[37:35] There you go.

[37:36] That is.

[37:36] It was not Bob Newhart.

[37:37] I know that.

[37:38] Which of the following was a photographic essay created by the National Film Board of Canada

[37:46] and presented two libraries across the United States?

[37:50] Was it A between friends on Tommy?

[37:55] Was it We Stand Together?

[37:58] New Psalm Solidare.

[38:01] Or was it C the Western partnership?

[38:06] Tabernac Est?

[38:07] Or was it D have some poutine?

[38:09] Exactly.

[38:10] Which one of it was?

[38:10] Which one of it was?

[38:11] I'll say we stand together.

[38:13] No.

[38:14] It was indeed between friends.

[38:16] Oh god.

[38:17] We're friends.

[38:20] Well, you know there was a wager.

[38:22] I think we talked about this the last episode.

[38:23] Wayne Nions tells us the story back when Spirit of 76 is being produced.

[38:27] And he and a few colleagues were enjoying an after dinner conversation with Judd Weinberg,

[38:32] the president of D Gottlieb and company.

[38:34] And Wade said there was probably five or six of us sitting around the table discussing Spirit

[38:37] of 76 and how many we're going to build.

[38:40] Okay.

[38:40] We had to start ordering materials and we had to get going on that.

[38:42] So it goes around the table.

[38:44] I don't say anything.

[38:45] Judd said, Wayne, what do you say?

[38:47] Why are you so quiet?

[38:48] You're never quiet.

[38:50] I said, if I told you how many games we're going to build, you wouldn't believe it.

[38:53] All you do is laugh.

[38:55] Judd says, come on.

[38:57] So Wayne said 10,000.

[39:00] And everybody laughed.

[39:01] There you go.

[39:02] They didn't think they could crack 10,000 to 10,000 production units.

[39:07] Well, Wayne's colleagues thought they were only going to sell maybe 2,500 or 3,000 games.

[39:12] So you got to go and order the wire.

[39:15] You got to go and order the reels and the box and the glass and all that stuff.

[39:19] So if you're ordering 2,500, it's totally different than if you're ordering 10,000, right?

[39:23] Okay.

[39:25] Huh.

[39:26] All right.

[39:27] Where do I start at the top here?

[39:28] Yes.

[39:29] Okay.

[39:30] Becoming a pro crew means the perfect way to say thanks and it starts at $3 of up.

[39:34] Want to get early access to episodes before everyone else?

[39:37] Have a strange love for stickers?

[39:39] Do you know what a discord is?

[39:40] Interested in having your comments and questions take priority on our episodes?

[39:44] Jump on.

[39:45] Wait a minute.

[39:46] This is odd twice.

[39:47] Idiot.

[39:47] Oh boy.

[39:48] You can't what you paid for.

[39:49] I can't.

[39:50] I can't.

[39:51] Uh boy.

[39:52] You can't what you paid for.

[39:53] I guess.

[39:54] All right.

[39:54] Hold on.

[39:54] Jump on.

[39:55] It's $6 of up premium crony.

[39:57] Want all the other perps and a shirt after three months?

[40:00] Join us at $20 some up as an Ellie leadest crony.

[40:04] Wow.

[40:05] Uh, can I have my money now?

[40:11] Judd promised that if it went as high as 10,000 that he would personally

[40:15] deliver number 10,000 to Wayne's door.

[40:17] Well, true to his word, Judd delivered Wayne number 10,000,

[40:22] which was produced.

[40:24] And it was the only game that Wayne Nions would own,

[40:27] which I find really weird.

[40:29] But there you go.

[40:31] This game is now at the Pacific Pinball Museum.

[40:35] Wayne was the only person to believe in the power of a merc.

[40:39] So, so how was Judd as a leader?

[40:42] You refer to Judd and Judd was, uh, what was his name?

[40:46] Judd Weinberg.

[40:47] John White.

[40:48] John Judd Weinberg.

[40:50] George Moton.

[40:52] Moton.

[40:52] Moton.

[40:53] Moton and Moton 10.

[40:56] Wow.

[40:56] That is, yeah.

[40:56] That's a really multiple tease.

[40:58] And there you go.

[40:58] Too many teas.

[41:00] George M.

[41:01] George M.

[41:02] Pinball artist around these times would tell Roger Sharp

[41:05] in his original recorded pinball tapes.

[41:08] Judd will tell you what he wants and bother the hell out of you until he gets it.

[41:11] But he was not a bad guy to deal with.

[41:13] Firm.

[41:14] And he would nag you.

[41:15] That's basically what I get from that.

[41:17] Well, this is when we get into a significant watershed moment in the life of

[41:21] DeGotlib and co people.

[41:24] A people in 1976, Alvin Gottlieb, son of David Gottlieb, the D and DeGotlib and company,

[41:31] sold Gottlieb to Columbia Pictures, the movie production company.

[41:35] I've done a lot of research and I can't find the reason why Alvin sold

[41:41] DeGotlib.

[41:42] Which is what I was going to ask.

[41:43] Yeah.

[41:44] You're killing it.

[41:44] You're selling games all over the place.

[41:46] This is like before solid state, before they kind of started to go downhill.

[41:51] Yeah.

[41:51] This is when they're peaked.

[41:52] This is the peak.

[41:53] I'm sure he, you know, is a pretty good time to get a chance.

[41:54] I could think of one reason, but I couldn't confirm it.

[41:57] Okay.

[41:58] David gave him a crap load of money.

[42:01] Cause they were the number one pinball company in the world at the time.

[42:04] That.

[42:05] So I mean, if anybody has a primary source,

[42:08] a primary source is Alvin or somebody close to Alvin,

[42:11] specifically saying why that would be the best thing I could, I could do.

[42:16] Because I'm not going to put some speculation in here, even though we just did that.

[42:18] It's like 40 years of the same family owning it.

[42:23] And then he just decided like, that we're going to sell.

[42:25] We're out of here.

[42:26] Now, Alvin actually did a lot of work with David Gottlieb.

[42:29] He was the salesy guy and the regional kind of person that would travel around

[42:33] to the distributor.

[42:34] So it's not like he was just new or he didn't care about the company.

[42:38] There was a reason why I can't find a solid reason why

[42:41] but let's just go with money.

[42:45] That's what I would think.

[42:46] Well, the leadership was basically the company was pretty much kept intact.

[42:49] Yeah.

[42:50] Which is pretty great.

[42:51] So I mean, it's different ownership,

[42:53] but the company more or less stays the same.

[42:54] Yeah.

[42:55] If you look at the material from the time like manuals and stuff,

[42:58] the only difference was there's now a Columbia Pictures logo on them.

[43:02] Other than that, everything looked exactly the same.

[43:05] You would answer to a giant corporate structure rather than a member of the Gottlieb family.

[43:11] So there's that bit to it.

[43:13] In this time, John Osborne would release his first game, which was gridiron,

[43:18] a football theme from 1977.

[43:21] It sells 1,025 units.

[43:24] It's designed by John Osborne and Art by Gordon Morrison.

[43:27] Wayne basically came to John and asked him to make a two-player version of Wayne's 1973 pro football.

[43:36] Oh, yeah, flyer, flyer, flyer.

[43:38] It's the one that's like green.

[43:40] It's very green.

[43:41] It's a world under glass.

[43:43] Yep, it's got a football field on the play field.

[43:47] It's a tough hitting action-filled new game.

[43:50] And it's very green.

[43:52] It's very green.

[43:53] Very green.

[43:54] This is the cool part about gridiron is that the ball doesn't have a plunger.

[43:59] It comes out of the center, right?

[44:00] It comes out of the center and it just shoots up like out of the trough,

[44:04] which is different, very different, very cool.

[44:07] It also has an amazing spinner right in the middle.

[44:10] That's just mm-mm-mm-mm-mm juicy.

[44:13] And it has two very targets, one on the left and one on the right.

[44:17] Love me a very target.

[44:18] Everybody knows that, right?

[44:20] Absolutely.

[44:21] You know, I love a very target.

[44:23] It also has four flippers at the bottom in a scissor flipper format.

[44:28] What do you mean by that?

[44:29] If you lift the flippers up, the ball can go in between them.

[44:32] Yeah, so it adds a little layer of scary.

[44:35] This was also branded as 50 years of got-leab

[44:40] with a Columbia Pictures industry company down in the bottom corner of the flier.

[44:46] Hmm, that's a fun game.

[44:49] It's a good one, but it only sold 1,000 units.

[44:54] The next game that John Osborne would do shortly thereafter, the next

[45:00] following year was Poseidon and hit the deck, which were basically the same game.

[45:06] Poseidon is very much a nautical theme with the god of water,

[45:15] but it also had like card playing theme to it.

[45:19] And it had a very attractive lady sitting on a boat with a dude.

[45:24] They're playing cards.

[45:25] It's really, it's an odd thing.

[45:27] The dude, they're playing cards.

[45:28] It's really, it's an odd, I have no idea what's going on there.

[45:32] But again, another really kind of cool play field.

[45:36] And the art is stunning.

[45:38] Gordon Morrison art, absolutely stunning.

[45:40] It was from August of 1978.

[45:42] It sold 531 and 375 units.

[45:45] Ooh, it used black score reels with red lettering.

[45:51] Yeah, to try to simulate digital scoring in the interview.

[45:55] He said it wasn't designed to like trick anybody.

[45:58] They just thought they would do it because it just kind of looked nicer.

[46:01] And it wouldn't stick out amongst all of the new solid state machines

[46:05] that were being developed by the other manufacturers.

[46:07] Yeah, and that's the issue.

[46:09] All the other manufacturers are making solid state games.

[46:11] And they're still doing EMs.

[46:13] They're still kind of, they're still kind of struggling there.

[46:15] The next two games that John Osborne would do, it was Blue Note or Rockstar,

[46:20] the two player or four player game.

[46:23] The one, I'm sorry, one player or two player game.

[46:26] It is from December of 1978.

[46:28] It is 229 units and 268 units designed by John Osborne and Gordon Morrison as art.

[46:35] It appears as though because at this time,

[46:38] they're still doing a lot, a lot of great designs with Khrinsky

[46:43] and some of the other team there at Gottlieb.

[46:47] John Osborne tends to appear as though he is like a fill the line kind of designer, wouldn't you say?

[46:53] Well, there have another games like Countdown that are selling a ton, Sinbad.

[46:57] Yeah, so it's not like they're suffering.

[47:00] As we said in our Gottlieb episode,

[47:03] one of our many Gottlieb episodes, when they first got into solid state,

[47:07] as much as everyone says they were behind,

[47:09] their first solid state games did sell well.

[47:11] Like in the late 70s, they made a ton of them.

[47:14] They had a gap in the line and they needed somebody to fill it.

[47:17] And that was ended up being John Osborne.

[47:19] The rock star game, I think it's one of his most unique.

[47:25] And it's a super interesting game in general.

[47:30] It's a musical kind of rock star theme, as you can imagine.

[47:36] Although it's very Beatles 1970s-esque backlash is just gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

[47:44] The play field is really unique.

[47:46] And why do I say that it's really unique?

[47:49] Offset flippers.

[47:50] Offset flippers, no outlane or inlane on the left side of the play field.

[47:55] This might have been the inspiration for Halloween.

[47:59] That left side instead of hedges are all stand-ups, just all the way up the left side.

[48:03] That's very Halloween-like.

[48:05] And they are Do-Remi Faso Latido, all stand-up targets.

[48:10] It's got five pop bumpers, two spinners on the right side.

[48:15] It's weird.

[48:16] It's weird.

[48:18] But it's unique.

[48:19] You got to give them that.

[48:20] And they got a guy with a trumpet, because I know when I think rock star,

[48:24] trumpet is like the first instrument I think of.

[48:30] Maybe if it was Chicago, but I mean, Chicago, the band Chicago.

[48:35] Yeah, band Chicago.

[48:36] Yeah.

[48:37] I love bands named after cities.

[48:39] Boston.

[48:40] Europe.

[48:42] That's not a city.

[48:42] That's a country, yeah.

[48:44] God, you're American.

[48:48] John said, they just decided they didn't want these particular designs.

[48:52] I didn't design that often because I had other things to do.

[48:54] I was not solely a designer.

[48:56] Yeah, so there he was.

[48:57] He was the Phil Veline designer.

[48:59] And they were, again, quirky, weird designs.

[49:02] I think the best one is the grid iron design, personally.

[49:06] This is the time where the microprocessor becomes the buzzword, right?

[49:10] So many companies in the 1970s were working on creating silicon, processing chips,

[49:15] Texas instruments, Intel, western design center to name a few.

[49:21] The race, especially in the United States, was around the microprocessor.

[49:28] Eventually, the pinball, eventually pinball would notice this sort of quick computing of the

[49:34] microprocessor and the ability to use memory and remember states of targets or locations.

[49:43] And they would leverage that for pinball, which they could do with pinball,

[49:48] but it would take a ton of relay, stepper units.

[49:51] It was just a pain, the butt to do.

[49:53] It's terrible, terrible, but now you could do it with a board.

[49:55] But a board, they would be much lighter than the massive score reels in back boxes as well.

[50:00] And they were required less tinkering to adjust the switches.

[50:04] They'd hopefully be cheaper and easier to manufacture.

[50:07] First in was ballet, then stern, then Williams, and lastly, got leap.

[50:12] And to be fair, stern just ripped off ballet.

[50:14] So

[50:16] got leap would stumble into solid state.

[50:18] That was very much the focus on our episode system one stepping on rakes,

[50:24] as well as the sort of the reinvention of solid state in system 80.

[50:29] That is a couple of episodes in our archives.

[50:31] You can see those at silverballcronicles.com or back in your pod catcher feed in the dedicated

[50:37] silver ball chronicles feed.

[50:39] So why was got leap last to the punch run?

[50:44] According to Wayne, Wayne Nions, he says I was part of the problem of got leap going downhill.

[50:49] I always blame myself as part of it.

[50:51] As a chief engineer, my time was taken up almost 100% with what was going on in the factory.

[50:56] Traveling to workout issues like getting enough wire.

[50:58] So I didn't see the electronics come in.

[51:01] Williams were the early guys.

[51:02] Balli were making all these electronics,

[51:04] fooling around with electronics and getting their systems ready.

[51:07] We didn't know.

[51:08] I blame myself for not seeing it soon enough and hiring enough people.

[51:11] Yeah, they were too big to move quickly because they are making 45,000 games a year, right?

[51:17] They have problems like can I get enough legs for the pinball machines?

[51:23] They are focused primarily on that.

[51:25] They are so big they can't just they call it nowadays the pivot, right?

[51:29] They can't change.

[51:30] They can't.

[51:31] Oh yes, pivot.

[51:32] Yes, everybody loves a good buzzword.

[51:35] They were too successful and they were too big to change enough.

[51:39] This is where the spiral started.

[51:43] Well, they would bring in Rockwell Industries and an individual named Alan Edwell.

[51:48] He would work on got leaps behalf with Rockwell Industries for the express purpose of building

[51:55] and designing their solid state system.

[51:57] Wayne would say, got lead went to a third party to design the solid state,

[52:01] but that's why we went downhill.

[52:03] We got started and brought in Rockwell.

[52:06] They made it for us.

[52:07] It wasn't the best system in the world,

[52:08] so we were kind of behind the eight ball.

[52:10] We never did catch up.

[52:12] I think got lead was downhill from that on.

[52:14] It was quite sobering in the interview with Wayne Nions where he takes a lot of,

[52:20] he takes a kind of hard of the loss of got lead because he was there.

[52:24] He helped build the company.

[52:26] It was his company and he takes a lot of responsibility.

[52:30] I think he feels a lot of shame in the downward spiral of got lead and the death of system one.

[52:35] He might have been part of the problem,

[52:38] but I don't think he was entirely the problem.

[52:40] I don't think he should be as hard on himself as he is.

[52:44] I'd like everybody to go check out episode five, stepping on rakes, got lead system one.

[52:50] Episode 19, 80s cheese done right, got lead system 80b.

[52:56] Episode 25 playing catch up got lead system 80.

[53:00] Those have lots of more detail on the Rockwell relationship and the struggles that they had

[53:08] to return to greatness.

[53:10] And then Rockwell later went into music and did the song Somebody's Watching Me.

[53:14] Anyone get that at all? Probably not.

[53:16] No. No.

[53:18] Rockwell. He was very gordy son.

[53:20] Yes.

[53:21] So he had that hit song that he had Michael Jackson do that parked that anyone or members from it.

[53:26] Somebody's watching me.

[53:28] Okay, you can edit that.

[53:29] So got lead also moved into video at this time because that was sort of a big sort of growth

[53:34] area in the early 80s. They would make a qubert as their biggest hit and mock three.

[53:41] And Dennis Nordman started working at caught lead and he was there for a cup of coffee.

[53:47] Yeah, Dennis says I think I was there for a year, year and a half.

[53:50] I didn't do pinball games there.

[53:52] I submitted ideas for video games.

[53:53] My game was their second laser disk game and then I wrote the script and built some models and

[53:58] things. That was it.

[53:59] Cuber is a good game.

[54:01] Cuber is awesome.

[54:02] And it has a pinball element.

[54:04] Ah, this one I know because you asked me this last time.

[54:06] I know. It is a knocker.

[54:08] Very good. Yes.

[54:10] When he falls off, it just hits that that's awesome.

[54:13] It's so good. And it's such a great game.

[54:15] David Theull did the sound.

[54:17] Cuber is amazing.

[54:18] And when he talks.

[54:19] Right.

[54:21] Remember your fuckers.

[54:22] Definitely.

[54:23] It was so good. They made the pinball machine for it.

[54:27] While Gottlieb was struggling to adapt in the solid state area,

[54:31] era, they were taking that sort of EM style game and they were just making it into solid state.

[54:38] And then they started moving into actual solid state pinball by system 80.

[54:43] So here's an example that John Osborne says that the struggle was real when they switched over.

[54:49] From EM to solid state.

[54:52] John says when we went to solid state, that changed everything.

[54:56] The way the games were built, we had to lay out the play field in the same way,

[55:00] but now because these cables had Mollex connectors on them,

[55:03] the factory really couldn't do that.

[55:05] We couldn't handle it.

[55:06] We had to program the thing.

[55:08] When I plugged a game in the first time, it never worked.

[55:11] There was always something not working.

[55:13] Then we had to build it.

[55:14] This big ship is trying to turn and now they have to train all of their staff on

[55:18] Mollex connectors.

[55:19] They have to train the poor guy doing the whitewoods.

[55:22] John Osborne is, you know, people don't understand how to change the relays and all of that stuff

[55:29] because there aren't any relays anymore.

[55:30] It's all programming.

[55:32] The very way Gottlieb was set up from design to factory was to build EM machines.

[55:37] Score motors, real switches, everything on a massive scale had to be redesigned and processes had

[55:41] to be recreated.

[55:43] The struggle became real and that's when we get into the system 80 transition.

[55:48] Gottlieb continued to fall behind.

[55:51] Wayne Eines and Judd Weinberg resigned the same day.

[55:54] However, Wayne stayed on as a consultant until 1983.

[55:59] Hey guys, as a quick heads up, I wanted to let you know that in my real life,

[56:02] I'm David the advice guy.

[56:04] At Dennis Financial, we aren't investment advisors or insurance agents.

[56:08] I always thought that sounded terrible.

[56:10] We want to provide you with sound financial advice.

[56:13] In fact, we want to provide you with investment and insurance advice for life.

[56:17] Can we take that honor very seriously?

[56:20] Do you know individuals who received financial advice for 10 years have two times the financial assets of

[56:25] unadvised individuals?

[56:27] For example, we've got mortgage insurance at the bank, right?

[56:30] What's you know?

[56:31] A 40-year-old non-smoker can save $30 a month every month for 20 years just from shopping around

[56:39] for a more competitive rate.

[56:41] Now just imagine what a pinhead like you could do with that extra money.

[56:44] Toppers and shooter rods, anyone?

[56:47] If you're looking for a more human dimension to your financial advice,

[57:11] So who would take over for those two?

[57:13] Well, a gentleman named Bob Bloom took over as president of the company and he quickly earned

[57:19] the nickname Bloom Doggle, like Boone Doggle or making a mess of things.

[57:26] He was certainly among the old guard at Columbia Pictures.

[57:31] You know who took over Wayne's position?

[57:33] Dick Finger.

[57:35] Wait, that's his name?

[57:36] That is his name.

[57:37] Dick Finger.

[57:39] Why wouldn't why wouldn't he go by Richard?

[57:42] I don't know.

[57:43] Why would he go by Dick?

[57:44] Well, according to John Osborne,

[57:46] Dick didn't stay too terribly long at Gottlieb.

[57:49] He was a nice guy, sincere and willing to learn, but he hadn't been in the industry.

[57:53] It was just strange to have these people directing us that really had no background in pinball.

[57:58] Ooh, red alert, red alert.

[57:59] Yeah, this resulted in creating a bunch of remakes of Ed Kinsky's design,

[58:06] such as Super Orbit, which was a redesign of 1971's Orbit and Royal Flush Deluxe,

[58:12] which was an example, a new solid state example of 1976's Royal Flush.

[58:18] John Osborne said, they kept telling us to keep designing.

[58:22] The factory was starting to get empty and there weren't as many people there now.

[58:28] I remember they began using the cabling department as a storage room for games,

[58:33] but they just said, keep going.

[58:35] There's still a market out there.

[58:37] The first pre-mile star game.

[58:39] So this is Amazon Hunt.

[58:41] Your favorite kind of hunt, isn't that right?

[58:44] Mm-hmm.

[58:45] Besides Space Hunt.

[58:48] Fantasy Jungle theme, September of 1983,

[58:51] Standard Body, it's a system 80A game,

[58:54] 1,515 units, Ed Kinsky design,

[58:57] Art by Larry Day, who is totally always skipped over when it comes to pinball art.

[59:02] He is amazing. Love me some Larry Day.

[59:05] Software is uncredited.

[59:07] It was probably Alan Edwell.

[59:11] Take a look at this flyer.

[59:12] Doesn't this look amazing?

[59:14] It's a jungle of fun.

[59:16] Rowing lions and trumpeting elephants.

[59:21] That's what they make with their nose.

[59:24] Yeah, exactly.

[59:24] Yes.

[59:25] Well, come players to Amazon Hunt,

[59:27] the latest in Gottlieb series of economically priced,

[59:31] convertible pinball games.

[59:33] What does that mean?

[59:34] That means you could just swap them out.

[59:36] It's incredible.

[59:37] Mm-hmm.

[59:38] It has great play, solid long-term earnings,

[59:41] and Gottlieb's renowned reliability.

[59:44] Book passage to the jungle of fun.

[59:47] I don't know if I do.

[59:49] It does look cool.

[59:50] That's all right.

[59:52] Looks good.

[59:53] It doesn't have regular slings, which is kind of fun, right?

[59:55] It's got just roll-throughs at the bottom,

[01:00:00] which is kind of neat.

[01:00:01] Very, very fun.

[01:00:04] Some of the things when they were transferring,

[01:00:06] though, into this era,

[01:00:08] were that they didn't have before,

[01:00:10] you know, now we're getting into ball-to-ball memory

[01:00:12] when it comes to system 80.

[01:00:14] Prior to that,

[01:00:16] they didn't have that in solid state EM.

[01:00:19] So sales are declining.

[01:00:20] Things are spiraling.

[01:00:22] Keep it going.

[01:00:24] But it's the turmoil at the top of the company

[01:00:28] that's really the big issue.

[01:00:30] It was during this time

[01:00:31] that Coca-Cola acquired Columbia Pictures

[01:00:35] on June 22, 1982.

[01:00:37] Now, Coke didn't buy Gottlieb, mind you.

[01:00:40] They bought the company that owned Gottlieb.

[01:00:44] They just kind of ended up with Gottlieb,

[01:00:47] but what they really wanted was Columbia Pictures.

[01:00:50] Now, a company who is struggling to learn pinball

[01:00:53] was just purchased by another company

[01:00:56] who didn't know anything about pinball.

[01:00:58] And then the process started all over again

[01:01:02] with learning how to build and manufacture.

[01:01:06] John Osborne says,

[01:01:08] one day they said,

[01:01:09] okay, everyone into the lunch room.

[01:01:11] They got the whole plant in there at the time.

[01:01:14] They can now get the whole plant into one lunch room.

[01:01:17] We're thinking, oh, this is it.

[01:01:18] This is it.

[01:01:20] Bob Loon gets up and says,

[01:01:22] you know, we're poised for a great future.

[01:01:24] We're a new company now.

[01:01:26] We have so much confidence

[01:01:27] that we're renaming the company.

[01:01:29] It's not going to be called Gottlieb.

[01:01:31] It's going to be called myelstar.

[01:01:34] Yeah, rebranded.

[01:01:36] Now, that's weird.

[01:01:37] Why did Coca-Cola change the name from Gottlieb?

[01:01:41] Well, according to Michael Shalob,

[01:01:44] in his book, The Pinball Compendium,

[01:01:45] now this is the 1982 to the present version,

[01:01:49] Coca-Cola sent a letter to all of its operators

[01:01:52] indicating that it wanted to invoke

[01:01:55] an organization developing exciting new products

[01:02:00] to meet tomorrow's entertainment needs.

[01:02:03] And the name myelstar was chosen after much research.

[01:02:08] Yeah, they thought it sounded newer.

[01:02:10] Myelstar, the wave of the future.

[01:02:13] Yes.

[01:02:13] Star, space.

[01:02:16] According to John Trudeau,

[01:02:17] Ed Khrinsky asked a vice president of the company

[01:02:19] who was announcing the name change to the employees.

[01:02:21] Why hasn't all the research into this great new name come up with the fact

[01:02:24] that myelstar pronounced backwards says rat slime.

[01:02:28] No, it does.

[01:02:30] Is it does?

[01:02:31] Look at that.

[01:02:33] This was spelled with a Y instead of an i, that's fancy.

[01:02:38] Coca-Cola decided to rename and to transfer Gottlieb

[01:02:42] into this new Coca-Cola subsidiary called myelstar electronics.

[01:02:47] Subsidiarary.

[01:02:48] Subsid... what did I say?

[01:02:49] I don't know what you said.

[01:02:50] Subsidiarary.

[01:02:51] Subsidiarary.

[01:02:52] Subsidiarary.

[01:02:53] Subsidiarary.

[01:02:55] Yeah, he said it right that time.

[01:02:56] That's great.

[01:02:57] Thank you.

[01:02:57] The exact date of this change is not particularly clear,

[01:03:00] but it appears to be somewhere around like September of 83.

[01:03:04] And this is where Amazon Hunt was being produced.

[01:03:08] And then in November of 83 when the next game was produced.

[01:03:12] Coca-Cola had a bunch of other departments.

[01:03:15] One of them called RAF Star and another department called

[01:03:19] Ray Star.

[01:03:20] Ah, that's where they got it.

[01:03:21] Ah, the research.

[01:03:23] Hmm.

[01:03:24] Well, John Osborne says,

[01:03:26] we came along with the Columbia sale and they called this myelstar.

[01:03:31] We called it no star because any of us who knew the company's history knew that

[01:03:35] anytime a company changes their name, that's the kiss of death.

[01:03:38] Now there was a massive sign outside on the Gottlieb factory.

[01:03:44] And it was like it was like lights and sheet metal and all this stuff.

[01:03:48] And it was even Gottlieb, right?

[01:03:49] This huge sign up on the factory.

[01:03:52] And the Coke people showed up and they started taking it down.

[01:03:55] And they had to break it into a bunch of pieces and they were going to toss it into a dumpster.

[01:03:59] Apparently John Osborne snagged this sign and took it home in his small car in the two or three

[01:04:06] pieces and it took him that many trips to take it to his home.

[01:04:11] And then he rebuilt it in his home.

[01:04:13] Eventually John would sell this giant sign on eBay to a Canadian collector.

[01:04:19] I wonder where that sign is today.

[01:04:22] Who is it in your house?

[01:04:23] It's not.

[01:04:25] Myelstar did not just create pinball machines but they also wanted to make more arcade games.

[01:04:33] Apparently the management at Myelstar wanted to be a video game company.

[01:04:38] Well, John Trudeau says when the video craze came to be, the Myelstar management wanted to

[01:04:42] kill the pinball product totally.

[01:04:44] That's why the name of the company was changed when Coca-Cola bought Columbia pictures.

[01:04:48] They wanted to be known as a video game company.

[01:04:50] If that could have put more hits on the street from the video and it would have happened.

[01:04:54] They were able to make those amazing games that Dennis Nordman was designing.

[01:05:00] Maybe they would have actually killed pinball entirely.

[01:05:04] Yeah, but video games died around this time.

[01:05:06] They were, it was sort of like a crappy time in general and that's the 8384 recession.

[01:05:11] Things were not great for Gottlieb in 1982.

[01:05:14] But 8384, it got much much worse.

[01:05:17] And we talk about that in our previous episodes.

[01:05:20] But in 1983, 84, a large-scale recession hit the industry.

[01:05:25] It's commonly referred to as the video game crash of 83.

[01:05:28] But this was also a recession across the entire economy and it started in the 1980s and it was a rough go.

[01:05:35] Do you remember the 1980s recession, Ron?

[01:05:37] Uh, I was a kid.

[01:05:40] Yeah, you don't.

[01:05:42] But it sucked.

[01:05:43] But there were more management changes.

[01:05:46] You can't have consistency with management constantly changing.

[01:05:49] Soon as somebody learns how they're doing the job or makes their mistakes,

[01:05:52] you're there out and now you gotta bring somebody else in who's gotta make all those mistakes.

[01:05:57] So soon Bob Loon was replaced by a guy who's initials were also BB,

[01:06:02] Boyd Brown, who's a nice man and a fan of gaming.

[01:06:05] But he took time to get up to speed.

[01:06:07] Then a gentleman named Al...

[01:06:10] G-Gabroius.

[01:06:13] G-Gabrous.

[01:06:14] G-Gabrous took over engineering.

[01:06:17] Milestar was banging out a bunch of different prototypes during this era,

[01:06:21] but they never made it to approval and full production.

[01:06:25] Six Milestar games ultimately survived through the internal process and were built and sold through distributors.

[01:06:33] The first game, rack them up.

[01:06:35] Great game.

[01:06:36] This is a billiards theme from November of 83.

[01:06:40] To System 80A, it's 1515 units.

[01:06:45] John Burris is the designer with David Moore.

[01:06:49] He did loads, loads of the premier games,

[01:06:52] art and software by John Burris as well.

[01:06:56] Take a look at this flyer.

[01:06:57] Rack them up.

[01:06:59] Oh, it's not very fancy.

[01:07:00] No, it's not.

[01:07:01] It's a very uh,

[01:07:02] pare-down flyer.

[01:07:03] For something that's supposed to be so exciting,

[01:07:06] the flyers are not.

[01:07:07] What do you think of this logo of Milestar Electronics Inc?

[01:07:10] It's an M with a star above it.

[01:07:12] Yeah, don't look good.

[01:07:14] It's very yellow.

[01:07:15] There's no ramps or anything on this game.

[01:07:18] It's got in lane on the left side with no sling and then a sling and an in lane on the other side.

[01:07:24] It's got a bunch of dropped targets.

[01:07:26] It's actually kind of looking fun.

[01:07:27] I've never played this.

[01:07:28] It's a great game.

[01:07:29] Rack them up.

[01:07:30] It's a crazy background sound.

[01:07:32] You'll hear it over everything.

[01:07:33] Yeah, they got that weird during this time.

[01:07:35] It's very billiards theme, right?

[01:07:37] You collect all the different balls and then-

[01:07:38] Like the balls, you can change which balls are lit on the dropped targets by hitting the spinner.

[01:07:43] How do you like the spinner?

[01:07:45] You can like the spinner on the target on the left.

[01:07:48] When it's lit for light spinner, you hit the target and it likes the spinner for one rip.

[01:07:53] Get one rip at a time.

[01:07:55] One rip.

[01:07:55] Yeah, and you want to get all the pool balls, etc.

[01:07:59] Typical stuff.

[01:08:00] It's got a play field multiplier or I'm sorry, a bonus multiplier.

[01:08:03] And I get-

[01:08:04] Be like you rack them up.

[01:08:06] Would you have that in your game room?

[01:08:07] I don't.

[01:08:08] Would you though?

[01:08:10] If I had more room, it's cheap.

[01:08:13] I mean, you could probably get that pretty cheap.

[01:08:15] Yeah, there you go.

[01:08:15] It's a cool game.

[01:08:16] It's a good one.

[01:08:16] There's only a thousand units out there.

[01:08:18] 1500 soldiers.

[01:08:19] Probably not very many left around in the world.

[01:08:21] Which is weird because I've seen a lot of.

[01:08:23] Yeah, I guess it's probably because it's a good one.

[01:08:25] Yeah, it's a good one.

[01:08:28] One that did not sell very well was Ready, Aim, Fire.

[01:08:32] This was everybody's favorite theme, Carnival.

[01:08:36] It's November of 83.

[01:08:37] It sells 390 units.

[01:08:40] This is designed by Xing Lam, who I've struggled to find information on Xing Lam.

[01:08:46] If you know anything about Xing Lam, send me an email.

[01:08:49] Silverwall Chronicles at gmail.com.

[01:08:51] Art by David Moore as well.

[01:08:53] What's going on here, Ron?

[01:08:55] Ready, Aim, Fire.

[01:08:58] It is interesting that even though Miles Stars, the company,

[01:09:00] they still kept the Gottlieb logo.

[01:09:03] These all say still on them a Gottlieb pinball game.

[01:09:06] And if you look at the Miles Star games, they still say Gottlieb on them.

[01:09:11] Yeah, it's like they were half committed.

[01:09:14] Everybody remembers Xing Lam from Go and Nuts.

[01:09:18] Oh, he did that one too.

[01:09:20] With a million pop-ups in there.

[01:09:22] He likes pop-ups because there's five on this one.

[01:09:24] It looks like.

[01:09:25] Yeah, and they're in weird locations on this one as well.

[01:09:28] And the art is, yeah, colorful.

[01:09:32] It's cool.

[01:09:33] Actually, I kind of like it.

[01:09:34] But it is kind of dumb.

[01:09:36] Step right up for the game of skill that's old-time,

[01:09:40] kind of a flavor.

[01:09:41] Ready, Aim, Fire.

[01:09:42] Bring the irresistible sights and sounds of the carnival to your game location with Ready, Aim, Fire.

[01:09:49] Call your Miles Star distributor for more details.

[01:09:53] Yeah, really, really, really weird.

[01:09:56] It doesn't, I mean, I guess.

[01:09:58] I give one a play if you see it.

[01:10:00] It's really unusual.

[01:10:01] Give every game a play when you see it, folks.

[01:10:03] Yeah, absolutely.

[01:10:04] Well worth the quarter.

[01:10:07] At round this time, it becomes very apparent that things are not going well

[01:10:13] to the leadership of Miles Star.

[01:10:16] As things struggle, they start making job cuts.

[01:10:19] And John Osborne was let go right around this time.

[01:10:24] And like, let's face it, John Osborne's designs.

[01:10:27] We're actually coming along really, really well at this time.

[01:10:29] He's doing like haunted house, just previous to this.

[01:10:32] You know, he's really starting to come into his own as a designer.

[01:10:36] But he's also, I would say, a critical background figure

[01:10:39] when it comes to designing and getting games ready.

[01:10:42] But they start making job cuts.

[01:10:44] And John Osborne says,

[01:10:46] I'll never forget when I got laid off.

[01:10:48] I was packing all my stuff up.

[01:10:50] Ed Khrinsky came in and says,

[01:10:52] they're letting the wrong people go.

[01:10:54] I'll never forget when he said that.

[01:10:56] He was the nicest man.

[01:10:57] The previous generation of leadership

[01:11:00] or the previous previous generation, Wayne Nions, Judd,

[01:11:03] they realized, hey, we need this generational transition.

[01:11:06] We need to bring in these new guys.

[01:11:07] Get them trained.

[01:11:09] Get them, you know, this now the current leadership is like

[01:11:13] Ed Khrinsky sells machines.

[01:11:14] John Osborne doesn't get rid of John Osborne.

[01:11:16] Now you got Ed Khrinsky.

[01:11:18] And as we mentioned in his bio at the beginning of this episode,

[01:11:21] eventually, he would quit.

[01:11:24] So in full panic mode,

[01:11:26] the game they release is Jax to open.

[01:11:30] This is the card game May of 84.

[01:11:33] sells 2,350 units designed by Ed Khrinsky,

[01:11:37] art by David Moore.

[01:11:39] This is a remake of 1971's Jax, Jax Open.

[01:11:45] This game, this game is awesome.

[01:11:47] I've played a lot of this game.

[01:11:50] It's so much fun.

[01:11:51] But it's really **** hard.

[01:11:55] Deal yourself a winner with Gottlieb's new pinball poker.

[01:11:59] First score an open hand of pair of Jax

[01:12:02] by hitting the drop targets.

[01:12:04] Then keep improving your hand until you reach the top.

[01:12:07] A royal flush.

[01:12:09] Every royal flush helps build huge scoring bonuses plus specials.

[01:12:14] It's easy to learn but challenging to play.

[01:12:19] The winning formula for every location.

[01:12:22] Combining classic play field with contemporary electronics

[01:12:27] and packaging.

[01:12:28] Jax to open is another winner in Gottlieb's line of economically priced pinballs.

[01:12:35] Call your distributor today.

[01:12:37] So what we're seeing here is we're reusing a design that was proven years ago

[01:12:42] because that's probably what distributors asked for.

[01:12:44] They said, remember Jax Open?

[01:12:46] That was an awesome game.

[01:12:48] Make that again.

[01:12:49] So then they made a solid state version of it with higher scoring potential.

[01:12:54] And they're keeping it low priced because they are in a recession.

[01:12:58] Things are terrible.

[01:12:59] They need quick, dirty and cheap.

[01:13:02] This game is awesome.

[01:13:03] Have you played this?

[01:13:04] Yeah, I'm.

[01:13:05] Yes.

[01:13:06] Yeah.

[01:13:06] So it's got drop targets in the front.

[01:13:08] It's got Ace.

[01:13:10] Couple of kings, some queens of Jax and tens.

[01:13:12] And you basically have to shoot two Jax and then three queens and then

[01:13:16] three queens, two kings and they reset all the time.

[01:13:20] That the it's great.

[01:13:21] It's so hard.

[01:13:23] But the hardest part of this run is that the bottom of the in lanes is open.

[01:13:30] Yep.

[01:13:31] So if you try to trap and catch that ball,

[01:13:34] it goes up the in lane and down through the hole into the out lane.

[01:13:40] Yes, it does.

[01:13:43] What do you think?

[01:13:43] Is it a winner?

[01:13:45] Do you like it?

[01:13:46] You don't like it.

[01:13:47] That's oh, now I feel bad.

[01:13:49] I didn't say I didn't like it.

[01:13:50] It's just it's not the best mile start game.

[01:13:52] That's coming up.

[01:13:54] This was when they started testing alpha numeric displays.

[01:13:56] Now these were displays that would do letters and numbers.

[01:14:01] And John Trudeau would tell IPDB that Jax opened serve as a test platform for the first alpha

[01:14:06] numeric displays.

[01:14:08] Although they first appeared actually in production in premieres.

[01:14:13] 1985 Chicago Cubs triple play.

[01:14:16] John Trudeau said we actually made 10 complete Jax to open games with alpha numeric

[01:14:21] displays and a new backlash having new art to fit the openings for those digital displays.

[01:14:28] I wonder where those games have ended up because they are rare.

[01:14:32] Hmm.

[01:14:33] John Trudeau said there was some management concern that it wouldn't make any difference in the

[01:14:36] cash box.

[01:14:37] There really was no way to tell how much the game would have made without it at the same

[01:14:42] location i.e. alpha numeric displays.

[01:14:44] But we did get some positive feedback because of the initials entering capability it now had.

[01:14:50] Players in general liked the displayed messages too.

[01:14:52] Yeah.

[01:14:53] Very cool.

[01:14:54] Always good to put your name in.

[01:14:56] They also had smaller coin doors at this time.

[01:14:59] So the coin doors because they were made of metal

[01:15:02] also kind of got a little smaller so they could kind of cut the cost a little bit.

[01:15:08] Yeah, it depended.

[01:15:09] Some would have the smaller ones, some would have the bigger ones.

[01:15:12] Even in the same models.

[01:15:13] Yeah, and it was like the silver got-leab one that everybody knows and then it was like the

[01:15:18] weird sort of tiny black one.

[01:15:21] And it looks terrible with this tiny black one by the way.

[01:15:25] Ugh.

[01:15:25] Grody.

[01:15:26] And now the next game, the best milestone game ever made.

[01:15:30] Alien Star.

[01:15:32] Alien Star.

[01:15:33] This masterpiece.

[01:15:35] It is a pretty awesome game.

[01:15:36] I've played yours when I was down to level zero.

[01:15:39] I absolutely totally love this game.

[01:15:42] A game that was underrated for a very long time and then all of a sudden randomly went

[01:15:46] through the roof for pricing.

[01:15:48] Yeah, because it was shown at Pinberg and they saw it in a tournament and said,

[01:15:52] oh my god, this thing's awesome.

[01:15:54] And then yeah, then everyone needs to have-

[01:15:56] Great theme, great sound.

[01:15:57] Do the thing is pretty easy.

[01:15:58] It's a do the thing game.

[01:16:00] And it had two different coin doors.

[01:16:01] I have the wider one.

[01:16:03] Yeah, the better one.

[01:16:04] Friend of mine has the skinnier one,

[01:16:06] which he would say is better because there's more cabinet art.

[01:16:09] Yeah, June of 84 sells a thousand sixty-five units.

[01:16:12] This is designed by John Trudeau and Art by Larry Day.

[01:16:16] And it's unique for a couple reasons.

[01:16:17] There's something with the ground that like this one's actually

[01:16:22] grounded right or something when none of the other games are.

[01:16:25] And this was all those system eighties really struggled from that.

[01:16:28] And we talked about how Gottlieb would never have any,

[01:16:33] like they would never have updates to their code ever,

[01:16:36] except in very specific instances like-

[01:16:39] Things would explode.

[01:16:41] Well, no, things like was it James Bond had the time played format,

[01:16:45] which did which bombed horribly so they came out with a non-time version.

[01:16:48] Well, Alien Star had a bug and they actually had a fix, a ROM fixed version.

[01:16:55] Beautiful.

[01:16:56] Beautiful.

[01:16:56] The art on this is awesome.

[01:16:57] It's like a space guy and a cape,

[01:16:59] but it's not highly detailed, right?

[01:17:01] It's like just the outline of him and its space behind him or her.

[01:17:06] It's awesome.

[01:17:07] And it's extremely simple.

[01:17:08] They could not have cost a lot of it.

[01:17:10] It's a lot to make the game.

[01:17:11] Because there's no drop targets.

[01:17:14] Just stand-ups, only three pop-oppers,

[01:17:17] spinner,

[01:17:18] had to be super cheap to make the game.

[01:17:20] That spinner.

[01:17:21] And they've moved to the metal-wide spinner,

[01:17:25] instead of that crappy plastic one they had.

[01:17:28] Well, they did that system 80.

[01:17:29] They had the better spinner.

[01:17:30] Pinball 1984.

[01:17:33] Journey to an Alien Star.

[01:17:36] Okay, so Alien Star is a location.

[01:17:39] Wow, I didn't know that.

[01:17:40] I thought it was a person.

[01:17:41] Journey to an Alien Star for a pinball battle in space.

[01:17:46] Multi-ball skill shots and plenty of fast action

[01:17:49] bring this fantasy world alive for your players.

[01:17:51] So yeah, it had a multi-ball.

[01:17:55] Big deal.

[01:17:56] Big deal.

[01:17:56] And the art is just so awesome.

[01:17:59] Tons of fun.

[01:17:59] So the idea of this game is that you want to complete Alien

[01:18:03] on the stand-ups on the right.

[01:18:05] And that lights your lock on the left.

[01:18:07] And a capture saucer, right?

[01:18:08] Yeah, but you want to lock in the lock at a higher value.

[01:18:11] You got 2X.

[01:18:13] Was it 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X?

[01:18:15] What is it again?

[01:18:16] Is it just...

[01:18:17] I'll try to give it a skips one.

[01:18:19] 2X 3X and 5X, yes.

[01:18:21] 2X 3X and 5X, you wanted a 5X.

[01:18:24] If you lock a ball at 5X,

[01:18:25] then everything in multi-ball is worth 5X.

[01:18:28] So if you hit a spinner, if you hit a lit spinner,

[01:18:31] which is worth 10,000 to spin,

[01:18:32] it's now 50,000 to spin.

[01:18:35] And your score will go from nothing to insane.

[01:18:38] So you changed the multiplier on the scoop on the left side by shooting the spinner itself?

[01:18:44] So you can actually spin it too far and go from the 5 back to the two.

[01:18:48] Yep.

[01:18:49] So then you got to, so it's very, very nuanced that way.

[01:18:53] And then how do you release the ball?

[01:18:55] Uh, you just plunge a new ball.

[01:18:56] As soon as it hits a switch, as soon as it hits a switch, it will release two ball

[01:18:59] multi-ball.

[01:19:00] Now that ball comes down and it bounces off the top of the left split sling.

[01:19:06] Not on the left split sling, not into the flipper, but onto the top of that sling.

[01:19:11] So you got to be on the, sorry about this, on the ball.

[01:19:14] On the ball.

[01:19:16] Because you got to be careful because it might go to the outline, it might go down the

[01:19:20] drain, it might go into the other slings.

[01:19:22] You got to be, you got to be on it.

[01:19:25] This is a pretty amazing game.

[01:19:27] I would totally have one of these in a heartbeat.

[01:19:30] And they're well overpriced at this point.

[01:19:32] Way overpriced especially, they were overpriced prior to COVID.

[01:19:36] So now it's, yes, yes, I blame Pinberg.

[01:19:39] Beautiful game.

[01:19:40] Tons of fun.

[01:19:41] Do the thing.

[01:19:42] Very cool.

[01:19:43] Because at level zero, we were playing, we were practicing before we started to stream,

[01:19:49] I beat you on this game.

[01:19:50] I don't, I don't recall that.

[01:19:52] I don't recall.

[01:19:53] One of the greatest accomplishments of my entire life.

[01:19:56] It's going in my autobiography.

[01:19:58] Chapter 37, the time I beat Ron at Alien Star.

[01:20:02] The last game that Miles Star would do was the games.

[01:20:05] The games.

[01:20:06] Which is a, a, an odd theme, odd enough.

[01:20:11] August of 84 sells 1,780, 768.

[01:20:17] It sports an Olympic theme.

[01:20:18] Yeah, you think it's weird.

[01:20:19] I mean, it's, it's 1984, the early Olympics.

[01:20:22] The MSRP of this game.

[01:20:24] 1,495,500 bucks.

[01:20:27] Yeah.

[01:20:28] 1500 dollars.

[01:20:29] But I mean, but this is the 1980s and the mid-84s.

[01:20:32] That's actually a lot of money.

[01:20:33] That is a lot of money.

[01:20:34] People don't really realize that, oh, wow, that's, of course, because there's been frigged

[01:20:37] 40 years of inflation.

[01:20:39] And this was the last machine produced by Miles Star before they were purchased by

[01:20:44] Premiere.

[01:20:45] Premiere electronics.

[01:20:46] Now, this was a management group that was led by Gilbert G. Pollock.

[01:20:51] They would purchase the Miles Star pinball assets in October of 1984.

[01:20:56] And they would continue to manufacture pinball machines under a new name for the company

[01:21:01] called Premiere Technology.

[01:21:03] Now Premiere Technology in the 1990s would then revert back to the Gottlieb name.

[01:21:09] There's still call Premiere.

[01:21:11] A Premiere name in pinball, but Gottlieb was prominently on all the games.

[01:21:16] John Trudeau would say the reformation of Gottlieb into Premiere was due to the efforts

[01:21:20] of Mondial distributing in Gil Pollock, a former Gottlieb VP.

[01:21:25] They made the deal to get the pinball assets away from Coca-Cola and made into Premiere

[01:21:29] Technology.

[01:21:30] If you want to learn more about Gil Pollock and his involvement, you want to listen to

[01:21:34] the 80s cheese done right because he was the guy at Gottlieb that I think really made

[01:21:40] a lot of fun in that era before they got into the 1990s reformation.

[01:21:49] And that was sort of in the post Miles Star era.

[01:21:52] Well, why wasn't Alvin Gottlieb involved in the purchase or any Gottlieb's for that

[01:21:56] matter?

[01:21:57] Yeah.

[01:21:58] Why were they totally not interested at all?

[01:22:00] Well, John Trudeau would say, as I understand, the Coca-Cola Miles Star pinball asset

[01:22:04] buyout situation, Alvin Gottlieb declined to be involved at that time.

[01:22:09] A few years later, Alvin's son, Michael, convinced Alvin to try again and they created Alvin

[01:22:17] G.

[01:22:18] And Co, which was a new pinball manufacturer.

[01:22:21] Which he couldn't use his own name.

[01:22:22] He couldn't use the Gottlieb name.

[01:22:24] Amazing.

[01:22:25] So Gil Pollock along with the Fez Gen family, which was the Mondale Corporation owners, they

[01:22:32] were the principal reasons that the pinball production even got a second chance to succeed.

[01:22:37] John Trudeau said, also, without the core of people that came over to Premiere from Gottlieb,

[01:22:43] engineering and manufacturing, there would have not been any success either.

[01:22:47] We all worked as a team to get Premiere running, long hours and a love of the game kept it

[01:22:51] going.

[01:22:52] Through the suffering that happened through that sort of recessionary Miles Star era, it

[01:22:57] brought those teams together stronger.

[01:23:00] And when they were purchased by Premiere, they went above and beyond to keep that family

[01:23:06] business together, to build it again and to make it something special.

[01:23:12] And they did an okay job.

[01:23:13] Yeah, they did.

[01:23:14] Not a great job.

[01:23:15] It's really caught up to Williams, but it was 10 years more of games, which is a good

[01:23:19] thing.

[01:23:20] It was a great game.

[01:23:24] Well Ron, that is the end of our episode today.

[01:23:28] Pinball is dying part for the Miles Star death spiral.

[01:23:33] That's not the title I hope.

[01:23:35] It sounded fun.

[01:23:37] I've changed the name a few times.

[01:23:41] But what do you think?

[01:23:42] What was the, what was, what happened here?

[01:23:47] Corporations that don't know anything about pinball getting involved.

[01:23:49] And then thank God at the end, people actually do know pinball, get involved and buy it back

[01:23:54] and save it.

[01:23:55] It's a wonderful story, but it's also a story that's kind of sad.

[01:23:59] I don't think it's, I think you can make a good movie about that.

[01:24:02] Like they're, they're the Cadillac of the industry and then they just go downhill.

[01:24:07] Corporations ruin everything.

[01:24:08] But then save yours come in and buy it and then everyone's happy.

[01:24:12] And then you do the epilogue at the bottom.

[01:24:14] You know, Premiere would make games for another 10 years.

[01:24:17] Neil Pollock would spend a lot of time on photorealistic backglasses in the 1980s.

[01:24:22] That people love.

[01:24:24] I would say it's a pretty amazing story and one that needed to be told.

[01:24:29] And I'm glad that we were able to do that here in this episode.

[01:24:32] Alien Star, let's call us, Betis Bay, the best game in that era.

[01:24:37] Is there anything else that deserves a really good shout out?

[01:24:40] Play them all.

[01:24:41] Every game deserves to be played, even like ReadyAimfire.

[01:24:44] Play them all.

[01:24:46] Play all the games.

[01:24:47] Don't be a snob.

[01:24:48] They're all absolutely.

[01:24:49] Don't be a ballie snob, William snob, don't be a snob.

[01:24:54] Play everything.

[01:24:56] I could tell you like when I would go to California Extreme and I couldn't get on any

[01:25:01] games because it was so crowded, there'd be like a row of got-leaves that no one would

[01:25:05] be on.

[01:25:06] And that's where I discovered all these amazing got-leaves because I wasn't a snob.

[01:25:11] Remember that.

[01:25:16] Do we get over here?

[01:25:23] Eh, eh, yes again, yes.

[01:25:26] Eh, eh.

[01:25:27] Okay.

[01:25:28] Eh, it's the same thing.

[01:25:29] Is he sitting on your lap?

[01:25:30] Am I sitting on your lap, Ron?

[01:25:32] Sorry.
