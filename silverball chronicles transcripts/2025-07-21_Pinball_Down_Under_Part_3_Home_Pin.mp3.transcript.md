[00:00] I better start recording myself again.

[00:02] So you're recording, okay, give me a couple claps?

[00:04] Actually let me clap less, because those are peaking like little golf claps.

[00:09] Yeah, well I can't even hear them on this side of the... it must cancel them out.

[00:14] Just say clap three times.

[00:16] Clap, clap, clap.

[00:19] God, that's probably gonna be in the fluke present the end now.

[00:30] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me this month

[00:59] like every month is Ron missed out on that ball thing at the Boston Museum Hallet.

[01:06] Wow, that's obscure.

[01:08] What's up, fella?

[01:09] Should we explain what the hell that even means?

[01:12] This came up in the latest SLAMTIL podcast.

[01:15] Yes, SLAMTIL podcast, my other podcast.

[01:17] Wow, we got that in early.

[01:19] With Bruce Nightingale.

[01:20] Bruce Nightingale, I mentioned, you know the little... it's like a glass dome and it'll have the electrodes

[01:28] inside like the mad scientist thing.

[01:30] Yes, everyone's seated at some point.

[01:33] They had that at the Boston Museum of Science when I was a little kid when we went for a

[01:38] plasma ball.

[01:39] Plasma ball.

[01:40] Plasma ball.

[01:41] And it was broken.

[01:42] I was so disappointed.

[01:44] And to that point, you randomly just sort of offhandedly brought it up under your breath

[01:50] during your episode.

[01:52] Yeah.

[01:53] It's still upsets me.

[01:57] It's quite literally one of the... I laughed for like three minutes and I wound it back

[02:02] to listen again because I thought, what an odd thing to hold on to.

[02:07] But that's the kind of people we are in pinball.

[02:09] I do heavily recommend though.

[02:11] At least as of 40 years ago when I went the Boston Museum of Science was awesome.

[02:15] Yeah, we did that in Ottawa.

[02:16] We went with the family.

[02:17] We went for Canada Day in Ottawa and we went to the Canadian Science and Technology Museum.

[02:24] They have Science in Canada?

[02:26] And Technology.

[02:27] Wow.

[02:28] They show you how they make the beer.

[02:29] Yeah.

[02:30] It's all just basically blackberry stuff and maple syrup distilling technology.

[02:38] And how Alex Lifesland's guitars were built and stuff.

[02:41] Actually, there was a guitars.

[02:43] There was like Lifesland's guitars.

[02:45] Of course there was.

[02:46] Yeah.

[02:47] It's quite literally just all of that stuff.

[02:49] It's pretty funny.

[02:50] Cool.

[02:51] Yeah.

[02:52] It's pretty good.

[02:53] But the Canadian History Museum, that's in Gatno Quebec, which is on the other side

[02:56] of the river from Ottawa, it's pretty awesome.

[02:59] And if you're ever coming to Canada and museums is your thing and you're like museums and

[03:04] history and reading plaques and stuff, Ottawa is just unbelievable with the amount of.

[03:09] We went to the aerospace, like the space and aviation museum and they have the only existing

[03:17] old airplanes that the old tiny people used to fly like before the first World War.

[03:22] Mm-hmm.

[03:23] So cool.

[03:24] It's worth it.

[03:25] Tom, tons of fun for the family.

[03:26] Anyway, what have you been doing?

[03:28] What's like, there's, the hobby's been pretty busy here in the last little while.

[03:31] Uh, yeah, all kinds of new stuff coming out.

[03:33] Harry Potter.

[03:34] Exciting.

[03:35] Mm-hmm.

[03:36] We got predator.

[03:38] We got predator.

[03:39] So, AI art.

[03:40] That's a whole thing.

[03:41] Dirk the magic dragon.

[03:44] Dirk the magic dragon, wait a minute.

[03:46] Is it Dirk and dragon's layer?

[03:48] No, it's Dirk.

[03:49] Oh, Dirk.

[03:50] Dirty.

[03:51] Dirty.

[03:52] Yes.

[03:53] Yeah.

[03:54] So, it's worth it?

[03:55] Yes, he's got an extra eye on the side of his face.

[03:58] Yeah.

[03:59] So, it's only on one side.

[04:00] We'll cover that sometime.

[04:01] We'll cover that.

[04:02] Ah, yes.

[04:03] Everybody else's had a go.

[04:04] We'll have a go some other time.

[04:05] Yeah, some other time.

[04:07] Give it a year or so when it really, when it really cools down.

[04:10] We're here to talk about Australia.

[04:12] That's right.

[04:13] But before that, we want to welcome our new patron, Red Velvet Steve.

[04:19] Thank you for joining our Patreon and enjoying the ride of which we have here.

[05:43] A bubble up to the top for people.

[05:44] And because our podcast is not whining about chip play fields and derpy dragons, it's ever

[05:52] green content.

[05:53] So it will continue to be relevant.

[05:55] Oh, I like that ever green content.

[05:58] We also have a discord.

[05:59] So that so when you're part of that patreon, you join that discord, you come aboard and

[06:03] you can chat with us.

[06:05] A lot of that is Ron spilling all the secrets that he knows about all of the upcoming games.

[06:11] Oh, yeah.

[06:12] He reveals his sources names in there.

[06:15] And he's always talking about all of those things that Bruce night and gale tells him that

[06:20] he doesn't say on public.

[06:24] Yep.

[06:25] I find all my information from George Goldmez himself.

[06:27] He just calls me and tells me what all the new games are.

[06:29] You just send him a text message because you're texting friends.

[06:33] Mm hmm.

[06:34] Yeah, you talk about growing up in the old country like like your families did, you know, because

[06:38] you're Cuban.

[06:39] Yes, sure I am.

[06:43] You know, you can email us too.

[06:44] Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[06:48] You can send us tons of emails.

[06:49] We didn't get any emails this month.

[06:51] Oh, that means we didn't make any mistakes.

[06:53] No mistakes.

[06:54] Nobody, nobody, none of the got-leab family emailed us to say that we made a drastic huge error.

[06:59] We didn't say anyone's name wrong or if we did, they didn't notice it.

[07:05] Yeah, I didn't accidentally forget to bleep out the the S word.

[07:09] Oh, you did.

[07:10] I did.

[07:11] It's alright.

[07:12] Mm hmm.

[07:13] But people didn't come here to listen to us chitchat and banter and talk about awesome

[07:18] museums and auto-awe when you come to visit.

[07:21] They came here for the for the for the meat.

[07:25] They didn't come here for the vegetables.

[07:28] Do you like the meat, Ron?

[07:31] Yes, the meat is good.

[07:32] The meat is good.

[07:35] We've visited down under twice already.

[07:38] Mm hmm.

[07:39] First time we visited, we talked about Haggis and the difficulties that there is when it comes to building pinball down under.

[07:47] In our second episode of pinball down under, we spoke about, yes, the old school pinball.

[07:56] Hanken.

[07:57] Hanken pinball, of course, also oddly starts with an H.

[08:01] Wait a minute.

[08:02] Yeah, you're right.

[08:03] I didn't think about that.

[08:05] This is episode three of the pinball down under series.

[08:09] One of the most emailed about and demanded topics we've ever had.

[08:15] Although it has less to do with this actual specific topic and more to do with what are you going to do with another pinball down under.

[08:21] So I've both made everybody happy and about to disappoint them.

[08:26] In part three of pinball down under, let's look at Hanken.

[08:31] Hanken was established in 2013 and was born from a hobby business of Mike Callianowski.

[08:38] For going forward, we're just going to call him Mike.

[08:42] Because most people call him Mike from Hanken, I think because of the last name, yes.

[08:46] It seems like a smart idea to set up manufacturing outside of Australia based on the previous episodes we spoke about.

[08:55] So Mike's special idea was to become the largest manufacturer of pinball in the largest manufacturing country in the world.

[09:05] China.

[09:06] All right. Let's talk about this one, Ron.

[09:08] So you're right. They're all H's.

[09:10] Hanken and Hanken, maybe that's an Australian thing. He's got to start with an H.

[09:15] That's why that's by accident.

[09:17] Wait a minute. My name's Hallett. So does that mean I could start a pinball company in Australia?

[09:21] Hallett pinball? Yeah.

[09:24] Mike. And we'll, in fact, should we call him Mike from Home Pin.

[09:27] Now he's an electrical engineer who worked with in a small electronics factory in Brisbane, Australia.

[09:34] He designed and started making radio control systems for modelers, like people making, you know, like model airplanes and things like that.

[09:43] And then eventually government departments, which government contracts, that's the place to be.

[09:49] These businesses that he started way back in the day all cover all aspects of design, manufacturing, and testing of in-house circuit design and layouts and fabrication and assembly and alignment and metalwork.

[10:06] And I don't know all that stuff that comes along with electrical engineering.

[10:10] You're a big fan of all those processes and project management things, Ron.

[10:16] Yes. Does that excite you? I like electronics. Does process excite you?

[10:22] Not process or process. Neither excites me.

[10:25] Mike loves manufacturing. He loves tooling. He loves engineering.

[10:31] So he is like a proper kind of engineering nerd. And I am not an engineer. I don't have an engineering mind. That's why I often struggle with my, you know, pinball.

[10:45] Repairs and arcade repairs because I'm not from that world. It takes a very special person to be an engineer.

[10:53] Sales people hate engineering clients.

[10:56] Ah, yeah. Well, yes.

[10:58] Because we don't speak the same language.

[11:00] Yes, sales and engineering do not speak the same language at all. That I can, yes.

[11:04] I'm from a very sales-oriented kind of background.

[11:09] Ah, now wonder we don't understand each other.

[11:11] That's, that's right. I, I am very weird that way.

[11:16] But the other thing is like, so when I, like my clients who are engineers, man, they want details.

[11:22] They want a million different scenarios. They want to know the possible ins and outs of everything that could possibly,

[11:29] but the thing is when you're dealing in an industry like I deal with, or like most industries, you can't plan for every possible outcome.

[11:37] So you end up just kind of going around in a circle forever.

[11:41] And quite frankly, that engineering mindset fits very well in our hobby, doesn't it?

[11:46] Ah, yeah. And a hobby with complicated machinery, yes.

[11:50] Yeah, totally. So it was, of course, he would become the founder of a pinball and video game manufacturer, wouldn't he?

[11:57] Mm-hmm.

[11:58] Now Mike finished his electronics apprenticeship, and he worked in radio and TV repair for a short period of time.

[12:07] Till he met a family friend who was a pinball operator who needed help.

[12:12] And Mike says, and I'm not going to do an Australian accent.

[12:15] I think, I think our fans will, will appreciate that.

[12:18] They really, they really hate when you go, oh, let's do another shrimp bomb the bobby.

[12:22] Yeah, yes. No, this is a professional podcast here.

[12:25] Mike's really upset when you, when you, when you, oh, let's go out here with the kangaroos.

[12:30] Oh, okay. All right.

[12:32] Well, Mike says, what happened was, Balli Playboy was released in this operator used to have a standing order of two or three new machines with every new model that came out.

[12:40] Three new Balli Playboys got delivered to them, and the technicians who were X Telecom servicemen opened up the back box and their jaws all dropped.

[12:48] Here was all this electronic stuff that they had no clue about.

[12:51] They were fine fixing the EM machines. They had no problem at all because this was effectively the next step up from telephone exchanges and so on.

[12:59] I just come out of my apprenticeship and here I was an electronics technician.

[13:04] And that shows you how long ago this was been 1978 then.

[13:07] So this is that transition from EM to solid state, right?

[13:11] So you've got all these people who've literally grown up in an industry of relays and switches and balancing things and sanding those relays down.

[13:21] And they just, they know that stuff like the back of their hand.

[13:23] All of a sudden they open up this machine and there's not a single relay in there.

[13:28] You know what I mean? Like immediately you're like, oh, I'm out of a job.

[13:33] There would be a flipper relay, but yes, I get me or go.

[13:36] But here is the new up and coming youngster who's kind of at the right place at the right time, which is they've learned the new technology and I was like, oh, that's well, of course it's just a board.

[13:46] No big deal. Here's all how it shows how it works.

[13:49] They even had 20 or 30 or 40 years of experience on the old stuff.

[13:52] Remember the issues with Balli and organized crime?

[13:57] Are there ties to it? Yes.

[13:59] Yes. We spoke about that way long ago, way back in the archives in our Balli episode.

[14:05] We had these chats about like the Johnson Act.

[14:09] You know what I mean? I remember what that was.

[14:12] The whole gambling transportation of pinball machines.

[14:16] Well, Australia had a similar experience in the late 1980s.

[14:21] But they were a little bit behind when it came to kind of cracking down on cash, business, and organized crime that gravitated towards pinball.

[14:33] After a few years, Mike moved to another operator in Queensland to Queensland automatics.

[14:41] And he worked with video games and gambling machines.

[14:44] And that's when the Australian version of the Johnson Act came around, which was the Fitzgerald inquiry.

[14:53] Do you remember that? The Fitzgerald inquiry?

[14:55] Is it Fitz? I don't see it.

[14:57] I just fit Fitzgerald.

[14:59] Fitzgerald? Yeah.

[15:01] Fitzgerald. It was the Fitzgerald inquiry.

[15:04] But then it says Tony Fitzgerald earlier in the article.

[15:08] So maybe that's a bit prick.

[15:10] I don't know. I'm, I, this is where silver ball chronicles were accurate enough.

[15:16] Well, it's Australia. So maybe it's not Fitzgerald. Maybe they say different.

[15:19] Let's just say it's Fitzgerald. The Fitzgerald inquiry.

[15:22] Yes. Tony Fitzgerald QC was appointed to lead the inquiry following media reports about possible high level police corruption involving gambling and prostitution.

[15:33] Damn. The inquiry took two years.

[15:35] And its terms of reference were twice amended to extend its scope beyond the initial allegations raised.

[15:42] The inquiry resulted in the resignation of Queensland's premier.

[15:48] The calling of two by elections and the jailing of three former ministers and the police commissioner.

[15:56] What was going on in Queensland, man?

[15:58] It also contributed to the end of the national party of Australia's 32 year run is the governing political party in Queensland.

[16:06] Wow.

[16:07] Legit corruption happening in there.

[16:10] So that goes well beyond like.

[16:12] Yeah. Pinball.

[16:13] A bunch of fellows.

[16:14] Benshefellas in Chicago moving pinball machines across state lines over to New York City and hiding them in.

[16:23] What, what was the thing? Where did, where did Roger Sharp play pinball?

[16:27] So did an adult bookstore or something?

[16:29] Something like that.

[16:30] Yeah. Like that's what's happening in the States.

[16:32] Apparently in Australia they're running like an actual like.

[16:36] Good morning, Roy.

[16:38] Yep.

[16:39] Seer, like, leave it to the Australians.

[16:41] A country founded as a penal colony to go all in on government corruption.

[16:46] Well, Mike says there was a lot of corruption going on in backhanders and secret money's left and secret toilet cubicles all over the place.

[16:56] I know some stuff I had overheard, but it's not really relevant these days.

[16:59] It's long gone and thank goodness.

[17:01] I was actually transferred by the company just before all those problems happened at their cons branch or cans branch.

[17:07] One or the other.

[17:08] I don't know how to say that properly.

[17:10] So, so Mike was the service manager.

[17:12] But after the Fitzgerald inquiry and the company closed, Mike was out of a job.

[17:18] So he started as a TV repair business and became an entrepreneur.

[17:23] And he started for 15 years at a thing called cans electronics after he sold cans electronics.

[17:30] But he was still looking for something to do.

[17:33] He had a friend who needed some help with a pinball machine and he went to help him out.

[17:37] The internet was starting and Mike threw many people that he knows, of course, understood boards and how to repair these boards in a lot of these old machines.

[17:48] So it was very much a bit of a hobby business.

[17:51] And then it was 15 or 20 boards and it continued to grow.

[17:55] Mike, along with his friends, started working on importing some of these boards and making new refurbished boards.

[18:02] Making new and refurbished boards.

[18:05] Mike would source the materials and he would attend trade shows and he would build relationships around boards.

[18:12] Now, Ron, a big thing on your other podcast, the slam tilt podcast, you're always talking about boards and replacement boards and battery leakage and all that stuff.

[18:24] Right? That's like a core pillar of the slam tilt podcast.

[18:29] Sure. It's a core pillar of modern pinball machines, but yes.

[18:35] Yeah, it's like a problem. Can you like expand on that a little?

[18:37] Well, in the solid state era when the machines aren't electromechanical anymore, they run on circuit boards and circuit boards eventually go bad.

[18:46] They have things on them that go bad. They have components on them that go bad.

[18:50] They have batteries that leak corrosive acid and ruin the boards and maybe need a new board.

[18:56] For years, I mean, you have to just fix all these yourself, but then as time has gone on, there have been more and more vendors that have these boards, replacement boards.

[19:06] Now, you can use the replace the originals. Many touted to be much better designs than the original boards were.

[19:13] Yeah, and you could replace parts easier if parts burned out or maybe there were more fuses in better places.

[19:20] Right? Like it was really a huge deal when all the sudden circuit boards became easy to manufacture.

[19:29] Now, there is no domestic manufacturing of printed circuit boards in Australia.

[19:35] So, of course, you look to the world's manufacturing base, China.

[19:40] And that led Mike to go to China to find a place to build boards.

[19:46] I went there and I found a few things for various people and started importing stuff and started a small importing business.

[19:53] The main reason for that was that these business people cannot justify buying a container loader product A or product B.

[20:00] I rented a little place in Gangzhou, China. It was the size of a 220-foot container.

[20:05] I would just buy three boxes of this and ten boxes of that for various customers.

[20:09] Once I had enough gear, I would bring it all into Australia and distribute it out of Brisbane from there.

[20:15] Back in sort of the 90s and the 2000s, to go to Asia, go to China. You couldn't just ship a t-shirt from Asia.

[20:25] There was no sort of team-oat-the-time. You had to actually have a whole container to make it worth your while.

[20:31] But the thing is, if you only needed 40 circuit boards for a system-1 godly, you're not going to buy enough to fill an entire container.

[20:39] So there's an opportunity here for Mike. It was pretty smart to help suddenly he was building like this hobby business.

[20:44] But what about starting home pin? Well, my goodness. At this time, 2010, right?

[20:52] There wasn't like a whole lot of manufacturers in pinball in 2010. There's basically stern and there's kind of the start-up of Jersey Jack.

[21:02] They haven't released anything yet in 2010, 2011, 2012. But they're kind of grinded in a way in the background.

[21:11] They will release by 2012. Yes. Well, Mike says more and more people, just ordinary lay people, were buying pinball machine.

[21:21] To have it home, which was kind of unheard of. I thought, well, there might be an opportunity here.

[21:27] So it seems like Mike is the kind of individual whose engineering mindset allows them to identify opportunities.

[21:37] Right? There's opportunities here there. Right? There was an opportunity to come at a school and work in repairing these machines and boards.

[21:47] Then there was an opportunity to kind of get higher up in there. And then when that kind of went bust, maybe I could build pinball machines for ordinary people.

[21:55] So that's when Mike says that he started investigating the possibility of a license.

[22:00] Because I figured a licensed pinball machine was going to sell better than an unlicensed pinball machine.

[22:06] I didn't want to have the Avengers or Superman or something that was pretty high end.

[22:12] In the end, ITV in London accepted my proposal for Thunderbirds.

[22:18] I was able to convince them that I was indeed able to set up manufacturing in a facility and build these machines.

[22:27] So he's identified you need an IP, right? Isn't that a thing that people struggle to understand in this hobby?

[22:35] Yeah, he got, yeah, at least he got that part. You need a license.

[22:39] You need a license and why do you need a license?

[22:42] Just you need a license to get people to buy the game.

[22:48] You need a property that people know that like, oh, yeah, okay. The original themes just doesn't work.

[22:57] The original themes used to work back in the day because the people buying the machines either had to buy those machines because they were contractually obligated to buy certain number of machines from Will.

[23:08] They didn't have any license themes and that's what they bought.

[23:11] And the reason the players today remember those nostalgic themes of theater and magic and medieval madness is because they had to play those machines because there was no alternative at the time.

[23:24] The industry is totally different. You need an IP. If you don't have an IP, don't build the machine unless you're okay selling 25.

[23:33] But he's hit something very smart here.

[23:36] So the problem with manufacturing in China from my understanding of the Aussie pinball podcast episode number 16.

[23:47] That's where a lot of this information comes from.

[23:51] So setting up a factory in China is not as easy as just getting a building and then building the pieces in that building.

[24:00] You still need to build pieces in different factories or buy materials from different factories from all over China.

[24:09] So my understanding by listening to this podcast and it was quite confusing trying to map out where all the stuff is moving from because again, Mike is an engineer.

[24:18] So he's very details. So he gives a lot of details which end up confusing people like me.

[24:24] Well, the thing is you can export anything from China. But importing things into China is near impossible.

[24:36] Right. Because they're very much like you and that's the problem that that trade that world trade is having with China right is the China wants to give you its stuff, but it doesn't necessarily want to buy your stuff.

[24:46] So that causes problems if you're trying to build factory equipment or mechanisms to build equipment for a pinball machine to manufacture pinball machine or build equipment or build mechanisms for a pinball machine.

[24:59] My understanding was that Hong Kong, which is part of China, but is a semi autonomous state.

[25:07] Mike spent a lot of time shipping stuff in to Hong Kong, then from Hong Kong to mainland China to help build this equipment.

[25:17] Yep. Even set up a set up an office in Hong Kong.

[25:20] And that's super, super common in China is you set up a business is set up something like almost like a shell in Hong Kong.

[25:29] And then it goes to Hong Kong on paper or it goes into one port and then out the other. That's something that Americans and Canadians don't understand on a high level basis.

[25:39] Throw it into Google and read all about the political situation in China and Hong Kong and all that stuff. I don't want to get into it.

[25:45] But that is really common. Does that make sense?

[25:48] Makes sense to me.

[25:50] Stern or Jersey Jack, right? What they do is they've got a plant in the United States and they buy from various vendors. Most of the vendors are in the US like they'll buy steel or aluminum from Canada and they'll manufacture a ramp assembly.

[26:05] And then they will sell the ramp assembly to Stern who will then kind of build it and put it in the pinball machine or they'll buy softwood lumber from Canada.

[26:15] And then that'll get made into a play field or a cabinet by another company and then it'll end up in Stern's factory and then they kind of bolt it together or they're circuit boards from China or they buy circuit boards from China because China is cool with exporting from the US and from the from China into US.

[26:32] And then it gets bolted into the machine and it all comes together.

[26:35] Where in China it's like you got to kind of circumvent the system all the time to try to get stuff in and out or out is easier in is the problem.

[26:45] But once you get it all set up in China, then it becomes a lot easier.

[26:50] The other weird thing that Mike talks about in China is if you're setting up a small or medium size factory in a place in China, you have to create what they call an accommodation block.

[27:03] Next to the factory or close to the factory. So what does it what does an accommodation block mean?

[27:10] It's where the employees live. I assume it's like apartments.

[27:15] So you're required to build an accommodation block or five, six, seven apartments that are attached or adjacent to the factory for your factory workers to live in.

[27:28] So that's very alien to Americans, North Americans and those in the West, right? We live in our house, we get in our car, we drive to our work, our factory or cubicle, and then we drive home.

[27:39] That's not the story in China and China you come from outside in the rural areas and then you live at your factory.

[27:46] And then if you ever get a vacation, you sometimes go back to the rural parts of China.

[27:52] Now here's another cool thing. Did you know home pin is metric?

[27:57] That would make sense. Right, because metric makes a hell of a lot more sense than the imperial measurement system.

[28:03] What is Australia? Is Australia metric?

[28:05] Australia is metric, but they're like Canada where we still for some reason use a lot of the imperial system.

[28:12] When it comes to like measuring and building houses, it's really annoying or wait. Super annoying. We have a mixture in Canada is very annoying.

[28:20] So I installed some wine racks in my basement the other day. And do you have any idea how frickin hard it was to use imperial system of like seven and three eights and seven and nine eights and seven and a quarter and oh my god.

[28:37] It's great, isn't it? That's what I'm used to.

[28:39] You know what's so easy, the metric system. It's just one to a hundred.

[28:46] Well, Mike says people ask, why is your stuff metric? Well, that's pretty simple because 99% of the world is metric. Get with the program.

[28:55] It's time that people woke up to themselves and realized that nine hundred and sixty fourths of something is pretty stupid measurement.

[29:02] We asked the Chinese about making something in seven sixteenths and they said, yes, we can do that, but it's double the price.

[29:09] Metrics pretty great. I mean, I believe is it metric used to send people to the moon and stuff, even in the US? I believe all that was metric. If it needs to be one hundred percent accurate and sciencey and stuff. Yeah, it's going to be metric. It's just just 11 centimeters.

[29:24] It's 10 centimeters.

[29:26] What's the centimeter? It's so weird.

[29:28] It's a meter. A meter. One meter. My socket set does have imperial and metric. So you'd be happy. You'd be okay with it.

[29:38] But you know, a typical American, they'll be like, what's three eighths? This isn't working. Oh, god, is this metric?

[29:45] And they got to go for the metric size like a stupid. That's the typical reaction. Here's the other thing. Okay.

[29:52] If you're going to China and you want to manufacture something manufacturing 200 of anything is a joke. That's not a lot.

[30:00] You want to manufacture 200,000 or two million like 200 of something is a joke. So that's really kind of a weird thing that happens in China.

[30:14] So we spend it all this time. We spool it up. This kind of makeshift factory. Now everybody when they pack picture a factory in Asia or a factory in Europe or in the North America, they picture this huge facility materials in parking lot, you know, all that stuff in reality.

[30:37] I don't picture materials in a parking lot. I picture them in a such a big parking lot.

[30:43] Oh, yeah. Building looks like one of those Amazon buildings and you go inside and there's some offices. I got one of those like right next to me.

[30:51] Yeah, like you just that's kind of what you expect. But in Asia, a manufacturing facility might just be like a small garage or a medium or large size garage that is then now a manufacturing plant for something.

[31:07] Not everything is Foxcon building iPhones, you know, especially when you're only building 200 of something. So Mike, of course, is picking away. He's got it kind of built up and he's got this small little factory with a few workers and some apartments.

[31:23] And just before he was about to launch Thunderbirds, Mike's wife passes away, which causes a lot of issues with his corporation and his life.

[31:35] Yeah, Mike says that brought with it a problem that I had no money and I had a factory with 10 plus staff in China with monthly bills and pretty much no income apart from some board sales.

[31:47] Certainly not enough to support the factory. I was very fortunate for an overseas customer. When I told them my plight, they came in and said, look, we'll give you an advance order for these parts for the next three months. And here's a big chunk of money.

[31:59] Ah, yes. Now that we've escaped the pinball network, we're truly independent. And now we can get the sponsors that we choose.

[32:11] Like Zach and Nicole Mitty at Flip and Out Pinball.

[32:29] That's when I buy, buy, buy, buy from Flip and Out. I'm on.

[32:35] Wow, that's a big deal. Having somebody pass away, especially somebody so close and somebody who's got a job and, you know, and all that stuff supporting you and building you through this, that's pretty difficult.

[32:49] So Thunderbirds ended up being stalled for like basically a year or two.

[32:55] 18 to 24 months. Yeah. And it had been four years since Home Pin had sort of began this project of, you know, setting up these corporations and getting stuff shipped to Hong Kong and then into China and setting all that stuff up.

[33:13] But that delay letway and the building project continued again. But that's when more tragedy struck Mike from Home Pin.

[33:23] One of the factory workers didn't show up for work on Monday. And it turned out the worker was in Mike's apartment, which was next to the factory and that they had passed away in that apartment.

[33:37] This was a massive problem because the apartment that he died in was not one of the workers apartments, but was actually Mike's apartment.

[33:47] And that caused a lot of legal issues and costs. Well, Mike says the cops came because the guys wife complained that I'd work this guy to death.

[33:57] They took three of my keys, staff away, my English speaking secretary to my engineers to the police station and grilled them for a couple hours.

[34:05] They came back at lunchtime and they said they were asked if I was an ogre foreign boss and did I work them on reasonable hours. And they said, no, no, he's the best boss we've ever had.

[34:15] Then they dismissed that line of inquiry. Could you imagine how terrifying that would be? You know what I mean? Like the more terrifying if I was in China when that happened.

[34:25] It's always I'm not there. They can't arrest me. Being in another country and knowing and you know, not knowing sort of their rules and social norms and things like that is really weird.

[34:35] So then all of a sudden there's like a death and then you're blamed for that death. That's got to be just sheer terror.

[34:43] But it eventually got worked out because he wasn't an ogre foreign boss and he wasn't working his staff in unreasonable amount of time.

[34:52] Worker might have had a heart attack for all you know, right? Like it's, you know, that's how it goes.

[34:58] But we finally got to the launch of home pin. This is exciting stuff. There's a new pinball machine manufacturer sure it's 2017.

[35:08] And it's been five or six years, but we're finally there, right? Yeah, Mike says I got to admit initially I was a bit worried because we've just released it to the market and I didn't quite know what to expect to be honest.

[35:21] And that game would be Thunderbirds.

[35:26] Now Thunderbirds is the creepy sci-fi Marionette theme. Wait a minute. Did you put creepy in there? No, no, it's the creepy sci-fi.

[35:34] It officially launched of January of 2018. We don't know how many units were produced. We don't know who designed the machine, but it was probably Mike.

[35:46] Now there's mechanics by an individual called Eddie Wang. And this is his only credited game.

[35:53] The dots on the dot matrix display were done by Glenn Lewis, Alexander Chu, and Roger Bergen, who was only credited to this game.

[36:06] The art for this was Federico Barbato, Grant Higgins, and of course that were their only credited games. Music and sound by Eddie Wang and software by Eddie Wang.

[36:20] Your favorite software designer, is that correct?

[36:24] Oh, sure. Thunderbirds is a theme.

[36:27] Yep. Before we get into this code, the manufacturing, the building field, let's just talk about the theme. We said IP absolutely critical.

[36:39] Yep, Thunderbirds is a British science fiction television series created by Jerry and Sylvia Anderson.

[36:45] Now you are a huge Thunderbirds fan. Well, okay. I'm a mystery science theater fan. In any early seasons, they had two mole people and their names were Jerry and Sylvia. And they were named after Jerry and Sylvia Anderson.

[37:02] And yes, it's called super marionation. Super marionation. That was like literally a thing. So what did they call the thing with?

[37:13] What did they call the thing on funhouse with Rudy? What was he? Oh, creepy.

[37:20] Did you just put creepy in that name? No, it was like they had a certain name.

[37:25] Yes, they had a name. I can't remember what it is.

[37:28] You know, but the super marionation thing. I still like because that's what was used. That's what Team America World Police is.

[37:38] Yeah, so it was filmed between 1964 and 1966 and it used like electronic marionettes. So it wasn't quite as like that old school marionette.

[37:48] Like their faces were different. They kind of are. They're marionettes. Yeah, but they weren't like the old school ones.

[37:54] Like before the 1960s where like you had to physically move the mouth like with a string. Like these had like electronics in the faces and stuff.

[38:06] Well, Thunderbirds falls the exploits of the Tracy family headed by American industrial instant X astronaut Jeff Tracy.

[38:13] Jeff is a widower with five adult sons Scott John Virgil Gordon and Alan.

[38:19] The Tracy's makeup international rescue a secret organization founded to save human life. They're aided in this mission by technologically advanced land, sea air and space vehicles that are called in a service when conventional rescue methods

[38:34] prove ineffective. Yeah, okay. So what do you think of Thunderbirds as a theme for Australia that was that was a hit. I mean, it was very popular in Australia and not it was not big in the US.

[38:49] No, did you guys have these marionette shows? No, the earliest marionette show I remember.

[38:57] And if someone wants to look this up, it's it's hilarious. There was in the 90s, there was it was on MTV. It was called the super adventure team.

[39:08] Okay, it only has like five or six episodes, but it was similar. It had a team fighting crime. And it was a comedy and it was hilarious.

[39:19] And I absolutely love there were episodes were like terrorists have kidnapped the Queen of England. And so it's sort of like a spoof of Thunderbirds and their demands are they demand to see kiss.

[39:31] They want to see the ban kiss and stuff like that. And because they were MTV, they could actually use all kisses music. So that's in the episode. Yeah, that's that's all I really play star remember seeing this marionette style in this country.

[39:48] I'm sure someone on cable had old Thunderbirds episodes, but yeah, it was not a thing now outside of sort of the the dominions of which the UK existed.

[39:58] The show was very big in Australia. So as far as it was big in Australia, it was very big in England. In fact, a friend of the show Mark silk voiced the new version of Thunderbirds are go, which was on the BBC.

[40:15] It was it's it's a big cultural thing there and it was fairly large in Canada. In fact, when I was a kid in the early 90s, there were a lot of reruns of Thunderbirds. And I watched it. And I think Thunderbirds is a friggin awesome thing. And do you want to hear something very embarrassing?

[40:33] Sure, if it's about you, it's not that embarrassing, but it's embarrassing nonetheless to it. Okay. So I kind of came into the hobby in around the summer of 2018.

[40:44] And then by the fall of 2018, like there was like the launch of Deadpool and like Batman 66 was finally getting revamped. And I think Beatles was on the horizon and there was Guardians of the Galaxy.

[41:00] So there's a lot of stuff going on. I'm like, wow, I would love to buy a pinball machine. And I'm looking for a theme that resonates for me. Somebody knew coming into the hobby is looking for a theme that resonates with them.

[41:14] They're not looking for an original theme. I get looking around and I found Thunderbirds. And I'm like, that's an awesome theme. I love Thunderbirds.

[41:25] And then I'm looking at this thing and I'm seeing the flyer for Thunderbirds. Okay. Let's take a look at that.

[41:32] Yeah, we need to take a look at the flyers. And I look at this flyer and I'm like, the art is awesome.

[41:38] It's a Jerry Anderson production. Thunderbirds.

[41:42] It's not a very good front page of the flyer. It has the art of the cabinet. It's got Thunderbirds. It's got like lightning in the sky, but it's got a picture of the cabinet.

[41:53] It's got a picture of the cabinet with the play field grade out in a way you would do if you were like didn't want to unveil it yet or didn't actually it wasn't done yet.

[42:03] It was like what you're sending to the licensor to get their approval. Yeah, yeah.

[42:07] So immediately I'm like, oh, that's weird, but the art is really cool. I'm super excited to see that. So then I look at the back of the flyer. And what do I see here?

[42:17] You see all the action of the international rescue team in their vehicles. You see eye catching graphics.

[42:23] Each machine is individually numbered with a certificate of authentication. Real mechanical pinball action.

[42:30] Single level play field with ramps and subways. So it's just got like a list. Yeah, it's got like a list of stuff.

[42:38] It doesn't show the game floor, saver feet, programmable electronic coin mechanism.

[42:45] Oh, I mean, I thought the floor saver feet were going to be something like feet that adjust or something, but it's like it's just like a list of stuff.

[42:53] It doesn't actually have a picture of the pinball machine. Oh, that was on the front. It doesn't. Yeah, but no play field.

[42:58] So that's the first that's kind of my first like little experience of it is like, oh, well, that's an awesome theme.

[43:04] So then I got to go searching and I eventually did find the photos of the play field and stuff like that.

[43:11] And what really excited me here were a couple of things. So I'm looking at like a deadpool, which I kind of liked.

[43:19] And I'm looking at guardians of the galaxy stuff and they got all these flat plastics and all that stuff.

[43:25] But Thunderbirds has these molded toys. So each character, a John and Virgil and all those guys, they all had a ship.

[43:35] Right. They had a ship or a boat or a rocket or a submarine or a some kind of something.

[43:42] And all of those are on the play field in a 3D molded kind of way. And I'm thinking that's cool.

[43:50] This company has gone the extra step and I was like, and it's got, but then I investigated a little further.

[43:58] And I think I might have dodged a bullet. What do you think?

[44:02] I mean, I played it. So, so like, was before we get into that, it's got all the things you want.

[44:11] It's got molded interactive toys. It has a layout, which looks fine. It's got hand drawn art, which is really good.

[44:21] How did the launch go? However, there was a lot.

[44:26] So, flipper issues, not making the ramps, ramps cracking. Let's see, flipper buttons are sharp. I don't think I had that issue.

[44:37] I did have the issue of not able to make the ramp. I did have that issue.

[44:40] So that was pretty common was that the original plastic ramp was too steep or something or the flippers weren't strong enough.

[44:48] Then there was problems with the ramps that were plastic at the mounting points were cracking.

[44:54] So then they sent out new metal ramps for everybody on those launch games. And I'm a, you know, couple months into the hobby.

[45:00] And of course, I'm the kind of guy that does not part with a dollar very easily. I will part with a dollar.

[45:06] And I will pay you a dollar and a half if I have to. As long as I feel like I'm getting something of value.

[45:14] And I quickly learned, oh, this, the theme speaks to me. It looks like they've done a lot of the things right.

[45:20] But kind of the bits, it's like the crux of it. Just they haven't quite hit it correctly.

[45:26] My major issues were the ramp. And the fact that you have to spell international rescue by hitting the ramp.

[45:34] So you need, you need to every time you hit the ramp, you get a letter in international rescue.

[45:40] Right, which seems pretty right. It seems kind of a thing. Like usually you collect letters or you collect teammates or something.

[45:46] International rescue is how many letters you have to hit the ramp that many times. It's, it's quite insane.

[45:54] And the other thing on the one, at least the one I played, you lock a ball. And then you do something to get the multi ball.

[46:02] But if you lock the ball, the first ball and you drain out of the second ball, it just releases the first ball back.

[46:08] It's like almost like a ball saver. And it just did that over and over. Like I was playing forever.

[46:14] So, so that was like a bug in the code.

[46:18] So most of my issues are more code related. And the fact that then that ramp. That's what I remember most of it.

[46:26] So here's me, right. Fresh into the hobby. I don't know. Good from bad. I've, I've, so I'm thinking, okay, maybe I can afford a pinball machine.

[46:36] I can't afford, you know, like $11,000 Canadian, right? Maybe I can afford like eight, you know, shipping and taxes and all that in.

[46:46] I should have got Deadpool, Deadpool pro. He's Canadian. I certainly missed, missed out on that one. Yeah. That's a, that's that will forever.

[46:54] A bum me out that I didn't go with that. But the thing is I didn't buy anything. So I bought like a, I found a tag team and somebody's like basement and spent the summer frigging around or the end of the summer.

[47:07] frigging around with like soldering and how do you fix things and all that. So I was learning a lot of the important skills that you need to learn as I was kind of watching the market as a person who works in financial markets.

[47:20] I study markets and I don't enter markets unless I fully understand the pros and cons and value and blah blah blah blah. Right. So I'm watching and I'm thinking.

[47:32] I would be the perfect demographic for somebody who's looking for a cheap pinball machine that's straightforward and looks like it has more value in the toys and molds and sculpts than the big manufacturer.

[47:47] As I'm reading through a lot of the feedback of this pinball machine and some of the issues here and there I realize maybe that pinball machine is not for me.

[47:58] In fact, the pin side top 100 list Thunderbirds is ranked 299. It's pin side though. I don't pay it much mine. Well, now it's two as of today. It's 313. It's two behind bugs, bunnies birthday ball and 3010 Raven got leaves Raven is 310. Come on Ravens not that bad.

[48:26] Her thunderbirds is worse in hercules. It says. Is this machine being review bombed? Are you aware of this term?

[48:35] Review bomb that people just pile on for the fun of it. Oh, yes. Yes. And yes, that happens with everything movies. Do you think this is the worst pinball machine ever made? No. Well, what is my think of all of the negativity? I'll tell you what he thinks. Mike says. I think there's a lot of negativity from people who want their food.

[48:55] They want to jump on the bandwagon. Oh, yeah, get the pitch forks out. There's suddenly experts that can comment whether favorably or negatively, but obviously majority negatively. I quickly learned to dismiss 95% of what was said. I would only listen to people who said yes. I have actually played the machine. It came home to me quite clearly when one supposed expert commented they played one ball and walked away with it sitting there. Some people say the worst thing is that the person who is playing the ball is not the best.

[49:24] I'll say the worst call out in pinball history. No. Is player two. You're up now on Thunderbirds. Is it quite that bad? No. No. So he's kind of right that people are kind of jumping on. Be a negative and crap. I'll give him the last statement. When people said like I played one ball and like walked away like really? That's that's it. You play one ball.

[49:48] But there's also a lot of feedback that he's also getting that is accurate that there are various problems with it. But I think he's also dismissing that. Is that true? Is it true that maybe both of them are too far apart that they can't see each other?

[50:06] I think if you listen to episode 16 of the Aussie pinball podcast and hear the way Mike says these things that will give you your answer.

[50:15] Basically he's saying all feedback is BS even though there is a lot of truth to what some people are saying. Some people are overly harsh and ridiculous because they think it's funny. That is true.

[50:27] So you mentioned the code you struggled with the code. What are Mike's what's Mike's reply to the code? Well, let's see Mike says I approach pinball more from a technicians or technical side rather than a player side.

[50:43] I'm not a pinball player. I love playing pinball. I love bashing the ball around and having fun. But the thing I dislike the most is a competition. I cannot stand the competition with 10 people or fighting one another.

[50:55] They're designed for you and I to bang the ball around. Have a bit of fun. Have a couple of beers and a laugh. Oh, I beat you. I got 10 points more than you. Whoop to do. That's just not my bag.

[51:06] Okay. So who are the people that have the biggest issue with the code?

[51:12] I mean, do you want me to say tournament players? Because I don't know if it's just tournament players. If I'm playing a game where I like a ball and then I drain out and it just gives me the ball back.

[51:25] Like, okay. After a while, I'm like, man, this is kind of super easy. I could play this forever. I don't think you need to be a tournament player to get that reaction, but I could be wrong there.

[52:49] Mike is basically saying that the tournament competition folks are all being mean and crap on this game because they want Keith L. Wynn or they want this level of competition and back and forth and fighting each other.

[53:07] But what Mike is really designing it for is just to flip around, shoot the ramps and have a beer.

[53:14] Yeah, his games are not for pinball players, as he said, which is a bit ridiculous.

[53:21] That is weird. That is a weird statement to make.

[53:23] He's making a pinball machine for somebody who goes into a billiards purchasing place and they've got thunderbirds and they go, yeah, I got a grandle just buy one of those.

[53:35] And then they take it home and flip around. I believe he said something like it's people just want to, you know, have a man cave.

[53:41] They just have pinball machine there. You go over there, play a couple of games and you know, that's it.

[53:45] Right, which is, which is totally understandable. I totally get that.

[53:49] However, that is a very, very small market. Pinball is a small market to begin with.

[53:55] But if you're just looking for a random person to walk into like your store and buy one of these things, that's even smaller.

[54:02] So instead of 2,000 pinball machines, maybe we're talking about 100.

[54:07] I will agree with him though. It got ridiculous after point where it was just like, you know, it's just cool to crap on this game.

[54:13] You know, even if you've never played it, I mean, I can say I've actually I've played several games of it.

[54:19] So and yes, the ramp was really hard and it seemed ridiculous that I had to spell international rescue by hitting it that many times.

[54:30] Like back in the back in the 80s or the late 70s, right?

[54:34] You would just like you'd collect lanes one through four and you shoot the thing and that was fine and you had a beer.

[54:41] But pinball has moved on from that. Even the even when you play a ballie Williams nowadays and you're like, oh, I got to, you know, shoot all these things and things.

[54:50] Like that code in a 90s ballie seemed like it was further ahead than this, right?

[54:56] I'm just trying to think of the game where a game other than or you have to spell something that that's that long.

[55:05] Even an Iron Man, you have to spell Monger, you know, six letters.

[55:10] But this is international rescue.

[55:13] I think he even stated that that was like a last second thing because they had the insert they had.

[55:20] I think it's on the back panel where it said and they had nothing.

[55:23] It wasn't anything for it to do.

[55:25] So they decided last second like that's what they're going to program and okay, you hit the ramp and spell out international rescue.

[55:32] Yeah. So this is the first pinball machine, the first kick at the can,

[55:37] spooling up a whole thing inside of China in mainland China, which is a whole issue.

[55:43] It's difficult. You know, Mike's wife dies.

[55:47] He's, you know, investigated for like working his employee to death.

[55:53] Like stuff has not been easy, but they got their first pinball machine done.

[55:57] Is it perfect? No. It's a cool theme.

[56:00] It's got the sculpts and stuff. The code lacked.

[56:04] You know, some people said that the plastic on the buttons,

[56:09] the flipper buttons was sharp around the edges because they didn't just use those,

[56:13] those what is it? Happ so flipper buttons.

[56:17] They'll have they literally met, they literally manufactured their own buttons.

[56:23] Right? We're stern just buys the same buttons that everybody buys for arcade machines since the beginning of time.

[56:29] I get it. So you get some things you learn from it and you move on.

[56:34] Even more issues appear for Mike and home pin in Xinjiang China,

[56:41] which is one of the major manufacturing hubs.

[56:44] So what started to happen there? Well, a year to 18 months later, things changed drastically.

[56:48] Suddenly factories weren't wanted.

[56:51] The Chinese leadership wanted more IT business and less manufacturing.

[56:56] Home pin were getting two to three inspections every week by a different government department,

[57:01] fire department one week, electrical the next week.

[57:04] It was someone else the week after they had to open a second facility out of Xinjiang

[57:09] to make the play fields and cabinets, the dirty work, and assemble them in the original factory.

[57:14] So Xinjiang doesn't want these small annoying building 200 or something factories.

[57:21] They want these big IT facilities.

[57:25] So now you got a second factory outside of Xinjiang that's doing all of the work.

[57:30] They're doing all of the cabinets and spraying the chemicals in the clear code and the whatever.

[57:36] And then it's being shipped to the original factory to being built together.

[57:39] It started to become a big mess.

[57:41] And Mike says the government changed a lot.

[57:44] Under the new regime, things have changed very drastically.

[57:47] And anyone that goes to China regularly or does business, they will tell you the same thing.

[57:52] That is just not what it used to be.

[57:54] It was obviously becoming more and more authoritarian and we needed to get out of it.

[57:59] The whole business model of Home Pin was built a factory on mainland China,

[58:04] make a pinball machine, dirt cheap, sell it in the States to a guy who wants to flip around

[58:09] and have a beer and a laugh with his friends.

[58:12] So here's the thing.

[58:14] I wanted to find more information.

[58:17] I wanted to see kind of more beyond this podcast.

[58:22] Well, I mean the Home Pin website has not been updated since 2017.

[58:28] Or at least the copyright at the bottom of the page has been open.

[58:31] Has it been updated since 2017?

[58:33] Oh, really? It doesn't have their newer games there?

[58:36] No. So a lot of that stuff is back and forth.

[58:42] But it's all being managed through their Facebook page.

[58:46] So you can go to their Facebook page and it has all their new up-to-date stuff.

[58:50] So it's...

[58:52] And it still says on that web page that Mike has established

[58:56] and personally manages a fully functional factory from scratch in Xinjiang, China,

[59:03] designed to produce high quality pinball and arcade machines.

[59:07] During this time, Mike has gained essential experience identifying and dealing with a multitude

[59:13] of Chinese suppliers to ensure reliable quality components are available.

[59:18] That's interesting that that hasn't been updated.

[59:21] So it says that on the official website.

[59:24] Not in China anymore.

[59:26] So he leaves and I'm going to put this in air quotes, China.

[59:29] Right? So I mentioned before there's China, then there's Hong Kong,

[59:33] which is like a semi-estonymous state, and then there's Taiwan.

[59:38] But there's a whole thing about China, mainland and Taiwan.

[59:44] Well, Mike, he wasn't really able to identify or deal with a multitude of Chinese suppliers

[59:51] and provide reliable components on mainland China.

[59:54] So that's when in about 2019, he decided to move his entire factory from mainland China to Taiwan.

[01:00:03] Seems like a pretty good deal, huh?

[01:00:05] Well, as it works out, when he's made two more games, so it worked out.

[01:00:10] So China doesn't want him there on the mainland anymore.

[01:00:12] He's not making enough. He doesn't have IT services.

[01:00:14] It's not a big thing. It's a big pain in the ass.

[01:00:16] But they get a sweet deal to help out a company that is near and dear to my heart, Porsche.

[01:00:23] Ah, we said it right too.

[01:00:25] Now they had a special set of one-off machines ordered,

[01:00:32] and they had the manufactured by HomePin.

[01:00:35] Now five of these machines apparently exist, and they were for promotional reasons.

[01:00:41] I don't know if there's one at the Asia-Porsche head office, or there's one in...

[01:00:47] Yeah, I've never seen any of these.

[01:00:50] But Mike has mentioned these a couple of times on a few podcasts where he made the Porsche machines,

[01:00:55] and it's a big sort of badge of honor.

[01:00:57] You weren't able to order them.

[01:00:59] There was no inquiries. He's not allowed to build anymore,

[01:01:02] but apparently he built five of them for Porsche.

[01:01:05] This is when I heard rumblings that after Joe Balser had left American pinball,

[01:01:10] he had a breach brief chat and a stint employed with HomePin.

[01:01:16] And it, yeah.

[01:01:17] It was for a cup of coffee. He wasn't long.

[01:01:19] He was there, I think probably for about a week and a half.

[01:01:22] Joe Balser, a little difficult to deal with, didn't get along with Mike, and then he left.

[01:01:28] Well, do we know that?

[01:01:30] Well, he worked like, apparently he worked remotely from somewhere in the States,

[01:01:34] and he was there for like two weeks.

[01:01:36] But this is when the awesomeness of the next theme comes.

[01:01:42] So he knows, Mike knows, you need IP.

[01:01:45] And the IP that he went with is he went with a cult classic movie.

[01:01:50] And that spoof movie theme was this is Spinal Tap.

[01:01:55] Have you seen Spinal Tap?

[01:01:57] He wanted to turn up to 11.

[01:01:58] Yeah, I was waiting for that.

[01:02:00] He rated it the gate.

[01:02:02] And no, I have not seen Spinal Tap.

[01:02:04] I have not seen Spinal Tap either.

[01:02:06] I've seen lots of scenes from it where I feel like I've seen it.

[01:02:10] But I haven't actually seen it.

[01:02:12] Well, let's start with the theme.

[01:02:14] So this is a film that was made in 1984, and it is an American mockumentary comedy.

[01:02:20] It is done by the filmmaker Marty D. Berge, and is filmed in a documentary style,

[01:02:31] which is directed by Rob Reiner in his debut of directing.

[01:02:37] So this is before like the office and before the trailer park boys and before community,

[01:02:43] before that sort of mockumentary style thing was cool and popular.

[01:02:47] Yeah, to the point where people thought it was a real band when they saw the movie.

[01:02:50] Yeah, yeah.

[01:02:51] The film is about an English rock band called Spinal Tap.

[01:02:56] And they're 1982 United States concert tour, which was to promote their new album, Smell the Glove.

[01:03:05] This is Spinal Tap is to be creatively launching the entire mockumentary genre of film making.

[01:03:16] This film did not go over huge, but it is a massive cult following.

[01:03:24] Now, the thing with small boutique manufacturers like Spooky or in this case, Homepin,

[01:03:32] the best thing to do is to go with a cult following thing because you can probably sell more to that community.

[01:03:40] Well, it had a $2 million budget this film, and it made $4.7 million in the box office.

[01:03:46] Now, the film has been caught up for years and years and years in various copyright and legal issues

[01:03:55] with lawsuits left and right from filmmakers, directors to the company that actually made it.

[01:04:02] It was a huge thing.

[01:04:03] However, in 2020, the rights were returned to the cast and they're making a new one, which is coming out this year.

[01:04:11] That is why you're seeing more and more of Spinal Tap stuff since 2020.

[01:04:18] You've seen a re-release of the thing on 4K.

[01:04:22] You've seen more merchandise.

[01:04:25] That's because now the cast is involved in that.

[01:04:29] There's a sequel, Rob Reiner, who is currently working on that sequel, which is supposed to launch in 2025.

[01:04:37] This is Spinal Tap is a dream theme for a lot of people in Pinball.

[01:04:44] That's true.

[01:04:45] Not me.

[01:04:47] You know what's interesting? I just thought of this.

[01:04:49] That means Rob Reiner has two Pinball machines now.

[01:04:52] Yeah, what's his other one?

[01:04:53] Princess Bride.

[01:04:54] Oh, yeah!

[01:04:55] Yeah!

[01:04:57] A directed Princess Bride.

[01:04:59] So what does Mike say about landing this license?

[01:05:01] He says they settled and the boys got their license.

[01:05:05] They're IP back.

[01:05:06] I was just Johnny on the spot at the right time because they'd only just got their license back.

[01:05:12] I was on the doorstep looking to license it.

[01:05:15] Their agent was a Kiwi lady, Livin' in London, and she and I had a Zoom call and got on very well.

[01:05:21] I explained to her what we did and what we wished to do, and she was very pleased about that.

[01:05:26] He was the first person at the door knocking on it, willing to offer them a check for their IP.

[01:05:31] Yep.

[01:05:32] That is how this is spinal tap ended up at home pin and not stern.

[01:05:39] Or whoever.

[01:05:40] Or spooky because they were the first at the door.

[01:05:43] Well, good, good on them.

[01:05:45] And a Kiwi was involved, so he had an in there.

[01:05:48] So a Kiwi is somebody not from Australia.

[01:05:51] They're from that other one.

[01:05:55] New Zealand.

[01:05:56] New Zealand.

[01:05:57] It's the same thing.

[01:05:58] They probably hate that.

[01:06:00] It's like, no, it's not.

[01:06:02] That's like my line.

[01:06:03] I'm the guy that makes that line.

[01:06:05] Now you've gone and offended an entire nation.

[01:06:07] Yep, the entire nation.

[01:06:09] Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[01:06:10] Send your hate mail.

[01:06:11] Here of Ron Hallett.

[01:06:13] Uh-huh.

[01:06:14] Did Mike learn anything from Thunderbirds?

[01:06:16] Like they had some issues.

[01:06:17] They had some coding problems.

[01:06:18] They had some manufacturing issues.

[01:06:20] So you take that and you learn, don't you?

[01:06:23] Well, he didn't want an LCD in there.

[01:06:25] Yeah, they wanted to go dot matrix.

[01:06:27] Right.

[01:06:28] He wanted a dot matrix just like the old machines.

[01:06:30] But he relented because they figured they had to show clips from the movie.

[01:06:33] Yeah.

[01:06:34] People, people sort of kind of demanded at this point LCD screens in their pinball machines.

[01:06:39] And that's what the LCD does.

[01:06:41] It shows clips from the movie and that's it.

[01:06:43] It's got a dot matrix display that does all the rest of it.

[01:06:46] So a dot matrix display on the bottom has the actual like scores and what to do and what to shoot for.

[01:06:51] And the LCD screen above it just literally plays clips of the film.

[01:06:55] Yeah.

[01:06:56] Did the manufacturing change a whole lot?

[01:06:58] Well, not so much.

[01:07:00] Did the pricing remain the same?

[01:07:03] No.

[01:07:04] So the $4,000 for US, $4,000 US for Thunderbird.

[01:07:08] Swinnelltap is $9,600 US.

[01:07:11] Yeah, which might be higher now because of the whole...

[01:07:14] Good enough stuff.

[01:07:15] ...terrified stuff.

[01:07:16] Mike more or less kind of doubled down, I would say.

[01:07:19] I think he dismissed a lot of the feedback because a lot of it...

[01:07:24] A lot of it was crappin' on it, which was not cool.

[01:07:28] He says, I spent an unbelievable amount of money and time on experts in inverted commas trying to get USB to work.

[01:07:35] None of them at the end of the day could make it work, not satisfactory anyway.

[01:07:39] That's to try to have USB updates for the code.

[01:07:42] Right, so we tried to get code updates.

[01:07:44] So once it left the factory, it was like done.

[01:07:47] Right? Like there was no...

[01:07:48] Like it's stern you plug into USB on those SAM systems that it updates the system.

[01:07:52] Now it updates over Wi-Fi or you get a...

[01:07:56] Well, I believe you could update them, but it's a chip replacement.

[01:08:00] You have to get a...

[01:08:01] Yeah, just like old-school games.

[01:08:03] So let's talk about this.

[01:08:05] You have played this as Spinal Tap?

[01:08:07] Yes.

[01:08:08] Have you played that?

[01:08:09] Yes, I have.

[01:08:10] I have not seen one of these.

[01:08:12] I kind of wanted to because again, what happened...

[01:08:16] The one I played was like the upper model.

[01:08:18] Like it had the skull-topper thing.

[01:08:21] So what happened when this game launched?

[01:08:23] Immediately, people started just crapping all over it.

[01:08:27] Crapping all over it.

[01:08:29] Every time HomePin gets a license, they're like, oh no.

[01:08:32] No, we don't want them to get the license, etc.

[01:08:35] And it took a while because they made the initial one.

[01:08:38] And then they think they added a flipper after the initial design.

[01:08:41] There was some... There was some design changes.

[01:08:44] This is the COVID era.

[01:08:46] We've talked about this previously.

[01:08:48] COVID era was very difficult for pinball manufacturing in general.

[01:08:54] All right.

[01:08:55] So let's wind it back.

[01:08:57] They've moved factories to a different country.

[01:09:02] They've gone with a really awesome IP that people love.

[01:09:07] They've instituted an LCD and they're ready to go.

[01:09:13] And then immediately the community, the quote unquote pinball community,

[01:09:17] just craps all over it.

[01:09:20] But they only have the promotional photos, one prototype, and people already...

[01:09:27] Well, they brought it to show in Australia.

[01:09:30] So...

[01:09:31] So this is when it goes off the rails.

[01:09:33] Is when people played it.

[01:09:35] The art from Thunderbirds was awesome, in my opinion.

[01:09:40] How is the art on this is spinal tab?

[01:09:43] Not as awesome.

[01:09:45] Not as awesome.

[01:09:47] However, that is kind of part of the...

[01:09:51] What the lineage or the joke perhaps?

[01:09:56] But it is Photoshop terrible bad.

[01:10:00] Bad, bad, bad.

[01:10:03] How would you say that that is accurate?

[01:10:08] I would say it's definitely Photoshop, yes.

[01:10:11] You want to get me to say stuff so bad, don't you?

[01:10:16] Okay.

[01:10:17] So I'm the nice guy here.

[01:10:18] I'm trying to be completely objective.

[01:10:21] Do I think there are many games better than this one?

[01:10:23] Yes.

[01:10:24] Oh, the skull.

[01:10:25] Okay, wait a minute.

[01:10:26] The skull topper is actually standard according to the advertisement.

[01:10:28] Okay, so I wasn't looking at a special...

[01:10:31] A special...

[01:10:32] SpinalTapPinball.com.

[01:10:34] This is where we're at.

[01:10:35] The spinaltappinball.com, which I assume is the official website from HomePin.

[01:10:41] Let me see when the copyright of this page is 2025.

[01:10:45] Okay.

[01:10:46] It did have the promotional video.

[01:10:51] Do you remember this promotional video?

[01:10:53] I do remember this promotional video, yes I do.

[01:10:55] Do you remember how this promotional video went over?

[01:11:01] Not particularly well.

[01:11:04] What were the critiques that people had?

[01:11:07] I mean, they have...

[01:11:08] Well, I assume it's a Taiwanese model like playing the game and trying to be as sexy as possible as she's playing the game.

[01:11:16] And that's kind of the focus of the video.

[01:11:19] There's almost...

[01:11:20] There's not very much of the game itself and more of the model.

[01:11:27] Wait a minute.

[01:11:28] So the skull's mouth is supposed to open according to this.

[01:11:30] It never did that in the one I play.

[01:11:33] You know, the sculpts are awesome.

[01:11:36] The toy...

[01:11:37] Like the toy things on the...

[01:11:39] Right?

[01:11:40] Like all the things that you would imagine from China, like molded plastics and things like that, all look great.

[01:11:48] But this video...

[01:11:49] I remember when this video came out, people were like, what is going on here?

[01:11:55] But that's for you to determine yourself.

[01:11:58] She's getting quite excited playing the game.

[01:12:01] It did not go over well.

[01:12:04] This machine.

[01:12:05] And I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here.

[01:12:07] Okay, it's a COVID-Arab pin.

[01:12:09] Are there many of these out there?

[01:12:11] I only saw the one.

[01:12:13] I don't think I've seen one either.

[01:12:15] I don't think there's been one at Fantastic.

[01:12:17] No, it was at Fantastic.

[01:12:18] That's where I played it.

[01:12:19] Was it?

[01:12:20] Yep.

[01:12:21] Jeez, I don't know how I haven't seen it then.

[01:12:23] You weren't at the last Fantastic or you would have played it.

[01:12:27] Oh, that's right.

[01:12:29] I was elbows up here in Canada.

[01:12:32] I played that.

[01:12:33] I played the next game too that they made.

[01:12:36] Like I said, I think they added a third flipper.

[01:12:40] They made some design changes after the initial sample runs.

[01:12:45] I've hardly seen any of the spinal taps over here.

[01:12:50] The one at that show was the only one I've seen at Fantastic.

[01:12:53] I would love to know how many they sold.

[01:12:57] I really would.

[01:12:58] Are we talking 50, 100, 250?

[01:13:04] It would be interesting.

[01:13:05] It would be interesting.

[01:13:08] Anybody who had spinal tap was like their dream theme, just...

[01:13:11] Oh, rough.

[01:13:13] So now let's get into the machine of which is currently in production.

[01:13:18] Production, yes.

[01:13:19] And I would consider this...

[01:13:22] So you know a Capcom.

[01:13:25] You know when they did break shot.

[01:13:28] Yes.

[01:13:29] Kind of like their stripped down model, like single level, whatever you want to call it.

[01:13:33] So single level didn't have any ramps, didn't have any...

[01:13:36] That's what Home Pins next game feels like to me.

[01:13:39] Like this is their version of that.

[01:13:41] Do you think this machine is designed to save money or something?

[01:13:46] Well, they wanted to make it cheaper machine.

[01:13:47] I think they said that.

[01:13:49] Okay.

[01:13:50] Because it's...

[01:13:51] Look at the price on this.

[01:13:53] So this machine is Blues Brothers, the Blues Brothers.

[01:13:56] Yeah.

[01:13:57] The Blues Brothers based off of the actual Blues Brothers and not the movie.

[01:14:01] Yes.

[01:14:02] It's the movie poster and name of the Blues Brothers theme.

[01:14:07] It's not the movie.

[01:14:09] It's based on them.

[01:14:10] And I'll get into that in a minute.

[01:14:12] Are you on a mission?

[01:14:13] Quote unquote.

[01:14:14] A mission from God.

[01:14:16] Of course, it's which is a quote from the movie that they don't have rights to.

[01:14:19] So they're not allowed to say that.

[01:14:20] So they're sad to say, are you on a mission?

[01:14:22] And then it says create your own Blues Brothers story as you play this fantastic new release from Homepen.

[01:14:29] And then it says the world's first open source software machine.

[01:14:36] So open source software pinball machine.

[01:14:39] Yeah.

[01:14:40] What does open source software mean?

[01:14:43] Means that anyone can modify it.

[01:14:45] You can make this thing do anything you want.

[01:14:47] So if you don't like the fact that it doesn't have any actual Blues Brothers songs in it,

[01:14:51] you could put it in there.

[01:14:52] Or if you wanted to, you know what, if you wanted to be tournament rules,

[01:14:56] make your own tournament rules and don't b****n complain.

[01:15:00] The Blues Brothers themselves vary.

[01:15:03] That was huge.

[01:15:04] The films.

[01:15:05] Well, the film.

[01:15:07] This is not, this is nothing to do with Blues Brothers 2000.

[01:15:10] Thank God.

[01:15:11] This is designed by Mike, mechanics by Mike and the Homepen team.

[01:15:15] Neil Frazier does the graphics, whoever that is.

[01:15:18] And Dick Hamill does the original open source software code.

[01:15:22] Yeah.

[01:15:23] And he is known in the community.

[01:15:25] He did, I think the meteor redo.

[01:15:29] He's done a lot of redoes of older games.

[01:15:33] Yeah.

[01:15:34] He's taken kind of the older stirons or ballies or whatever and made new kind of different code.

[01:15:40] He was on an episode of the slam tilt podcast.

[01:15:42] He's done a lot of the early solid state games.

[01:15:45] Let's wind it back.

[01:15:46] So it's the license that isn't a license on the documentation and all the stuff.

[01:15:51] It says Blues Brothers trademark Jake Blues trademark and L word blues trademark.

[01:15:59] I'm sorry, L would blues trademark are registered trademarks owned by applied action research

[01:16:07] corp and Judith Belushi and are used by permission under license from Blues Brothers approved

[01:16:14] ventures LLC.

[01:16:15] That's a mouthful.

[01:16:17] Now that is different than the IP holders and the other people who own the Blues Brothers

[01:16:26] film, which is probably like ten of them.

[01:16:29] It would be a nightmare to try to get anything from that.

[01:16:32] Blues Brothers images are owned by one company, which what I assume would be Blues Brothers

[01:16:39] approved ventures, etc, etc, etc. and the film rights owned by the film people and whatever that is.

[01:16:47] So there's no film assets in the game.

[01:16:49] The only assets you get are pictures of the Blues Brothers themselves.

[01:16:53] So what does home pin say about this?

[01:16:57] It is very difficult to obtain full movie license.

[01:17:00] The problem is there are too many players all wanting a separate contract at a piece of the

[01:17:04] pie.

[01:17:05] With our new open source software, it is very, very easy to add your features for home use, of course.

[01:17:11] Ah, so what do we say in there?

[01:17:13] We're saying we're the default software will hardly have nothing in it as far as rights,

[01:17:20] but you can add all the stuff you want.

[01:17:22] Right, so you being the pinball people can create and download your own stuff

[01:17:30] and jam it in there anyway.

[01:17:32] And a lot of people do that anyway, right?

[01:17:33] Yeah, to start to stern dismay, yes, some people do that to their games.

[01:17:38] They go and they will add movie music or something from the James Bond films.

[01:17:44] Or they'll have a Jurassic Park and they actually put clips from the movie in.

[01:17:48] Yeah, which is like a huge no-no, right?

[01:17:51] Like, but they do it anyway.

[01:17:53] Um, did you, are you a Blues Brothers fan?

[01:17:56] You fan of the Blues Brothers?

[01:17:58] Oh, yeah.

[01:17:59] Oh, yeah.

[01:18:00] So the Blues Brothers, I didn't know this through my research.

[01:18:03] The Blues Brothers is the first film, the film, not the pinball machine, or what the pinball machine is named after.

[01:18:10] Yep.

[01:18:11] It is actually after an original SNL sketch by Dan Acroid and Jim Belushi.

[01:18:20] Someone incorrect.

[01:18:22] And it's John Belushi, not Jim Belushi.

[01:18:24] Sorry, John Belushi.

[01:18:25] Yeah, the dead one.

[01:18:26] That's a common misnomer.

[01:18:28] That one clip of them on Saturday Night Live is the introduction.

[01:18:31] That's not true.

[01:18:32] They were around before that.

[01:18:34] They actually debuted.

[01:18:35] They debuted like on that.

[01:18:36] I think it was the Steve Barton show, which I didn't know he had a show, but yeah.

[01:18:40] They debuted there.

[01:18:41] They were playing live and stuff for a while before their appearance on Saturday Night Live.

[01:18:46] But it's based off of the characters.

[01:18:49] Jake and Elwood Blues.

[01:18:52] That's why there are so many issues with the IP of this, right?

[01:19:00] Because they existed kind of before.

[01:19:03] Then they were on SNL.

[01:19:05] Then they had a film.

[01:19:07] Then they had the other film, which should probably remain nameless.

[01:19:10] They had a platinum album.

[01:19:12] Right.

[01:19:13] It was one of the biggest selling Blues albums.

[01:19:15] And that's the other thing.

[01:19:16] Most of the songs are all Blues covers.

[01:19:18] So...

[01:19:19] So the pinball machine itself, the art is awesome, in my opinion.

[01:19:23] The Playfield art is cool.

[01:19:25] The Playfield looks fun.

[01:19:28] What is that Playfield, by the way?

[01:19:31] I will disagree with the art summation.

[01:19:34] You don't like the art?

[01:19:35] No, you got to see it in person.

[01:19:38] Okay, because I think it looks cool.

[01:19:40] The Playfield is stars.

[01:19:42] Stars stars with some modifications, but basically stars.

[01:19:47] What are the modifications?

[01:19:48] What did they change?

[01:19:49] Just look at it.

[01:19:50] You can see what they changed.

[01:19:51] Is it the orbit on the right side?

[01:19:52] They added a ramp.

[01:19:53] It's supposed to simulate when they jump over the bridge.

[01:19:58] Yeah, in the movie that's not part of this.

[01:20:01] I wonder how they got away with that.

[01:20:03] Yeah, they added some targets, some stuff on the upper right side.

[01:20:06] But I mean, the base Playfield is stars.

[01:20:10] So stars is amazing.

[01:20:12] Yes.

[01:20:13] Stars is an amazing shooter.

[01:20:14] It's one of the greatest layouts of a single level.

[01:20:16] Yeah, they ripped off a good game.

[01:20:17] They ripped off a good game.

[01:20:19] Did it pay off?

[01:20:22] Let's just say this had several of the same issues that Spinal Tap had, where you drain out

[01:20:29] and it just kept giving me balls over and over.

[01:20:32] Like I literally could not end the game.

[01:20:34] Right, but you could just fix it yourself, Ron.

[01:20:36] It's got open source code.

[01:20:37] Okay, here's the problem.

[01:20:38] Why did it do the same exact thing on two different models?

[01:20:41] Two different games.

[01:20:42] It did the same thing.

[01:20:43] Right, but you can update the code yourself.

[01:20:45] You can fix the problem that's creating.

[01:20:47] It's doing that on Spinal Tap.

[01:20:48] You can't update the code on that.

[01:20:49] Well, that doesn't matter.

[01:20:50] We're not talking about Spinal Tap.

[01:20:51] That's like in socks.

[01:20:52] This is Blues Brothers.

[01:20:54] If it's feeding you balls when it shouldn't be, you just fix the code yourself.

[01:20:59] I will say.

[01:21:00] Just like Stern.

[01:21:02] It looks...

[01:21:05] It's tough to be diplomatic here.

[01:21:10] Basically, there were home brews in the home brew aisle that looked better than Blues Brothers.

[01:21:15] Oh, okay.

[01:21:16] Okay.

[01:21:17] Okay.

[01:21:18] So now, are you crappin' on this just like everybody else?

[01:21:21] I played at least five games of Spinal Tap.

[01:21:25] At least four or five games.

[01:21:27] Well, I tried to play four or five games of stars.

[01:21:29] But when the game's written in because it's endless,

[01:21:32] it was broke.

[01:21:34] Most of the show they had to keep fixing it to get it back up,

[01:21:38] which kind of concerns me.

[01:21:40] But, yeah, I mean...

[01:21:44] Even like the back box,

[01:21:47] some of the lighting was actually blocked by things in the back box.

[01:21:51] So you got like this...

[01:21:52] I can't explain.

[01:21:53] You'd have to see it in person.

[01:21:55] So like the boards in front of it were putting shadows...

[01:21:58] The topper that it has, the kind of topper that Blues Brothers has.

[01:22:02] It's just the guys with the little pulleys.

[01:22:07] And they just move their arms.

[01:22:09] It's...

[01:22:10] Yeah.

[01:22:11] It's just...

[01:22:12] No.

[01:22:13] And this one doesn't have a DMD.

[01:22:14] Like I said,

[01:22:15] well, my break shot analogy.

[01:22:16] This is their lower cost.

[01:22:18] It has alpha numeric displays.

[01:22:21] Mike has not necessarily learned from the feedback

[01:22:25] of which the community has provided.

[01:22:27] Some of that feedback being mean and not good,

[01:22:31] which should be ignored.

[01:22:33] Some of it being valid, which looks like it has been ignored

[01:22:36] because it's been lumped into the same...

[01:22:38] Is the other people...

[01:22:39] Would you say so?

[01:22:40] All I say is,

[01:22:41] if you can find one of these,

[01:22:42] play it and you can make your own opinion.

[01:22:45] Don't listen to me,

[01:22:47] but I can tell you my opinion.

[01:22:49] It's disappointing.

[01:22:51] How much does it cost?

[01:22:53] You wanted to keep...

[01:22:54] So we started out at what was it like 5,000...

[01:22:57] 4,000.

[01:22:58] And then we went up with spinal tap.

[01:23:00] Then he wanted to make a cheaper game,

[01:23:03] which is this is.

[01:23:05] Because you just want to have a game to bat around with your body.

[01:23:07] With your buddies...

[01:23:08] The brown with your buddies.

[01:23:09] You're non pinball player buddies

[01:23:11] just to play a couple balls of pinball.

[01:23:14] He's going to have to look at the exchange rate.

[01:23:16] So it's 7,000...

[01:23:18] $7,000...

[01:23:20] Aussie money.

[01:23:22] Well, $6,800.

[01:23:23] But yes.

[01:23:24] Okay, so $6,800 Aussie money.

[01:23:26] That's what it said in the end.

[01:23:28] Dollar-reduce.

[01:23:29] Dollar-reduce.

[01:23:30] And that's about $4400 US,

[01:23:32] let's say $4,500 US.

[01:23:34] Still more than Thundersburg's was.

[01:23:36] So let's add let's say $4400.

[01:23:39] That's cheaper than any Stern.

[01:23:41] That's cheaper than any...

[01:23:42] Yeah.

[01:23:43] So you got to add a tariff to that.

[01:23:45] You got to add 10% tariff.

[01:23:47] So now you're at like $5,000, $4800.

[01:23:49] It's still cheaper.

[01:23:51] It's still cheaper.

[01:23:52] Still cheaper.

[01:23:53] And you can do your own code.

[01:23:54] You can fix whatever problems are with it.

[01:23:56] Yes.

[01:23:57] Well, not physical problems, but yes.

[01:23:59] You can add all that music from the movie in there.

[01:24:01] You can put all the quotes in there.

[01:24:03] You can fix the ball saver.

[01:24:05] Now this is assuming you're a programmer

[01:24:07] and you're just going to go through and do all this.

[01:24:09] So this is the person who's randomly looking for a pinball machine

[01:24:13] to bat around with their buddies and have a beer,

[01:24:15] who enjoys pinball enough to spend $5,000,

[01:24:19] who is also a computer programmer,

[01:24:21] and able to program their own machine.

[01:24:23] Like we're getting pretty niche here, right?

[01:24:25] And there was other details about they were going to have a forum set up

[01:24:29] and you could, if you made modified versions,

[01:24:31] if they approved them, they'd be available for download

[01:24:34] and stuff like that.

[01:24:35] But I don't know how they could approve anything

[01:24:37] that had licensed music in it.

[01:24:39] I'm confused how all that was supposed to work,

[01:24:42] or how it is working.

[01:24:43] I don't know what's going on with that currently.

[01:24:45] It's a mess.

[01:24:47] It's a mess.

[01:24:48] It's no other way to say it.

[01:24:49] There's, if you had someone who knew what they were doing,

[01:24:52] they'd add all this stuff in that everyone wants,

[01:24:54] and then you could just get it in a somewhat nefarious way.

[01:24:58] Like go to my Dropbox and download it.

[01:25:00] Here you go.

[01:25:01] But somebody that knows what they're doing is willing to put all that time

[01:25:04] and effort into it, they're buying jaws.

[01:25:06] Yeah, they'd have to have this game, which is online.

[01:25:08] They're buying Godzilla.

[01:25:09] Yeah.

[01:25:10] They're, they're playing Keith L. Wins next game.

[01:25:13] They are buying Harry Potter, because they are a slightly overweight millennial

[01:25:17] that wants to pretend they're a wizard.

[01:25:19] That is what's happening.

[01:25:20] So this niche that he's wanting to find does not exist.

[01:25:24] And if it does, there's 15 people in an already small hobby.

[01:25:30] And gosh darn it, I want people to succeed.

[01:25:34] And Mike has the smarts.

[01:25:36] He's got the manufacturing knowledge.

[01:25:39] Good Lord.

[01:25:40] This makes me mad.

[01:25:41] I'm all hot.

[01:25:43] I'm all hot and bothered.

[01:25:44] Well, Mike's final word is, we're just going to make a fun machine.

[01:25:48] We're not going to be hung up on whether it has deep rules that are a 10.

[01:25:52] You got to hit it this target and stand on one leg and do this and do that.

[01:25:56] It's not what we do.

[01:25:58] People have to get through their heads that home pin doesn't do that.

[01:26:01] We leave that to the other people.

[01:26:03] If J.J.P., spooky, stern want to do that, knock yourself out.

[01:26:07] That's great.

[01:26:08] That's your market.

[01:26:09] That's your bag.

[01:26:10] Fantastic.

[01:26:11] They'll fill that niche.

[01:26:12] We're aiming for a totally different market.

[01:26:15] Which isn't the American market because he said he doesn't like Americans either.

[01:26:20] He said that before too.

[01:26:22] So maybe he likes Canadians though.

[01:26:24] Maybe he'll like you guys.

[01:26:26] But again, if you want to know what Mike thinks of all this and what Mike thinks of everything,

[01:26:37] the Aussie pinball podcast episode with Mike, it is amazing.

[01:26:41] It is one of the single greatest interviews I've ever heard in any podcast.

[01:26:47] I'm putting the plug out.

[01:26:48] You need to listen to this.

[01:26:50] It's all out there.

[01:26:52] Basically 90% of the quotes we just said are from there.

[01:26:54] So remember, this game is not for pinball people.

[01:26:57] He's actually said those words.

[01:27:00] If you're listening to this, you're not even in the market for it.

[01:27:04] It's just...

[01:27:08] I find it humorous that now people get upset if he gets the license for something they like.

[01:27:13] Because they know they're going to hate the game.

[01:27:15] I don't want a dog pile on home pin.

[01:27:19] But if you don't learn from your mistakes, how do we know their mistakes?

[01:27:23] He might have sold a bunch of these and we just don't know.

[01:27:26] We have no idea how many of these games he sold.

[01:27:29] If Mike has listened to this, send us an email with how many you've sent.

[01:27:32] How many you've sent out? How many you've sold?

[01:27:34] I'd love to let everybody know.

[01:27:35] Or if it's enough.

[01:27:37] Like, yeah, yeah, we're very happy with what we've done.

[01:27:40] Then he's all set.

[01:27:41] And it doesn't matter.

[01:27:42] But he's fine.

[01:27:43] If your goal is to sell 100 of these things and you've done that and you're living the dream,

[01:27:48] just say that.

[01:27:49] But not everybody needs to be stern.

[01:27:51] I get it.

[01:27:52] But good Lord, your ball saver should work before it leaves the factory.

[01:27:55] Three games in a row.

[01:27:57] It was just weird that I had the exact same kind of software issue with two games, two other games.

[01:28:04] Like the exact same one where it's just kind of...

[01:28:07] You're an endless ball saver and you can't drain.

[01:28:10] You have to tilt to finally drain out.

[01:28:12] That's the only way you can do it.

[01:28:14] And it was just a little bit more fun.

[01:28:16] And it was the same on both of them, which was so weird.

[01:28:21] All right.

[01:28:22] I'm done.

[01:28:23] Wow, you seem too upset over this.

[01:28:25] I'm done.

[01:28:26] Mike's is going to do what Mike's going to do.

[01:28:29] And we love him for it.

[01:28:31] And my friends, always you can send your comments, questions, corrections, and concerns.

[01:28:37] Or if you're Mike, you can tell us how many games you sold.

[01:28:40] Send it to superballcloniclesatgmail.com.

[01:28:43] I think somebody said I needed to retire Stewie.

[01:28:45] So I'm just doing my own voice here.

[01:28:47] Oh, okay.

[01:28:48] We look forward to all the messages that we read every one.

[01:28:51] I don't know.

[01:28:52] This is sound is good when I'm just saying it.

[01:28:53] What if it's hoagin'?

[01:28:54] Oh, god no.

[01:28:55] No wrestling going on.

[01:28:56] Turn on automatic downloads, brother.

[01:28:57] Don't miss a single episode.

[01:28:58] There you go.

[01:28:59] Leave us a five star review where more people can find us, brother.

[01:29:03] That's right, Joe and Paige, we're on to support the show, dude.

[01:29:06] Come and pro-crowdy, brother.

[01:29:07] It'd be a real American.

[01:29:09] Unless you're Canadian, of course.

[01:29:10] Remember, it starts at $3 a month.

[01:29:12] Do you want to get access?

[01:29:14] It really accesses to the episodes before everyone else.

[01:29:16] And you love stickers.

[01:29:18] And you want to join our Discord chat.

[01:29:19] You can join that for about $6 a month.

[01:29:22] And become a premium crony.

[01:29:24] But do you want all those perks?

[01:29:26] And a shirt?

[01:29:27] Then you can join us for $20 a month.

[01:29:29] Is an elitist crony.

[01:29:32] Just swing it on over to silverballswag.com

[01:29:35] to pick up a silverballclonicles t-shirt.
