[00:00] The pinball network is online, launching silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Anyway, sorry about being late.

[00:15] The building across from me is on fire.

[00:17] Apparently they've been pumping water into it for three hours.

[00:22] So I apologize if you can hear a bunch of grinding or sawing or something.

[00:28] It's because they're trying to bust into the ceiling, like into the attic of this building.

[00:33] Oh my.

[00:58] Hello everyone.

[01:04] I'm David Dennis and this is silver ball chronicles and with me is Ron the Govna Hallet.

[01:12] What's up, fella?

[01:13] The Govna.

[01:14] The Govna because I went to England.

[01:15] Oh my Govna.

[01:16] You did.

[01:17] Okay.

[01:18] And you grew a mustache.

[01:19] Well, I had that before.

[01:20] I went to England, but yes.

[01:21] Yeah.

[01:22] It was very, it's a very English thing with the mustache and the traveling and the pinball.

[01:29] Not really.

[01:30] I have to wax it, maybe put handlebars and then I feel more.

[01:33] Oh, yes, with the things.

[01:34] Yeah.

[01:35] With the curly things.

[01:36] That's what I should do.

[01:37] Very good.

[01:38] And you enjoyed yourself in England.

[01:39] I was there in high school once and I was one of the most amazing times I've ever had.

[01:44] But you're not a city person.

[01:46] No, hate it.

[01:47] You hate cities.

[01:49] I did go to the British Museum.

[01:50] I didn't realize when I was there because I read this later that it's the largest museum

[01:55] in the world.

[01:56] Yes.

[01:57] And the best part about the British Museum is that most of the stuff in there is stolen

[02:01] from other people.

[02:02] Oh, yeah, yeah.

[02:03] I noticed that.

[02:04] Very, very cool.

[02:05] Yeah.

[02:06] All this, it's just so fun.

[02:07] Did you get to, it's like that.

[02:08] That didn't come from here.

[02:13] Did you get to the London Dungeon?

[02:15] Did you go there?

[02:16] The London Dungeon.

[02:17] I went to the...

[02:18] It's like a touristy place where they explore all of the worst parts about London through

[02:24] like the 16th century and the London fire and jack the river.

[02:28] No, no.

[02:29] I went to the Tower of London where they did have a dungeon.

[02:33] I saw the Crown Jewels.

[02:34] Oh, oh.

[02:35] Oh, you mean the diamonds?

[02:37] Yes, yes.

[02:38] The actual Crown Jewels.

[02:40] Wow.

[02:41] Yeah.

[02:42] That's still giggle when you say that.

[02:45] Yeah.

[02:46] Canadians are so goofy.

[02:47] Speaking of family jewels, how about the launch of Alice in Wonderland?

[02:51] I'm sure that'll be in a future episode.

[02:54] We'll do a Dutch, Dutch pinballs, Alice adventures in Wonderland.

[02:59] Yeah.

[03:00] So that's a whole thing.

[03:01] But then there's also X-Men, which I think looks like a winner.

[03:05] Congratulations, Jack Danger.

[03:08] I'm slowly piecing together an episode for you.

[03:11] So just keep going.

[03:13] And we'll get you something together here and hopefully help celebrate the odds.

[03:17] Awesome pins that you're creating.

[03:19] But then we've also got Mark Sidens first pin over JJP, a theme that I like, although

[03:26] I can't imagine buying a $15,000 pin avatar.

[03:31] Avatar.

[03:32] Ah, looks beautiful.

[03:34] JJP, you make the best premier, fancy-looking pinball machines.

[03:38] I'll tell you what.

[03:39] That's their gimmick.

[03:40] If only we were talking about them in a future episode.

[03:42] Yes, I've almost got the JJP episode done.

[03:46] But I'm going to have to split it into two pieces.

[03:49] The episodes that I've created recently have all ended up being too big and have been

[03:54] required to be split into two, including this episode.

[03:57] All right.

[03:58] For content, and you can space it out longer and milk it longer.

[04:03] So good.

[04:05] And as most of our listeners know, most of the content is just stuff I take from other

[04:08] people and we just talk about it.

[04:10] So it's not like I'm doing anything at all.

[04:12] Well, for some of it, I was actually there.

[04:14] So.

[04:15] Yeah, that helps.

[04:16] And I think that's the only thing that will be interesting for me because I got to see

[04:19] it all happen in real time.

[04:22] Yes, you got to see Jersey Jack's birth.

[04:24] I got to say as a pinball manufacturer.

[04:28] Yes, yes.

[04:29] No, no, not the actual Jersey Jack.

[04:32] No, he's older than me.

[04:33] So that would have been impossible.

[04:34] Well, we've sold out as everybody knows over at patreon.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[04:40] Up on for $3 a month, not a big commitment just to come in and say thank you.

[04:47] It's been a wild ride so far.

[04:50] And I'll tell you what, since the last episode we've seen, we've seen a lot of activity over

[04:56] on the Patreon.

[04:57] And I don't know why.

[05:00] We just covered the Australian pinball ones.

[05:02] But I want to say welcome to yum McBain.

[05:07] What's that McBain thing?

[05:08] Oh, it's the goggles that you're nothing.

[05:12] From the Simpsons, yes.

[05:13] From the Simpsons.

[05:14] I'm McBain.

[05:15] I'm here to lead, not to read.

[05:17] So thank you very much, Nick.

[05:20] And then we've also got the secret antelope who is my favorite new premium crony who has joined

[05:28] us spending a lot of time hanging out on the Discord channel at $6 a month.

[05:33] You get early ad free access to the episode plus access to the Discord chat room.

[05:42] What do you think about that Discord chat room and what's going on in there, Ron?

[05:47] It's all barbecue and porches.

[05:50] That's what there's no pinball talk whatsoever.

[05:55] But it does devolve into a lot of barbecue tips, which I have to say.

[06:01] I've taken quite a few of the suggestions for the barbecue.

[06:06] What about yourself?

[06:07] Almost people don't know that they're in Discord.

[06:09] We've already named the next 10 games.

[06:12] People don't know that.

[06:13] Yes.

[06:14] They're and they're all barbecue thieves, which I think is a winner if I have ever heard

[06:21] of a theme.

[06:23] So shout out to the haymaker and all of his barbecue tips.

[06:29] From the US shout out to him.

[06:31] Thank you.

[06:32] Yes.

[06:33] Exactly.

[06:34] Also, $20 a month gets you the ad free access, the Discord access plus you get a free

[06:41] t-shirt after three months.

[06:42] But if you just want a t-shirt, you don't want to do any of the shenanigans.

[06:46] You can swing on over to silverballswag.com.

[06:50] You can click on the silver ball chronicles link and all of that comes up.

[06:55] You can also chat with us over on Facebook.com slash silverball chronicles.

[07:01] That's where Mick Bain dropped us a couple of really nice comments and thank you very much

[07:08] for that.

[07:09] I like how it's the Facebook.

[07:12] That's said like a true senior.

[07:14] I ordered something from the Amazon.

[07:17] With that increased engagement also came some increased scrutiny on our previous episode.

[07:26] Wrong.

[07:27] Correction time.

[07:28] We were wrong on a few things and I want to set it clear here.

[07:35] Okay.

[07:36] So first of all, I had somebody reach out to be almost immediately and they said by the

[07:42] way, you have said some of the names in correctly.

[07:48] Well we know that.

[07:49] Wayne Gillard is how Wayne's name is pronounced.

[07:54] Not Gillard.

[07:55] It's Gillard.

[07:56] Not Gillard.

[07:57] Gillard.

[07:58] Okay.

[07:59] Yes.

[08:00] So in Canada, the reason I struggle sometimes with certain names is we have a French influence

[08:06] particularly in my region and my province.

[08:10] Gillard.

[08:11] Yeah, it'll be Gillard.

[08:12] Here.

[08:13] Gillard?

[08:14] Oh, Gillard.

[08:15] Probably, right?

[08:16] No, it will be Gillard.

[08:17] Oh, oh.

[08:18] Gillard.

[08:19] Right?

[08:20] So that's why I'm like, so I thought I did a good time by saying what did I say?

[08:24] Like Gillard, but apparently it's Gillard.

[08:26] I don't know.

[08:27] I can't remember.

[08:28] And I don't go back to listen to these other episodes because once I'm done editing,

[08:31] that's the end of that.

[08:32] But we also had a chat from Ryan over at the Phantom Tilt podcast.

[08:40] It's Ryan here from the greatest bi-monthly recorded in Western Australia above the

[08:44] tropic of Capricorn podcast in the world, the Phantom Tilt Pinball podcast.

[08:49] I really enjoyed the latest episode and I'm looking forward to hearing you deep-dive

[08:53] born to Pinball down here.

[08:55] It's a shame it had to start with the sniveling runt Damian, wow.

[09:00] I know there are so many other interesting characters around Australian New Zealand

[09:03] to get into, so I'll eagerly be eagerly awaiting the next one.

[09:07] If you need any Aussie callouts to throw in throughout the show, Dopey Shy, send me

[09:11] a list and I'll record them in my best.

[09:13] I don't know where that is.

[09:14] Bogen voice.

[09:15] That must be that like stereotypical like rural Australian voice.

[09:20] Ah.

[09:21] Well, I'm off to watch my kangaroo before I ride it into work tomorrow.

[09:23] I hope you can both make it down here one day and try our local delicacies.

[09:28] Good morning, Snags and Vegemite Sangas.

[09:31] Ooh, very cool.

[09:33] Very cool.

[09:34] I probably said all that wrong.

[09:35] I've always kind of wanted to go down to Australia because it's fairly similar to Canada

[09:40] being a former British colony that didn't revolt against our great king.

[09:49] We just got too expensive and they decided to get rid of us.

[09:52] I find that very exciting.

[09:55] I'd love to make it down there.

[09:56] We're a big deal in Australia.

[09:57] We sell a lot of shirts down there.

[10:00] They tend to be fairly large like double X or triple X shell shirts.

[10:04] What are you saying?

[10:05] I'm saying little less Vegemite guys.

[10:08] What about Dr. John?

[10:09] Who's Dr. John?

[10:10] It's Dr. John Cosson.

[10:12] Well, known in the pinball community, Australian.

[10:16] He says, hello David and the slam tilt chap.

[10:19] Yes, that's my other podcast, the slam tilt podcast.

[10:22] Oh, that's the one with Bruce Knighton.

[10:24] That's my plug.

[10:26] He says, as you mentioned, I had dealings with Haggis from an early stage purchasing the

[10:31] first Keltz built.

[10:33] It was a simple but slightly frustrating game, but held up well, even went on location

[10:38] for two years as we know building one is easy, but not manufacturing multiple.

[10:43] Damien had multiple innovations in the game, including the perspex spec glass.

[10:50] That is one piece similar to what Abba has from pinball brothers.

[10:55] I think Alien has that too.

[10:57] It was like a one piece.

[10:58] It did have magnets, but also a locking key on top so it wouldn't fall off during play.

[11:03] My adhesive did fail at one point so the whole thing fell off the frame onto the glass

[11:08] during play one day.

[11:09] Very confusing and frightening to see, but did no damage to anything.

[11:13] Just glued it back on.

[11:14] Okay?

[11:15] He also incorporated locking levers.

[11:18] You twist to lock the back box in place rather than head bolts.

[11:22] Fabric line glass channels to eliminate glass rattles.

[11:25] I wish more people would do that.

[11:26] Printing on the underside of the play field to align in mount mechs and other minor features.

[11:32] He says, I received my fathom number one nine months after I paid full for it.

[11:38] This was quite fast by all reports.

[11:40] Season ticket holders got their games first and waited a year in some cases after paying

[11:44] the full cost invoice and receiving their games.

[11:47] I personally told Damien face to face.

[11:49] This was not a good way to run a business, but it was his business so didn't have to

[11:53] listen.

[11:54] Of course, I didn't order the centaur due to what was happening, even longer delays,

[11:58] minimal staffing, no communication, etc.

[12:02] Just to correct a few things from the informative Haggis episode.

[12:06] Wayne's last name is print house.

[12:08] Yes, Gil Lard.

[12:10] Kelt also came with the acrylic overlay on the play field.

[12:14] See pick of mine below.

[12:15] So he sent a picture.

[12:17] The wood is not glued to the acrylic.

[12:20] This is the big mistake here.

[12:21] I got a couple of emails on this.

[12:23] They are held together by the mechs that go through both.

[12:26] I think the term delaminating is a misnomer because what seems to have happened to some

[12:32] the game's suffer heat exposure, the acrylic top expanded more than the wood.

[12:37] Thus where there was less mechs holding it down, there would be a bow or buckle.

[12:42] Which is basically the center of the play field, right?

[12:45] The middle between the flippers and stuff like that.

[12:48] The score displays on the phatham are also RGB.

[12:52] In mermaid battle, they changed from blue to red.

[12:56] Super cool, super cool.

[12:57] So there's the thing, right?

[12:58] So we had said the delaminating that was happening to some of those pins was because

[13:04] the heat exposure and there was some lifting.

[13:08] Well, the idea was that it wasn't glued to the play field.

[13:12] So it wasn't actually delaminating from the play field.

[13:14] It was bending or whatever because of the shrinking or expanding of the wood underneath

[13:18] it.

[13:19] Okay, the other thing about this acrylic top that we said was that it was likely the heat

[13:25] exposure from when it sat on a dock, waiting to get into containers or from containers through

[13:32] customs into the dealers, etc., etc., in North America.

[13:37] Maybe some of those bowing or buckling play fields were actually air freight so they didn't

[13:43] spend a lot of time sitting on a boat and things like that with heat changes and they still

[13:49] had problems.

[13:50] So I wanted to be crystal clear about that, even though we screwed up in the first episode.

[13:55] Which I mean, is the first time for everything, right?

[13:58] And what about Greg Silby?

[14:01] He says, hi guys, I've been listening to your podcast since you started.

[14:04] Love it.

[14:05] I want to say thanks for pronouncing my name correctly in the Haggis episode.

[14:09] As I know, this is not usually your strong suit.

[14:11] Oh, thanks for that.

[14:14] But we did it.

[14:15] We did it.

[14:16] We got that name and we did it.

[14:17] Let's jump into today's topic.

[14:18] Shall we?

[14:19] We shall.

[14:20] David Gottlieb.

[14:21] Alvin Gottlieb and Michael Gottlieb.

[14:26] All people with the same last name.

[14:29] It's like they're related.

[14:31] A famous last name.

[14:34] The name that is synonymous with pinball, its growth expansion, and then its collapse.

[14:43] The Gottlieb's are absolutely integral to what we know as pinball today.

[14:52] David, the grandfather, Alvin, the father, and Michael, the son all had a hand in building

[15:02] a Gottlieb pinball machine, although they all kind of had separate names for companies.

[15:08] But in the beginning, it was David Gottlieb.

[15:12] So join us this month for Meet the Gottliebs.

[15:15] What is your memories of Gottliebs?

[15:18] What is the first memory of Gottlieb?

[15:21] Hmm.

[15:22] That's a good question.

[15:24] Like when was the first time where you were like playing a pinball machine and you realized

[15:27] Gottlieb was something?

[15:31] When I saw all these one player EMs and they were all Gottliebs, all the wedgeheads and

[15:35] they're all Gottliebs.

[15:36] Wow, this Gottlieb made a lot of games.

[15:39] Without a doubt, now my first memory was I was searching out pinball machines in my

[15:45] 30s when I first got back into pinball and I realized there were manufacturers and different

[15:51] companies and things like it wasn't just pinball.

[15:55] There was like a whole business.

[15:57] And I played jungle princess, no jungle queen, the four player.

[16:04] Do you know what that one with the monkeys and the drop targets?

[16:08] And I remember looking at that and being like, oh, Gottlieb, that's the company that made

[16:12] this.

[16:13] This thing is heavy and built like a tank.

[16:17] It's wild.

[16:18] That's my first memory of Gottlieb.

[16:19] If you have a first memory of Gottlieb listener, shoot us an email at silverballcronicles.

[16:24] It was a gmail.com and also phonetically spell out how you say your name.

[16:28] And we know Dennis is lying.

[16:31] The first one he played was spring break.

[16:33] Yeah, that's right.

[16:34] Everybody, yeah, what was the other one?

[16:37] What's the one with the cactus?

[16:38] Oh, yes, cactus jacks.

[16:41] Cactus jacks.

[16:42] Dancing cacti.

[16:43] Got to love that.

[16:44] Got to love that.

[16:45] But that was that was that was a whole other thing.

[16:47] That'll be in part two.

[16:48] But let's let's wind it away back.

[16:50] Let's go.

[16:51] Let's go back to the beginning.

[16:53] David Gottlieb was one of nine kids growing up in Milwaukee or as it's known by the

[17:02] Eroquois in the area, Milwaukee, which means the river.

[17:08] Isn't that true from?

[17:09] Oh, I, I, from Wayne's world.

[17:12] Oh, I've never seen it.

[17:13] Sorry.

[17:14] You haven't seen Wayne's world.

[17:15] Sorry.

[17:16] Oh, that really fell flat.

[17:17] That did not go.

[17:19] So his father was a foreman in a type of tailoring shop and David's grandfather before

[17:27] him came from the old country, like so many other people back when they came in with the

[17:34] odds.

[17:35] You remember the old country, Ron?

[17:37] I'm two or three generations removed from the old country.

[17:41] Wow.

[17:42] That's pretty good for, for like a, for like an Italian American three three.

[17:46] Yeah, I would say my great grandparents were

[17:48] from Italy.

[17:49] Oh, see my grandparents were their grandparents and their grandparents.

[17:54] We landed here in like 1860.

[17:55] Wow.

[17:56] Yeah, before they even kept records, we just sort of showed up on the shores of eastern

[18:00] Canada.

[18:01] You are Canadian as they come.

[18:02] I am as Canadian as they absolutely come.

[18:05] It is unbelievable.

[18:07] So there was no old country really for us, which was pretty wild, but we did come from

[18:11] the correct part of Europe, which is England and Scott, the correct part.

[18:16] All right.

[18:17] David Gottlieb was eight or nine.

[18:19] He had a newspaper route and started that four in the morning.

[18:24] He had some serious hardworking ethic right from when he was a child and he started from

[18:30] zero and he continued to grow over the years.

[18:36] He attended the University of Minnesota.

[18:38] What does that mean?

[18:39] He started from zero like zero, like he didn't have anything.

[18:43] That's just he did it all himself.

[18:45] He's a weird lie.

[18:46] He started from...

[18:47] You know guys don't say that, don't you?

[18:48] And I thought you were talking about his paper route.

[18:50] He started with like zero subscribers and then grew over the years.

[18:54] Then he became the paper boy and then he made a video game about it.

[18:58] That's right.

[18:59] That's right.

[19:00] That's right.

[19:01] And then he ran the territories of all the other paper boys and then they had to make

[19:04] them out of a cut.

[19:05] And then he did obstacle courses for some reason.

[19:08] People need to be...

[19:09] He wasn't wearing a helmet.

[19:10] Oh, no one wore a helmet back then.

[19:12] Are you kidding?

[19:13] He attended the University of Minnesota when the first World War broke out and he went

[19:18] to the Army training corps.

[19:20] The Great War if he will because they didn't know a second one was coming at.

[19:25] Yeah, at the time it was not called World War.

[19:27] It was called the Great War.

[19:29] Yes, that's right.

[19:30] And this Army training corps was in the university that he attended and by the time he was ready

[19:36] to ship out World War I had already ended.

[19:41] Now of course you remember when the first World War started right, Ron?

[19:45] It's like something like 1914 and 1918, something like that.

[19:50] Oh well no, for you it was 1917, wasn't it?

[19:53] Everybody else was in war in the 1914.

[19:55] New Americans sat in the sidelines.

[19:58] Well yeah, we weren't in the area, you know.

[19:59] Let's see 1914 and 1918.

[20:01] Damn, I'm good.

[20:02] Damn it.

[20:03] I thought I was going to get you.

[20:05] After the war David and Saul his brother began selling film on the road to theaters.

[20:13] Now this was in the old Nickelodeon days and no it's not Nickelodeon like the Nickelodeon

[20:18] channel in cartoons.

[20:21] But this was like something I had to look up.

[20:25] So in the 1920s Nickelodeon was a theater chain with what they called movie palaces.

[20:32] Have you ever been to a movie palace?

[20:35] In Albany there was a palace theater.

[20:39] Oh okay.

[20:41] So you have been to a palace.

[20:42] It was like old school and then there was the Madison which was your old school like

[20:46] theater with the huge lobby and all that kind of cool stuff we don't have anymore.

[20:50] Yeah, so what they did in our local place is they've replaced everything with recliners

[20:56] because they realized that people don't want to come and pay $50 to go see a movie and

[21:00] sit on terrible seats and wait 40 minutes before it even start.

[21:05] David and Saul had an old model T Ford car and it was so difficult and stiff to start

[21:12] with those old cars running.

[21:14] You can almost like break your arm to start them that they only stopped in towns that

[21:18] had a hill so that they could start the car by pushing it down the hill rather than

[21:23] turning the crank.

[21:24] Well to jump start the engine.

[21:26] Yes.

[21:27] Exactly.

[21:28] Exactly.

[21:29] David came up with this brilliant idea to splice the national anthem and the American flag

[21:36] into every film he sold so that at the end of the film the people would stand up and

[21:43] applaud and cheer for America.

[21:46] The people outside of the theater would hear this noise and excitement and assume that

[21:52] the film was so good they would buy a ticket for the next showing.

[21:57] That is salesmanship.

[21:59] The family would move to Dallas, Texas to get away from the cold weather of Minnesota.

[22:06] Have you been to Minnesota?

[22:07] Oh just the airport.

[22:10] Just the airport.

[22:11] Yeah so I mean it's a big difference between Minnesota and Dallas you know.

[22:14] Texas is the heart of the American oil industry and he began to work in the oil fields.

[22:21] He would sell what was called punch boards to the oil field workers.

[22:26] I had no idea what the heck a punch board was so I had to look this up and it is in our

[22:30] show notes.

[22:32] A punch board is like a portable gambling device which had jackpot.

[22:38] Oh everyone knows that.

[22:40] Does everybody know that?

[22:41] I've never heard of that before.

[22:42] I was like I've never heard of this before.

[22:44] So like you know nowadays we have like the one arm band and you go you have a VLT, a

[22:48] video lottery terminal or you know those things that you've got in like Vegas.

[22:53] Well back in the day you would carry around these like boxes and you'd put your finger

[22:58] in and break the hole.

[23:01] It's sort of like an advent calendar you know what I mean?

[23:03] So he carried a lot of cash around with him because if anybody won the jackpot he would

[23:08] have to pay them.

[23:10] This was like western cowboys kind of hotel thing.

[23:16] So what did he do to keep safe?

[23:17] I had a gun.

[23:19] When he was young teenager he would sleep with the gun under his pillow and he would

[23:24] put a dresser up against the door.

[23:26] It was so dangerous.

[23:28] David Gottlieb had a reputation for being very tight with money.

[23:33] He didn't joke around.

[23:36] This is a great example of how wealth is built over generations.

[23:41] Okay.

[23:42] Wealth doesn't just come to everybody.

[23:44] It doesn't just appear one day but you have to think that over generations both David

[23:49] and Alvin and Michael and all of his grandchildren and all that stuff have all benefited wealth

[23:56] is built over generations.

[23:58] That's why Europeans look kind of fancy because they've had a lot more generations to build

[24:02] wealth.

[24:03] What does Alvin Gottlieb say about his father being so tight?

[24:07] Once he got his hands on a buck he liked to keep it.

[24:10] His hopeful conservatism was such that I don't think he owned any stock or anything but

[24:14] our own company.

[24:15] His personal funds were always in the US government, Treasuries.

[24:18] He preached that loud and long to anyone within the air shot.

[24:21] He said the human mind can only concentrate and produce well on one subject at a time.

[24:26] If your mind is clogged up with things on the outside, other investments that you have

[24:29] to worry about, you can't concentrate on your business.

[24:32] His experiences in those days were such.

[24:34] He said, I never ever want to be broke.

[24:37] So we can see that once you're in those early odds and tens around the first world

[24:43] war, life was a lot tougher.

[24:46] You had to be, you had to have more grit.

[24:49] You couldn't just go to the grocery store like we have now.

[24:53] Life was tough.

[24:55] And that means that you never, ever want to go back to that again, especially when you've

[25:00] been given such a gift.

[25:03] In 1927 David Gottlieb discovered a grip testing machine, which was manufactured in Dallas,

[25:09] Texas.

[25:10] So what's a grip testing machine?

[25:13] If it's the game one, you grip it and harder you grip it, the higher ranking you have.

[25:20] Yeah, and it's a competition.

[25:21] You got all these oil field guys, these rough necks that work out on the oil field.

[25:27] And these are all big dudes.

[25:28] They are all muscular because they're like lifting up pipes and turning things with big

[25:34] tools.

[25:35] You can tell I'm no.

[25:36] You can tell you've never actually done physical labor.

[25:39] Yes.

[25:40] Anyway, so those guys, they'd come out from the oil fields and they'd have a bunch of

[25:45] money and they would get these punch cards and they'd gamble and then they would go and

[25:50] then they get all, you know, they'd have a couple of drinks and then they would want to

[25:54] see who's the stronger one, who's got the stronger grip strength.

[25:57] So this thing would probably print money.

[26:00] What do you think?

[26:01] I'm sure it's what it looked like.

[26:02] If it had like a window of different levels like Woosey, Strong, Hercules level or something.

[26:08] David Gottlieb bought one of these machines and he wanted to produce his own.

[26:14] But he couldn't find anyone in Texas with the expertise in making the castings that he

[26:18] would need because it needed these like metal grips and all these like little bits and

[26:22] pieces.

[26:23] It wasn't just sort of like today where you've got a computer board and some software.

[26:27] You needed like literal mechanisms.

[26:29] Dave and Saul were traveling to Chicago quite extensively as part of their sort of jack

[26:35] of all trades jobs.

[26:37] David would move to Chicago in 1927 because they had the parts and the talent to build

[26:43] these types of machines that David was drawn to and he would move to Jefferson Street where

[26:49] he began building grip testing machines.

[26:52] In 1930, David discovered pinball machines in Ohio and that's where he saw the potential

[26:58] and we spoke a little bit about this in episode 2070 brief history of pinball.

[27:04] You love that episode.

[27:05] So long ago.

[27:06] 27 episodes were on episode like 40.

[27:08] Damn.

[27:09] At least 41 maybe.

[27:11] Holy crap.

[27:12] We're on episode 41.

[27:13] Yeah, like I said.

[27:14] We're like elder statesmen now.

[27:16] This is where production of Baffle Ball by Gottlieb had started and he had to move to a larger

[27:21] facility and that was when he moved over to Chicago Avenue which was essentially just

[27:27] an oversized garage.

[27:28] Now you remember Baffle Ball.

[27:30] They sold a lot of them.

[27:32] 50,000 units.

[27:33] Now they weren't $10,000 each.

[27:38] But they weren't exactly cheap either.

[27:40] Well, we had a flyer, didn't we?

[27:42] Here's the flyer.

[27:43] You know, Baffle Ball, it's the greatest value ever offered.

[27:47] It says so.

[27:49] Ten shots for one cent.

[27:51] It's absolutely the finest pinboard game made, pinboard.

[27:55] No bugs in this game.

[27:57] I wonder if that was a problem back then.

[28:00] It's like literally bugs.

[28:02] It says in, it doesn't work right.

[28:05] Oh, operators before buying machines get our low prices.

[28:09] They are astonishing and they are also not on our flyer.

[28:12] They're not there.

[28:13] Nobody wants to hear any of those.

[28:15] Back in this time, we're not talking about pinball with flippers and we're not really

[28:19] talking about pinball with like bingo which was like the one with holes and things like

[28:25] that.

[28:26] We're talking a very small sort of tabletop game.

[28:30] It also came with legs in some versions and you would kind of shoot the ball up and

[28:36] it would go through the arch just kind of like those those 1970s games which are not really

[28:40] a thing anymore where the ball goes up and it bounces back and forth and back and forth

[28:44] and then comes down the play field and into various holes.

[28:47] Well, we have some pricing.

[28:49] You can get your new Baffle Ball for only $17.50.

[28:53] Could you imagine?

[28:55] And if you want the legs, it's $37.50.

[29:00] Hey, pinheads.

[29:01] When I'm not doing this podcast, I'm Dave the Financial Advice Guy.

[29:06] In a recent survey, we found that 70% of those pulled were concerned about their retirement

[30:20] Very nice.

[30:22] You could upgrade to the Playboy senior which was the leg version of Playboy which was not

[30:30] what Playboy is nowadays.

[30:32] 1750 and 3750 respectively.

[30:36] Really cool stuff.

[30:38] Really cool stuff.

[30:39] This was the era where it all started in November of 31 and this was D. Gottlieb and

[30:46] the company.

[30:47] That is the Gottlieb that we know and love and will continue for many years.

[30:54] We'll follow it for quite a while.

[30:57] The game resonated with people because they just wanted some cheap entertainment during

[31:03] this great depression era.

[31:06] Anything that you could do to kind of distract yourself from kind of the trials and tribulations

[31:12] of society.

[31:14] Lookstores and taverns in the US primarily operated these types of machines with many

[31:20] of the locations quickly recovering the cost of those games.

[31:25] What did Alvin Gottlieb say about this era?

[31:27] He said things were going so well.

[31:30] They were making about 400 of these baffle balls a day.

[31:33] And I and dad, his younger brother, my mother, my mother's younger brother, were working

[31:38] from eight in the morning till about midnight and they had people there all night long.

[31:43] The term was they threw the key away because there was always some bunch of people in the

[31:47] place.

[31:48] They were just building constantly turning these things out.

[31:53] That's so there's that hard working kind of tough work ethic.

[31:57] You know what I mean?

[31:58] To maximize the profit, to maximize the potential, your family are the ones you're employing,

[32:05] to build them because your family is willing to work eight till midnight every night.

[32:09] Now Ray Maloney, this is a name that has popped up with some of our previous episodes.

[32:16] He was selling machines via mail order and he couldn't get enough of these baffle balls

[32:23] from David Gottlieb's company.

[32:25] So he, you know, as a distributor, you're struggling with getting enough product.

[32:30] So that's when he said, well, I'll just make my own.

[32:33] And he made...

[32:34] Pallyhoo.

[32:35] And it did so well.

[32:36] He named his company after it.

[32:38] But Leib, however, was sort of the innovator in this area and they continued to survive

[32:44] because they would change sort of the methodology of these pin games, if you will, as opposed

[32:53] to pinball.

[32:55] And they would sort of continue to tweak those to really build and become the total creator

[33:01] of the entire coin op industry.

[33:04] David Gottlieb loved innovation.

[33:07] Only he saw a way forward to continue to push sales.

[33:12] Well, Alan Gottlieb says they would run if they hit a hot number.

[33:17] See, that's the thing.

[33:18] If they had a hot number, they would do two, three, four months.

[33:22] If they didn't have a number, they didn't do anything.

[33:24] They would just sit around, work like the Dickens to try to invent something else.

[33:29] I assume he means like the game itself.

[33:31] Like if the game didn't sell, like, okay, this ain't sell.

[33:33] We need something else.

[33:34] There's no such thing as testing.

[33:35] They would start building them and they go into production.

[33:39] If it was not so good, it didn't last long.

[33:42] If it was a really good item, they would go like the Dickens and pretty soon everyone

[33:45] in their uncle was making the same thing.

[33:48] They would be copying each other.

[33:50] Continuing innovation.

[33:51] Now, I think Toyota has this thing that's called Kaizen.

[33:54] Are you aware of Kaizen?

[33:57] No.

[33:58] No, it's continuous gradual conscious improvement, right?

[34:03] You're always trying to improve the process.

[34:05] You're always trying to improve production.

[34:07] You're always trying to improve innovation.

[34:08] You're just picking away at things all the time.

[34:12] That is what naturally David Gottlieb would do is he was always trying to innovate and

[34:18] change and improve.

[34:20] That led to the rise of the entire coin-op industry.

[34:24] Let's see what Alvin has to say about that.

[34:27] He says, you got to bear in mind that that was back in the days when there wasn't a lot

[34:30] of states running slot machines.

[34:32] The jukebox business was in its infancy.

[34:34] The coin-op machine business is such hardly existed.

[34:38] The old coin telephone and vending machines were coming into their own, being a bit more

[34:42] accepted.

[34:43] Telephone, right?

[34:44] Literally, the telephone was not a thing in like 1919 and sort of outside of major cities.

[34:49] You know what I mean?

[34:51] Having a phone booth, which is now exotic for my kids and kids growing up today, they've

[34:56] never seen a phone.

[34:57] Vending machines are still alive and well.

[34:59] Yeah, they've got this vending machine in her local mall that makes cotton candy with

[35:04] crazy designs.

[35:05] Have you seen one of those?

[35:07] No.

[35:08] That's cool stuff.

[35:09] I'll send you a video of that.

[35:11] That's worth a Google there listeners.

[35:13] Worth a Google.

[35:14] But how did the business continue to rise during the Great Depression?

[35:17] Because people got nothing to do.

[35:19] They got nothing to do.

[35:21] They got no money.

[35:22] Spending time in the pub, drowning your sorrows, is what you did.

[35:27] The pool halls, pool halls became a thing because the alternative was hanging out on the

[35:32] street.

[35:33] So games rose in popularity to distract.

[35:37] But there were some serious doubts that this fledgling new industry would actually take

[35:44] off.

[35:45] One of those large doubters was David Gottlieb himself.

[35:48] So they brought out a game called Five Star Final in 1932.

[35:55] Five Star Final is one of these sort of games that sticks out in the mind of Alvin

[36:02] Gottlieb and some others.

[36:03] And this is another one of those big 50,000 plus sellers.

[36:08] It's quite, it's like a quite a wonderful game here.

[36:11] So let's just describe what we're looking at.

[36:14] It's wood.

[36:15] And it looks like a figure eight.

[36:17] And it only weighs 20 pounds.

[36:18] That's amazing.

[36:19] It has two stars.

[36:21] It looks sort of like Iron Man shield.

[36:23] It's me, the silver ball Chronicles AI.

[36:26] I'm pretty sure David meant Captain America's shield, not Iron Man's.

[36:31] Wow, I thought he knew his comic book stuff.

[36:33] How embarrassing.

[36:35] Well enjoy the rest of this so-called history podcast.

[36:38] I have to get back to learning to drive a Tesla Cyber Cab before the investors realize

[36:42] it's a marketing scam.

[36:44] Like top and bottom and the shape of an eight.

[36:46] And you shoot the ball up and it will zip around based on the strength of which you plunge

[36:53] that ball.

[36:54] You plunge the ball really hard.

[36:55] It goes all the way around to the bottom eight and up and through and it keep going around

[36:59] and flip.

[37:00] It looks really fun, eh?

[37:01] I've probably played this at some point.

[37:04] Kind of like one of those, one of those like old sections.

[37:07] Yeah, we'll have the 30, yeah, the 30 tabletop.

[37:10] The 30s tabletop section.

[37:12] They'll have all these games.

[37:14] Yeah, this was also when Prohibition took off specifically in Chicago.

[37:19] Well, they didn't take off.

[37:20] They had Prohibition in the 20s.

[37:22] Well, that's right.

[37:23] It's still going.

[37:24] It's actually, it's dying out near the early 30s.

[37:28] I'm trying to think when repeal went into effect.

[37:30] It's like 34, 35, something like that.

[37:34] Well, Alvin says Prohibition in Chicago, of course, always made headlines that weren't

[37:38] good.

[37:39] There were reasons to try and establish an image separate apart from what the press had.

[37:47] This is Gene Simmons from KISS.

[37:49] I would like you to join the Patriarch or Silver Ball Chronicles in coming up Procronis,

[37:54] the perfect way to say thanks, and it starts at $3 a month.

[38:37] If your games, like Five Star Final and all that stuff, are in pubs and bars and things

[38:43] like that, you're associated with that.

[38:46] And then they needed to create an association or a lobbying group to help improve their

[38:54] image.

[38:55] So the reason David Gottlieb was a doater is that he brings out something like Five Star

[38:59] Final, a smash hit.

[39:02] But he's being sort of dragged down into this CD underbelly of alcohol and whatever.

[39:10] And that's not David Gottlieb's sort of modus apparenda.

[39:14] He's not that kind of person.

[39:15] He's a very squeaky clean kind of guy.

[39:18] But that industry association, the business needed to compete across distributors and

[39:27] manufacturers.

[39:28] They all had to come together if they were going to survive.

[39:31] They had to have some competition, but they needed to have the right kind of competition.

[39:37] By the time they started to coordinate this together, that's when the old WWII broke out.

[39:43] And when did that start, Ron?

[39:45] When did WWII start?

[39:47] Oh, 39.

[39:48] Are you sure?

[39:50] Well, no, before he won for us because it would be December 8th when we entered the war.

[39:56] Because of a little thing that happened to December 7th, yes.

[39:59] A little bit late.

[40:00] A little bit late.

[40:01] A little bit of prohibition ended in 33.

[40:02] I was one year off, assuming.

[40:03] It would just been late.

[40:04] We were late getting in and been going on for two years.

[40:06] It's when Germany invaded Poland, I believe, is when it officially started.

[40:09] That's right.

[40:10] That's okay, just twice.

[40:11] You've been early in every other war since, eh?

[40:15] Wow.

[40:17] We know what Canada's track record.

[40:20] Actually, there were Canadians at the Battle of Normandy, including Scotty from Star Trek.

[40:26] He was there.

[40:27] And he survived because he was a smoker.

[40:29] True story.

[40:30] The bullet deflected off the cigarette case he had in his pocket.

[40:34] So literally being a smoker saved his life.

[40:36] There you go.

[40:37] James do hand.

[40:38] James do hand.

[40:39] Was it James?

[40:40] I believe so.

[40:41] So go out.

[40:42] All the North American industrial output was moved to the war effort.

[40:47] Now even though you guys were a little bit late, you did, uh, let's say ramp up your industrial

[40:57] output to help out the European, uh, war effort.

[41:02] But the problem with this is it made finding parts and skilled labor in the game and coin

[41:08] up industry, which was kind of in this precarious situation really, really difficult.

[41:15] So David, like Harry Williams and Lynn Durant, began refurbishing games and trying to sell

[41:21] them as new, rather than building brand new pieces.

[41:27] David would buy old stock back from people who had purchased these machines.

[41:32] He disassemble them, then reassemble them, change the art and they were new.

[41:36] Stock loads of the stuff along with rats, bugs and animals would all come back to the factory

[41:44] inside these old machines.

[41:46] So these machines did have some bugs.

[41:50] They also made parachute hardware, glider toe hooks and machine gun.

[41:55] Awesome.

[41:56] In their fact, so is there a machine gun clip that says like D got leaving company on it?

[42:00] That would be awesome.

[42:01] Probably.

[42:02] Our games will kill you literally.

[42:05] So in the stock, you know them, they were a jukebox manufacturer, right?

[42:09] That's what I know for yes.

[42:10] They made rifles because they had the woodworking shops and they were able to make those kind

[42:15] of gun grip things.

[42:18] The wood part, yes.

[42:19] The wood part, things because I'm definitely a gun person.

[42:23] You know, they sort of had started a few things and paused a few games.

[42:28] Now a game that kind of started production, kind of trailed off and then they ramped production

[42:32] back up during that time period was a game called stage door canteen.

[42:40] I'm a big fan of canteens where you get snacks.

[42:43] And it says a back box on it.

[42:45] Yeah.

[42:46] So this is we're changing brief history of pinball podcast talks about sort of the change

[42:50] and the reason to attract people and scoring and things like that.

[42:53] But when you look at this game, being the first one, quote, like kind of the first game

[42:58] that they, you know, really manufactured when they got back, what is what's happened

[43:02] here all of a sudden?

[43:03] It looks more like a modern pinball machine.

[43:06] Yes.

[43:07] Yeah, we got bumpers, but no flippers.

[43:09] Are those pop bumpers or are they just dead bumpers?

[43:11] Well, they look like pop.

[43:12] They look like pop up.

[43:13] Yes.

[43:14] You hit them and they go, dang, they don't actually, they don't bounce the ball around.

[43:19] Things are changing, right?

[43:20] The technology is that have been invented because of the government spending to ramp up

[43:26] the war effort, things like casting plastics of rubber, those kind of things have all

[43:33] started to trickle down into the actual kind of economy.

[43:39] But there was a huge innovation that got laid ahead in the 1940s and that was Humpty

[43:44] Dumpty.

[43:45] The flipper had been around for years, but it was essentially like a baseball bat, pitch

[43:53] and bat kind of game.

[43:55] And the baseball bat was mounted in the front of the game on the, you know, it wasn't quite

[43:59] the same.

[44:01] Harry Mabbs is the one that sort of solved the major issue and created the flipper as we

[44:06] know it today.

[44:07] Again, we covered that in greater detail in a brief history of pinball.

[44:11] But what did, what did Alvin say about Harry?

[44:14] He says, Harry, he been working on a switch built into the flipper so that the ball rolled

[44:18] by that.

[44:19] That particular piece of plastic was called an island.

[44:22] Okay, so when the ball came down and hit the switch, it would bat it out of the way.

[44:26] He would monkey with this thing and he couldn't get it to work because the swing and the

[44:30] impact of the fast stopping would shatter the mechanics.

[44:33] So he had the wires pulled outside of the cabinet and he was hitting the two wires together

[44:38] when the ball rolled down and he hit the two wires.

[44:41] He got the effect he wanted.

[44:43] He then realized, what am I doing?

[44:46] He put the buttons on the side of the cabinet and built the first flipper.

[44:49] That's a great little quote with adding some context from something.

[44:53] This is a quote that I found before.

[44:55] So he's just kind of screwing around with trying to figure out a way for this thing to

[44:59] just automatically kind of flip up and hit the ball, but it's not working.

[45:03] It's breaking.

[45:04] So then he invents the flipper by going, I'll just put it outside the cabinet and put

[45:07] touch the wires together like your hot rod in a car, right?

[45:10] It would take a month or so, but when they realized that they had it, it was almost

[45:14] perfect.

[45:15] Samples went out to the field and people went nuts.

[45:19] That was when the old die hard skeptics said, oh my God, they'll play this game forever.

[45:25] How long are people going to play on this game?

[45:28] Because before it was all about draining dollars and it was all about draining coins.

[45:32] Well, before you plunge in, it's going to get to the bottom eventually.

[45:36] Now you have flippers.

[45:37] They're probably like, oh no, you can keep hitting it up top over and over and over and

[45:40] it's never going to drain.

[45:41] Well, they were wrong.

[45:43] It drained.

[45:44] It drained a lot.

[45:45] So who is Alvin Gottlieb?

[45:47] David Gottlieb's son?

[45:48] David Gottlieb's son.

[45:49] We had mentioned that before.

[45:51] We've pulled a lot of his quotes.

[45:53] These quotes come from Roger Sharpe's interviews, which he used to make his book, the, what

[46:02] was that book called?

[46:03] Pinball.

[46:04] Back in the day when he was doing his research.

[46:07] So the recordings that he made, if you've seen the man who saved Pinball, the film, all

[46:13] of the interviews that he had with people, this would be one of those interviews.

[46:19] Alvin served in a second world war in the Navy.

[46:22] And when he left in 1947, he began working in the family's factory.

[46:28] He was 20 and he was working in the engineering department and he learned all the ins and

[46:33] outs of design, development and production of pinball machines.

[46:38] He worked in almost all areas of the business, including travel to distributors, sales department

[46:44] manufacturing, product quality review, like he did it all.

[46:48] He was a jack of all trades.

[46:51] During this time, Gottlieb struggled compared to those prior years.

[46:56] They were no longer selling 50,000 tabletop units.

[47:00] And the reason for that, Ron, was one thing.

[47:03] Gambling.

[47:04] What kind of games were those?

[47:05] Bingo.

[47:06] Five All Games were suffering.

[47:08] What's with your anti-bingo sentiment?

[47:10] Come on.

[47:11] You did a whole episode on Bingo.

[47:13] Yeah, great episode.

[47:14] Everybody loved that one.

[47:14] We got a lot of tons of emails and support of that episode.

[47:17] Oh, it's part of history, folks.

[47:20] I'm just joking.

[47:22] I loved it.

[47:23] Well, Alvin says, David Gottlieb's point of view was that he just wanted to be strictly

[47:26] an amusement game business.

[47:28] Gambling was no interest to him at all.

[47:30] He wanted to be able to provide, in his own words, provide amusement for the populace

[47:35] at a very low price.

[47:37] We try to make a couple of games that work games of chance, but his heart wasn't in it.

[47:41] It was more or less to maintain competitiveness.

[47:44] He didn't enjoy it at all.

[47:45] I was in the engineering department one day and he came in and told us that it was the

[47:49] end of our attempt to get into that business at all.

[47:52] From then on, it was strictly amusement games.

[47:55] Yeah.

[47:56] So David Gottlieb is actually running his business in a direction, which is negatively

[48:02] affecting sales and negatively affecting the growth of his business.

[48:07] He didn't want to build gambling machines.

[48:09] Whether that was a moral thing or gambling was bad or the whole thing, even though he

[48:14] did a lot of gambling stuff when he was a kid, maybe he saw the damage that the gambling

[48:18] did to the individuals that he sold his gambling things to when he was younger in Texas.

[48:23] Didn't want to do it.

[48:25] Amusement games only.

[48:27] And game and companies like Bali were shooting the lights out.

[48:30] Isn't that right?

[48:31] Yeah, Bali was like gambling.

[48:33] Yeah.

[48:34] All in.

[48:35] But that was when the Johnson Act would change everything.

[48:40] Many companies struggled to keep a float during this time.

[48:44] But since Gottlieb wasn't in the slot machine or games of chance business like Bingo, they

[48:50] actually weathered quite well.

[48:53] And it was because David being very conservative with his management style.

[48:58] He didn't focus on too many different ventures.

[49:02] He focused on amusement games.

[49:04] And the Johnson Act was in 1952.

[49:07] It was the absolute right decision to make because the government changed the goalpost

[49:12] when it came to gambling machines.

[49:14] But by 19, so by 1956 production numbers of pinball, five ball pinball machines had jumped

[49:21] back to the tip top and they were away the industry leader.

[49:28] Who's Judd Weinberg?

[49:31] I don't know.

[49:32] It says I don't know where else this fits in.

[49:35] That's right.

[49:36] So I'm going to stick it in here.

[49:39] So Judd Weinberg, he was the husband of Marjorie Gottlieb, David's sister.

[49:46] And he worked in their father's clothing company after he graduated from university in

[49:53] 1947.

[49:54] So he's fairly young, dude.

[49:57] Judd joined Gottlieb in 1952.

[50:00] David Gottlieb was delighted to have his son-in-law join the company where he was tasked with building

[50:07] some pinball machines.

[50:09] Now Judd Weinberg super, super important to the growth and development of D Gottlieb

[50:19] in Coalmost as strong as David Gottlieb himself.

[50:24] Judd joins Gottlieb.

[50:26] It's coming together.

[50:28] They're building like a management team, right?

[50:29] They're building like an actual kind of scaled company, people with rather than trying to do

[50:35] all things.

[50:36] David need to bring experts in from other individuals sort of talents and continue to expand the business.

[50:42] When David got to the point where he did no longer was able or willing or wanted to run

[50:47] the day-to-day of D Gottlieb and Coalven took over more and more of those operations.

[50:55] Judd would join him as the president of the company.

[50:59] Judd skills were perfectly complement Alvin's who was more of a hands-on engineer or salesy

[51:05] guy.

[51:06] He needed somebody to actually run the plant smoothly and do all of the budgeting and numbers.

[51:14] Does that make a lot of sense?

[51:17] Judd would pass away in February of 2020 at the age of 93.

[51:23] Could we all only get to 93?

[51:25] It depends what kind of shape we're in when we're 93.

[51:28] My knees, not a big deal.

[51:29] My mind, please let me still have that.

[51:32] Let's wind it all the way back again.

[51:33] Let's get, now we're in the late 50s.

[51:36] What's your favorite part of the late 50s?

[51:38] I wasn't alive, so I can't really say my favorite part was.

[51:43] The Yankees were really good there.

[51:45] Yeah, you can think about back in the day, right?

[51:48] How great it was in the late 50s?

[51:52] Wasn't that the time that back to the future was?

[51:56] I think that was 1955 in the movie.

[51:59] Oh, okay, so it was mid-50s.

[52:02] Mid-50s.

[52:03] Well, David Gottlieb started plans to build a hospital.

[52:08] A hospital.

[52:09] Yeah, he's moved out of kind of the day-to-day of the pinball manufacturing thing.

[52:15] He's got all this money.

[52:17] He's got the money he inherited and grew.

[52:19] He's got the money from the business.

[52:20] What's he going to do?

[52:21] He's going to build a hospital.

[52:23] This hospital is known as Gottlieb Memorial Hospital.

[52:27] Michael Gottlieb, the grandson of David Gottlieb, has some thoughts on that.

[52:32] My grandfather came from nothing.

[52:34] He made more money than he ever conceived of.

[52:36] And once he had enough to take care of his family, he pretty much just gave the rest

[52:39] away.

[52:40] Instead of just giving it away and running a check and not paying any attention to it,

[52:44] he thought it'd be really good to give back to the community.

[52:47] My dad, Alvin, was physically the guy watching the foundation, and he was flying around

[52:51] the United States interviewing doctors.

[52:54] He kind of built that whole thing from the ground up.

[52:56] The family is coming together.

[52:57] They're given back.

[52:58] I don't know if that's ingrained within society quite as much as it was sort of in the

[53:04] late 50s.

[53:05] David and Richard Weinberg, they were Juds III boys.

[53:10] They've all been involved in the Gottlieb hospital system right up to even the early 2000s.

[53:20] Michael's cousin, whose name is Peter Gottlieb, he's also involved in that.

[53:24] So the whole family is still involved in this Gottlieb hospital.

[53:30] So let's give a tip of the hat, Ron.

[53:32] Tip of the hat.

[53:33] Build in the hospital.

[53:34] Now in Canada, it's different because we have single-payer healthcare.

[53:38] We don't have people that build hospitals and hire doctors and create a company.

[53:42] So it's a bit alien to me that way.

[53:44] But wow, what an awesome way to give back.

[53:48] 1960, right?

[53:50] 5960.

[53:52] So Alvin Gottlieb, he would also design a few games in the 1960s.

[53:57] So we talked about November of 1960.

[53:59] His first game was called Get This Flipper, terrible name, unless it's about the dolphin.

[54:05] Oh, God.

[54:06] I think there's a game called Bumper, too, or something.

[54:09] So we're looking at Flipper here.

[54:11] Oh, no, not about the dolphin.

[54:13] That's a fail.

[54:14] So it was 1100 units.

[54:16] Alvin Gottlieb did the concept.

[54:18] And he worked with Wayne Nions on designing the game because Wayne Nions, a brilliant, we talked

[54:23] about him in the Centurion pinball centurion episode.

[54:28] Art was by Roy Parker.

[54:30] Why was this a big deal for Gottlieb and Alvin?

[54:35] You know what I mean?

[54:36] When we sort of look at this game, they've had the Flipper for years.

[54:40] We talked about that.

[54:42] We've had the back box.

[54:44] They've had, you know, it's score reels.

[54:47] But there's something very, very special about this game that made it a big, big deal.

[54:57] It's a wedge head.

[54:58] Ah, you spoke about it.

[55:00] You said wedge head before.

[55:01] So what did we say wedge head?

[55:02] What do we actually mean?

[55:03] It's just the shape of the back box head, that the back box.

[55:06] It's wider at the top and then it narrows down as it goes into the cabinet.

[55:13] Yeah, it's quite literally the head of the pinball machine is in the shape of a wedge.

[55:19] And then there's the reverse wedge that some manufacturers had or the opposite.

[55:23] Right.

[55:24] Where it was really narrowed.

[55:25] Yeah, it got wider.

[55:26] Now when you aesthetically look at it, the Gottlieb version is much more pleasing to the eye.

[55:31] Is it not?

[55:32] It is very pleasing.

[55:33] Where the other one just looks weird.

[55:36] And it's the same thing.

[55:37] It's just flipped upside down.

[55:38] I don't understand why it's different.

[55:40] So what does Wayne Nions say about the wedge head?

[55:42] He says, when the games came on location, we sued her to complaints about side by side

[55:48] games.

[55:49] It was hard to keep the games in line and separated so that there was room for two pairs of hands.

[55:53] I believe that Doc, who was Roman F. Doc Garbark, the head of mechanical engineering

[55:58] at Gottlieb, came up with a wedge head design.

[56:01] It was cheaper for us to spend a little more money on the cabinet than to buy a larger

[56:06] glass, more artwork, screens, etc.

[56:09] It was a new look, a win-win deal for us.

[56:12] I don't know hung the name wedge head on the design, but it's very descriptive.

[56:16] You're playing next to each other.

[56:17] You got a row of like four or five pinball machines.

[56:20] Your hands are all rubbing together like not now because it's a wedge head because now

[56:24] the back boxes can be touching, but you'll have room between the games.

[56:28] Ah, so smart.

[56:31] So this is that continuous innovation that David Gottlieb had sort of built into the

[56:36] culture of Gottlieb.

[56:38] It wasn't, you know, he wasn't there making the decisions like, you're named to make

[56:41] this.

[56:42] It was just ingrained in their culture to always be looking for improvement.

[56:45] Yeah, the wedge head wasn't the only thing.

[56:48] This is a groundbreaking pin for Gottlieb.

[56:51] A new concept.

[56:52] Let's see the flyer.

[56:53] I wonder if they trademarked it.

[56:55] Is the trademark done the flyer?

[56:56] Did they put a little TM?

[56:57] Now they didn't.

[56:59] Introducing Audible.

[57:02] A revolutionary type of extended play.

[57:05] New Audible feature coupled with bold, futuristic styling and hard coat wear resistant playboard

[57:11] finish.

[57:12] Yeah, I met resistant, scored an instant success and comprehensive field tests.

[57:17] A skillful player operation adds an unlimited number of balls to each game.

[57:23] If I was an operator, I'd be like unlimited.

[57:25] I don't know if I like that.

[57:27] I hate skill players.

[57:29] Skill players cost me money.

[57:30] But yeah, you do something skillfully and you get another ball.

[57:34] An Audible.

[57:35] Yes.

[57:36] An Audible.

[57:37] So, Flipper was the first Audible machine and that introduced the concept of this extended

[57:43] play.

[57:44] So, until this game was made, David Gottlieb was of the firm opinion that they will never

[57:50] replace the free play game attraction thing, which was you'd get enough points and you

[57:57] hit a couple of things and bam, you get a free game.

[57:59] There was no way you were going to add anything else to that.

[58:04] But this was something totally different.

[58:08] See, Alvin says after David, David Gottlieb played Wayne's first finished production model,

[58:14] he decided to try to get it approved in some foreign markets where a free play was considered

[58:19] a thing of value that made it part of gambling.

[58:22] Oh, God, you gave me this to say.

[58:24] Ha!

[58:25] Surin, Fagion's Mondial Company managed to get it approved in France and Italy and the

[58:31] rest of this history.

[58:32] So you get around laws now.

[58:34] Like you're not winning a free game, it's just another ball.

[58:37] You're adding another ball.

[58:39] The ball is not a thing of value.

[58:42] So we're kind of playing in a bit of a gray area there, but it's also a bit silly to

[58:46] think that a free play could be gambling, but whatever.

[58:50] This Surin, Fagion's Mondial Company, that's going to be very important in our next part

[58:57] two of the ball.

[58:59] But we'll get to that some of the time.

[59:03] Gottlieb also got into pool tables.

[59:05] Yeah, did you know that?

[59:06] I actually know.

[59:07] This is the first time I had heard of that.

[59:09] Yeah, this was in one of the interviews I'd heard.

[59:11] It didn't work out too well.

[59:13] Have you ever seen any?

[59:15] I've never seen a Gottlieb pool table.

[59:17] Okay.

[59:18] So give me a little context as to what's going on here.

[59:22] Well, they ventured into pool tables.

[59:24] It was a disaster.

[59:26] It's all the Gottlieb's if you're going to do something, do it right or not at all.

[59:29] So multi-million dollar mess, but they still made money maybe 15K.

[59:34] They lost.

[59:36] They spent millions of dollars in the made 15 grand.

[59:38] Yeah.

[59:39] Let's tie this back to what David Gottlieb's philosophy was.

[59:45] Focus on one thing and Alvin's kind of coming in and him and Judd, right?

[59:51] So, you know, David Gottlieb is sort of slowly moving out of the picture.

[59:55] Alvin and Judd are kind of moving into the picture and they came up with, let's get

[59:58] distracted by pool tables.

[01:00:01] Boy, oh boy, they learned if you can't do it 100% get out.

[01:00:07] But that's still around this time is when the positive momentum returns like a rocket

[01:00:12] ship to Gottlieb by 1961 things had turned around into a serious positive market.

[01:00:19] By 1967, Gottlieb had to move plants a few times to keep up with production because they

[01:00:26] had to continue to modernize their production processes.

[01:00:30] From the front to the back, they started to design everything with receiving, manufacturing,

[01:00:36] shipping, end to end.

[01:00:38] All materials coming in one end, machines going out the other.

[01:00:42] So this is when we get into the real manufacturing boom of the 1960s in the United States.

[01:00:50] Innovation is bleeding through society.

[01:00:52] Seeing some of their factory pictures from like the early 70s, they're too clean.

[01:00:59] It's mind boggling.

[01:01:00] How can you have anything that clean and you're making games there?

[01:01:03] Especially when the games that you're making are like, there's tons of cabling and wires

[01:01:09] and wire cutting and this and that, right?

[01:01:13] It was pretty wild.

[01:01:14] We spoke a lot about this sort of process around System 1, Gottlieb.

[01:01:22] We're skipping a lot of time now.

[01:01:23] We're going right to, we're into 70s all of a sudden.

[01:01:27] So if you want to learn all about that 70s, I'm sorry, the 60s, the 70s, the 70s,

[01:01:33] we've got our other Gottlieb episodes.

[01:01:37] I'm also still working on our wedgehead episode, which is primarily focused in this sort of section.

[01:01:44] So yes, I am going to jump ahead in time here to the next sort of major milestone

[01:01:52] within the Gottlieb company's history.

[01:01:55] And what is that next major milestone?

[01:01:58] The sale to Columbia Pictures.

[01:02:00] Sale to Columbia Pictures.

[01:02:02] Now why did D Gottlieb and Co sell to Columbia Pictures?

[01:02:07] Do they have money issues?

[01:02:08] Were things in the tank?

[01:02:11] What do you think?

[01:02:12] See, yeah, I've never heard a concrete reason from anyone in the know about why that happened.

[01:02:17] And I've looked.

[01:02:19] Yeah, it's so weird.

[01:02:20] It's, it's, I don't know why.

[01:02:24] I've looked in the pinball compendium.

[01:02:26] I've looked online.

[01:02:27] I've looked, I've gone through YouTube, old YouTube, like videos talking to Wayne Nions

[01:02:34] and all of those guys.

[01:02:36] But nobody can come out and say, you know, Alvin Gottlieb just got tired.

[01:02:40] Like they were hurting in any way.

[01:02:41] They were still, this was pre-solid state they got sold.

[01:02:46] Yeah, that's the thing.

[01:02:47] They were, they were the kings.

[01:02:49] I mean, from the 60s into the early 70s, I mean, they're the Cadillac of the industry.

[01:02:56] And it's like, I understand like, oh, maybe they're too busy with the hospital stuff.

[01:03:00] Maybe they're, maybe they, maybe his heart just isn't in it anymore.

[01:03:04] You know, maybe Alvin's kids are too young to sort of take over.

[01:03:08] Or maybe he doesn't want to be on the road.

[01:03:10] Like I haven't heard any answers.

[01:03:13] And it's kind of annoying because there's like this black hole spit, a bit in this kind of part of history.

[01:03:19] If you know, or you've talked to anybody, or you have a primary source,

[01:03:23] not my brother's uncle's cousin's former roommate told me that he wants to talk to David Gottlieb.

[01:03:28] No, like I need like it written down or some primary source to really put a nice button on this.

[01:03:35] But I did reach out to Dave Marston.

[01:03:37] And do you know who Dave Marston is?

[01:03:39] Dave Marston has been to every single pinball expo ever.

[01:03:42] He's a New England guy.

[01:03:44] He has, he has a vanity license plate that says pinball without,

[01:03:49] when Al won for the eye or anything, like it literally is pinball.

[01:03:53] So you know, he got that thing a long time ago.

[01:03:55] He is, he's one of the organizers of fantastic New England.

[01:03:59] Yep.

[01:03:59] And he, I would say he's, I would say I'm an amateur historian, right?

[01:04:04] Like I, you know, I look all this stuff up and collate all these things.

[01:04:07] I would probably say that he's like one level up for me.

[01:04:09] I wouldn't say he's like, he's not like a university professor in his story.

[01:04:14] He's, he's, he's be close.

[01:04:15] I mean, he was an operator.

[01:04:17] Right.

[01:04:17] But he knows whatever.

[01:04:19] Yes.

[01:04:19] He knows what's up.

[01:04:20] He's been in every friggin expo since what was in 1985 was the first one.

[01:04:25] Yes.

[01:04:25] And it's going to be the 40th one this year.

[01:04:28] It's going to be exciting.

[01:04:29] But what Dave says without consulting sources and resources, I can offer

[01:04:34] well informed theories.

[01:04:36] I do not think that they had a money crunch because they had already invested

[01:04:39] in it's system one just to get the company to the point that it would be

[01:04:42] saleable.

[01:04:44] They may have been intimidated by further investing to develop video games in

[01:04:47] house.

[01:04:48] I think Alvin was more interested in expanding the Gottlieb hospital,

[01:04:51] which had been the beneficiary of family donations for years already.

[01:04:55] Combine that with Alvin's background as an electro mechanical guy.

[01:04:59] And he probably saw the business becoming less fun.

[01:05:02] Then factor in licenses, which made the acquisition by Columbia pictures

[01:05:06] and especially good fit as they owned one of the world's largest licensing

[01:05:09] agencies.

[01:05:10] You just make note that the Gottlieb's did not really

[01:05:12] wish management on the day they sold.

[01:05:14] So Dave is just saying like he's making some well informed theories,

[01:05:18] which is speculation.

[01:05:20] But his speculation I think is kind of in line with most people

[01:05:25] speculate.

[01:05:26] And he's had conversations with people, right?

[01:05:28] So yeah, the hospital is kind of a big focus.

[01:05:31] Investing in video games and all end and these new system one systems is

[01:05:36] probably terrifying for a lot of these management folks.

[01:05:39] The thing is they sold it before they even had an electronic.

[01:05:44] Before it was done.

[01:05:45] Yeah, because I remember I think there's an EM called Big Hit.

[01:05:50] And I remember seeing it and it has the Gottlieb and company,

[01:05:53] but then it has, you know,

[01:05:54] subsidiary or whatever Columbia pictures on it.

[01:05:56] Like, wow, I always thought that was like that came along with the electronic era.

[01:06:03] Like there were no EMs that actually said that, but there are.

[01:06:06] Yeah, it's a precarious time because I think you and I and other people romanticize

[01:06:12] about this time period.

[01:06:13] Like, oh man, Gottlieb was so great and their games in this era were so fun and innovative

[01:06:19] and their drop targets were so effectively built and all those things.

[01:06:22] And then they just sort of disappeared, right?

[01:06:24] They kind of slowly kind of.

[01:06:27] Oh, I remember our system one episode.

[01:06:30] They did pretty good at the beginning.

[01:06:32] Yeah.

[01:06:34] Then they bled and then they ended up being premiered.

[01:06:37] And then because now they've got corporate.

[01:06:39] Well, they had lower.

[01:06:40] Columbia then they had coca coca cola.

[01:06:42] And then they became myelstar with coca cola.

[01:06:46] The employees bought it back.

[01:06:48] Thank God to give us more years.

[01:06:50] Right.

[01:06:51] Then the Mondale group comes in and then their premier technology, I was like, it's just,

[01:06:56] they just lost that former glory.

[01:06:59] I did find one quote from Alvin Gottlieb, which is a bit cryptic, but maybe you can read

[01:07:05] between the lines as to his thought process at the time.

[01:07:08] Alvin said, we had been operating the business for all those years.

[01:07:12] We got to a point where my brother, law and I discussed the situation.

[01:07:16] We thought it was about time that we could take it easy after that.

[01:07:19] A friend of his managed to come up with the Columbia deal.

[01:07:22] The numbers were good.

[01:07:24] They treated the people properly.

[01:07:26] At that point, I was pretty much done.

[01:07:28] I was quite busy being a daddy to Mike and Joe and enjoying that very much.

[01:07:33] Yeah.

[01:07:34] His heart was no longer in it.

[01:07:36] I mean, when businesses get to a certain point, Ron, they get so big that to sell

[01:07:42] them to somebody and get money for that sale becomes really, really difficult, especially

[01:07:50] in this era when we're getting into like corporate tax law and IRS rules and things like that.

[01:07:57] Things are getting really complicated.

[01:07:59] So to sell the business and get money out, it's going to be really hard to do that.

[01:08:04] The other thing is I heard a stat the other day, which was really cool, Ron, that only

[01:08:09] 10% of businesses transitioned from one generation to the next.

[01:08:16] And only 3% of those businesses, 3% of those 10% businesses make it from the second generation

[01:08:23] to the third generation of ownership.

[01:08:26] Did you know that?

[01:08:27] I did not know that.

[01:08:28] It's very cool stat.

[01:08:29] So this is a great example of that, right?

[01:08:31] Like they survived to the next generation being David to Alvin.

[01:08:34] But then to go to the next generation, there's only a 3% chance of that, which is pretty

[01:08:41] wild.

[01:08:42] Did you know Alvin stayed on with Kotley for a five-year management contract and continued

[01:08:46] working through that period?

[01:08:48] He even stayed, even stayed until Columbia sold to Coca-Cola in 1981.

[01:08:52] So he stuck around because he was, it's still a family company, right?

[01:08:57] It was still family run.

[01:08:59] The management was still family, although they had a corporate overlord.

[01:09:03] The biggest thing with business transition is if the owner of that business just disappears.

[01:09:09] If they disappear, Alvin probably had all the relationships with the distributors, right?

[01:09:15] Everybody says, oh, Alvin, he's the greatest.

[01:09:17] He buys his drinks whenever he comes down to, you know, to, comes over to Detroit.

[01:09:23] You know, if you've got those relationships and then Alvin just disappears, that's a risk

[01:09:27] to the sale of your business.

[01:09:28] So he's got to stick around regardless.

[01:09:30] Then we get into the change from got-leaved to myelstar.

[01:09:33] Well, Alvin says, when Coca-Cola bought out Columbia, things changed.

[01:09:39] Coca-Cola was one of those mega corporations where you have to have a meeting, to have

[01:09:44] a meeting, to decide to have a meeting.

[01:09:46] Now that wasn't exactly our management style.

[01:09:49] Yeah.

[01:09:50] So things are starting to get messy now, right?

[01:09:53] Like, things, this is when things really start to change.

[01:09:57] We get into, we get into this sort of discussion around the sort of future of pinball, the future

[01:10:09] of got-leaved in one of our other episodes, which is the ADB era.

[01:10:17] And we also talk about myelstar in one of our other episodes, which escapes me at the

[01:10:21] moment.

[01:10:22] But it'll...

[01:10:23] It was probably our way Nyan's episode.

[01:10:24] Yeah.

[01:10:25] It's probably around there.

[01:10:26] You want to check out silverballcronicles.com.

[01:10:30] You can click on the archive and the show notes there.

[01:10:33] You can see all of those previous episodes.

[01:10:35] Because Ron, this is episode 41.

[01:10:37] And I can't remember a friggin' thing.

[01:10:39] Not me neither.

[01:10:41] But that brings this episode to a close.

[01:10:45] David got-leaved was an absolute, just miracle man for our hobby.

[01:10:54] And he has left a massive legacy forever and ever.

[01:11:01] What do you think?

[01:11:02] I agree.

[01:11:03] What is your favorite old school sort of pre-mile star got?

[01:11:10] Oh.

[01:11:11] Hmm.

[01:11:12] Which one do you really enjoy?

[01:11:14] I like several, honestly.

[01:11:15] I like 2001.

[01:11:17] Good one.

[01:11:18] Also known as Dimension, I think, is the other version.

[01:11:22] The Audible version.

[01:11:23] Oh, there you go.

[01:11:24] Let's see.

[01:11:25] 70s ones, far out.

[01:11:29] Oh, I love far out.

[01:11:31] That's a good one.

[01:11:32] Volley.

[01:11:33] Volley's a big one.

[01:11:34] Volley's good.

[01:11:35] They knew their EMs, man.

[01:11:36] They did.

[01:11:37] Now, remember, we'll have a part two of Meet the God Leaves where we'll cover everything

[01:11:39] kind of from myelstar all the way up.

[01:11:42] And then we'll also talk about that weird adventure that Alvin and Michael Godleaved would

[01:11:47] get into in the 90s.

[01:11:49] Oh.

[01:11:50] Alvin G.

[01:11:51] Where they couldn't use their own name.

[01:11:52] They literally could not use their own name.

[01:11:54] Oh.

[01:11:55] Sorry.
