[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:16] By golly it's bingo. Isn't it swell? Is it the 30s voice? Yeah we're gonna do the 1920s guy. No.

[00:30] Hello everyone I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me this month and every month is Ron.

[00:40] Tell it to Sweeney Hallet.

[00:44] What's up fella? Hello. Tell it to Sweeney. I don't get that. 1920 slang which means that you're full of crap. Okay you're not gonna talk like that the whole episode are you? Only in specific and

[00:56] area because this is one of the few times where I can crack out my 1920s voice. What you've been up to? Not much.

[01:05] That much you've been playing pinball. A little bit. I'm gonna do it again. I'm gonna do it again. I'm gonna do it again.

[01:13] I'm gonna do it again in specific areas because this is one of the few times where I can crack out my 1920s voice. What you've been up to? Not much.

[01:23] Not much you've been playing pinball. A little bit. A little bit of Elton John. Very nice. A little announcement from John Wick. You're a big John Wick fan.

[01:33] I like the first movie. I did. I've seen them all. I enjoy them all. I think the first one is borderline masterpiece. It's so good.

[01:42] It's so different and exciting. As a movie person, a person really likes films. I love the cinematography. I love the camera. It's just great. Just so wonderful.

[01:54] I just like that. He shoots everyone in the head. That's a good one. Wow. Why didn't I think of this? Just everyone in the head. Then you're just guaranteed death.

[02:01] Yeah. Everybody's always shooting everybody here. I don't understand it. You see only when it gets it right.

[02:06] Yeah. But I mean, I think the pinball machine looks pretty cool. Very exciting from Elliott.

[02:12] Aizmann, who's one of the mechanical engineers over at Stern. I think in the past we might have, or maybe I,

[02:18] threw a little bit of shade towards him on some of his mechs and things like that. But I really like the way that John Wick looks.

[02:26] I think it's a really great game right out of the gate. I'm looking forward to playing it. Probably not until next year. Fantastic.

[02:35] What? You don't have any locations that would have that. Absolutely. No. I live in a pinball desert here in the eastern canon. It's quite depressing.

[02:47] The one that I'm very excited for though, fun house remake. Now that's something I'm going to keep my eye on because a couple of things.

[02:54] One is love Rudy. Love fun house. Probably I think Pat Lawler's best game. No. I think so.

[03:02] And also made by the Italians and everything made by Italians. Fantastic quality. Super excited. What do you think?

[03:10] I like fun house better than fun house. But yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, we're what two minutes in here. Two minutes in.

[03:18] Hey, you already got a weird accent. It just throws me off.

[03:22] Matt, here we go. Show notes. Got all these weird misspellings. All these extra use everywhere. I don't I don't understand.

[03:29] Show notes. Show notes.

[03:32] Well, I mean, I'm pretty excited for all the goings on here in the hobby at the moment. It is we're getting through.

[03:38] We're kind of in that post pandemic. I think era now. It's very nice to see things kind of becoming a little more normal in pinball, little more exciting.

[03:48] And the breadth of people manufacturing pinball is pretty exciting.

[05:04] Ron, you have some silver ball chronicles t shirts soft luxurious.

[05:09] Yeah, my dad does one too. I told them make sure he gets the one that says Ron first on it and the names.

[05:14] That's right. I should get him one that specifically has like Ron crossed out.

[05:18] Really put a smile. If you just want a t shirt though, you can swing on over to silver ball swag. You can click on the silver ball chronicles link and there you go.

[05:29] We have been very active in our mail bag this last month. Ron, have you seen these emails come flying in?

[05:37] I have.

[05:38] Every now and then we got to get this flurry of emails. It seems like everybody is interested in sending us an email. But then there's like a couple of months go by where it's like radio silence and I wonder if anybody is listening.

[05:48] Let's talk about Ben.

[05:50] Hi, Ben.

[05:51] Oh, I can read it. Is this from Ben Kenobi? It could be. He didn't put his last name.

[05:55] It says hi, Ron and David.

[05:56] No, no, it says hi, Ron and David.

[05:58] Okay. Oh, yes, exclamation point. Hi, Ron and David. I love your podcast.

[06:03] Now I'm on my way through all the episodes for the second time. Wow. There's so much information and amazing history to learn and I really enjoyed on my drive to and from work.

[06:13] I love spending time with Ron at T.P.F on the show floor and had fun hearing his impressions and knowledge in person.

[06:20] I still feel I still feel horrible about my dogs during our breakfast trial and hope you enjoyed the rest of the weekend.

[06:27] He was in the room next to us in his dogs parked.

[06:29] J.J.P. Selton John will always have a special place in my heart now. Keep up the great work.

[06:36] I don't get to a lot of shows. I'm really busy and I got a lot of young children.

[06:41] Lot. I have two young children.

[06:43] So like I'm doing all the children stuff. So I don't get out as much. So it's always exciting to know that Ron, you're holding the flag for silver ball chronicles.

[06:52] That flag of course has Ron's name first on it.

[06:56] I played Ben's really loud and up knock just Batman forever.

[06:59] Oh, okay. That's great.

[07:01] Multiball. Multiball. Multiball.

[07:03] Yeah. Okay. Well, I got I got an email here from Mark S and he's also working on our back catalog of episodes.

[07:11] Just started to listen and catching up on the old episodes on the Stern episode right now.

[07:17] I was cringing at the moments of I was cringing at the comments on quick silver.

[07:23] It's all good, but that game is the best game of all time and I love the art package.

[07:29] Things are subjective, I guess, but it's all good.

[07:32] I must have been you insulting it or something.

[07:34] It was. I thought a quick silver is overrated because if I walk down my stairs to my basement, it's like right there staring at me.

[07:42] So I know it wasn't me.

[07:44] When you sleep in your basement, is that the one you sleep under?

[07:47] No, I sleep on the couch. That's in my basement.

[07:50] Okay. Actually, that is quite a company.

[07:53] And then we've also got one from Alec.

[07:56] Wait, am an Alec as an Alec Guinness Ben Kenobi.

[07:59] This is amazing. He says, hey guys, obligatory. Love the podcast.

[08:05] I've been binging it up the last few weeks and as I listen, I have pin side, IPDB and pinball map pulled up so I can visualize each pin you talk about and find somewhere to play the ones that interest me the most.

[08:17] I'm off to play Circus Voltaire 2.5 hours away in the next couple of weeks.

[08:22] Oh, I thought it was like Circus Voltaire 2.5.

[08:25] I was like, is that a new kid that I didn't see?

[08:28] It's probably made by the Italian.

[08:30] For example, John Papaduit games seem to call to me.

[08:33] I'm putting money aside to snag it tails of the Arabian nights someday.

[08:37] Also, somewhat hoping for a Chicago games remake though.

[08:41] Oh, maybe Pajretti at this point.

[08:44] As a software engineer, I melted down when in one of the pinball's dying episodes, you said junior engineers got assigned to coding pinball at Valley Williams.

[08:53] So jealous.

[08:54] I can't imagine doing something that fun slash engaging as a junior engineer.

[08:59] Usually I had to just change file names and do data analysis.

[09:02] Thanks for the content, Alec.

[09:04] Yes, I think we met Alec at Pintastic.

[09:07] I'm pretty sure this is the fellow we met in the tournament room.

[09:10] He's wearing one of our shirts.

[09:11] It's very possible.

[09:12] Yes, I gave him a little container of maple syrup.

[09:18] Oh, sure.

[09:19] Did know we were going with that.

[09:21] Yeah, he could take a little piece of me home with him or a thousand little pieces.

[09:25] We also had another Ben who emailed us.

[09:28] Different Ben?

[09:29] Different Ben.

[09:30] Oh, this one's cool because it talks about crawl.

[09:33] For switching back and forth at your turn.

[09:35] Oh, no, no.

[09:36] I want you to do this one.

[09:37] Oh, okay.

[09:38] Because I know what's coming.

[09:39] Hi, David and Ron.

[09:40] Hi, David.

[09:41] So it's in your podcast.

[09:42] And after being referred to you all from a friend, I'm finding it fascinating that I'm learning

[09:45] pinball history from you guys about things pinball related that I did not know that I thought

[09:49] I already knew as I've been into pinball for almost a decade.

[09:53] Can I please have two small frosties?

[09:55] I only have chocolate.

[09:56] Chocolate is great.

[09:57] That is all.

[09:58] Sorry.

[09:59] I was ordering Wendy's and my phone picked it up.

[10:03] Okay.

[10:04] I was immediately fascinated with the machines that were potentially great games that never

[10:07] made it into production for one reason or another.

[10:09] And I met through Pinsider from the same city.

[10:12] We collaborated, redesigned and built two copies of the crawl machine.

[10:16] It was a massive undertaking.

[10:17] Took over two years.

[10:19] You can check out that Pinside post.

[10:21] Yeah.

[10:22] Super cool.

[10:23] I crawl one of my weird movies that I really enjoyed when I was younger.

[10:28] Yeah.

[10:29] What's the space in that?

[10:31] The Amnesian is in it.

[10:33] Yeah.

[10:34] He's like a background guy.

[10:36] But you know what?

[10:37] The one thing I totally remember about that is.

[10:39] So when you watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from the 19, what is it?

[10:43] Say the things or whatever.

[10:45] There's a teacher character in there.

[10:47] And he's the teacher and he's telling them, oh, you got to do.

[10:53] How many chocolate bars did you eat?

[10:54] And they're doing like division infractions and stuff.

[10:57] That guy was also in crawl as one of the main characters.

[11:01] And every time I see Willy Wonka, I'm like, where the heck do I know this guy from?

[11:07] And it wasn't until Wikipedia was invented that I was able to figure that out.

[11:11] When I think of crawl, I think of the thingy, the thingy that they throw the disc thing.

[11:19] Yeah, yeah, it's like sharp knives.

[11:22] That's when I think of crawl.

[11:23] Super cool.

[11:24] And I think of the Fimall machine and that it just kept breaking constantly at expo.

[11:29] Yeah.

[11:30] So good for you, other than that is exciting.

[11:31] You can get it working, congrats, because that thing, that was a high end Pins restoration

[11:37] crawl and the thing just kept breaking over and over and over.

[11:41] You could see why they didn't go to production with it.

[11:43] It looked like a maintenance nightmare.

[11:45] Yeah.

[11:46] And I mean, black hole was bad enough.

[11:49] This thing, it has a huge, under, huge underneath play field, like second play field, but then

[11:54] it's got the weird refraction thing to make it look small.

[11:57] It's so weird.

[11:58] Rather than just making this small.

[12:00] We put this huge thing underneath here and we're going to make it look small.

[12:06] Try to get that by Gomez nowadays.

[12:08] He won't even let you put an upper play field in.

[12:13] Bingo just isn't the game you can play at the county fair or a sketchy gambling establishment.

[12:19] Bingo is also the big brother to days modern pinball.

[12:24] You'll remember we spoke about Bingo machines and the issues that they had in our brief history

[12:30] of pinball episode.

[12:32] But we figure that Bingo actually needs its own episode.

[12:37] I mean, come on.

[12:38] We gave Roger Sharp two freaking episodes.

[12:41] Why can't we give Bingo one?

[12:43] I agree.

[12:45] Now have you ever played Bingo?

[12:49] I've played Bingo, but I haven't played Bingo.

[12:55] Like I've played a Bingo machine like of the pinball variant.

[13:00] But I've played the game where it's B10.

[13:04] Yes.

[13:05] And you stand there.

[13:06] I played that once with basically my grandmother.

[13:11] They were babysitting for me.

[13:13] So they brought me out to their Bingo game.

[13:15] Really?

[13:16] Yeah.

[13:17] Bingo is I think a bigger thing where I'm at here in Eastern Canada for some reason.

[13:22] Like when you're a kid, you play Bingo in school or...

[13:24] Oh, there's Bingo.

[13:25] And we go.

[13:26] Bingo was for old ladies.

[13:28] That's basically...

[13:29] Which already people play in Bingo.

[13:32] And they'd have like my aunt.

[13:33] She would have 10 of the cards like she would get.

[13:36] And she's like, did she have her own stamp?

[13:38] She had a little stamper.

[13:39] Oh, yeah.

[13:40] Oh, yeah.

[13:41] Oh, yeah.

[13:42] Hardcore.

[13:43] Wow.

[13:44] That's a big deal.

[13:45] Did she have a specific color?

[13:46] Did she have a lot of colors?

[13:48] That I don't know.

[13:49] Like purple.

[13:50] I just know that at Fun Spot in New Hampshire.

[13:56] I love Love of Her just R.K.s out there.

[13:58] There's a Bingo right next to the main building.

[14:03] Yeah.

[14:04] And that's when you get...

[14:05] Like when you're at that thing, that's...

[14:06] Okay, well let's get...

[14:07] Let's talk about Bingo machines.

[14:08] All Bingo machines, yes.

[14:09] I mean...

[14:10] Yeah, yeah.

[14:11] This is what the episode is about.

[14:12] Nobody wasn't here about our grandmother's playing Bingo.

[14:14] For God's sake.

[14:15] But I do want to draw some attention here to this one.

[14:18] I have almost zero...

[14:20] I have zero experience with Bingo machines.

[14:24] I probably have five percent.

[14:25] I've never even seen where it's...

[14:27] I have seen them.

[14:28] Yes.

[14:29] Yeah.

[14:30] So the bar here, everybody who's listening, very low.

[14:33] There's going to be a lot of things we don't get right here.

[14:36] But I wanted to say that most of the research in this episode comes from Nick Baldridge.

[14:41] And people will know his name because he's popped up quite a bit in the pinball hobby.

[14:47] But I've used pieces from his for amusement only podcast.

[14:51] I've also had some correspondence back and forth with Nick asking some questions.

[14:57] And the issue with Bingo is it is fairly complex, which is what makes it an exciting

[15:03] playing experience.

[15:05] And it's very difficult to sort of draw that out, not having a whole lot of knowledge

[15:10] or experience.

[15:13] That being said, Nick totally offered all of his time to give me a phone call, to discuss

[15:18] and review.

[15:20] And I didn't take him up on any of that.

[15:23] Wow.

[15:24] I just was like, can you send me a paragraph on how this works?

[15:28] And he sent me like a huge bit like three paragraphs.

[15:30] He's like, well, I can't really fit it into a sentence.

[15:32] And I'm like, okay, and he just kind of gave me a whole paragraph.

[15:35] And then I read it and I'm like, oh, I don't get any of this because I am kind of dumb.

[15:39] So, but I hope that Nick realizes that his podcast, the for amusement podcast,

[15:51] isn't entirely about Bingo machines, but he tries to stick in a little bit there.

[15:57] But Nick absolutely is the modern resource for all Bingo machines, Woodrail type pinball

[16:09] stuff.

[16:10] And his audio journaling has that he's been doing for years on this podcast insures that

[16:18] there is an amazing place for Bingo and the history of pinball machines that will be

[16:24] preserved for a very long time.

[16:27] He should take a lot of pride in what he has done for the hobby, even though I think most

[16:33] of our listeners may not know Nick Baldrige.

[16:37] Have you met Nick?

[16:38] Maybe.

[16:39] I don't know if I'm naked.

[16:40] He seems like the nicest guy, but probably in a seminar he did.

[16:44] Yeah.

[16:45] Seems like the nicest guy on the planet.

[16:48] So here's a summary from Nick about his, his for amusement only podcast.

[16:52] And I'll be the voice of Nick Baldrige.

[16:54] My podcast goes through each machine one by one and mostly chronological order so that

[16:58] the evolution can be noted as I got into reverse engineering the games I learned a lot more.

[17:03] When I did the same, when I did the same for the precursor one ball horse race games, even

[17:08] more came to life.

[17:10] There were two dueling luminaries in the Bingo space, Lynn Durant and Don Hooker, both

[17:16] creative engineering geniuses with different approaches to mechanical calculation, maintenance

[17:22] and styles of play.

[17:24] Gambling has been a part of pinball history forever and even exists today, dollar games.

[17:28] Bingo's whole great historical significance and the gameplay is really challenging and

[17:33] fun to boot.

[17:34] Okay, I'm kind of excited here.

[17:35] I'm really excited.

[17:37] So what really gets me excited is the the mesh of the way pinball is where it mixes art

[17:46] and engineering and physical play and mathematics and it jams that all together.

[17:51] But the historical context of that is what really excites me and that's why I do the

[17:57] podcast, which is really nerdy and really weird, that it's the history that is so significant

[18:02] with some of this stuff.

[18:04] And this is my kind of episode because I'm learning things that I didn't know and I'm

[18:08] seeing old machines and things that I didn't even know existed but are an important part

[18:14] of our hobby.

[18:16] And importantly, there will be flyers.

[18:18] There will be flyers.

[18:20] And there will be 1920s.

[18:23] That's right.

[18:24] But let's wind, let's wind it back.

[18:27] So time machine time, we get the time machine, we go back.

[18:30] So after the second world war, the technologies that were created during the war had really

[18:36] began to expand and then started to move kind of from the war effort into more of the

[18:43] individual or private company space, things like plastics, injection molding, computer systems,

[18:53] quote unquote, computer systems, right, with relays and all that stuff.

[18:57] Amusement devices really became much more common, but it was easier to distract yourself

[19:02] from the post war era.

[19:05] One ball machines were very popular and growing.

[19:08] So a one ball machine was you had one ball and it would kind of go up and bounce around

[19:13] on some pins and fall in a hole and that was kind of it.

[19:17] Usually you would play, you'd bring your high score to the attention of the barkeep or

[19:21] the pharmacist or whoever was working at the counter at the shop you were at where the

[19:26] one ball game was and you'd get like a store credit or you'd they'd buy you a drink

[19:32] or you'd get a cigarette or a couple of nickels back.

[19:35] So I picked this one out for you.

[19:37] This is Vic camp and if you could have a super New York accent, that would be great.

[19:40] I believe Vic is from New Jersey.

[19:42] So I don't know.

[19:44] I don't know.

[19:45] All right, unless you're just going to say they're all the same.

[19:49] Let's see, for me, you really wanted me to do like, you know, like for me playing on

[19:53] root was so exciting to make these numbers exactly.

[19:55] Exactly.

[19:56] No, I'm not doing that.

[19:57] No, no, no, no.

[19:59] For me playing on root was so exciting.

[20:02] To make these numbers, I love the pressure to move.

[20:04] The closer I got to five in a row, the more I knew I was going to make that number, try

[20:08] harder and harder to make these inline scores or hits, which we bingo players call them.

[20:13] Can you do those inline scores and hits?

[20:17] So it's like there's terms here.

[20:18] I don't even know.

[20:19] It's got its own language and it's exciting.

[20:25] Now usually these one ball games in that time were like horse race theme or sports themes

[20:32] because that was kind of the popular male thing back in the 1940s and 50s.

[20:42] I would argue sports betting along males is as strong as ever.

[20:47] Yeah, what yeah, now we're getting into what is it called?

[20:50] A dual one game.

[20:51] All that stuff.

[20:52] Yeah, not a sponsor of this podcast.

[20:55] No, so all of that stuff, that's pretty popular.

[20:58] It tends to be kind of a thing.

[21:01] Greg Smolish, one ball collector, began actively collecting wood rails in late 2012.

[21:09] Now he ended up following even deeper into a niche of horse race games after a couple

[21:16] of years in 2014.

[21:19] Now these are individuals that have been on the four amusement only podcasts, which is

[21:24] where I'm pulling a lot of these quotes.

[21:27] And Craig says, without a doubt, these credit machines were designed and functioned

[21:31] well beyond simple amusement for the player.

[21:34] Along cash being awarded by the business owner, advanced side betting prior to the start

[21:38] of another race was a regular activity among patrons.

[21:41] I mean, it's pretty obvious that this post-war era, a lot of these like bingo, let's call

[21:49] them one ball at this point, horse race sports games were specifically designed to be gambling

[21:55] to lose.

[21:56] Oh yeah.

[21:57] Right.

[21:58] So here's like a couple of examples.

[22:00] So one that popped up a lot through some of these podcasts was Genko.

[22:07] You said it right.

[22:08] It's very good.

[22:09] I know.

[22:10] I did.

[22:11] I worked on that.

[22:12] I know.

[22:13] I did.

[22:14] I worked on that.

[22:15] I would have been proud of you.

[22:16] Thank you, Steve.

[22:17] So wonderful.

[22:18] This also had the same game in 37 called auto derby, slightly different.

[22:22] This is kind of late Thursday.

[22:24] The game is home stretch.

[22:26] Yeah.

[22:27] Sorry.

[22:28] Home stretch.

[22:29] I'm going to look at here with this picture.

[22:31] It's like a very small tabletop kind of pinbally thing, right?

[22:35] Pinbally thing?

[22:36] Yes.

[22:37] It's a tabletop and it's got lots of horses.

[22:39] Yeah.

[22:40] It's got horses.

[22:42] They're racing.

[22:43] It's got what look like dead bumpers or pop bumpers that are sticking up that aren't

[22:48] actually pop bumpers.

[22:50] Those are like, they're like little baskets that catch the ball and it falls below the

[22:55] play field.

[22:56] I guess those are the points you get somehow.

[22:58] It's all about nudge in the ball, but you can see there's a shooter lane, right?

[23:01] The ball goes up to the top and bounces left to right like a lot of.

[23:04] I see cool horse horse artwork.

[23:07] Horses everywhere.

[23:08] Yeah.

[23:09] It is very, very cool, but this is really 1930s looking, right?

[23:14] Like really old school 1930s.

[23:16] Like this 1930s game really looks like a 1930s game.

[23:19] Now this, this has a billboard ad.

[23:24] It doesn't have a flyer.

[23:25] You want to read this one, Ron?

[23:28] Let's see, it's a mighty, it's, it's a mighty busy place filling orders.

[23:32] No, no, no, no, no.

[23:35] It's a mighty busy place filling orders for these two new novelty game hits.

[23:40] Humbstretch.

[23:41] An auto daily.

[23:42] A 70 for 50.

[23:44] Odeos today.

[23:45] It's a $74 and 50 cents for some reason.

[23:49] Okay.

[23:50] Maybe you can talk them down to 74.

[23:51] I don't know.

[23:52] These things were flying off the shelves back then, Ron.

[23:56] It's pretty cool.

[23:57] Check out IPDB and take a look at this.

[23:59] There's only a few photos because there's not a whole lot to it.

[24:02] But this was one that came up and I really thought that was, that was well worth the,

[24:08] the time to take a look at it.

[24:11] The other one here is also from the late 30s, 1938.

[24:16] This is, see biscuit.

[24:17] That was like a, you never see this game as Horses.

[24:20] Man, this horse.

[24:22] So famous.

[24:23] He got his own game.

[24:25] Actually, I think it was a Canadian trainer.

[24:27] I wonder if he got any residuals, the horse.

[24:30] I seriously doubt it.

[24:32] Oh, like he had a license.

[24:34] License?

[24:35] I don't like the license.

[24:36] License the horse.

[24:37] No, no, no, no, no.

[24:38] License for you.

[24:39] He turned it down.

[24:40] He turned it down.

[24:41] He's got a shamrock on it.

[24:42] Yeah, of course.

[24:43] He's lucky.

[24:44] Irish gimmick.

[24:45] Right.

[24:46] So it was, this is, so when I'm looking at the back glass here and it's got seven horses

[24:50] numbered one through seven.

[24:52] Really cool art.

[24:54] And then it has place, win show and purse, which are terms involved in gambling when it

[25:01] comes to horse racing.

[25:04] The play field, when we look at that, that is also really interesting.

[25:09] And it is really kind of unusual when you look at today's modern pinball and then bingo

[25:16] that would follow after.

[25:17] So you got one ball.

[25:19] It goes up, bounces off the top arch.

[25:22] And then it kind of comes down into one of these different areas.

[25:26] So the further down the play field that you can nudge the ball, the closer to a win you

[25:32] can get.

[25:33] You got to collect all the different numbers for all the different horses and it gets even

[25:39] higher for the replay value.

[25:41] Now, Valley Faremont, 1940.

[25:43] I want to see Biscuits one of the first license games, even though they have sure they

[25:47] didn't pay anything for it.

[25:48] Because the year looks like the year came out, Cbiscuit was voted American horse of the

[25:52] year or that year.

[25:53] American horse of the year.

[25:55] Who was American horse of the year this year?

[25:57] I don't know.

[25:58] Well, this year is not over yet.

[25:59] So probably last year.

[26:01] But I, that's interesting.

[26:03] So Cbiscuit was at the height of his popularity and they made a game featuring him.

[26:09] Cody's wish was horse of the year, last year in 2023.

[26:14] So shout out to Cody's wish, trained by William I.

[26:17] Cody's wish was probably not beginning his own game.

[26:20] No, no, he is licensing fees are too high.

[26:23] So Faremont by Valley as well, a one ball game looked very similar win place show, purse,

[26:31] one through seven really exciting back glass, right?

[26:36] It's classy.

[26:37] It's old.

[26:38] It really pulls on those.

[26:39] I wouldn't want to say nostalgia things, but this antiquey kind of artistic stuff.

[26:45] Now when we look at the pinball machine or the one ball machine by itself, look at

[26:49] the size of this thing.

[26:50] Well, the cabinet goes all the way to the floor.

[26:52] There's no legs per se.

[26:54] There's no legs.

[26:55] It's all wood.

[26:56] It's huge.

[26:58] It must weigh a million pounds.

[27:00] It kind of looks similar to the one that Elton John plays in Tommy.

[27:03] That kind of shape.

[27:04] Yeah, hey, you know what?

[27:06] I bet you that's probably where they got that from.

[27:08] That thing.

[27:09] And then there looks like in the photo here on IPDB, looks like an old Toyota or something

[27:13] in the background.

[27:14] Okay.

[27:15] Pretty cool stuff.

[27:18] All right.

[27:19] Yeah.

[27:20] So that's kind of cool.

[27:21] Take a look at those just so you can kind of get a visual understanding if you're driving

[27:25] don't.

[27:26] Now there's a really cool one ball article, which I will include in the show notes that

[27:32] you can kind of dive a little bit deeper into one ball games kind of from that late 30s

[27:37] early 40s.

[27:39] Bring it back to for amusement only podcast episode 54.

[27:45] Nick hosts a gentleman named Jeff Lotton, who is a bingo and one ball guru.

[27:52] Jeff free has been repairing wood rails and EM machines for decades.

[27:57] And he's even written articles in pin game journal.

[28:01] And Jeffrey says once you get the idea of what you're supposed to do, you need to keep

[28:05] the one ball moving so that you can get past the first couple of rows and get into place.

[28:10] Then if you're lucky, you can actually make a winner once in a while.

[28:13] If you don't shoot it right, it's done.

[28:16] It's gone before you realize the games are set up just like everything else at that time.

[28:20] There's certain holes that are designed to be very easy to go into and that whole almost

[28:23] never spots at the horse you need.

[28:26] Yeah.

[28:27] So you've got horses one through seven.

[28:29] You got to get specific holes for your specific horse.

[28:33] Right.

[28:34] And the idea is that it's not just your play in one game, right?

[28:38] So today in pinball, you put in your coin, you get three balls and some extra balls and you play in your play and you play.

[28:44] This one is specifically designed that you got to play it more than once to collectively put your card together.

[28:53] You need different numbers, different balls to continue to build your score.

[28:58] Now Steve Smith, he's also a big guru with wood rail and bingo.

[29:03] And also on that same podcast, he says, these were engineered to make money tying it back to where we first started here at post war era.

[29:13] We need some entertainment.

[29:14] These were gambling devices.

[29:17] No way around it.

[29:18] They were specifically designed to incentivize you to keep gambling.

[29:23] There was almost, there was some level of skill, but it was not for amusement.

[29:27] It was for return.

[29:30] So how do you actually play a one ball game?

[29:33] Now this, I'm probably going to get this wrong, but we're trying our best here.

[29:38] Oh sure, make me say the wrong thing.

[29:40] You put a nickel in and you have a four selection to get a ball.

[29:43] You get a random horse.

[29:45] So if you bring the ball up and set it before the plunger, you can put another nickel in and you can increase your odds, but will also change your horse selection.

[29:53] It was less about the single game and more about the multiple games together, like slots.

[29:58] So that's the thing is that you got to play a bunch of games and it moves your odds around based on what you're playing.

[30:06] Now I am very, are you a poker player?

[30:09] No, so I am not.

[30:11] A lot of people in pinball are poker people because pinball is very about mathematic and risk rewards and odds.

[30:19] And I don't have the short term brain capacity to be able to do that.

[30:25] Not really great at like mental math on the fly stuff like that.

[30:29] These types of games really play to people who are very good at that.

[30:34] And I bet you if you're pretty good at poker or you enjoy poker, these type of games would really draw you in.

[30:42] What does Jeffrey lot and say?

[30:43] He says you got to remember you get one ball.

[30:45] So if you're getting a good score every 20 nickels, you're doing okay.

[30:49] If you're getting a winning score every 10 nickels, you're on fire.

[30:52] If you're hitting the winning score every 5 nickels, you've achieved God status.

[30:59] This is Gene Simmons from Kiss.

[31:01] I would like you to join the Patriarch for Silver Ball Chronicles.

[31:44] Then after what you could swing on over to Kiss Online.com.

[31:49] There you go.

[31:50] So we're talking 20 games, 10 games, 5 games, right?

[31:53] Like you got to keep playing.

[31:57] When this is obviously a gambling device, that's when organized gambling became a problem in some establishments.

[32:06] This didn't go unnoticed by government officials with the decay and the moral collapse of society,

[32:12] which of course happened in the postwar era that everybody remembers.

[32:16] Those people were very concerned about organized crime because there was a lot of cash and a cash element

[32:23] as a part of these pinball machines.

[32:25] So if you've like banned alcohol or something like that,

[32:30] it's easy to take your black market cash and wash it or wander it through organized crime

[32:39] and a cash business, which this very much was.

[32:43] You remember the moral decay of children, our grandparents and great grandparents?

[32:47] You remember that, right?

[32:48] They were just morally decayed.

[32:50] Yes.

[32:51] Terrible. Just like society today.

[32:54] I guess the weird part there was that children spent a lot of time in these establishments

[32:59] and they were worried that these children would be affected by that.

[33:02] But I find it also very weird that it was okay for children to be in bars,

[33:07] but not to gamble in bars.

[33:11] So in the 1950s, Bingo sort of took off as a variant to the one ball game.

[33:18] Companies like Pamco.

[33:19] You remember Pamco?

[33:20] I remember Pamco.

[33:21] Do you?

[33:22] I don't know.

[33:23] I just said that.

[33:24] I figured we talked about it in a previous episode.

[33:27] I don't know.

[33:28] Maybe we did.

[33:29] I can't remember.

[33:30] But we did talk about Western.

[33:31] We everybody knows Bali.

[33:32] United.

[33:33] Some people know about you.

[33:34] Oh, yeah.

[33:35] We spoke about them previously.

[33:37] Williams?

[33:38] Well, they all produced Bingoes.

[33:41] But it was really Bali and United that dominated the market.

[33:45] And this was led by Lindorant and Dawn Hooker.

[33:51] So this was a very close knit industry.

[33:54] Coin up.

[33:55] Everybody knew everybody.

[33:56] It's still like that.

[33:57] Yes.

[33:58] We all see this competition between Jersey Jack and Stern or American pinball and all

[34:03] this stuff.

[34:04] But I mean, they all know each other.

[34:06] They all worked with each other.

[34:07] They all have good relationships or hurt feelings from years ago.

[34:12] Everybody knows everybody's business.

[34:14] And that's just the way it is.

[34:16] Stern would say it's not really a competition being they own most of the...

[34:20] To be totally honest.

[34:22] It's not competition.

[34:23] That's why they see the fact that they're building these machines.

[34:27] You're building your machines.

[34:27] We work in different markets.

[34:29] They're not throwing shade.

[34:30] It's just that's just the way it is.

[34:32] So who's Lindorant?

[34:34] This one's fun.

[34:35] Lind was an electrical engineer and he was mostly self-taught.

[34:40] During the war, the war being the Second World War, Lind worked with Harry Williams at

[34:45] exhibit refurbishing games into new designs.

[34:49] So we spoke about this in the brief history of pinball that exhibit was building pinballs.

[34:54] But what they were doing is they were refurbishing games.

[34:58] Mostly because you couldn't find a lot of those materials because they were going to

[35:03] the war effort.

[35:04] So you had to recycle the old materials to make something new.

[35:08] You'll also remember Lind worked with Harry Williams on contact from 1939.

[35:15] And that was the big deal, flipperless, five ball game, really the predecessor to what

[35:22] we know today as pinball.

[35:24] Do you remember contact?

[35:25] I remember contact.

[35:26] Remember talking about that?

[35:28] Bigly.

[35:29] Great story about the bell.

[35:30] Remember the bell?

[35:31] Add in the bell to contact.

[35:33] Ron, just go back.

[35:35] Listen to that brief history of pinball podcasts.

[35:38] Like hopefully everybody else will be listening to it.

[35:40] I can't listen to the episodes.

[35:41] I'm on them.

[35:42] That would be weird.

[35:43] It's such a, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I feel that ego, Ron.

[35:46] Now you're just, you carry in that around all those tournaments.

[35:49] Did you know exhibit made many payout machines in flipperless games.

[35:53] Many were uncredited, but were often worked on by Lind and Harry Williams.

[35:57] Yeah.

[35:58] And so when you go to IPDB, there's a lot of issues that I have found kind of in this

[36:02] area, especially with Lynn is that Lynn did a lot of the work on all of these machines,

[36:09] but he's not credited on the internet pinball database as working on some of those.

[36:14] I can't be 100% certain as to who's working on them, but it was often Lynn and Harry

[36:21] Williams.

[36:22] So payout machine.

[36:23] It's really kind of like your one ball, one arm bandit kind of gambling machines.

[36:28] You pull them that, that kind of stuff that's literally a payout machine.

[36:31] And then flipperless games are more like kind of like bingo, the precursor to the flipper

[36:36] pinball machine.

[36:38] Now Linda rant started working at Western working on an EM slot machine to compete with

[36:43] this one arm bandit type slot machine.

[36:47] Wayne Nions would say that he was a great electrical man, but didn't last long at Western

[36:53] under Jimmy Johnson who fired him.

[36:56] Do you remember Jimmy Johnson?

[36:57] He might remember, yes.

[36:58] I remember that got me in the episode.

[37:00] Huge character.

[37:01] Well worth the listen to listen to that one.

[37:04] And I believe we spoke a lot about Jimmy in the Wayne Nions episode.

[37:10] Now Linda rant would later become an engineer for United Manufacturing Company.

[37:15] And he would come up with a concept that was first to market and that concept was the

[37:21] bingo machine.

[37:22] The design didn't catch on because the play field created a style of play that was a

[37:27] little bit too random, but it was Valley after looking at this machine that would improve

[37:33] that concept immediately.

[37:37] Lynn focused on building up the automatic scoring shuffle alley machines for United after

[37:42] this.

[37:43] Do you remember shuffle allies?

[37:44] Those old school EM shuffle allies must be really cool.

[37:48] I mean, United, the chemical shuffle allies under the United name for ever.

[37:54] I remember playing one as a kid.

[37:55] Was it alley cats?

[37:56] I thought I'm pretty sure that was United has all the cats on it.

[37:59] So cool.

[38:00] But like, and I feel like that's where it's got like the strings that bring the balls

[38:05] down and stuff because like, it's just, oh, it's just so cool.

[38:09] Those old school EM shuffle allies and they're made with like, they're made almost like

[38:13] like a classic bowling alley with like, these super fancy wood alley.

[38:21] I guess for a lack of a better term, right?

[38:24] The play field is like an old basketball.

[38:27] I just remember you had to put the powder on it.

[38:29] You always had the powder stuff you had to put on it to get the puck to slide.

[38:33] So cool.

[38:34] That stuff.

[38:35] So cool.

[38:36] Lynn would finish out his career as president of United.

[38:40] So he would work his way up through all these companies and eventually become the president

[38:43] of United.

[38:44] And he very much modeled his career after Raymond Maloney.

[38:47] And this is a name I don't think anybody knows, which is why I've brought him up.

[38:52] I've included his Wikipedia page in the show notes.

[38:56] Ray is super important to pinball.

[39:00] When Godleem's bath football started to become popular, Maloney tried to secure a steady

[39:04] supply of bath football cabinets for Midwest novelty.

[39:07] Frustrating with Godleem's inability to supply the machines quickly enough, Maloney decided

[39:11] to start producing pin games himself.

[39:13] Starting his company in December of 1931, in 1932, we released Ballyhoo with a price

[39:19] of $16.50 per machine, a relatively affordable price for operators at the time.

[39:25] The machine was a great success selling 50,000 units in the first seven months and becoming

[39:30] the name of his company.

[39:33] Yeah, exactly.

[39:34] This company would eventually become Bally, the big person in that.

[39:37] So Baffle Ball was that tabletop pin game where you pull the little plunger and the little

[39:42] ball goes up and it bounces off all the pins and into the holes, right?

[39:46] So that was kind of the start of that.

[39:48] Well, they couldn't make enough of those Baffle Ball machines.

[39:52] So Raymond created his own company and he sold just as many of his machines.

[39:57] And Ballyhoo, I think that was like a men's magazine or something.

[40:00] Something like that.

[40:01] Something like that.

[40:02] Very cool.

[40:03] And then he wrote, quote, from Alvin Gottlieb, who is the son of David Gottlieb.

[40:07] He says, Ray Maloney, these guys were really strong personalities.

[40:11] Ray Maloney did everything over Bally.

[40:13] He built electric razors.

[40:14] He built television sets.

[40:16] He manufactured ballpoint pens.

[40:18] Ray would build anything and everything.

[40:20] He was a monumental supporter of inventors.

[40:23] Guys would come to him from all over the world with the weirdest things.

[40:26] A lot of that stuff went into production.

[40:28] At this time and sort of in that era, right?

[40:31] It's like kind of the future and the excitement of the greatest next invention because of the

[40:37] investment in governments at the time in science and technology.

[40:42] For kind of the post-World War I era was like, what exciting stuff can we create?

[40:50] And then according to the second World War would break out.

[40:53] But another big name in here was Sam Ginsburg.

[40:57] Remember him?

[40:58] We spoke about him a little bit in our previous history of pinball, a brief history of pinball

[41:05] episode.

[41:06] Well in 1931, Sam Ginsburg's brothers, who was Louis Ginsburg, David Ginsburg, and

[41:13] Meyer Ginsburg founded Genco, which was the amusement manufacturer.

[41:18] Sam decided to enter the business after them by establishing Chicago coin machine exchange.

[41:25] Chicago coin exchange.

[41:26] This company would become Chicago coin machine company, which would eventually become stern

[41:33] electronics.

[41:34] When Sam stern bought him, yeah.

[41:36] Yeah.

[41:37] So this, you were drawing the lines here, Ron, somehow and even in this episode, we're

[41:40] driving up the value of your friggin' stern machines.

[41:44] So what does Sam Ginsburg think about Linderant?

[41:47] Well Sam says, Linderant was a damn fool, a good mechanic, good engineer, young kid.

[41:53] I think when he started refurbishing games, he couldn't be more than 32.

[41:57] Wow, that was, that was young.

[41:59] Okay.

[42:00] What he wanted to do more than anything in this world was to emulate Ray Maloney.

[42:05] Ray Maloney was his king, his god.

[42:07] Maloney drank well and that's what killed him, Ann Lynn.

[42:10] They died about the same age.

[42:12] A little bit of shade.

[42:13] A little bit of shade from Sam Ginsburg.

[42:16] But that gives you some insight into this market, this kind of post war 1930s fanciness that

[42:26] is the pinball industry or what would become the pinball industry.

[42:31] Lynn was a sales guy through and through.

[42:34] So he learned that from Ray.

[42:36] He knew exactly what to do to boost sales.

[42:40] And the bingo game gave him an approximate profit of $300 per machine.

[42:49] Now a pin game at that time, so the older sort of style pin games would only have a profit

[42:55] margin of 50 to 75 dollars a game.

[42:59] So we can see that he has noticed that these new bingo games have more profit margin.

[43:05] They're larger.

[43:06] So they look like they cost more so you can make them actually cost more to increase

[43:11] your profit margin.

[43:12] What does Sam Ginsburg say about Lynn Durant's sales tactics?

[43:17] Lynn learned everything from Ray.

[43:19] He had a big long closet full of fur coats and anything you could think of, cameras, anything.

[43:25] If you came in from Texas as a visitor or whatever, he'd say, here, you take this to your

[43:29] wife.

[43:30] Yeah, sketchy.

[43:32] So what he's doing there is he's building relationships through a reciprocating, you

[43:37] know, thing, right?

[43:39] He'd come over.

[43:40] He's like, I got these fur coats here.

[43:41] Thanks for coming up and looking at my bingo machines.

[43:44] Take this fur coat back to your wife.

[43:47] She'll enjoy it.

[43:48] And then you get brownie points from your wife because that's what it's like in the 1930s

[43:52] and 40s.

[43:53] You buy a machine from them or a couple of machines.

[43:56] What about the other name, the other legend that we were told here, Don Hooker.

[44:01] Don Hooker was also a genius engineer and he spent most of his time at Bali where he

[44:07] would work in the engineering department and he would refine the bingo machine for them.

[44:13] The play fields were a little bit different because they had spring steel, hidden lamps.

[44:20] It also had position posts where the ball would bounce around and it had 25 different

[44:26] holes to trap the ball.

[44:29] The holes on the play field would match the bingo cards on the back glass in a 5 by 5 grid.

[44:37] And this is from Nick Baldridge.

[44:39] He says the first game from Bali called Bright Lights had six cards.

[44:44] Each card to be bought in order for one nickel.

[44:47] The game proved extremely popular and got around the primary issue with one balls.

[44:52] On the new bingo pinball, a player could win with only three of five balls played properly.

[44:57] You only had to line up three numbers on the card to win a small amount of replace.

[45:02] Four in a row earned about four times the amount for three and five in a row earned 100

[45:06] replace.

[45:07] Yeah.

[45:08] Okay, so we're making the odds a little easier here.

[45:11] Is that what I'm getting?

[45:12] That's what you're getting.

[45:13] That's okay, good.

[45:14] Okay, I understand this so far.

[45:15] So the reason what Bali figured out over the one balls and after they kind of looked at

[45:21] United's first bingo was how do I make it a little easier, but also is exciting.

[45:29] And that was kind of refining the five by five grid of cards.

[45:35] So let's take a look at, actually, let's take a look at United's bingo first and then

[45:40] we'll compare and contrast.

[45:42] Okay, United's first bingo and this is listed on IPDB.

[45:46] So I can't 100% confirm that this was actually the first one.

[45:50] But this is the first one listed on IPDB.

[45:53] So I'm going with this one.

[45:55] So if it was a five by five grid, it's called ABC, by the way.

[45:59] It's called AB.

[46:00] Yeah, it's very exciting.

[46:02] This game is from March of 1951.

[46:06] It is literacy theme.

[46:09] We have unknown amount of units and the designer is uncredited, although it was Lynn Durant.

[46:14] So what it like, when we're looking at the at the back glass, what are we looking at here?

[46:17] We're looking at bingo cards, three of them.

[46:20] Three bingo cards, A, B, and C. And they're kind of lined up in the shape of a three.

[46:26] And then when we look at the play field, what do we kind of see there?

[46:30] It's almost like a roulette wheel with holes in it.

[46:33] Yeah, it's like a roulette wheel.

[46:35] So you shoot the ball up around the arch.

[46:37] It goes into the roulette wheel, which is kind of spinning.

[46:39] And then you kind of fall into a number from one to 25, which then corresponds to the

[46:47] bingo card on the back glass.

[46:49] So how are we going to sell this one?

[46:51] Well, we're going to sell it with a flyer.

[46:54] United's ABC, new, different, five ball replay game.

[47:00] So no more one ball.

[47:01] We're going to give you five balls.

[47:03] And do you know what has fascinating bingo appeal?

[47:06] It has 180 scoring combinations on each card.

[47:10] Its top award is 200 replays.

[47:13] Play one, two, or three coins each game.

[47:16] Very fast play.

[47:17] The average game is 40 seconds.

[47:19] That would be great for some pinball machines.

[47:21] An average ball of 40 seconds.

[47:23] That would be good.

[47:25] Yay.

[47:26] But the thing was back with the kind of the one ball thing was kind of like, eh, it goes

[47:31] dink dink.

[47:32] Done.

[47:33] And it's like three seconds.

[47:34] Well, you can play for five cents, ten cents, or 25 cents.

[47:37] Woo, expensive.

[47:39] Spent some.

[47:40] But that's kind of neat.

[47:41] It's kind of cool.

[47:42] So now let's contrast that to the, I would say, much better, ballies, bright lights.

[47:47] So we click on that.

[47:48] As you say that, having not played any of these, we have no idea.

[47:52] You just get to go by the picture.

[47:53] It looks cooler.

[47:55] I'm flying blind here, guys.

[47:56] I really am.

[47:57] I'm trying to balance it.

[47:58] So bright lights we have.

[47:59] So is it cabaret theme?

[48:01] This is March of 51.

[48:03] So you got six cards.

[48:05] Instead of three cards.

[48:07] This is exciting.

[48:08] This is a lot going on here.

[48:09] Yep.

[48:10] Right, five by five.

[48:11] Starts going over my head.

[48:12] Yeah.

[48:13] Now I have no idea what's going on.

[48:14] Look at the instruction cards.

[48:16] Yeah.

[48:17] So there's a, on IPDB, there's a set of instruction cards here.

[48:21] Old school instruction cards.

[48:22] Wait for score to register is the first one.

[48:25] So then it's got, oh, god.

[48:27] Okay.

[48:28] So five balls for 10 cents.

[48:30] First, deposit one to six coins to select the desired skill selections.

[48:37] You literally have six different score cards to probably depending on how you set it up.

[48:42] Exactly.

[48:43] So the first coin selects the first selection.

[48:46] Each additional coin selects the next selection.

[48:50] This is reading like stereo instructions.

[48:52] Then shoot five balls to light the score.

[48:56] It says push knob under shooter to raise the ball to the play field.

[49:01] For amusement only, no prizes or gambling.

[49:04] So let's just pick one of these score cards.

[49:07] Let's just choose the first one.

[49:09] So go ahead and read that one.

[49:10] Any adjoining three in a line?

[49:13] Four.

[49:14] I guess it means, was that mean four?

[49:15] Four credits.

[49:16] That must be, yeah, it must be four reports.

[49:18] Horizontal vertical diagonal tied together by white line.

[49:21] Only one, three in line per section scores.

[49:24] Okay.

[49:25] Okay.

[49:26] I think I get that.

[49:27] Any adjoining four in a line?

[49:29] 32 credits.

[49:31] Horizontal vertical diagonal tied together by white line.

[49:35] Any adjoining five in a line?

[49:38] 100.

[49:39] Horizontal vertical diagonal tied together by white line.

[49:42] Score must be in a selected section.

[49:46] Only high scores in each section.

[49:49] Score void of tilted game.

[49:51] Okay.

[49:52] And that's one of six cards.

[49:53] So I assume that's just operator selectable.

[49:56] How many credits do you want to give out?

[49:58] Okay.

[49:59] So I think I know what's going on here.

[50:02] You plunge the ball.

[50:03] You got five balls.

[50:04] You got to get it in the hole.

[50:06] So then when we look at this, we got 25 different holes.

[50:08] So there's not a roulette wheel in the play field.

[50:11] The play field is a bunch of holes, one through seven,

[50:14] eight through 13, 14 through 18, 19 to 22 and 23 to 25.

[50:20] And it gets kind of, it's sort of like a funnel towards the ball.

[50:23] There's posts everywhere.

[50:24] And this is all going to be how hard you plunge and nudging.

[50:28] Yeah.

[50:29] Plunging, nudging, trying to get it down, avoid.

[50:32] It seems kind of fun actually.

[50:34] Right?

[50:35] Kind of like it's all about like, oh, I got to get it down to the 20.

[50:39] Well, I got to get it through three rows of death

[50:43] and try to get it into the 20, which seems really hard.

[50:47] I guarantee you there's people who can master this.

[50:50] Back glass hurt, kind of fun, but the cards seem really confusing.

[50:54] Okay, that's exciting stuff.

[50:55] So you can see the different, you can see why

[50:58] kind of the ABC United bingo thing.

[51:00] You didn't see what that's exciting.

[51:02] What's that?

[51:03] Because it doesn't exist in there.

[51:04] That would be a picture of insight.

[51:06] Oh yeah, oh man, imagine what the back box is.

[51:08] Yes.

[51:09] Okay.

[51:10] That's when I saw bingo.

[51:11] Who's in it scared me?

[51:12] Like, oh my god.

[51:14] Yeah.

[51:15] They went to the moon on that technology.

[51:17] That scares the crap.

[51:18] I would say bingo is probably, or EM technology.

[51:21] EM amusement technology taken to its highest possible level.

[51:26] So United would launch its next bingo style game 3, 4, 5, which is I guess like ABC, which

[51:35] was a two card back glass instead of the six card back glass.

[51:40] United and Durant had their designs mostly mirror that of ballies after a little while.

[51:47] So when production started to ramp up, they realized that ballet had figured it out.

[51:52] Bingo's added more complexity over the years.

[51:55] So as bingo kind of continued on, it added more complexity.

[51:59] So not only did the bingo cards have six of them on the back glass, some of those bingo

[52:04] cards like rotated.

[52:06] So you could like rotate them left to right or you could turn them so they would kind

[52:12] of spin in a circle.

[52:13] It was really confusing.

[52:15] Then they would add buy-in options so you could add more credits after you started to

[52:19] play.

[52:20] And you would even get player controlled kickouts that if you didn't want to be in a certain

[52:25] spot, you could kick it out to kind of hopefully get it further down the play field.

[52:29] Uh huh.

[52:30] You got it.

[52:31] You're going out to get a bingo.

[52:33] They're really heavy and huge and they scare me.

[52:36] Does this seems like the kind of game that Zach from your other podcast.

[52:41] Oh, you mean my other part?

[52:42] You're the slam-tale podcast?

[52:44] Yes.

[52:45] That's right.

[52:46] This seems like right up his alley.

[52:47] He probably would consider it boring or something.

[52:49] Because he's like the soren of EM games, right, where he can make his own code.

[52:53] Uh, yeah, that's, yeah, that's kind of his nickname.

[52:55] So I mean, like this seems like I would love to know.

[52:58] In the next episode of the slam-tale podcast, your other podcast with your other host,

[53:04] Bruce Nightingale, you should ask him why he's not in to bingo.

[53:09] We probably wouldn't like his answer.

[53:11] You'd be like, I don't know.

[53:12] Just don't like it.

[53:13] Pretty much.

[53:14] You know, it was in 1951 where everything changed.

[53:20] So they were selling a boatload of these games, right?

[53:23] They were all coming out every couple of months with a whole new one and they were selling

[53:26] thousands.

[53:28] In 1951, we spoke about this previously.

[53:31] It became the Johnson Act, which was the big boogie man.

[53:35] And this was to tamp down on gambling devices.

[53:38] Now it wasn't to outlaw gambling devices altogether.

[53:42] It was the transportation of those gambling devices from one state to another.

[53:48] So crossing state lines.

[53:51] The Johnson Act was amended several times in the invading years.

[53:55] And most notably, the Act makes it unlawful to transport those games.

[54:00] So if you're building them in a Chicago area and you're trying to get that to New York

[54:06] or upstate or New York City or Ohio, it's not happening.

[54:10] You can't get it across state lines.

[54:13] And this basically made one ball games illegal because they were now deemed a gambling

[54:20] device.

[54:22] Valley was the first to switch gears with the new legislation.

[54:27] And in 1963, there was some revisions to the Johnson Act, which carved out flipper games

[54:34] and further tightened the news around bingo games.

[54:39] They had to change the way that they were designed.

[54:43] They'd become more skill based, if you will, unless gambling.

[54:48] So how about Valley's high-fi?

[54:50] This is a cool one from 1954.

[54:53] So this one's one of those more or less quote unquote redesign style games.

[54:57] Don Hooker.

[54:58] Don Hooker.

[54:59] Right?

[55:01] What does this back last look like?

[55:03] So it doesn't have six cards.

[55:05] It's got one card in the middle.

[55:07] And then on the bottom left and bottom right, it's got two three cards.

[55:11] This one is targeting more and more complicated.

[55:13] Then they have other boxes with other options, other features.

[55:18] Run.

[55:19] So these have lights behind them.

[55:20] All of these lights correspond to holes, just holes, in a play field.

[55:25] And then it has to figure out the math behind those lights.

[55:30] I don't get any of it.

[55:35] Hey, Pinheads.

[55:36] I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not doing this podcast and making bad jokes,

[56:37] So let's take a look at the flyer.

[56:38] Flyers are starting to look cooler.

[56:39] Flyers are more salesy, more more markety.

[56:45] Valley high five famous in line features plus new exciting skill action.

[56:51] I don't know if the news guy really works as well.

[56:55] You don't think so?

[56:57] This is all I got Ron.

[56:59] You got all those.

[57:00] Now, in line name is more thrilling than ever.

[57:02] Errants more money than ever.

[57:03] Thanks to the new bump feature in capitals B.U.M.P.

[57:09] Bump electronically operated the new Valley bump mechanism eliminates player fatigue caused

[57:14] by hand operated devices and gives more action and skill control.

[57:20] Do you hear that Johnson act?

[57:22] Skill.

[57:23] Smooth and quiet in operation.

[57:25] Bump feature gets immediate extra play in profit.

[57:28] Get on in the ground floor of this 1954 bumper boom.

[57:32] Get high five on location now.

[57:35] Wow.

[57:36] So we talked also about how confusing that backlash was.

[57:39] There's in line scores which are like that.

[57:42] The back glass is a bump button basically to knock the ball out of the hole to another

[57:47] hole.

[57:48] No, it's even better than that.

[57:49] We'll get to that in a second.

[57:51] Then we got corner scores, got advancing scores.

[57:54] We got select a spot, extra time, extra ball, super card and spot rollovers.

[58:00] I have no idea what most of those are when it comes to bingo.

[58:05] Let's take a look at the play field.

[58:07] You were talking about the bump feature and that's why this game is because it's at the

[58:11] bump button on the side of the cabinet.

[58:14] You push a thing and it has player controlled, I don't know, bumpers pop pop bumper kind

[58:22] of things.

[58:23] So when the ball gets closer, you hit the button and it'll bump the ball.

[58:28] It'll bump it up the play field.

[58:31] So what you're saying is it's the action button before the action button.

[58:35] It is the tealous button.

[58:36] So once again, the feature you thought was new, they were doing it in the 50s in an

[58:41] EM.

[58:42] It's cool.

[58:43] So let's talk a little bit further about the bumper.

[58:47] Butch Glada who is also known as bingo butch is a huge collector in the bingo community.

[58:54] He's got some insight to the bumper.

[58:57] He says, I got a bit.

[58:58] My friends didn't like high five because they could never figure out the bumper.

[59:02] It takes years of practice of playing these to get it down pat.

[59:05] I remember one time I needed the four.

[59:08] I timed it perfect.

[59:09] The ball came down.

[59:10] I used three or four bumps.

[59:11] I bumped the ball up like on the top of the 11 then I bumped it some more and it went

[59:16] right into the four.

[59:17] No kidding.

[59:18] That was one I brag about.

[59:19] It was so exciting that after all these years, butch still talks about that one time where

[59:26] he used the bumper to get it in the four.

[59:30] It's pretty.

[59:34] I kid right.

[59:36] It's weird right to get that excited about this thing.

[59:40] Do you remember the time that you, you know, were able to destroy the ring?

[59:44] I guess this is kind of the same thing.

[59:47] You know, actually the first time I got to destroy the ring, I think it broke on me or

[59:51] didn't work.

[59:52] The second time it didn't register, the third time something went wrong also.

[59:57] I think the fourth time it finally worked.

[59:59] I have bound up with machines breaking.

[01:00:01] I was one shot away.

[01:00:02] I just had to shoot the ramp into the ring.

[01:00:04] It's all I had to do.

[01:00:07] I bricked it three times off the spinner and then once off of the post that's next to

[01:00:13] ballrog right down there.

[01:00:14] What does that have to do with bingoes?

[01:00:16] Yes.

[01:00:17] Miami Beach.

[01:00:18] That's the sort of the next kind of fun one that people bring up in their in the podcasts

[01:00:25] here.

[01:00:26] It's a beach theme.

[01:00:27] It's a beach theme.

[01:00:28] Everybody loves the beach, but it's Miami Beach.

[01:00:32] And this is before like 1980s Don Johnson cocaine Miami Beach.

[01:00:39] Right.

[01:00:40] This is like classy 1950s.

[01:00:42] Yeah, we haven't even gotten to reels yet when he really gets complicated.

[01:00:46] We're still in lip box, back box lighting.

[01:00:49] So what do we see here on this back box?

[01:00:52] Lots of text and instructions.

[01:00:55] So confusing, but the card, it's not a five by five card.

[01:01:00] It's a five by five six seven eight nine five by nine card.

[01:01:07] And then it has like a weird four card and another four card and bottom four card.

[01:01:11] We can have the other.

[01:01:12] I'm counting five by five.

[01:01:15] So there's a guide or there's a show.

[01:01:19] Oh, a back box mechanism that reveals more of the car.

[01:01:24] Oh my goodness.

[01:01:25] So as you kind of plan, you can reveal more of the card.

[01:01:31] And let's look at the flyer.

[01:01:34] Amazing new magic card.

[01:01:37] Gross bigger and bigger and bigger.

[01:01:41] So do operator settings.

[01:01:43] Super X.

[01:01:44] Wow, boost three in line to five in line.

[01:01:48] Red and yellow super lines.

[01:01:50] Boost three in a line to four in a line.

[01:01:53] Even then everything was super.

[01:01:55] Select a spot X corner score 100 or 300 advancing scars.

[01:02:01] Extra balls.

[01:02:04] Miami Beach.

[01:02:05] Miami.

[01:02:06] That's an is untouchables.

[01:02:07] Well, no, that's it.

[01:02:09] What about this?

[01:02:10] Wow.

[01:02:10] Peak behind the magic.

[01:02:12] Wow.

[01:02:13] Okay.

[01:02:14] Well, that's from the time.

[01:02:16] That's this is from this is from that exact same flight.

[01:02:19] This is the opposite side of that flyer.

[01:02:21] Basically they have the naked woman behind a curtain.

[01:02:25] Yes.

[01:02:26] So what we're talking about here is when you would go to the beach, you would you would

[01:02:32] you would be wearing your Sunday best.

[01:02:34] And then you would go into like a changing booth.

[01:02:39] If you would and you would pull the curtain in front and then you would change into your

[01:02:44] bathing suit and you would open the curtain and come out in your head to toe bathing suit

[01:02:50] covering all of yours.

[01:02:52] But how is this allowed?

[01:02:53] This is the 50s.

[01:02:54] How is this an advertisement?

[01:02:56] This is the precursor to side boob.

[01:03:01] She's nude.

[01:03:02] It's one of those like her arm is in the way.

[01:03:04] Yeah, but she's nude.

[01:03:06] Yeah.

[01:03:07] Wow.

[01:03:08] The curve in her hip in this picture.

[01:03:11] I'm shocked that they were able to get it.

[01:03:13] Although it is Valley.

[01:03:14] So if anyone was going to do it.

[01:03:16] Yeah, it's totally Valley.

[01:03:18] So then there's another flyer here that outlines kind of how the how this card this this

[01:03:24] growing card will increase your earnings and is a big money making feature.

[01:03:33] Really cool.

[01:03:34] Really cool.

[01:03:35] August of 55.

[01:03:37] Don don hooker again.

[01:03:40] Well, how do you actually play it?

[01:03:42] So we kind of see it, but how do you play it?

[01:03:44] Well, Bingo, butch says on most bingoes you play number one and number seven.

[01:03:50] It's like 13 and eight real real easy.

[01:03:53] So on Miami Beach, you just pull a plunger back and you shoot it and let it go and it

[01:03:57] will go boom right into the one.

[01:03:59] So you have to have select the number lit too.

[01:04:02] When you have greens, three scores, five and then you get number one.

[01:04:06] Then you got five, twelve, thirteen and twenty four.

[01:04:09] It's a five in line.

[01:04:11] Four numbers.

[01:04:12] You have four balls to get any one of them for five in a line.

[01:04:15] To me, that's super.

[01:04:17] I hope those listening understand.

[01:04:19] I don't understand.

[01:04:20] I'm not a I'm not a slot machine person.

[01:04:23] So I need to I've been to a casino a couple of times.

[01:04:26] This isn't a slot machine.

[01:04:27] It's a bingo.

[01:04:28] Yeah, but it's it's this it's so it's slot machines.

[01:04:31] There always like you need to get like the you need to get the something five in a row

[01:04:36] on this line in the line and there's an X in the circle and a like I don't get any of

[01:04:41] that stuff, but you can see that this is the same thing.

[01:04:45] You get it's five in a line, four in a line.

[01:04:48] It's all about plunging the ball on Miami Beach and I guess all of the other similar games

[01:04:54] of this time going up the play field into that top arch.

[01:04:58] It bounces left to right.

[01:05:00] Then you got to nudge it into one of the correct 25 holes.

[01:05:04] You put it into one of those 25 holes and then that sort of sets up your options for

[01:05:11] the next ball.

[01:05:12] Does that make sense?

[01:05:13] Okay.

[01:05:14] So then this so then okay.

[01:05:16] Oh, I've got it in the one.

[01:05:19] And if I look at the back glass, okay, the back glass, the one is right in the center.

[01:05:25] That's like your number one.

[01:05:27] That's and it's in the upper right.

[01:05:29] So you got those two spots.

[01:05:31] So then you're like, okay, that means I need a three in eight or 11 to get five in a row.

[01:05:37] So then I got to look at the play field and go, okay, where's the, where's the three,

[01:05:41] the five and the 11?

[01:05:43] Right.

[01:05:44] So then I got a, oh, that's what I need the three and the five or the 11.

[01:05:47] So then that's kind of where and I see where the, the lure of these machines comes from.

[01:05:54] Because then it becomes a little bit less, I need to shoot the ramp three times to start

[01:05:58] a mode to stack with a multi ball and more to do with I just got a nudge it just one

[01:06:03] little bit.

[01:06:04] And then instead of getting it into three, you get it in the six and you're like, no,

[01:06:09] it's the end of the world.

[01:06:11] Well then the flipper folk started to notice some of the ideas in bingo and started to

[01:06:17] steal some of those ideas.

[01:06:19] What does Nick Baldridge say about that?

[01:06:21] All of the bingos are marvels of engineering mechanical computers with randomization built

[01:06:26] in through the use of clutches, drag arms and timers design operate with a minimum of

[01:06:31] downtime for long periods of time with rough play.

[01:06:34] Many of the anti-cheat mechanisms and more robust amusement pinball mechanisms were born

[01:06:39] from these gambling pinballs.

[01:06:41] And we have Lynn Durant and Don Hooker to engineering powerhouses to thank.

[01:06:46] Well how about on the flipper side?

[01:06:47] So when we're talking about somebody who is the god of flipper pinball machines at this

[01:06:51] time, Wayne Nions, what does he say?

[01:06:53] He's copied each other's designs and ideas before they had a chance to ship it out of town.

[01:06:58] The only games I've ever looked at were bingo games.

[01:07:00] I love to look at bingo games.

[01:07:02] I love the circuitry of bingo games.

[01:07:04] The reflex unit and all that kind of stuff was intriguing to me.

[01:07:07] But I never looked at like a Williams game.

[01:07:09] I didn't want to start thinking like them.

[01:07:11] Yeah, so Wayne is trying to say, well what can I learn from bingos that I can implement

[01:07:17] into flipper games?

[01:07:18] But I don't want to look at other flipper games because I don't want my flipper games

[01:07:22] to look like theirs.

[01:07:24] He wanted to add engineering complexity and bingo was where you went to.

[01:07:30] Well we talked about these six card games.

[01:07:32] Nick Baldridge has a good point here at six cards.

[01:07:34] Six card games.

[01:07:35] I'm sorry, six card games.

[01:07:37] With a card card, you know exactly what your goal is at any given time for each ball.

[01:07:42] With the six card, you know exactly what your goal is at any given time for each ball.

[01:07:46] It's pretty simple.

[01:07:47] You just have to know which number you need to make.

[01:07:49] Usually there's a couple that will get you a good result.

[01:07:51] At least three.

[01:07:52] So it's a little easier for someone who's intimidated by all the features.

[01:07:56] Well, that sounds like it's for me.

[01:07:57] Yeah, that's the one for you.

[01:07:58] You're easily intimidated by all the features.

[01:08:01] He's like, no, I just want to play Godzilla where I get rewarded for everything.

[01:08:06] Each circuit board was game specific and would recognize a ball in the hold by his little

[01:08:10] is .2 volts.

[01:08:12] How wild is that?

[01:08:14] These things are complicated.

[01:08:17] So complicated.

[01:08:18] Well, wait a second.

[01:08:19] So we just talked about Wayne Nions.

[01:08:20] Wayne Nions worked at Gottlieb.

[01:08:22] Yeah, why are they making bingos?

[01:08:24] They make more money than flipper games, right?

[01:08:26] Totally.

[01:08:27] So in the early 1950s, bingo and these gambling machines were taken off.

[01:08:32] And five ball games were really suffering.

[01:08:36] You know, you remember years ago they invented the flipper.

[01:08:39] Humpty Dumpty.

[01:08:40] And that evolved into more of the game of skill kind of things.

[01:08:44] Those were considered five ball games.

[01:08:46] And they were really suffering compared to these bingo and gambling.

[01:08:50] Well, Alvin Gottlieb, who is the son of David Gottlieb, the creator of Gottlieb, what

[01:08:56] does he say?

[01:08:57] He says, David Gottlieb's point of view was that he just wanted to be strictly the amusement

[01:09:01] game business.

[01:09:02] Gambling was not of interest to him at all.

[01:09:05] He wanted to be able to provide in his own words amusement for the populace at a very low

[01:09:09] price.

[01:09:11] We try to make a couple of games that were games of chance, but his heart wasn't in it.

[01:09:15] He was more or less to maintain competitiveness.

[01:09:18] He didn't enjoy it at all.

[01:09:19] I was in the engineering department one day and he came in and told us that that was the

[01:09:23] end of our attempt again into that business at all.

[01:09:26] From then on, it was strictly amusement games.

[01:09:29] Yeah.

[01:09:30] So I work on a future episode about the Gottlieb's and David Gottlieb.

[01:09:35] He had a very high kind of moral standing.

[01:09:39] You know, he didn't like the idea of gambling and games of chance.

[01:09:43] They half-assed it for a little bit and then he just said, nope, that's it.

[01:09:46] We're done.

[01:09:47] And in the end, it actually probably would have proved to be a good idea because they

[01:09:51] didn't put all their eggs in that gambling basket.

[01:09:54] And then when kind of everything collapsed with the Johnson Act and a few other things,

[01:09:58] they weren't really caught up in that.

[01:10:01] But Alvin does know that Bingo does have it.

[01:10:03] It's a appeal.

[01:10:04] Alvin Gottlieb says, in 1949, United was building shuffle alleys.

[01:10:08] In the early 50s, the Bingo pinball machine came along and the flipper business just about

[01:10:11] died.

[01:10:12] In fact, the whole flipper machine business was about gone because the Bingo machines

[01:10:16] are running rampant all over the country and territories are being closed up, left and

[01:10:20] right all over the place.

[01:10:21] In 1956, there was a case which interpreted the Bingo machine was seen as being so-called

[01:10:27] slot machines and coming over the $250 gambling tax.

[01:10:31] This is what we're seeing, right, is people, like law makers and people at the time were

[01:10:36] sitting around and then all of a sudden these Bingo gambling machines were everywhere.

[01:10:41] That's what prompted the Johnson Act and that's what prompted all those things to say,

[01:10:46] oh my goodness, we need to slow this down.

[01:10:49] The Gottlieb's noticed this.

[01:10:50] They're like, whoa, what's so attractive about these Bingo machines, Ron?

[01:10:55] Oh, I don't get it.

[01:10:57] I mean, to me, they're attractive from the mechanical aspect.

[01:11:01] They're so complicated.

[01:11:02] It's just exciting to figure out what the heck is going on in there to make this work.

[01:11:09] When I first got into pinball, I put up a Facebook ad that was like, I will buy your old pinball

[01:11:14] machine as stab in the dark.

[01:11:18] One gentleman reached out to me one time and he's like, I've got this Bingo machine and

[01:11:22] I looked it up and this is when I was in the hobby for, I don't know, like a month and

[01:11:26] I look it up and I'm like on IPDB and I'm like, what the hell is this thing?

[01:11:30] It was a Bingo and I'm like, oh, that's going to be really friggin heavy.

[01:11:35] This worth maybe like 200 bucks.

[01:11:38] Is it going to be worth it to go and get it and figure out how to friggin clean all these

[01:11:41] contacts and how does the motors work?

[01:11:43] I had no time for that.

[01:11:45] So I was like, no, I'll pass on it.

[01:11:46] But then this guy told me about this Bingo machine, this old pinball machine.

[01:11:50] He's like, this machine was in the clubhouse at the beach.

[01:11:56] And in the 1950s and 60s, we played this thing forever and all the kids were around it.

[01:12:01] It was so much fun and we were betting on it and gambling on it.

[01:12:05] It was so much fun.

[01:12:07] And then kind of 20 years later, he found that exact same machine at a yard sale and he

[01:12:12] bought it and he put it in his basement because he remembers the nostalgia from when he

[01:12:15] was a kid.

[01:12:16] I thought that was an amazing story.

[01:12:20] It's funny that a bunch of kids were gambling on this machine, which is obviously the problem

[01:12:25] that they had.

[01:12:26] But it had an alluring the youth.

[01:12:29] Who's ruining the youth?

[01:12:30] Nick Baldridge knows the allure.

[01:12:32] Nick says there's so aspects of playing a Bingo pinball machine that really attract players.

[01:12:37] The risk of reward of how many coins to play in the betting phase, the constantly changing

[01:12:41] goals and reaching a point in the game where you have two sets, two sets of two in a row

[01:12:46] with a single number in between.

[01:12:48] With only one number needed, you have to make your shot.

[01:12:51] Otherwise you get nothing.

[01:12:52] You got to choose which one you got two options, right?

[01:12:55] Do I go for the 13 or the 20?

[01:12:58] You know, which one's easier to get to?

[01:12:59] Do I go for the three or the five?

[01:13:01] They're so close together.

[01:13:02] There's one in the middle.

[01:13:03] What do I do?

[01:13:04] Ah, I get it.

[01:13:06] I get it.

[01:13:07] I haven't played one, but I get it.

[01:13:09] Now a guest on for amusement only, his fill, Bomega, he would say, I was always kind of

[01:13:15] a number sky.

[01:13:16] I always like to pay attention to probability and things like that.

[01:13:21] When I was a kid, I'd make games up with dice and I knew all the probabilities of dice

[01:13:27] and made money.

[01:13:29] So there you go, right, Ron?

[01:13:31] It's probabilities.

[01:13:33] It's mathematics, it's excitement.

[01:13:35] So if you're the kind of pinball player that loves kind of math, that loves risk reward

[01:13:41] on a level that is a little bit slower than high flow pinball today, give Bingo a chance.

[01:13:52] By golly, give it a chance.

[01:13:54] What do you think?

[01:13:55] Give it a chance.

[01:13:56] I say give everything a chance.

[01:13:57] Give it a chance.

[01:13:58] Don't.

[01:13:59] Oh my God.

[01:14:00] No.

[01:14:01] No.

[01:14:02] All right.

[01:14:04] This EM technology used in one ball, Bingo, and then electro mechanical flipper pinball.

[01:14:13] It's dying out, right?

[01:14:14] We're kind of losing a piece of that history, I think now.

[01:14:18] Technology when it comes to boards, the availability of new pinball machines and the complexity

[01:14:23] of those new pinball machines.

[01:14:24] I feel like we're losing a lot of this.

[01:14:28] There's fewer and fewer people know how to fix this stuff.

[01:14:30] Yeah, they're complicated.

[01:14:31] They're not impossible, but they're hard to do.

[01:14:35] Which, Jeffrey Lawton is one of those individuals that's trying to keep it alive.

[01:14:38] A whole lot of people aren't interested in it today.

[01:14:41] Nobody's taking the time to understand electro mechanical technology.

[01:14:44] It's kind of a shame.

[01:14:45] It's literally a dead art.

[01:14:47] I have customers that are graduate electrical engineers that have electro mechanical machines

[01:14:52] and they call me.

[01:14:53] Pretty wild.

[01:14:54] Another guest is Hugh Cohen.

[01:14:58] He was on, he's a big Bingo repair individual.

[01:15:02] He says, I had a guy from Belgium come over here and he stayed with me twice for two weeks

[01:15:09] just to learn how to repair these games.

[01:15:12] We're losing this part of our pinball history because it's just so much time has passed.

[01:15:17] A lot of people are like, Bingo is boring.

[01:15:20] There's no ramps.

[01:15:22] There's no flippers.

[01:15:23] There's why would I spend my time?

[01:15:24] Well, it's a niche, right?

[01:15:25] It's something within this great hobby of pinball and we're losing out on part of that.

[01:15:31] Well, I have to say Nick Baldridge has actually spent some time developing his own home

[01:15:37] brew multi Bingo machine.

[01:15:40] And that's well worth it to look if you check out his pin side thread on that.

[01:15:47] If you check out his website for amusement only, you can check out his multi Bingo machine.

[01:15:53] Which is kind of like a virtual pinball machine that has all these old Bingo's on them.

[01:15:59] In addition, Nick has also worked on a lot of visual pinball games.

[01:16:04] So you can play some of these games in visual pinball and you can learn them.

[01:16:09] So you don't have to know the technology that is electro mechanical.

[01:16:14] It loses some of the romance, but it's at least keeping that part of the hobby alive.

[01:16:18] And you know what?

[01:16:19] Tip in the hat to Nick Baldridge for doing that.

[01:16:23] Gemini final thoughts were on.

[01:16:25] I feel like I should say something.

[01:16:28] Something profound.

[01:16:29] We need something profound.

[01:16:31] These games are really complicated.

[01:16:33] But to be fair, I'm confused easily.

[01:16:36] We have a sword here from Vic Camp.

[01:16:38] And I was at Vic's house for one of his parties and he had, he collects mostly single player

[01:16:45] like Gottlieb Wetchheads and he had that.

[01:16:47] Kind of like Woodrails and stuff too.

[01:16:50] Most of them were like 60s, 50s, 60s and up.

[01:16:53] Yeah, there's some Woodrails in there.

[01:16:55] But he had in his, I know things that moved around in his collection system.

[01:16:59] But I think the garage area, he had all the Bingo's like all in a row.

[01:17:04] And I remember he was explaining one of them like the rules.

[01:17:08] And within the first like 30 seconds, I was totally lost.

[01:17:12] Yeah, you got to kind of play it out.

[01:17:14] You got to figure it out and got it.

[01:17:15] So Vic says, these games are sophisticated.

[01:17:19] You need to study the layout, play a lot of games.

[01:17:21] Just like anything else in life to get good, you need to dedicate time and focus.

[01:17:25] And you'll become a better player and enjoy the game more.

[01:17:28] That'll fuel you to becoming a better player.

[01:17:30] Just like anything you can do in anything in life.

[01:17:33] Bingo's need that.

[01:17:34] You really need to dedicate time to these games.

[01:17:36] It's not like a flipper game.

[01:17:38] You're whacking the ball around.

[01:17:39] You're shooting for a target once in a while.

[01:17:41] Bingo's are the opposite.

[01:17:42] You're on top of the ball, controlling that ball all the time.

[01:17:46] You're always moving.

[01:17:47] That ball's just rolling down the play field.

[01:17:49] There's no pop-up uppers hitting it anywhere.

[01:17:51] There's no ricochets, no kick out holes, no drop targets.

[01:17:54] It's just you and the ball.

[01:17:57] Very good, Vic.

[01:17:57] It's just you and the ball.

[01:18:00] That was his interview on For a Musement Only.

[01:18:04] Vic Camp.

[01:18:05] Amazing.

[01:18:06] One of the best ones I've ever heard.

[01:18:08] He gets so filous off.

[01:18:09] And did he say that?

[01:18:10] You can see that's like his line.

[01:18:12] You see that all the time.

[01:18:14] Look at this as you can see.

[01:18:16] As you can see.

[01:18:17] As you can see.

[01:18:18] He does have a slight...

[01:18:19] You could tell he's from the Northeast section of the country.

[01:18:23] I just remember he's Jersey.

[01:18:24] He's jukebox.

[01:18:26] He had a lot of four seasons stuff on there.

[01:18:27] I'm like, of course.

[01:18:28] That makes perfect sense.

[01:18:29] I'm a lot of do-op.

[01:18:30] And that makes sense.

[01:18:32] Very good.

[01:18:33] Is that very new Jersey do-op stuff?

[01:18:35] Yes, that's like...

[01:18:36] What do you think of these bands?

[01:18:37] The Jersey boys.

[01:18:38] Four seasons.

[01:18:39] Oh, I see.

[01:18:40] You know?

[01:18:41] Sherry.

[01:18:42] Sherry baby.

[01:18:43] You know that kind of stuff.

[01:18:44] Wow.

[01:18:45] I do.

[01:18:46] Walk like a man.

[01:18:47] I can't.

[01:18:48] Fast as I can.

[01:18:51] I was more of a Roy Orbison kind of guy.

[01:18:53] Yeah, he's definitely not Northeast.

[01:18:55] I just got off.

[01:19:13] It's like almost noon stewing.
