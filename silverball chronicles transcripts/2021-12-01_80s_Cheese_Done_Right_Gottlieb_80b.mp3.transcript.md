[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Do you see no time to die yet? No, no. You can rent it. I don't care. Watch all of them. Do it. No.

[00:23] No. No. No. No. My dad can watch it. Do it.

[00:53] Hello everyone. I'm David Dennis. This is silver ball chronicles with me this month like every month is my co-host Ron dominated expo hallet. What's up, fella?

[01:11] Hello. Yes. You just smashed all the competition at the expo tournament didn't you the first major tournament and convention that we've had in a long time. Did I you're right up there in the top 100 right.

[01:28] I don't think so. I don't think they even posted any of the results. Then why do you even go to these things? I don't know if you're not first your last run.

[01:37] That's from a movie right just ask Raymond Davidson. Ah, what movie is that from Ricky Bobby? That's not the title of the movie. Yeah, it is. I thought it was Taladega nights. Right. The Taladega nights the ballot of Ricky Bobby. You're doing the subtitle. Yeah, well, it's okay. Well, yeah, you're doing the part underneath that's in quotes. So that doesn't count.

[01:57] First of all, that that is a proper racing pinball machine. I still want my team America pinball machine, but that's probably not going to happen. So you've been to expo you've met people people exist. I haven't seen many people. Yeah, you weren't there. Some people have said actually that you and I are not actually different people because we've never been in the same place at the same time.

[02:20] That's true. You've never seen us together. So I could be doing your voice. And I and I got the Canadian accent down if that's the case. You have been on your stream simultaneously with Stu McVicar, but we have never been in the same place at the same time. So yes, we'll have to do that. Anything exciting announced in the hobby, Ron announced. There's all kinds of excitement. There's always new games. There's always there's always excitement.

[02:46] You know, we're still waiting for those God's illus to get out and about. I haven't played one. I haven't played a new Stern since stranger things pro with 0.7 code. So I have no idea what pinball is like after a year.

[02:58] Where do you live again? I don't know what it's like to be connected. Are you like an ant article or something? No, I'm in New Buron's Wic. Do they not have pinball there? It's basically main. Every every major pinball place is about an hour away.

[03:14] We do have a bar opening up showed out 83 barcade opening in my hometown. However, all of their machines are vintage machines. There's no new ones.

[03:26] Oh, what would you consider vintage? I would say anything sort of like, you know, pre 2000. Wow. Okay.

[03:37] So all those classic 90s games are all vintage to you. They are indeed my friends. Okay. You know, you can get an antique license plate for cars before 2000 now. I did not know that. It's been 21 years, Ron, since the 2000 started.

[03:53] Okay. Well, then I guess our subject today is quite vintage. Yes. Is it like ancient ancient? Well, we're not getting this isn't an Ed Khrinsky episode here, but oh, yeah. Well, check us out on Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles send us a message.

[04:10] Post on the wall there. Send us some of your shenanigans. That's where we'll post up from time to time a couple of things. Last month, what we did is we tossed up a little something something after the episode.

[04:22] You said you wanted to post up what is one of the favorite mechs that we covered. And I'll tell you what we had a lot of engagement on that post over at Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[04:36] A lot of it was mostly why didn't you talk about this meck? That's what I figure. Yeah. And I mean, really the reason we didn't talk about some of those mechs. They were in other episodes.

[04:48] They did get an honorary mention a lot of them, especially with Sean Ledgerwood saying the getaway turbocharger. That was your favorite mech of all time back in the day.

[05:00] Was that in addition to the supercharger? What did I say? You said turbocharger. Oh, it's supercharger. Supercharger. That's right. It's downstairs right now. That's what it says. It's written on it. Very important.

[05:12] A lot of people fun host Rudy right red and Ted from road show that kind of stuff. The the one of course that I didn't mention that I think is actually a big miss on my point, even though we didn't cover it in the episode. It did. It certainly did deserve an honorable mention. And that's the theater of magic trunk, which is awesome. Yeah, you failed. Yeah, of course the medieval medieval madness castle mentioned by Jonathan Hall.

[05:40] Pat pit mentioning the jump rope on champion pub. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff on championship champion pub. Yeah, the feedback jump rope. Oh yeah.

[05:52] Very, very wonderful. So swing on over sometimes we'll post up some stuff there. Also, if you want to leave us a review on your pod catcher of choice, please do that. Five stars or more. That feeds the ego for run there. And he can walk around the house pretending he's all important and stuff.

[06:09] And you can also leave us a review at this weekend pinball calm in their promoters database. So even if four stars is the highest, leave us a five star. Exactly. Okay. Yeah, you have to like if it's only a four star, leave four stars. And then in the description, say I would have given it five stars.

[06:26] So you always give a hundred and fifty percent would be a hundred and twenty five percent. If it were four stars plus another one would be twenty five percent. Okay. So another thing we have wonderful thing from Dan J says I don't have a favorite toy.

[06:42] Just wanted to comment about how outstanding the podcast is love it. Outstanding run. Did you think when you started podcasting you'd ever be on a podcast that was called outstanding.

[06:54] No, but outstanding. Yes. Have to make a Canadian accent line every episode. That's the rule.

[07:02] In the early nineteen eighties, there was a boon for pinball manufacturing, ballet and Williams head transition to solid state early and had evolved their platform over several years.

[07:15] Got leave, however, struggled with system one and as soon as they found their stride with the new system eighty board set pinball was dying by the mid nineteen eighties pinball was clawing its way back.

[07:31] But got leave never regained the foothold and industry dominance that it once had. However, that did give them some creative freedom.

[07:41] The eighties was known for Don Johnson's jackets, big teased hair, trickle down economics, crappy synth music, Indian lights.

[07:52] While Williams and ballet passed on being too trendy or in the moment got leave dove head first into pop culture and the eighties cheese we've now come to embrace take note that he said crappy synth music that's not in his notes. It just said synth music.

[08:10] So it's it's it's it's his fault. I have no I have no problems with synth music. This month our topic is eighties cheese done right got leave system eighties.

[08:21] System eighty B wait a minute eighty B eighty B wait a minute we're skipping ahead.

[08:28] What's going on this shenanigans got to do a little more research on system eighty and this one's more or less finished and I have a I have a

[08:40] week part of my heart that just loves eighty B games. So we're going to jump into it now.

[08:47] I figured I'd just bring it up before listeners do like hey you went out of order. Yeah, so we're actually going to recap a little bit here of sort of the

[08:56] pre system eighty era just to sort of catch everybody up they can listen to our system three episode if they want to get a little bit more

[09:06] knowledge on the end and they can listen to our system one episode if they want to catch up on the other side of the

[09:13] book end so we were filling in some some of the gaps here we will be also doing a got leave system eighty

[09:20] in another episode sort of the precursor to eighty B and eighty A and we'll call that pinball is dying in our

[09:26] pinball is dying series one of your favorite series Ron I wasn't aware was the whole series but it's a whole

[09:33] series it's a series within a series wow let's recap a little bit with the constant ownership changes that got

[09:41] leabes suffered in the late seventies and early eighties sort of the turmoil around that time at got

[09:47] leabron really put them on the back foot didn't it you know from thirty forty years being owned by the got

[09:53] leabes and they sold it to Columbia pictures so Columbia pictures wanted to get into coin op because quite frankly

[10:00] they are an entertainment company part of getting people into the theaters in to see movies was also to catch

[10:07] the dollars when they were there in pinball machines well they discovered very quickly that when pinball

[10:15] started to trend downward and system one didn't go that great at least for the beginning of system ones they were

[10:22] selling like ten k a unit so they were doing quite well at the very beginning before it started to go in the toilet

[10:28] well eventually they would sell to Coca-Cola in nineteen eighty three and that was then operated as

[10:36] Milestar or is it Milestar I have heard it both ways from multiple sources so I'd like to know myself if

[10:43] if any got leave employees listening is it Milestar or Milestar I've always called it Milestar so I'll stick with that.

[10:51] In the 1980s around mergers and acquisitions that was the buzzword right building big large multinational conglomerate

[10:58] corporations big deal right you're getting into all these other places instead of focusing on what made you

[11:05] great and what brought you to the dance so Milestar was of course the short period of ownership where Coca-Cola tried to spin off the

[11:16] video game section so they sort of looked at the books and they said so then they spun off got leave and they created

[11:22] Milestar potential buyers were approached in nineteen eighty four because of the downward cycle in coin

[11:29] operated machines in general course when system one started with Columbia pictures there selling ten twelve

[11:35] fifteen thousand machines by nineteen eighty one were down to like two thousand machines at best and in some

[11:43] cases if you remember from our Williams episode where they're selling like seven hundred pinball

[11:48] machines out Milestar basically made one good game which was alien star and most former Milestar

[11:57] employees referred to the company as rat slime which is Milestar backwards that was coined by Ed

[12:05] Crinsky in a very public meeting I guess if you say it that way backwards it has to be Milestar right it's an

[12:12] I slime Milestar yeah I think we have our answer there we go now of course this led to a sale to

[12:23] premier technology Coca-Cola kind of noticed this was not going very very well they would eventually sell

[12:32] the premier technology who purchased all of the assets in October of nineteen eighty four premier

[12:39] technology had two partners got leave electronics corporation and embassy electronics ink this all comes from

[12:48] got leave website which I'll include in our show notes so got leave electronics corporation was a

[12:54] subsidiary subsidiary of Mondale international corporation which was the largest distributor of got leave

[13:02] machines in the world these fellows at Mondale international corporation wanted to make sure that got

[13:09] leave continued to grow and continue to sell machines because they sold most of them around the world

[13:16] that's a big deal you don't want something to fail other partners of course who came in to help out

[13:21] was embassy electronics that was a corporation control by somebody we've run into a few times

[13:27] Gilbert G Pollock or Gill a former member of the management team at Milestar so we can see that in

[13:36] this sort of period let's say cyst the end of system eighty the beginning of eighty a eighty B

[13:43] you know everything is in turmoil right sales are in the crapper people are are escaping from pinball

[13:51] at a record rate and going to other things it's not going really really well and got leave never recovered

[13:59] what they once had during this time they did however run have some machines in the pipeline for

[14:06] what's called system eighty a these were all generally left over games from Milestar and they were

[14:13] just pushed out under the new got leave name of premier you're always a huge fan of premier games

[14:19] right it's good the good ones yes you've got them in your basement I don't have any premier games in my

[14:26] basement I have a Milestar game in my basement you have Eldorado city of gold the Ed Khrinsky remake I

[14:34] do not have that no you have touchdown from October of 1984 which is an American football

[14:40] theme standard body 711 units sold designed by drawn Trudeau art by Larry Day and sound and

[14:47] software which is uncredited designed by who you said like drawn Trudeau oh designed by John Trudeau

[14:54] I don't have that one either it was the first pin produced entirely in the new premier facility

[14:59] the flyer was printed incorrectly still had Milestar on it yeah actually looks pretty cool

[15:04] it's got some neat in lane lane saucers two spinners no not ringing a bell no I've seen it in its

[15:09] ornament is it the one it's got like a green playfield yes like with the yardage lines and stuff on it yeah

[15:16] does I'm right yes oh man the cabinet has the same thing it's green with the yardage lines on it yeah

[15:22] it's it's got stuff hey is is got lead the strength of got lead was they weren't afraid to make any

[15:34] playfield no matter how weird it may look yeah so we're we're you know when you look at it you got

[15:40] sort of the old EMS had those two spinners kind of at the top third just at the bottom of the

[15:46] top third of the playfield it goes into four pop bumpers down on the bottom of the playfield it's got

[15:51] weird in lane outlines into a saucer if the ball lands in the saucer it'll go to the in lane if it

[15:56] goes out of the saucer it'll go down the drain it's unusual to say the least John Trudeau was known

[16:01] for very unusual games we love our flyers what what great catch phrases are in this one pinball 1984

[16:10] that's not the title it's called touchdown touchdown has all the right moves excitement competitive

[16:18] football action on a pinball gridiron I like that whoo quality and dependability in the

[16:26] classic got lead tradition timing available to your location for the seasons kickoff yeah

[16:34] they are getting in getting in to make sure that you're getting the fall dollars in your bar

[16:41] because people are coming in to see the football season and it kind of looks like a green bay packers uniform

[16:48] yeah it is literally the yellow with and white they just don't actually say green bay anywhere on it

[16:54] but this of course the art done by Larry Day who is in my opinion an absolute unsung hero when

[17:03] it comes to pinball art he doesn't get any of the accolades as much as you know like a Greg

[17:09] Ferris you know Paul Ferris those guys but man he had an awesome style when he did his art

[17:19] very very cool you can see on the helmet here on the flyer the guy has myle star on his on his

[17:26] on his helmet down here there's some players you got the brisky which would be Dave Zabrisky

[17:32] written on one of the back of the the jerseys there who's one of the programmers at the time he of

[17:37] course would end up elsewhere in the industry as a big deal this pin although unusual to say the

[17:47] least stands out because if you are a big football person and you got you know a bunch of fellas

[17:56] and over for a football game this is a must have in your basement if you ask me this is awesome

[18:04] so put it right next to Monday night football and Stern's NFL football yeah see I think this

[18:10] would be this would be better than those two not because the rules of the play field is better

[18:14] but because the it's got this vintage air to it it's got this old excitement it's got some

[18:20] really cool art right I think this is a really cool little little thing the plastics the art on the

[18:26] is just gorgeous the cabinet itself not so much break green yeah looks like a field yeah

[18:34] there's how's that for theme integration yes the world under glass now you had mentioned

[18:42] john trudeau tends to be the major designer at the time here there are many of his unfinished

[18:50] whitewoods that are listed on IPDB included ACE's high night hoc pinball squared which was a

[18:58] by-level game sub chase sevens which was a flipperless game tyrannosaurus and snooker he had a lot he

[19:06] was just pumping out play fields left and right his nickname was doctor flash and that's the reason he had that

[19:13] nickname because how fast he can make play fields this is this is another pinnacle absolute must have in your

[19:22] basement bar it is ice fever which is ice hockey themed from February of 85 this one sells 1,585

[19:32] units designed by john trudeau art again by Larry day sound and software by john purus this is the

[19:41] last system 80 a game and it is awesome I like this I've never seen you so into these games this

[19:50] oh my god if I could I know there's one of these in London Ontario showed out to Mike dimes he's

[19:58] got one of these for sale up there and I'll tell you what is it because it's like hockey in your

[20:03] Canadian is that exactly why okay not only that but I am ready to catch the fever all what kind of

[20:14] fever the ice fever my friends all did you know that scoring a goal activates the backlash animation

[20:21] feature exactly so you know everybody knows world cup soccer you shoot the goalie you know he's

[20:29] in the he's in the net this has dropped targets which are the goal tender behind it a captive ball

[20:38] which then hits a target that is scoring a goal in this game and then on a back box the hockey

[20:46] player shoots the ball right into the net the backlash the hockey players look like they are on

[20:52] massive amounts of steroids this was before they did a lot of the drug testing I think so they

[20:58] look huge they look bigger than the football players did on touchdown hey Ron you remember hit the

[21:03] ice from the 1990s right was it a video game it was indeed and it was a video game that was more

[21:11] arcade than simulator you got into fights all the time the characters were big and brutish and

[21:18] looked silly it was the official video hockey league the video hockey okay don't know what that means

[21:24] but anyway that's what this art reminds me of because it's away over the top the really square

[21:29] it's not taking itself too seriously it has a serious spinner on it that much I remember

[21:35] because I think if you light it it stays lit and you could just hit it repeatedly you know I love a

[21:39] spinner orbit spinners yeah it's pinball on ice score a winning goal with ice fever a fast

[21:48] high earning pinball game that features an animated puck in the back last goal for goal ice fever has

[21:54] plenty of action clear the way for a slap shot into the net after knocking down the rollover drop

[21:59] targets and score a goal three goals scores a hat trick advancing the multiplier nice this game is

[22:07] awesome this is Larry Day again doing the art and he's got this the way he does the art is it's got

[22:14] lots of lines in it it's very cartoony it's so much fun there are four oddly placed pop bumpers

[22:25] on this they are all over the place again you want original play fields got leave is your company

[22:32] this game is so cool I would totally have one of these Ron why don't you have a nice fever

[22:37] ah I haven't played one enough but you're not you're not shutting it down ah no it's got a spinner

[22:45] it's got a juicy spinner this has the new spinner from the old system ones an early system 80 plastic

[22:54] crap spinners this is the thick heavy metal 1980s spinner it's a sparkly spinner this is the

[23:02] pinnacle of spinners they use the same spinner from probably system 80 all almost all through

[23:09] system 80 it's the same one it's the one that is is always never available that any of the

[23:14] part sites for some reason yeah you got to cannibalize a lot of these games yeah or you can go to a show

[23:20] where the I think it may fair amusement always has them there's no ramps we're not into the ramps

[23:26] here not too early so it's all single level play field what was interesting about this era is

[23:32] rather than ramps creating kind of interesting bends in the play field it was the play field ball

[23:39] guides that sort of created s shapes or or loops or hooks but we still haven't got into kind of the

[23:47] flow style era where it's returning to the pop bumpers or it's returning from the pop bumpers

[23:53] down into the flippers it's just kind of going everywhere and it's all about kind of control

[23:59] some people call the style what like clunky it doesn't have to be clunky just because it

[24:03] just because the game doesn't have flow doesn't make it clunky give me a little extra on that

[24:08] I mean not every game is a flow fest clunky would mean it's just shots just don't seem to work right

[24:13] hit something clunks out shots don't seem to work like you think they should work that's more of a

[24:18] clunky okay am I okay now for john trudos sports trifecta by the time baseball season rules around

[24:28] okay so we've got a football game in the fall we got a hockey game in the winter and we've got

[24:36] Chicago Cubs triple place well I think yeah so the lovable losers of baseball to the lovable

[24:44] losers of pinball at that time yes also being made by the lovable loser of pinball manufacturers

[24:52] this is may of 1985 it sells 1,365 units this was a concept by Gill Pollock who was a big Chicago

[25:02] Cubs fan designed by john trudos art by Larry Day john bureus on sound and software now pinball

[25:09] was really struggling and many people had all but assumed they knew what the solution was to bring

[25:17] pinball back how do we invigorate things again well Steve Kirk you remember him of course from

[25:24] stars and meteor Ron oh yes he had been lobbying the manufacturers for some time to allow him to

[25:31] work on a new pinball concept bringing back the creativity and higher bomb and excitement

[25:41] well I'll tell you this time it got leave there was no creativity like john trudos creativity

[25:49] because he could make some crazy stuff on a play field with basically no bill of materials

[25:55] hence the reason so fast was that three games in a year three games in six months not even here

[26:02] it said that Steve Kirk after lobbying all of these manufacturers the one that he got furthest with

[26:08] was got leave and there's a play meter magazine from may of 1985 which I'll include in the show notes

[26:15] where he speaks in vague terms of his new way to do pinball and the creative crisis that pinball

[26:24] was in during this era and think about Steve Kirk I'm not sure if it was that interview but there

[26:31] was one of the play meter interviews where he talks about things like games being connected to each

[26:38] other being able to play like across the country against other players and stuff like that south

[26:45] of there absolutely now Kirk Kirk would say the main problem is most creative people in the industry

[26:52] are not in a position to do anything I get very down on the premise that upper management never

[26:59] goes to the arcade and doesn't play the games in the street yet they're dictating what goes out

[27:06] the door they really have no idea what the needs of the playing public are or what the results of what

[27:13] they're doing is and test results are meaningless because you really don't know how the games are being

[27:20] played on location I would somewhat agree with Steve Kirk and his critique at this time but when

[27:29] you look at a lot of these system 80 specifically system 80 be John Trudeau play fields there is a lot

[27:38] of creativity going into them even though there may not be a lot of stuff on them what do you think

[27:43] agree very good do us to expand on that role so he would also say that manufacturers were scared

[27:52] to take risks and it was all about making money and not being creative now that that certainly

[27:58] sounds familiar does it not run it sounds like stuff python angel would say sounds like stuff a lot

[28:05] of the designers would say sounds like people said before jersey jack it's like they say nowadays

[28:12] it's the inevitable struggle which is why a lot of the designers and those in power at the manufacturers

[28:18] today basically ignore it because they've literally heard it for 40 years oh you got to make money

[28:25] that's the thing the main purpose of these games is to make money yeah capitalism man and be fun

[28:31] but the first part is the more important part you know when you look at something like this when

[28:36] you look at this chicago cubs triple play game it's kind of fun as well and this is like another

[28:43] one of the i got a habit in my basement bar games especially if you're a chicago cubs fan especially

[28:50] if you're a sports fan what what is the flyer say on this one i love these sign up with the cubs

[28:59] oh man this is a long one i don't think i'm gonna do the whole but the baseball season can be

[29:03] profitable for you chicago cubs triple play premieres timely new pinball game transforms your

[29:10] location into rigley field wow and gives you your customers a chance to play ball with the cubs

[29:17] so do they uh what do they call them the um bleacher creatures are they there they like spilling

[29:22] beer on you from the outfield one of the few baseball games that have actually attended live

[29:29] of course outside of the Toronto blue jays is a chicago cubs game at

[29:35] rigley field and i'll tell you what there is nothing like rigley field in sports it is something else

[29:45] but you've got the skydome yeah but the skydome has that eightiesness to it it doesn't have the

[29:50] charm and nostalgia and that smell of urine that the chicago cubs rigley field has wow i got nothing

[29:58] add to that now the neat thing here about this play field is that it has four flippers

[30:07] two at the bottom where they should be and two at the top of the slings but like they're smaller

[30:14] and kind of like in the in the inline yeah two inch flippers really cool i don't i think they're

[30:20] probably useless uh looking at the play field i'm guessing in a competitive situation you would

[30:26] probably try to never use them yeah beautiful beautiful line of six drop targets these drop

[30:33] targets run in the nineteen eighties at got leap rock solid and they felt amazing when they

[30:44] engaged and disengaged oh they tend to not to break as much as the other manufacturers and solid

[30:50] they wouldn't break either but they wouldn't break as often it's pinball everything breaks totally

[30:58] now this is another awesome art package by larry day just beautiful the back glass is really

[31:07] the shining star here when it comes to that you are looking at people rushing into the

[31:15] rigley field stadium and the cool part is we're moving into the alpha numeric generation so

[31:22] we're moving out of score boxes and we're moving into two lines of digital displays that will have

[31:30] both numbers and letters that can spell things larry day has integrated those alpha numeric displays

[31:37] into the rigley field home of the Chicago cubs sign on the stadium very cool

[31:45] and the fact that it's a field means it's actually not a stadium yeah whatever the intimacy of

[31:51] rigley field yeah my favorite part is when you go to the boxes at rigley field you have to like walk

[31:56] through scaffolding salt skulls very cool so there you go three games in six months banging them out

[32:02] all sports themes all of them ready for the sports season what was the first game run that was

[32:10] ever produced with alpha numeric displays well supposedly it was aftor yes or you could say it

[32:18] was hyper ball if you consider that a pinball machine because that actually did have actual

[32:24] that had alpha numerics and would say things like condition critical because that's what I would

[32:29] see all the time when I would drain and fail because I never could understand that game at all

[32:34] after was the bizarre and this is another one is it wico or wico I would always say wico I don't know

[32:41] how it's pronounced correctly but they were no more for their parts especially replacement parts

[32:47] like if you had a genuine so you got leave coil fail you could replace it with a wico or a

[32:53] Williams coil you know it would be cheaper neat so they were they had that the after I had like a

[32:59] metal back box and like metal it was interesting it was there were there one pinball machine I think

[33:05] they did but it had alpha numeric displays on it and that was in 84 so one of the references that I

[33:11] use Ron is the pinball compendium which you can get on Amazon in a few other places that's by Michael

[33:17] Shalob and Ozzy I believe you are correct he is also wonderful coffee table book wonderful and it's

[33:25] he's got a lot of really cool stuff in here I use this a lot for some of our references

[33:31] John Trudeau would say the alpha numeric display was a group effort to try to update the pinball

[33:37] game in general Chicago Cubs slash Rigglyfield Marquis was a natural place for it to debut I don't

[33:46] think it actually did a whole lot immediately for the cash box but it did receive very favorable

[33:52] reviews for those people who did get to see the test games and anything that could help the

[33:58] pin product was not frowned upon those were pretty slim times I believe that the size of the

[34:04] tubes was determined by their availability nothing larger was readily available so the cost of

[34:11] producing the displays was a determining factor it was I really like the way they did the alpha

[34:18] numerics at got lead and it looks like they worked out really well mostly because of their

[34:24] constraints as opposed to being unconstrained can also put in high score names now put your

[34:31] initials in that's a big deal although you they had to put two extra buttons on the front of the

[34:36] cabinet for some reason in order to do so yeah you didn't use your flipper buttons left and left

[34:42] and right button on the front of the cab guessing there was a technical reason for that that someone

[34:47] shouting at us right now it was probably a board limitation or something you couldn't do it with

[34:51] the flippers because they were separate they're probably separate from the actual switch logic and

[34:55] all that so it couldn't work to put initials in that would be my guess yeah I bet you if you listen

[35:01] very carefully right now Ron you can hear Bruce night and gale's vein on the top of his forehead

[35:08] pulsating an anger because he knows the answer and you don't yes Bruce is my podcasting co-host

[35:17] on my podcast actually I'll plug that at the end doesn't sound right during the show now of course

[35:22] this is going to give you some serious bragging rights if you're walking through the arcade right

[35:26] you're able to put up your initials on the high score tables yeah you can do what you have been

[35:31] able to do in a video game since probably the late seventies congratulations pinball only five or

[35:36] six years behind always behind on that one now July of eighty five we're chugging right along

[35:43] so we're talking two months later yeah we're getting to the things are starting to pick up or

[35:48] are going to be picking up soon because high speed is on its way era um business is about to pick

[35:53] up as they would say but not on this game this brings us into bounty hunter which is a cowboy gun fighter

[35:59] theme July of 1985 sells one thousand two hundred and twenty units designed by john bureus this time

[36:07] not john truto art by Larry day again software by john bureus now this will eat software and playfield

[36:16] design big deal yet now if you love yourself some cowboys this is probably the pin for you now Larry

[36:24] Day would tell IPDB that bounty hunter was inspired by the nineteen eighties Spanish graphic novel

[36:32] torpedo 1936 with the art by jordi burnett super it's a cool looking game now uh Mr. Scoot

[36:43] who is one of the streamers at the pinball network he has and this is one of his first this is his

[36:49] first game a bounty hunter I remember playing this once for a long time mm-hmm that's what I remember

[36:58] as in that it it was really long playing let's talk about uh no drop targets here no drop targets

[37:06] oh does it have a spinner it no whoa no spinner and no drop targets yeah that's a hard pass

[37:14] mm-hmm and it's brown it's brown like really brown I think it does have one drop target actually

[37:21] now that I'm thinking about it I think there's one that sort of blocks a left orbit shot well there

[37:26] you go but it's not a it's not a drop target bank that's kind of it's kind of a no-no I think when

[37:32] it comes to these uh system 80 games you got to have drop targets you got to have a spinner but what

[37:36] it does have is awesome Larry Day art it's like a guy he's got a cigarette he's loading his gun there's

[37:43] a damsel in distress in the back with some CD looking fellas and I want a dead or alive poster of

[37:49] course what you can't have a you can't not have a wanted dead or alive poster on a cowboy game in

[37:54] the side of the cabinet there's a shootout happening yeah how about how about the middle of the

[38:02] play field there with the pistol with the bonus going up the barrel and then the the six

[38:09] multipliers down on the bottom where the chambers are that's some cool friggin design load them up

[38:16] for profits yep so this is this is now I know these are funny I know these are a bit cheesy but these

[38:23] are nowhere near as cheesy as the Williams ones the Williams wonder groaners these ones make you

[38:29] giggle well you know bounty hunter features our new alpha numeric top players display trademark

[38:36] that now let's players enter their initials the new display also has easy to read scores with

[38:43] scrolling messages during gameplay nice wow and he has a name did you know that I'm sure he has

[38:51] a yes cactus Sam I could have done a better job but man Larry day the way he draws with these

[39:02] dark lines he's very it's very comic book right does that but it's not um it's not like zombie

[39:10] yeti comic book it's like it's very cool do you like that it's very brown it's fair yeah it's a big

[39:17] brown it's kind of put brown yeah yeah did come with a comic book on the flyer it did yes do you

[39:24] want to read this I was tracking down a new cutly pinball game from premier technology it's called

[39:31] bounty hunter when I was hot on its trail I heard that's another one of them high earning pin

[39:37] games from premier that's built like a bank safe there's like a guy and he's like shooting it's like

[39:42] ping ping ping and he's like stealing this lady I'll read the blue bits but there's one more thing

[39:49] about premier if it's like their other games there's gonna be plenty of action you can load your

[39:57] gun rotate your chamber and fire and pick off cactus Sam oh I guess cactus Sam is the bad guy okay

[40:05] I miss miss uh read the the synopsis there it also has premier's new affinum air top players

[40:12] display realistic shoot them up western sounds and lots of graphics that make bounty hunter a great

[40:19] looking package yeah see your local distributor today this is a great one if you can look this

[40:25] went up this is this beats the phantom comic book thing that they created to tell you whatever

[40:31] the hell's happening on phantom actually it looks better than the uh the dialed in one too it's

[40:36] so fun Larry Day obviously enjoyed the heck at a doing that guaranteed loved it beauty go buy one

[40:45] of these I'd rather buy the next game that came out all right Ron this is this is a big one for me

[40:54] this is the machine that started it all whoa okay it's a game I like too tag team pinball

[41:01] this is wrestling lucha libre theme from September of 85 sells 1,220 units designed by John Trudeau

[41:11] art by Larry Day music and sound by Ken Hale and of course he's done a lot of work at today's

[41:19] stern the software john burys this was my first pinball machine fast you're biased I am heavily biased

[41:30] and this is a stunning amazing game which I wish I did not sell oh how could you have sold it if

[41:40] it was so great this game I pulled out of a basement in a man's home this was the first machine

[41:48] so you jump on it right away and you pay whatever you can and you drag it out of a basement

[41:54] and it had been down there for many years because it like most system 80b's had a lot of technical

[42:01] issues and had a lot of small little fires but as I continued to fix it up and basically got it to

[42:09] 95% a lot of the other issues kept making me chase my tail and we'll talk about a lot of the

[42:17] technical stuff in 80b and 80 here in a little while but there was a lot of moisture I think in the

[42:22] basement at the time so there was like some rust and it caught fire a little bit in my my garage

[42:29] caught fire a little bit just this a little bit this a little bit but the game was awesome it's

[42:36] beautiful it's a lot of fun the flyer instead of going for the comic type art it's actually has a

[42:43] photograph of two big muscle band guys with lucha masks on and these guys are

[42:49] big they're big or too big to be lucha d'Horse a pinball first team competition players can now

[42:55] choose the excitement of challenging one team against the other so the score will actually say team

[43:00] one team two right so player one and player three are on one tag team player two and player four

[43:08] on the other tag team we've combined the appeal of professional tag team wrestling with

[43:13] multi ball play field action our alpha numeric display trademark so does that mean if anyone else

[43:19] calls it alpha numeric display got leave gets a cut they must adds up the team scores automatically

[43:26] while also displaying individual scoring put a wrist lock on high earnings with tag team pinball

[43:32] from premier yeah so so you could play for player you could play you know for four on four you

[43:39] could play you know your regular two on two but you had the choice it would say would you like to play

[43:43] stand like regular or tag and you could use the buttons on the front of the cabinet to choose

[43:48] one or the other this has an absolutely amazing art package i'm an old school wrestling fan

[43:58] just like you run mm-hmm and this just is awesome from top to bottom the only thing that would

[44:06] make it better is if Bret Hart was in it oh my god Bret Hart if he was on this mission he was on the

[44:12] le yeah maybe or maybe they just removed him and put hogan on it isn't that what they did for

[44:17] the daddy east one uh no he's daddy east oh yeah he no Bret Hart is in the uh he's in the brawl

[44:25] rumble 100% he's right on the playfield yeah but wasn't he on the back last and then they replaced

[44:30] him with hogan oh well they had a lot of people dropping out and stuff they might have replaced the

[44:35] hogan would have been oh yeah this is a sidebar you can edit but a hogan would have always been on

[44:40] there i would have guessed more than likely they removed him for someone else other than hogan there's

[44:45] no way hogan wouldn't have been on the back classes the main character this art package just got the

[44:49] two sort of luchadors who are like obviously the bad guys the guys with the masks massively

[44:55] roided up luchadors yeah and they are like they're they're they're sort of tag teaming the one sort

[45:01] of like good guy or the the baby face in one corner and the other guy on the other side is trying

[45:07] to get into you know save his friend but of course the the very dangerous referee is keeping him

[45:13] from getting in to save his friend oh this got the crowd in the front looking in it's it's an

[45:20] awesome backlash it is super super good but these had a lot of those heat issues like a lot of

[45:25] those old back classes so they flake like crazy incandescent lighting heat heat generates peeling

[45:32] or heat causes peeling now when you look at this uh back glass the the gentleman or the uh the

[45:39] wrestler in the background who's trying to get in to save his tag team partner from the bad guys

[45:45] that looks like a very familiar wrestler and i would say that it's clearly magnum t.a now he was a

[45:52] big deal wrestling personality at Jim Crockett promotions which is the predecessor to world's

[45:58] championship wrestling and he retired in 1986 because of a car accident where he lost control of

[46:04] his Porsche and he hit a tree yeah he wasn't supposed to ever walk again but he did but he had to

[46:10] retire from wrestling and he was like this he was this next big thing they say and he was like this

[46:18] was a pretty devastating thing to happen at that time which is kind of interesting that he's sort of

[46:23] lived on as this legend although he didn't really do much but what he did do was so impactful

[46:30] that he is clearly the sort of mustache mullet guy blonde buff guy in the back and of course

[46:36] this would be before his tragic you know situation very very cool as name was Terry Allen but

[46:43] since magnum p.i. was popular and he kind of looked like Tom Selik that's how he got the magnum

[46:48] t.a. name not only is the art really cool and it's kind of a theme that harkens back to my childhood

[46:54] but Ron the gameplay rules are a lot of fun and it has an orbit spinner yeah yes it does so you roll

[47:04] over the the left in lane it lights that spinner and then you can just smash that spinner and then it

[47:10] goes up into the lanes down into the pops and hopefully you can get it back down to that left

[47:16] in lane again and just smash it again but it has two sets of drop targets a set of three and a set

[47:22] of four the top left has tag and the bottom center drop targets have team so if you spell tag

[47:31] you light a capture hole at the top left if you knock down team it goes in the lock saucer at the

[47:40] bottom right now you have to spell it in order t.a.g not just a gt right you got to spell it in

[47:49] order so if you spell it out of order you know you'll lock in the t for example and then it'll

[47:54] raise the targets again and then you got to do a g in the correct order before you light that up so

[47:58] it's kind of a little interesting it's got a lot of really kind of neat shots for a single level

[48:05] playfield why do you like it Ron that's why it shoots good yeah it does I mean it has in the right

[48:12] the right side doesn't have an outlane if I remember it just like yes what the right flipper is

[48:16] almost directly above the apron there's no outlane on the right side but on the left side there's

[48:21] two out lanes it is like a vacuum it just sucks balls in there but it does give you a little

[48:28] something called a last chance ball so if you've got a ball that's locked you go out the left

[48:34] outlane if you go out the correct left out lane it will be lit and then you roll over it and it

[48:40] will release the locked ball and then you can start the process again it has a three ball

[48:46] multi ball it does not have very good sound however it's almost like a drum beat that just sort of

[48:55] gets beating faster and faster but it does also have one of the greatest pinball inventions of all time

[49:03] the bell which has been used since EM days but exactly but could it be any more thematically

[49:10] perfect no ding ding you got it ding ding oh when you match oh this game is awesome way underrated

[49:19] I've just driven up the price of this thing and I'll never be able to afford it again

[49:23] the next game we have also by John Trudeau his 10th game and no less than a week

[49:30] this is rock which is a rock star music theme October of 85 1,875 units so we're we're

[49:41] ticking up here a little bit in sales numbers art by Larry Day music by Ken Hale and software by

[49:49] John purist basically the same team as the last game now you want to talk got leab innovations

[49:56] we have the first pinball machine with a trans light rather than a back glass now we're not

[50:05] into the photo thing here that we're going to talk about in a couple of minutes but this is still

[50:11] a hand drawn art trans light which more than likely was done as a cost savings and it screams

[50:19] 1980s it it does the pants not not as tight as I would expect but they are leathery yeah there is

[50:26] a lot of teased hair it's a rock band with a woman lead singer very progressive but then for the

[50:32] flyers we have the photographs which are which are bad very 80s just you talk about hair this

[50:40] guy's all business in the front pernion the back but premier says it's the new look now because

[50:46] got lead was not the industry dominator they could take a lot more of these risks you know they

[50:53] could go all in on theme and odd play field designs and they could really dive into pop culture

[51:02] and this is the first time they sort of dipped their toe into pop culture what's interesting is

[51:08] on the flyer they actually have the got leave employees on the flyer all wearing some sweet

[51:15] sunglasses as we're rocking at premiere especially this lady who looks like she's in her 60s yes

[51:21] wearing like an apron of some sort looks like a winner part of premier's new look is our high tech

[51:27] cabinet design this new design utilizes single fluorescent two back glass illumination

[51:34] combined with our new artwork the result is a sharper more vibrant image to attract the players

[51:41] attention so years before stern started doing the fluorescent tube got lead was doing fluorescent

[51:46] tubing big time do you know that it sounds like a winner too because premier has completely redesigned

[51:53] its sound system to capture the interest of today's game player our new soundboard and extra

[51:59] speaker gives this game an extra ordinary play appeal yeah so we're talking a big time innovation

[52:08] change here that itself didn't cause a revolution but it certainly did make a huge impact at

[52:17] premier technology and got leave this system 80 era is dominated by amazing sound and this is the

[52:26] beginning of that so the code of this is pretty straightforward you basically kind of have to collect

[52:35] various band members or instruments and in so doing you add an extra layer of sound to the sound

[52:44] package yeah had the drums yeah the bass yeah the guitar and then eventually you have this kind of

[52:51] rock and song which itself is not actually that bad is it wrong trying to remember it off the

[52:56] time it does have the trend that um john trudeau liked his little mini play fields that are just part

[53:02] of the you have a little section of the play field which will be like a little mini play field in

[53:07] itself with a couple flippers in this case they're offset you're trying to hit drop targets in the

[53:13] back of the play field yeah it's kind of like a single level it's like a single level swords of

[53:20] fury drop targets in the back flippers in the front two flippers it's got a two orbit spinners one

[53:27] on the left and on the right yeah but it has this really kind of neat loop looping swooping shot

[53:35] kind of that goes behind the drop targets the it's really kind of a neat thing that's going on

[53:42] there yeah totally unusual off the wall design and some amazing sound things are starting to change

[53:50] and they're they're they've seen some sort of way forward I think to differentiate themselves in

[53:56] the industry at this time so this is just prior to the system 11 transition now this is where we

[54:03] get into my second game raven the infamous raven this is an unlicensed action movie theme it's

[54:14] October of 85 it sells three thousand five hundred and fifty units that is a big seller

[54:22] designed by john truto art by Larry Day and Don Marshall sound by Ken Hale and software by

[54:29] John Burris it's raven gets a lot of crap but it sold three thousand five hundred and fifty units

[54:34] the last time we're on that got leaps sold over thirty five hundred units was devil's dare in

[54:41] nineteen eighty two that sold three thousand eight hundred and thirty two units we are talking

[54:50] three years since the last time they sold more than thirty five hundred and raven is basically

[54:55] the female Rambo exactly and raven is also got leaps space shuttle right so it's the game that

[55:01] keeps the lights on before all the future huge hit games come out exactly it's the it's the it's the

[55:07] one that started the trend back up my friend this is what save the company raven did you know raven

[55:13] came from the code word used in the Hollywood movie Rambo I did because I wrote the show notes now

[55:21] raven is the type of game that definitely creates a lot of strong emotional arguments it's very

[55:32] polarizing to say the least because it's kind of crappy and it's not really the play field per say

[55:41] that's crappy it's not really the art that's crappy or the code it's just all of it together

[55:48] kind of creates a crappy game but for people who aren't really pinball people or people who just

[55:55] like to shoot the ball around and have no idea what's going on it's actually a pretty good game

[56:00] I guess we'll start with with the flyer because it's a good one are your games missing in action

[56:06] oh that's a great line she's here raven to the rescue the model on the back glass is on the front

[56:14] here and she has like a what is that like an M4 or something you're an American you should know

[56:19] what kind of gun I'm not a gun expert now the fire is funny in that it actually shows them taking

[56:24] the picture for the flyer on the flyer exactly and it is it is something else because the the actress

[56:35] or the model is is kind of there with the back glass pose but we're looking kind of from the other

[56:40] side and there's like fireworks and smoke coming up it's kind of over the top I don't understand why

[56:48] this image is needed but it's kind of fun it's obviously got the art director of this game

[56:53] Dawn Marshall sitting there in his like turtle neck and suit and I don't know if he's trying to

[57:00] like get himself on a flyer and make himself look fancy or something but it worked I guess

[57:05] did you know that raven is offering a very uniquely designed play field this game was created with

[57:10] the idea of offering entertainment to the novelty player and at the same time challenge the true

[57:15] pinball player this is quite evident with the split rail ramp unlike some of the earlier games

[57:21] introduced raven's ramps give the player the option to continue playing the game even when the

[57:26] ball is on the ramp to add to the realism of the game raven has a moving helicopter located within

[57:32] the play field together the novelty items ramps and artwork make raven a game for today's player

[57:41] did you know that raven will set a new industry precedent with its photo graphic back glass

[57:48] oh it'll do that all right this is this is where it gets a lot of heat but it's got some some

[57:53] 80s cheesy charm to it as well for this photo backlash I believe it was their first game they use the

[57:59] photo photo realistic back glass it's a fun game the code is a far too shallow and it basically ends

[58:06] up shooting it into the orbit spinner and getting into the top lanes to increase your multiplier that's

[58:11] basically the game I think it's another one as you go through the in lane lights a spinner and then

[58:14] he hits better yeah you can just do that exactly after I would say I'm about a month of playing it I

[58:21] was like wait a second are you telling me this is that you just shoot the thing in the round that

[58:26] that's it and then sort of when I realize that I was like oh well that's no fun as well as I'm not

[58:33] so sure that I really like sort as cheesy and funny as the back glass is it's not like something I'd

[58:40] like to have in my game room or my living room or it's just a bit too much cheesiness for me I think

[58:48] there's other games that I think would kind of be more fun but this one's just I don't know it just

[58:53] didn't do it for me the play field artist kind of cool it's like a world underglass right it's like

[58:59] you're looking at a battlefield with the Raven female Rambo character the best part though of this

[59:07] game are the random single drop targets the snipers that pop up in the play field at certain times

[59:17] I just wish that the coding was better as to when you shot them you got I don't know multipliers

[59:22] or you got more points or something because it just ends up being they pop up from the play field

[59:29] and they like block the orbit or they're really close to the flippers but they don't really do

[59:34] anything besides just being annoying right John Trudeau would bring this back in Ghostbusters

[59:39] basically being the Scalary Brothers cactus Canyon also use them which is a bit topical at the moment

[59:46] kind of cool so to 24 now it has this this this ramp on the left side and it will open up and you

[59:53] can shoot under it to kind of go into the orbit and around the top of the play field into the

[01:00:00] the top lanes they call that the Stargate ramp and this is a crutch at Gottlieb where it's like

[01:00:06] they had a bin of these things and they made too many of them in like 81 and they're trying to get

[01:00:11] rid of them but it pops up all the time on these Gottlieb games it is a cool mechanical device but

[01:00:19] at the same time it's like once you've sort of seen it you've kind of seen it I think John Trudeau

[01:00:24] also used it on Mustang right the ramp does come up hey pinheads I just wanted to let you know that

[01:01:24] insurance solutions provided by denisfinancial ink Canadian residents only what do you think

[01:01:29] are raven you know I tell my ever play it is internaments and you just you do left in lane

[01:01:35] rights better over and over and over would you put this in your your collection probably not

[01:01:40] because it also has I mean it has the ramp that is steep and it's way at the end of the play

[01:01:45] field so if the flippers are anything other than optimal it takes a lot of effort and it's very

[01:01:51] narrow shot so it's easy to have a high clunk factor trying to get up there got got leave did all

[01:01:56] these steep metal ramps that are just sometimes nearly impossible to get a yeah this is before they

[01:02:01] sort of get into those new flippers that john norris would eventually work with it got leave to

[01:02:07] sort of make them better that really debuted at the end of of 80 and more or less became into its

[01:02:14] own in system three well this still has well this believe it or not these still has the older

[01:02:19] flipper max in it these old these older games I don't know if they just didn't have enough

[01:02:23] power in the coils or something but the other thing that's really weird and I don't understand

[01:02:28] why they're there I'm sure that you know the the folk around you are much more technical than I

[01:02:33] am but they've got these pop bumper boards so all of the the the the transistors and resistors

[01:02:39] and control pieces for the pop bumpers are not on the driver board as they were with

[01:02:47] Williams or or or ballet they were actually a separate board that was mounted underneath the

[01:02:53] playfield and the worst part about working on this game when I had it was that the pop bumper

[01:03:00] boards there's four of them one for each pop bumper and they were mounted horizontally on the

[01:03:06] playfield so there was an extra board that these these boards were mounted to and to get around

[01:03:13] in there to like unplug them or or you know check the the voltage was really really hard and super

[01:03:21] horrible the pop bumper boards that was due to limitations of the number of actual transistors they

[01:03:28] use on the main board John Trudeau would say that this is his homage to Steve Richie's fire power

[01:03:34] and I guess the reason for that is that it has six stand-ups in the middle of the playfield and

[01:03:39] four pop bumpers yeah because that's about it at the front is very reminiscent of fire power there's

[01:03:45] a bit of a gimmick is that you shoot up that ramp and it comes around and then it goes either left

[01:03:50] or right if you kind of nudge it and then it goes down the ramp and it goes into a saucer and it

[01:03:56] holds the ball and it's like the helicopter is dropping a bomb on the playfield and then it pops

[01:04:01] it out perfect place to do a multi-ball capture but there's no multi-ball in Raven

[01:04:07] multi-ball might have made this better helicopters kind of cool it's got the blades that move like a

[01:04:12] helicopter on a track mode it goes tt tt tt tt every now and then which is kind of neat it's kind of a

[01:04:19] crap kind of crap wow but if you have no idea what you're doing or you got family members that

[01:04:24] have no idea what they're doing or you got buddies that coming over for a pint it's a good game

[01:04:28] just don't think too hard how about we crack out the hits again for rock on core on

[01:04:34] paper of 86 this is the le sells 250 units so I guess it sort of sells like an le wow this is a

[01:04:42] concept by Ken Hale Dawn Marshall and Jeff Walker designed by John Trudeau Larry Day John Marshall

[01:04:48] on art John Burris and Ken Hale on sound and software respectively premier had advertised this is

[01:04:58] a booster pack as a 15 minute art and sound conversion kit for your existing rock pinball game

[01:05:07] it consisted of a replacement photo translate because that's the future and three new pinball sound

[01:05:16] roms it's it's also a few hundred dedicated rock on core games were made but you know they basically

[01:05:24] sold it as a conversion kit so this was an upgraded translate what do you think of that Ron

[01:05:31] do you think that the other rock needed a photo translate not really I'm trying to remember I

[01:05:39] think it's the one it's just one where the dedicated version of the game has some like

[01:05:45] different side art that's correct so the conversion kit when I got you the new side art right but the

[01:05:51] the production game which they only made a couple of them had more of a splatter art that said

[01:05:57] rock on the side it actually looked much cooler than the original cabinet if you asked me what do

[01:06:01] you think of this flyer you know premiere is changing their tune keep a good thing going with

[01:06:07] rock on core so this guy has the most puffy pop music 80s hair I have ever seen yeah the guy

[01:06:17] is can hail himself with the super poofy here I hope that's a wick he didn't have his hair he looks

[01:06:23] good though he does look like a rock star and the funny thing is in the picture it shows him taking

[01:06:27] it shows him in front of a rock where they've taken the original the original translate out and

[01:06:32] replaced it with the photo realistic translate I like the original one better it says keep a good

[01:06:38] thing going with rock on core the premiere booster pack is a 15 minute art and sound conversion kit

[01:06:44] for any rock pinball game you know these new sound and photographic pack less they produce prolonged

[01:06:50] earnings at a minimal investment yeah it's a new game in 15 minutes now we're not talking playfield

[01:06:57] changes or anything we're just talking different more sent the tune music and a different back glass

[01:07:05] and I don't know I guess this is kind of when ken hail and dawn marshal who were kind of within the

[01:07:15] let's let's call them the brain trust at the time they're young they're trendy they're trying to

[01:07:19] make an impact this is how they thought hey this is really cheap let's do this and really get us

[01:07:24] into the future but it was the next game that really brought them into the future hollywood heat

[01:07:33] this is a new wave Miami vice theme it's June of 86 it sells 3400 units the concept was by Jeff

[01:07:44] Walker who was another member of the brain trust of young folk designed by john trudo art by

[01:07:50] Larry day dawn marshal sound by ken hail and john purus when you look at this game run how do you

[01:07:58] see nothing but Miami vice oh with 100% of Miami vice ripoff you were a big fan of Miami vice I assume

[01:08:05] uh I saw it back in the day I'm not that old I would have been kind of young to watch that show

[01:08:12] that was a more adult show yes this was the crime drug drama cop show it ran from 1984 to 1990

[01:08:22] on prime time in BC dripping in 80s music and cocaine the 80s was the whole war on drugs

[01:08:28] Colombians sneak and cocaine into the United States it was the thing right that was the thing

[01:08:35] and don johnson the star of that show he would be just the pinnacle of cool in this

[01:08:44] there's the other his tubs his part was Philip Philip Michael Thomas I was like the only thing

[01:08:50] he was ever and he disappeared after the show went off they would say that this is a top 50 show

[01:08:55] of all time and this show actually created the long pop music thing that all TV shows have even

[01:09:07] to this day where the characters are thinking or they're reflecting or they're driving and there's

[01:09:14] some sort of pop song that's playing they use a ton of licensed music in the show big kind of

[01:09:21] hard when it came out in video to get the rights for all that stuff. Now this had one heck

[01:09:27] of a photo translate the translate scene shows ocean drive which is at 13th Street in Miami Beach,

[01:09:36] Florida and there are some serious serious cool characters on the front of this. There's two ladies

[01:09:44] wearing 80s bathing suits with what was the thing in the 80s was like pump high heel shoes with

[01:09:51] everything right that doesn't look very comfortable that doesn't he's got like a what was that a

[01:09:56] Ferrari. I think if my memory serves me correctly Don Marshall he was at pinball expo the banquet he

[01:10:04] got inducted into the pinball hall of fame and he talked a lot in his speech so I don't know if

[01:10:10] this probably isn't on film anywhere he talked a lot about these photo realistic backlasses and

[01:10:16] I believe this is the one he had a story that the car that's used in this they actually procured that

[01:10:22] from some kind of actual not mobster but someone who is probably making making their money and not

[01:10:29] the greatest way. Wow. It's a very interesting story. What's really cool is that it's shot kind of

[01:10:37] at dusk and it's got these beautiful pink clouds in the background with the palm trees and it has

[01:10:41] this old hotel with these old with these vertical neon lights. It's very reminiscent of the

[01:10:47] air. It's very perfect. One of the interesting things is that the photo was actually retouched

[01:10:51] because one of those three vertical neon lights was actually burnt out so they had to use

[01:10:58] I don't know computers. I don't know how they did that back then. Photo shop the 80s version. Yeah

[01:11:04] which was like a crane on on the film. I don't know and of course the man on the flyer was Jeff

[01:11:11] Walker who is the ideas guy. So Jeff Walker was the marketing department head. He was the person

[01:11:20] that came up with a lot of these concepts for the 80s games. He's like hey let's do a Miami vice

[01:11:26] knock off. He was the ideas license guy. That's gotta be nice. Come over the idea and put yourself

[01:11:33] on the back glass. Yeah. Other interesting thing about Hollywood heat. Steve Richie has said this

[01:11:38] was his favorite got lead. We're weird. Do you know Hollywood heat. It's a vice worth having.

[01:11:44] That's literally what it says. On the on the flyer they are leaning into it. And it even uses the

[01:11:51] same font as Miami vice used. That's the other thing. The heat is new eight digit scoring.

[01:11:57] Three separate bonus levels. Multi ball play. Two ramps and the best music yet. The look is cool.

[01:12:06] The sound is hot. The action is awesome. It does have awesome music. That's the best part about

[01:12:14] system 80 is all of these games especially when we get into this era have amazing amazing sound.

[01:12:21] It's like he took the right side from tag team as there's there's no outlaying in the flippers

[01:12:27] almost directly off the apron again. The the play field looks like this like 80s drug hotel thing

[01:12:36] where it's like art deco styling but with this like bright neon colors dancing girls on the side

[01:12:45] of the cabinet. It also has this super annoying pop bumper board mounted vertically underneath. It's

[01:12:53] something else this game also has the has a little play field within a play field. Yeah the that's

[01:12:58] sort of again that sort of John Trudeau little play for the flippers. Steep ramps that are tough to

[01:13:04] hit. Lupin shots. It's got a purple ramp. What do you think of a purple ramp? It fits the theme.

[01:13:09] Yeah I guess this has two ramps but I only see one. Uh no the one is a very short ramp that goes

[01:13:16] over it's in the center but yeah it's it's a little metal thing that says hot shot on it and that

[01:13:23] shoots it up into the the the the the middle play field. Yeah it's a cool little game and I think

[01:13:28] I think this would be awesome in somebody's house because it's so funny right like it's sold 35

[01:13:34] hundred of them are getting better numbers. Yeah 34 34 hundred. Very very very cool. Now this is

[01:13:43] when we're getting to vacuum formed ramps the plastic ramps rather than the metal ramps right so

[01:13:49] they're able to sort of bend it a little bit better. Um what I think is the most fun about this

[01:13:56] is that it doesn't have that system 11 fancy fun code stuff but it is still pretty decent and

[01:14:06] when you think about the machines of your youth how just sort of simple it is to sort of shoot it

[01:14:12] around this is kind of a neat game. It's very cheesy iconic but it's not as cheesy and iconic as

[01:14:19] Genesis. Ah one of my favorites. Everybody loves Genesis. Now you got on your notes here.

[01:14:24] Fantasy little person theme. Yes it's from September of 1986 it sells 35 hundred units. John

[01:14:31] Trudeau Larry Day on art with Don Marshall Ken Hale on sound John Burris on software. This game was

[01:14:40] inspired by the 1927 German film called Metropolis. Yes and the woman robot from it is underneath

[01:14:47] the play field. Yes of all the machines that kind of have a do the thing gimmick. This is probably

[01:14:53] the best one ever created but let's start at the translate. What's going on on the translate?

[01:15:00] Um I never could figure out the translate other than you got an old guy that I assume is supposed

[01:15:05] to be the scientist. You got a little guy that I'm assuming is supposed to be his henchman.

[01:15:09] Yeah he's a little person and the woman who is the creation. All right yeah so she's kind of got

[01:15:15] this puffy 80s hair the red lips but she's pale. Yeah I mean I think that's the story they're

[01:15:23] telling and the game it has these as these swirly pink ramps and you kind of so they don't go it's

[01:15:29] not like it's not like Williams or or it's not anything like a Steve Richie it's not like they

[01:15:35] go up the ramp and it comes back to the flippers it like goes up the ramp and then like goes around

[01:15:40] a weird curve and then like falls into a capture hole and then back out into the pop bumpers.

[01:15:46] Very anticlimactic. Oh I think it feels good. What's the flyer say? Genesis, another great got

[01:15:53] lead creation by Premiere. Genesis attributes this exciting gameplay to a number of challenging

[01:16:00] features. Genesis offers a multiplier capability of 49x for a single ball and up to 98x for

[01:16:08] multi ball scoring. Dual ramps, very target and the completion of the body part sequences

[01:16:14] built to a climax with a spectacular unveiling of the Genesis creation. Yeah and the Genesis creation

[01:16:22] is cool. It is now the best part about this flyer is not the writing. It's that they've cut out

[01:16:29] the creation model who's got like she's dressed I mean very you know sexy I guess or 80s sexy if

[01:16:39] that's your thing but they've like cut her out into all these weird situations and like

[01:16:45] dropped her in like really bad Photoshop like she's sitting on it like presenting the game but she

[01:16:52] shrunk down or she's sliding down the ramps like a like a slide at a child's like school. It's very

[01:16:59] weird but I got to say the Genesis creation the spectacular climax is it actually a spectacular

[01:17:08] climax can you explain how you get there Ron and then what it does. I believe the deal is you have

[01:17:13] to assemble body parts which sounds weird but yes there's was four different sets of body parts

[01:17:23] you have to spell four different things yeah arms the brain the body and the legs and each one

[01:17:30] kind of has a corresponding shot which is kind of anything you got to spell them all and then you

[01:17:35] got to hit the very target or something that's right and then it reveals and the thing is I think

[01:17:40] when it reveals it the ball is still in place it's going on it's not like it's that's where the

[01:17:44] fail is it should have been like some kind of scoop or something in a hold it so you can enjoy

[01:17:50] the regenerator which is what they call it and it's got I think this is the the it has a window

[01:17:57] like creature from the black lagoon another John Trudeau thing he would reuse this type of this

[01:18:03] window and underneath the window it has you you can barely see it it's the regenerator but you see

[01:18:10] the back of it when you actually hit the very target all the lights will come on like really bright

[01:18:15] like flashers so it'll turn around and then you see the robot which is the life force robot

[01:18:22] and it plays the um that music which I'm trying to remember it's a box terracotta and fugue

[01:18:28] is it the dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

[01:18:35] and yeah it rules not only that just the regular music in the game when your building stuff is really

[01:18:41] great we're into full awesome 80 sound package got leave the era where almost every game sounds

[01:18:46] yes sounds similar but awesome if you want a really cool game that's both fun and interesting and

[01:18:52] unusual and screams 80s this is the one you want and this is it hate the back the translate there's

[01:18:59] alternate ones and if you hate pink ramps you can get clear versions now yeah very cool because

[01:19:05] they're probably broken anyway obviously what do you think about the next one run gold wing

[01:19:11] gold games I kind of like it I remember playing this it's a top gun rip off just like

[01:19:19] um khali wahit was the Miami vice rip off but this one it has a feature that is invariably

[01:19:28] disconnected on almost every on every one I've ever played do you know what that is like it's unplugged

[01:19:35] almost every one of these I've ever played I have no idea it has an air raid siren thing in it oh my

[01:19:41] god that would be annoying it's almost always disconnected because it is incredibly loud yeah

[01:19:50] like oh my god so this is September of 86 it sells 3,260 units designed by John Trudeau Larry

[01:19:59] day on our dawn marshal Larry day does the play field dawn marshal does the photo translate software by

[01:20:06] john purist so we're noticing a same team on every game everything's done by john Trudeau everything's

[01:20:11] done by Larry day and dawn marshal and everything's done by john purist nonstop here cranking

[01:20:16] him out man top gun of course from 1986 this was clearly a knockoff Steve Richie's f 14 Tomcat

[01:20:25] better than this oh yeah probably it's released in 1987 so got leave of course the innovator here

[01:20:33] with the knockoff theme Steve Richie of course did 10 white woods with f 14 Tomcat this this did not

[01:20:42] have 10 woods it has this weird offset flipper thing the flippers the bottom regular flippers are

[01:20:50] kind of offset to the right but then there's like a wide open left out lane that you're totally

[01:20:58] going to die right away but there's a flipper there to save it it's different it's a bit of a mess

[01:21:04] uh it plays fine I haven't played one so I can't really say but just looking at it it I am I

[01:21:09] going to lose my ball right away uh you will lose your ball eventually okay well now I mean if

[01:21:13] it's a if it's a knockoff it's got to be awesome yeah and and it's a knockoff again we have gold

[01:21:20] wings but it's in the top gun font I love how they just completely rip off the the font make it the

[01:21:26] same buddy's got his like flight jacket with the thumbs up in the aviators does it say whether he's

[01:21:31] a godly been player not he probably is it's got a insane topper it looks like an aircraft carrier

[01:21:38] with the with the chase lights on it which is super cool but it's you just supposed to be like

[01:21:43] you're the pilot and this is how it would look to you if you were taking off I mean it rip I mean

[01:21:48] it really rips off top gun to the point where it's got the almost the same pose with uh was it

[01:21:53] Tom Cruise and uh Kelly McGillis yeah on the on the motorbike which has nothing to do with aviation

[01:22:01] jet fighters but you know from the first jet thrust as the ball sores into play gold wings

[01:22:08] peaks your senses with the thrill of the game a total light and sound experience takes you through

[01:22:13] every stage of play the ball maneuvers around the play field up the ramp and through the loop with

[01:22:19] a speed of a true jet fighter with features like multi ball play eight digit scoring a real

[01:22:26] horribly loud siren I don't think it actually says that and a special light box attraction gold

[01:22:33] wings flies circles around the competition I have never seen one with the actual topper one thing

[01:22:39] I do want to talk about here is this really awesome ramp okay this is a ramp way back in the back

[01:22:50] left now there is a flipper kind of in the mid play field to help you hit this shot but it actually

[01:22:58] does a loop deloop like if you've seen that home Bruce sonic spin ball or if you've seen hot wheels

[01:23:06] and said why didn't they do a loop deloop it's because it was already done by premier technology

[01:23:11] how do you make it any better it goes vertical like uh like a 360 ramp but then comes out the other

[01:23:18] side how cool is that women it would be a 180 ramp one to 360 ramp like just to be a full circle

[01:23:25] you know I'm gonna turn this team around 360 degrees no but it does go 360 because it goes up

[01:23:31] in the same spot and comes down at the same spot it is on the right that's true how cool is that

[01:23:37] we got more plastic ramps and it's got like layered plastics so it sort of looks like clouds give

[01:23:46] it a try if you see it yeah it looks like it looks it's interesting I don't know if it shoots

[01:23:50] any fun it's got a great spinner into the pops which kind of looks like it sucks because I bet you

[01:23:54] the pops just smash it back into that spinner though but the air siren is so loud why would you do

[01:24:01] that I don't know all right money carlo says the gambling casino theme from February of 87 sells

[01:24:09] 4,315 units my goodness john trudot on design art by dawn marshal software bite john burus brokka

[01:24:17] record this is a photo translate of course which is a which was photographed at the gas like club

[01:24:26] in chicago alvin got leave is the older gentleman and gill polych is there in the bow tie

[01:24:33] and they are all standing in the background so it's fun because all of these trans lights and

[01:24:40] these flyers all have the people at got leave in them of course with models but they it's nice

[01:24:47] that they have all these fun little easter eggs in their flyers and stuff it's like that they have a

[01:24:52] got leave and a got leave it's like got leave inception well you know when it comes to money carlo

[01:24:56] don't gamble on the competition place your money on a sure bet features three ball multi ball

[01:25:03] roulette wheel we love the roulette wheel those always work and a 10 million point shot this isn't

[01:25:10] interesting design again they're just smashing the most you know it's it's okay I guess I haven't

[01:25:15] played it have you let me see the play field here I mean I'm sure I have I don't know if I remember

[01:25:22] yeah we're getting into ramps again that are more sort of orbit based ramps right on the left

[01:25:28] and right side and my goodness once again we've got the stargate rising ramp on the left side

[01:25:35] at least this ramp does return the ball back to the flipper on the right side so at least we're

[01:25:42] getting some movement back to the player here it also has a really cool shots shot on the left

[01:25:49] and right side can you explain with those no I don't know what that means well yeah shots is

[01:25:53] same as an alley pass when you pass for one flipper to another by letting the ball roll all the way

[01:25:58] to the very tip and then you flip it the last possible second and it actually goes up the other

[01:26:02] flippers in lane and you can actually go up and shoot a target in there that was of course famously

[01:26:07] brought back at iron maiden by Keith L one this also as you had mentioned as we were chatting does not

[01:26:15] have in lane switches in the play field but actually these kind of game look as very unusual I don't

[01:26:22] know if I've ever seen that it's very unusual yeah it's got a bunch of drop targets it's got what six

[01:26:30] ten drop targets four different banks two ramps it's a great looking looking a little playfields

[01:26:35] different that would be an alley today with that many drop targets that would put it away over budget

[01:26:41] and also has a plunge into a 180 scoop just like Jurassic Park from Stern

[01:26:47] Keith L one stealing all the ideas did he steal it because it was on almost all the John

[01:26:52] Papa do games World Cup soccer it's a 180 there's no Larry Day on the play field here and you can

[01:27:00] tell because it doesn't have that same sort of dark line hand drawn Larry Day design it's got a

[01:27:09] roulette wheel got a roulette wheels and can't get it should we talk about the peak of 80s cheese here

[01:27:14] when it comes to got labor on this one is unusual and that they go a little for usually got

[01:27:20] leap was known more for the family friendliness and the play field on this is not family friendly this

[01:27:28] is spring break it is a aquatic fun and happiness theme that's what it says that's what it says on

[01:27:34] IPB fun okay I had to take that directly it's from April of 87 it's a standard body sells 3550

[01:27:43] units concept by Jeff Walker John Trudeau Don Marshall and John Burris there's no manual ball shooter

[01:27:51] assembly the ball is launched into play by pressing the right flipper button oh that must be really

[01:27:59] annoying if this is the one where every ball starts with a multi ball this this game is a bit

[01:28:06] risque wouldn't you say forgot leave yes the flyers got a girl with no top covering it with her hands

[01:28:13] and a woman with a shell top bikini and another one into bikini and then you got down here

[01:28:21] laying in the sand is Jeff Walker buried in front of them he's doing he's living the dream

[01:28:28] well and the top of the woman who doesn't have a top is in front of him exactly um he's putting

[01:28:34] himself over pretty hard here on a lot of this stuff it's very 80s like coming of age party movie

[01:28:41] theme I guess it's okay right the art is and it's on the play field is pretty risky the girl with

[01:28:48] her top taken off and there's like a dog at the bottom who stole her bikini top what do you think

[01:28:55] of this game run try to pretty sure this is the game that starts with multi ball actually let's

[01:29:01] look at the fire I'm sure they would advertise that if something let's see premier brings the party

[01:29:06] to you featuring new automatic percentages and other words the thing that was first on high speed

[01:29:12] that will change the high score so it doesn't keep getting hit over so you're not winning free

[01:29:18] games will adjust multi image backlash in other words instead of one photograph it has several

[01:29:25] an automatic ball launcher so yeah every ball starts with multi ball so it just fires all the balls

[01:29:31] out until you lose all of them the in the the top lane lights the top lane rollovers are beach balls

[01:29:38] that's kind of fun it's the ultimate party I guess I haven't played it wouldn't know it's not

[01:29:43] really not really one for my living I think I definitely had to have played it once because I

[01:29:46] remembered the multi ball thing I mean you still get three turns but I believe it just fires out

[01:29:51] two three balls and once you lose them all that's considered your first ball your first turn very

[01:29:56] cool so then they did another conversion kit for amazon hunt two which was a conversion kit

[01:30:03] primarily made for the European market now we had mentioned this before what's with all these

[01:30:09] john trudo games why is he literally designed every game for the last what like four three years

[01:30:19] this is insane we're into 87 and he's done every game well at the time john trudo was their

[01:30:25] only designer you'll remember from our Williams pinball is dying episode that really the only

[01:30:33] designer that was left there was Barry Osler so in a similar fashion drawn true no was holding down

[01:30:41] the fort and keeping the lights on Gil Pollock would eventually hire Joe Kamen cow yes that Joe

[01:30:48] Kamen cow the one that's got a boatload of money a James Bond car and a bat mobile now eventually

[01:30:55] Gil Pollock would also hire john Norris and he would promote ray tanser from engineering into game

[01:31:03] designer of course management at this time wanted to wean off being a hundred percent dependent on

[01:31:11] john trudo now this caused a lot of tension at got leave when john trudo noticed that others were

[01:31:18] coming in it's also said that john trudo felt very threatened by Joe Kamen cow so he spent a lot

[01:31:26] of time politicking behind the scenes to eventually have Joe fired Joe was incredibly enthusiastic

[01:31:34] about his current design which would later be the class of 1812 and suddenly Joe was no longer

[01:31:43] employed at premier got leave now it took over a year before ray tanser and john norris would have

[01:31:51] their first games released but once they did the company had three full-time game designers

[01:31:59] who could keep the line going well that brings us into ray tansers first design which is arena

[01:32:06] a fantasy theme June of 1987 sells three thousand ninety nine units art by constantino and

[01:32:14] jenny Mitchell software by john bureus but he's still doing everything john bureus is still in on

[01:32:20] it doesn't seem like they're settling into a nice three thousand units per each game yeah they're

[01:32:25] just moving on to the next right they don't want to do too much they don't want to order too much

[01:32:30] this is a conanish theme or like gladiators battling thing ray tanser of course the new blood you'll

[01:32:38] hear a lot more about him in our episode two zombie pinball back from got leave system three and

[01:32:45] who is ray tanser laughter godly be joined say gap in ball in february nineteen ninety six they

[01:32:50] head up their mechanical engineering division saying where the company is they became stern pinball

[01:32:54] nineteen ninety nine up until the end of two thousand eight when he left the join namco wow a lot

[01:32:59] of people seem to leave stern in round two thousand yeah cuz that's when they fired everyone

[01:33:04] when they had the big downturn but he's back at stern now he managed the expansion of their latest

[01:33:09] facility which is now too small and he was also one of the guys responsible for all those

[01:33:16] metal ramps in the Ellen games oh I thought he was a venture yeah ventures he said you can

[01:33:22] use a metal ramp right there we we use it on stargate shoot the pair miss so that the the skill shot

[01:33:30] this game is all built around the skill shot arena how about that for a flyer yeah that's

[01:33:37] Conan I'm Conan you do not have to pay an isancing only for those who dare to enter the arena

[01:33:47] wow they're plugging this one enter the exciting world of arena got leaves newest hit I love how

[01:33:54] they know it's gonna be a hit like it's not even it's just out but we know it's gonna be hit

[01:33:58] combines the challenge of battle with the power and speed of pinball okay premier introduces

[01:34:05] another new concept combining photographic images and pinball art for a new exciting backlash

[01:34:13] the innovative music and pulsating sound add to the excitement of the challenge arena arena features

[01:34:22] also include a new flipper end of stroke switch and assembly a lighted tube ramp and new led strip

[01:34:31] huh interesting their flipper bats are still the same haven't changed those yeah this this game

[01:34:37] is all built around the skill shot which is called the pit basically plunge the ball it goes up and

[01:34:43] it goes like around this circle yeah it's like it's like a circle it's like a it's like one of

[01:34:51] those carnival games things we're trying to get the things just the right speed and you're trying

[01:34:56] to come up around the circle and have it take the right path so it goes into the the highest

[01:35:02] level yeah like if you plunge all the way too hard it goes all the way around and into the 25,000

[01:35:09] hole and if you plunge just right it goes right into the middle hole and then if you plunge not

[01:35:16] quite right it goes into the 50 or the 75,000 hole it's it's really kind of neat but I don't know if

[01:35:24] it looks fun because it a lot of it has to do with that that's the arena right like that's the pit

[01:35:31] and you're in there for like a second and then that's it and then you're kind of struggling down on

[01:35:36] the bottom play field I don't know what do you think I think I've only played it probably a couple

[01:35:40] times so the ramp is unique right because the ramp goes up across the play field on these tubes with

[01:35:47] led strips and then it goes back into the shooter lane so you're always back into the shooter lane

[01:35:53] into the pit back to the shooter lane into the pit and I love games to put you back in the shooter

[01:35:58] lane that is something that just I love that I don't know what it is about getting back into the shooter

[01:36:03] lane you know the walking dead or Star Trek or Star Wars or any of those older sort of gotleaves with

[01:36:12] the with the gate love that stuff but here it just looks annoying well actually has a gate it can

[01:36:18] go back to the flipper or go to the shooter lane I believe oh yeah at least that's what the

[01:36:24] flyer says and the flyer surely wouldn't lie it says it says it says back to the flipper or to the

[01:36:31] shooter lane and into the pit the pit you see the exact same sort of Connie Mitchell art that you

[01:36:40] see on a lot of the Williams of the era where it's like this these odd colors and he tries to make

[01:36:48] things look like rocks but it looks too cartoony doesn't really do it for me I I miss Larry Day all

[01:36:54] should also mention is the pit the arena is actually it's a upper play field yes yeah it sits above

[01:37:02] the play field that's right yeah it's kind of cool it's different you can tell that Ray Tanzer is

[01:37:07] trying something all new he's in you know the young blood but I don't know I don't think it really

[01:37:12] works but I would have to play a lot more than just look at it how about the next one though this is

[01:37:19] the one that everybody loves to talk about this is victory auto racing theme October of 87 3,315

[01:37:28] units John Trudeau Connie and Janine Mitchell this is sound by Dave Zabrisky and software by John

[01:37:35] pure shit is a genie or Janine or Janine yeah Janine you said Janine whatever what you said Janine

[01:37:44] spell Janine this is this is certainly a play field experiment wouldn't you say in what way it's

[01:37:51] particularly unique now victory was the first game that uses a fully screened photo realistic

[01:38:00] vitro graph vitro graph mylar overlay for its play field rather than the industry standard

[01:38:09] silk screening on the wood directly basically in a nutshell what this is is the art is printed on

[01:38:16] the mylar and then it stuck on to the play field was it hard top stuff that they have now it's

[01:38:23] it's like hard top stuff but this was much thinner than a hard top and at this time the major

[01:38:30] complaint amongst all of the the the operators were that these play fields were we're just disintegrating

[01:38:37] and the art was just falling off of them really really quickly so they realized after doing this

[01:38:44] they had a lot of significant adhesion problems and the pieces it was coming off the play field

[01:38:50] it looked horrible and it was not working then it then got leave went back to the standard silk

[01:38:55] screening on the wood rather than the mylar they but they did it for a few games they did it for

[01:39:01] victory they did it for time and lady they did it for tx sector yes and the art itself you can see

[01:39:07] is a lot less like hand drawny look and more it has this different look to it right like it has this

[01:39:17] photo realistic look but not necessarily like pictures like it was drawn art but it just looks

[01:39:24] different it does look different it's it's it's unusual it when you see it you'll know you have

[01:39:30] to look at it check out it on i p d b which is in the show the interesting thing we're looking at the

[01:39:35] victory play field here and i've never noticed this before but if you look at where the the x's are

[01:39:40] one x two x four x eight x and the font they're using doesn't that look a lot like hot wheels oh yeah

[01:39:47] that's kind of yeah i just like damn that looks just like hot wheels but the um victory game is all

[01:39:53] about the checkpoints you got to get through all the checkpoints and they're all lit in order you

[01:39:57] get one and then two lights and three lights and four lights it forces you to hit every single

[01:40:03] area of the play field so you're kind of chasing the blinking light but in a fun way i always liked it

[01:40:09] and it has the light strips along the ramps look pretty cool it also has an awesome spinner

[01:40:16] into like a kicker thing so you shoot the spinner and it goes into this spot where it rests

[01:40:21] and then the ball gets kicked up to the upper play field into a four drop target yep it's

[01:40:27] got an upper play field we should mention that the small it's actually not small it's the entire upper

[01:40:32] right hand side lots of drop targets lots of ramps stand-ups too but you can see that the crutch

[01:40:38] at got lead because those uh those flippers aren't as powerful as the Williams flippers that often

[01:40:44] the ramps are supplemented by really small flippers in front of them because that it's like they're

[01:40:51] trying to get enough power so the flipper has to be really close to the ramp or in this one you need

[01:40:58] the flippers to get up that you mean the upper play field yeah because you can get on the upper

[01:41:02] play field from the left ramp which is really far back but then there's also the right ramp from

[01:41:06] the kicker from the kicker yes right so it's like if you can't make the other ramp you got the one

[01:41:11] on the other side where there's uh instead of a flipper there's a device that flicks it up the

[01:41:16] play field some people say this is um john trudos best got lead game um because it's got awesome

[01:41:23] rules originally it had a little racetrack under the play field with a car that would move around the

[01:41:29] track but that was determined to be too expensive and was cost cut i could see that so the flier on

[01:41:35] this one says a great pinball tradition continues with victory and then it has a picture of the got

[01:41:44] lead factory which doesn't really scream oh i see it's got a huge flier load your weapons check your

[01:41:53] equipment and start your engines you're about to start the race of your life set your weapon

[01:41:58] sights on high earnings as you speed to each checkpoint yeah this is sort of like a death race

[01:42:05] theme as opposed to looks like a yeah a regular kind of car theme it's like a four page brochure

[01:42:11] it's quite large screech around corners over and under three ramps your adventure to the finish line

[01:42:18] race to your distributor with the checkered flag and claim your victory yeah it's kind of neat

[01:42:24] doesn't do it for me have you played it no fail i know this is what happens judgment the judgmental

[01:42:31] the other thing is i'm never i never get to go to a show to play them anyway right there's never any

[01:42:35] certain shows i would go to they'd have a whole row of all this air of got lead and no one would

[01:42:40] be playing them so i so i got to play them oh i would be on this real quick now the next one

[01:42:46] out of the gate here is diamond lady this is card game gambling theme it's from February of

[01:42:53] 88 two thousand seven hundred units designed by john norris a new name got Connie and

[01:43:01] gini Mitchell Dave Zabrisky and john norris on sound john software

[01:43:08] berris berris berris or however have i been saying burras yeah however you've been saying i'd

[01:43:14] say the same way i don't know how to say my i've probably been saying it wrong that's fine that's

[01:43:18] our gimmick john norris of course you can read up about him on our episode two zombie pinball got

[01:43:25] lead system three just like you did for rate handser now of course just in a nutshell john norris

[01:43:31] made some home bruise and he was a big collector of wood rails back in the day he first heard about

[01:43:36] pinball expo in the fall of 1985 he had made some resumes and some designs in a workbook he gave

[01:43:45] those directly to a bunch of manufacturers at chicago pinball expo and he didn't think he'd hear back

[01:43:51] from any of those companies about a month later he heard from gill paulich and he joined got lead

[01:43:56] wow so he was later that was the first text box 1985 so yeah so his first design was diamond lady

[01:44:03] diamond lady introduced a new back box design with extended side panels and with scoring displays

[01:44:13] and speakers located at the top of the back box that is a controversial design when it comes to

[01:44:22] having machines nowadays is that people often complain because it throws off the cemetery

[01:44:27] baldie did it so they weren't the only ones the woman who modeled for the manufacturers flyer and

[01:44:33] the backlash also appears on the international concepts 1989 really I did not know that

[01:44:42] yes the same person so if you look up I see his night moves the the little game yeah it's

[01:44:49] little cocktail pinball machine yep and you know who designed that yes mr. Trudeau the second

[01:44:55] game with the vitriogrid vitri graph playfield yes diamond lady and the play in the artist completely

[01:45:03] different between the two the vitro graph and the self screen versions are completely different

[01:45:09] and this again when you look at the play field the the model that's on the play field is photo

[01:45:16] realistic so it's not hand drawn art it's not photoshop it's like this weird whatever

[01:45:22] everywhere in the 80s and it all and she's everywhere she's in the in lane the out lane yeah she

[01:45:28] might be more places that Arnold was in t3 look at this let's try to catch a lot two three four five six

[01:45:33] seven eight she's like eight right off the top of my you know just looking at it pretty funny in

[01:45:38] front of every sort of major thing to shoot at she's in front of it what's interesting here is that

[01:45:43] it has a drop target between the flippers is like a ball first to do that but probably the first

[01:45:48] in a while to do that yeah super super cool and you can tell that there is a different designer in

[01:45:55] town because we have a lot of different sort of shots tons of drop targets two very cool flippers

[01:46:03] it's a great looking little game here and this is one of Chuck words from the tpn streaming and

[01:46:08] sdtm he just he loves this game loves it that plunge looks familiar doesn't it another 180 another 180

[01:46:16] back to the flipper who would have thought that somebody like john norris would steal ideas from a

[01:46:23] young Keith L you know I could argue how about black knight the original it has the same 180 ramp that's

[01:46:30] how it gets up the upper playfield that's how most of those get to the upper playfield those

[01:46:34] pi level games I guarantee you there's probably a wood rail made in the 40s that uses it yeah what I

[01:46:40] really like about this is is the translate the photo translate okay is photo on the top it's

[01:46:49] like a playing cards the queen of diamonds but then on the other side she's hand drawn it like

[01:46:55] changes from photo realistic into hand drawn it's actually really cool effect it looks really really

[01:47:00] nice have you played a lot of diamond lady yes what are your thoughts so good game it's different

[01:47:06] but different in a good way the shots are a lot of fun deal yourself a winning hand with diamond

[01:47:12] lady see what we got here so any gold so any gold on the second page here uh got diamond lady

[01:47:18] carries got leaves part replacement limited warranty for one year on all basic and machine parts

[01:47:25] and a 90 days on printed certainly better than today's companies warranty then there's an

[01:47:32] asterisk see them manufacturers part replacement limited warranty for specific details items and

[01:47:37] conditions diamond lady is built with the vitro graph easy maintenance where resistant playfield

[01:47:44] surface patent bending boy wonder wonder if they're still making money from that patent no

[01:47:50] yes this is a john norris's first game and I think you know for a first game out of the gate I

[01:47:55] think it's a I think it's a winner you do if you look at it you do realize what it's an homage to

[01:48:00] hmm nice you may have said this too if you look at the drop-target arrangement I believe it's a

[01:48:06] of volley the e m volley yeah basically it's a the banks are pretty much the same spot yeah it's

[01:48:13] it's volley with a ramp it's got kind of a neat ramp in the back left yeah it's neat yep it's

[01:48:19] very cool orbit spinner oh yeah he knows he knows it also has this really kind of neat spinner

[01:48:27] into a loop right next to the ramp the way that it goes up there and hits the spinner and then

[01:48:33] kind of loops around the edge of the spinner is very cool very cool he'd reuse that again in another

[01:48:38] really great design but we'll get to that in a minute this brings us to the darling of the tournament

[01:48:46] text which is tx sector it's a sci-fi theme it is march of 1988

[01:48:54] 2,336 units so not a big seller designed by john truto constantino and genie michael

[01:49:03] software by john burress or burress whatever play fields now there are three different play fields

[01:49:09] for tx sector out there so depending on when it was manufactured yours may be different

[01:49:14] there's of course the laminated a vitri graph play field a screen printed play field with

[01:49:22] light trapezoids and a silk screen play field with darker trapezoids yeah which one's more

[01:49:28] designed which ones are rare which ones worth more which which is the one that you got that you

[01:49:33] can flip for seven and a half thousand dollars so Dave can't afford to take all machines anymore

[01:49:38] they decided to get rid of vitri graph after this game yes probably not that one

[01:49:41] vitri graph is probably the one you don't want now this play field has a really cool plunge

[01:49:47] so the plunge goes up into a wire form around the left of the play field in an arcing motion

[01:49:53] and then down to a third flipper where you never want to flip the ball from I pretty much want to

[01:49:59] hit the lit spinner yes this game is two spinners one on the left kind of in the middle of the playfield

[01:50:06] one on the right kind of in the middle of the play field if you go in the left in lane or the

[01:50:11] right in lane it will change which spinner is lit for 10,000 a spin and all you do is shoot them

[01:50:20] spinners it's kind of fun however there is multi ball and the balls we can transport it from one

[01:50:27] area the play field to another yes so the got leave invention here is that they invented transport

[01:50:35] technology where the ball goes up a ramp into a saucer and the game transports it from that side

[01:50:44] of the play field to the other isn't that awesome it is awesome how did they have the money to do

[01:50:50] transport technology but not the money to actually make decent code code is fine it's more the

[01:50:57] experience of the game it has an incredible sound package it's probably what is incredible most

[01:51:03] known for and just the completely bizarre artwork including the back glass sorry the translate that

[01:51:10] is just I don't even know what it's supposed to mean it just looks it's like it's like a guy

[01:51:15] transporting but he's like faded in and out out of focus and like what does it even it looks like

[01:51:21] the translate has been the bottom of it has been dipped in water someone someone's but some

[01:51:27] of us will be around it or something it's just yeah it's all it's all like peeling down or

[01:51:32] it's very odd it's it doesn't make any sense but this is where you'll often get the term power

[01:51:38] drain a lot of people will talk about oh it a power drain out the left side or something the background

[01:51:44] somebody else in the background will say that yeah it has speech kind of that's one of the things

[01:51:49] that says but even the speech is just weird makes it these weird sounds and they're all good it's

[01:51:55] a cool it's a cool game I have played a lot of tx sector actually I had the opportunity to buy one

[01:51:59] but just spinners all the time I don't know if I can handle that you don't have to play it that way

[01:52:05] yeah but you do if you want to you know get a score but it's also but I mean for a do the thing game

[01:52:14] like spinners that change based on on on in lane and are based on the in lanes that's a pretty good

[01:52:20] do the thing txtxtxtxtxt, teleport yourself into a new dimension in pinball where reality ends

[01:52:27] and adventure begins don't miss it how about this 80's lady with the with the super crazy

[01:52:37] i make up pointy-eye makeup, it's cool, it's a cool game I really like it it's a tournament

[01:52:42] dartling I think it was in a lot of tournament streams people wanted after that here's where thing

[01:52:49] get a little bit kind of interesting and I found this story and I think it's kind of cool.

[01:52:54] So there was an operator meeting at a trade show around this time. Now it was likely with

[01:52:59] Gil Pollock and some of the designers. Some of the operators had a discussion around how great

[01:53:06] Sinbad, Countdown, and 8-ball Deluxe were when it came to earnings a few years ago.

[01:53:13] They were simple to understand, easy to maintain, and they earned a lot of money.

[01:53:20] Now when it comes to Sinbad and Countdown, those are basically what the best system won games.

[01:53:27] And 8-ball Deluxe, one of the greatest of all time in the class of Ballet 1981.

[01:53:34] The idea came up in this meeting to make new versions of those games with a modern look, theme,

[01:53:41] and feel. So this is where we get into some unique games. This one being really, really cool

[01:53:48] and one that I wish I could play, Robo War. Sci-fi Battle Theme from April of 88,

[01:53:55] sells 2,130 units, designed by John Trudeau and John Norris, Connie and Genie on art, and John

[01:54:05] Beerus on software. I would take Robo War over TX sector any day because it is an updated version

[01:54:14] of Sinbad and I love Sinbad. I also love sci-fi so it fits pretty well within my wheelhouse.

[01:54:22] So this is an updated version of Sinbad? Yeah. Robo War, where skill and fast action collide.

[01:54:31] The back glass is like this moon-based planet thing with these saucer-looking imperial walkers,

[01:54:40] shooting lasers. I assume they're robots and they're in war. Very, very, very cool. So when you look

[01:54:47] at this play field, Ron, when you bring it up on IPDB, link is in the show notes as always. You

[01:54:53] can see Sinbad. There's a set of a single target on the orbit. There's a four targets. There's

[01:55:02] two in the middle and the three on the right. Never really saw that, but yeah, it is. It also has a

[01:55:09] friggin stargate ramp on the left side. So it lifts up. You shoot under it. It goes to the top lanes.

[01:55:17] If you shoot up it, it goes across a wire form and into a capture.

[01:55:23] It's a close stargate ramp because it was on stargate or is it called a stargate ramp?

[01:55:27] Because it was on the first like a Mars God of War. Yeah. It's also in spirit and it's

[01:55:33] called stargate on that too. Right. Anyway, this is a really cool game. I really think this is cool.

[01:55:39] This is definitely one that would be in my collection. Regardless of the silly looking

[01:55:46] back box with the speakers on the top. But they point right at your head where they should.

[01:55:51] Yeah, instead of at your like nipples. So have you played Robo War?

[01:55:56] Probably. It's another tournament darling. They're all about these internaments.

[01:56:01] I think you lock a ball and you hit a ramp. Something like that. Yeah.

[01:56:05] Yeah. The next one. This is the most perfect version of eight ball deluxe that you can get.

[01:56:12] And that is. Oh, no, I'm sorry. That is bad girls. It's eight ball deluxe with multi ball.

[01:56:22] It is November 88. They sell 2,500 units. That's kind of a bummer. This is designed by John Trudeau.

[01:56:30] No, John Trudeau and John Norris. It's got music by Dave Zabrisky and Craig B. Airwaltz

[01:56:39] and software by Bob Wilson. And of course, art is always by Connie and Jeannie Mitchell.

[01:56:47] So what's up with this? This Bob Wilson on software. What is John Burris? He did everything

[01:56:53] for like five years. Well, John Burris was the director of software. He programmed most of the ADB

[01:57:01] games. Bob Wilson was hired and so was Alan Edwell. He was of course from the system 80 era and

[01:57:09] has been rehired. Now at the towards the end here, John Burris was given a staff.

[01:57:17] Management wanted more than an eight ball deluxe ripoff and John had some great ideas. So he was

[01:57:24] able to work with somebody new while Burris was on a different project. Basically, what John

[01:57:31] Norris did is he flipped the play field. He added multi ball, a very target, which makes every game

[01:57:37] better. And a translucent pool rack on the play field. Of course, in this area, you got to add a

[01:57:44] couple of ramps. And there are some really cool shots. Do you love bad girls as much as I do?

[01:57:52] I don't know if I've played it more than once. I need to get more time on it. This this game is

[01:57:58] criminally underrated. And the reason it's criminally underrated is because of the yards.

[01:58:06] But let's talk a little bit about the play field itself. It's got drop targets all on the left side.

[01:58:12] Which is awesome, right? It has two spinners. It's got one spinner on the left side kind of in the

[01:58:19] middle of the play field. Right squeeze it right by the pop bumper. And then it has another spinner

[01:58:26] on the left side in the far back. But when you hit that far right spinner, it loops around a ball

[01:58:33] guide and comes back down the spot. And that spinner just goes and goes and goes and goes. And it's

[01:58:40] such an awesome shot. It's basically the mirror image of the diamond lady spinner loop. But it's

[01:58:48] for some reason it's done so much better on this game. And I can't explain why. But it's you can

[01:58:54] see it better. It spins faster. It's so cool. It has the John Trudeau window. It has the window

[01:59:01] in the middle of the play field. But there's nothing below the play field like a rotating sculptor toy.

[01:59:09] It basically just has lights that light up. And it makes it look like a fancy digital display.

[01:59:14] But it's just some lights on some glass. It's actually kind of a need effect. I think the game

[01:59:20] would be better if it didn't have it. Because then you could put in some kind of need more art.

[01:59:24] But it also has three ladies on the play field. And they are seriously hardcore 80s images. Like it is

[01:59:36] it is 80s 80s 80s. They're bad girls. They play pool apparently. Apparently good girls don't play pool.

[01:59:43] It's got a Vuck which is awesome into the into the pop bumpers. The drop bank has two sets of

[01:59:51] recoil two sets of reset. And that's two sets. That's two reset coils. Whatever. It's got those

[01:59:58] things. They do stuff. And it's got mirror blades. Yeah, but they're on the outside of the cabinet.

[02:00:05] Not the inside. Yeah, that does. So you have mirrors. You can look at yourself

[02:00:10] if you're standing next to the game. Yeah, it's so weird. So weird. Now this is a pretty

[02:00:17] risqué translate. Wouldn't you say again, for Gottlieb? This is a different risqué than

[02:00:25] the spring break one. So the reason this backlash is very risqué.

[02:00:32] The bad girls who are playing pool. They have like stockings that stop just below their dresses.

[02:00:46] And they've got those garter belts hanging out. And they don't have shoulders on their dresses.

[02:00:56] It's iconic 80s. And it's not particularly offensive. But they're very sexualized. Let's put it that way.

[02:01:10] This actually caused a lot of problems in Gottlieb at the time. Well, the models, they were

[02:01:17] friends of Gil Pollock. Of course they would be. Because everybody has a bunch of models for

[02:01:23] friends. But John Nora says I'd suggested that they include a G rated translate like the flyer

[02:01:29] photo and include it inside a cardboard tube with each game. But management decided not to do that.

[02:01:34] Probably due to the added expense. Yeah, they know that the target audience in pinball machines.

[02:01:40] And we talked about this a lot in our, um, ballet, art episodes, our teenage boys. And you know,

[02:01:49] you're trying to get teenage boys to spend more time around your machine. And the best thing to do

[02:01:55] is to put ladies in suggestive clothing. 1980s high heel pumps.

[02:02:03] Gloves, I guess, are sexy. I don't know. It's a, it's a bit much. But it, but it's pretty cool.

[02:02:11] I'm not going to lie. In fact, this was the era when they started testing the waters for a new

[02:02:18] board set. John Norris would say that there were 10 bad girls that were released to test system

[02:02:25] three hardware. The games were shipped to a distributor called New Orleans novelty. So

[02:02:31] you might have one of those fancy super rare system three hardware bad girls. So we've done

[02:02:38] Sinbad. We've made it pretty awesome for the new era. We've done the new eight ball deluxe,

[02:02:46] which I think is probably the best version of eight ball deluxe. What do we only have one left?

[02:02:52] And that's countdown. The new age updated super awesome countdown countdown being the best system

[02:03:02] one is necrrect. I'll go with that. So we get ex caliber, which is a fantasy night theme from 1988

[02:03:09] in November. So it's 1,710 units. That's not good. It's designed by John Trudeau and John Norris.

[02:03:16] Art by Connie and Jeannie Mitchell and software by Rob Wilson. And I put probably on that because

[02:03:23] he's uncredited, but some people have mentioned it in other sources that I've had. So I put his name

[02:03:30] in there anyway. What I find funny is that these distributors had these conversations that they

[02:03:36] wanted these updated versions of these games because they sold well and they earned well and all

[02:03:42] that other stuff. But Robo War sells 2,130 units. Bad girls sells 2,500 units. Now we've got ex caliber

[02:03:52] sells 1,710. So these major distributors kind of put that out there and made the manufacturer do

[02:04:00] it. And then they didn't back it up. They didn't buy the units. So that's a pretty sleazy thing if

[02:04:05] you ask me. So this is countdown. And would you say that this is a new updated fun version of countdown?

[02:04:13] Let's see the play field. Let's see. Oh yeah. Again, I never noticed that before. Now I'm looking at

[02:04:20] the play field. Yep. It's countdown. Ladies and gentlemen, David Dennis has taught Ron Hallett

[02:04:26] a massive thing when it comes to pinball. And it's less dropped targets at the top. It looks like,

[02:04:31] but it is it is countdown. They added a ramp. Wire form. This machine probably has one of the

[02:04:39] worst plunges in pinball history. So you plunge the ball. It goes around the orbit. It goes up a ramp

[02:04:47] and then into a diverter to the left or right, which goes down into a capture saucer. And then it has

[02:04:55] a center ramp right in the middle of the play field. And that center ramp goes right up. And then

[02:05:01] again, into the diverter, which goes to the left or right capture hold. But you can't ever get up

[02:05:07] the ramp from the back again. You can only get up that way from the plunge. It seems a bit of a waste.

[02:05:14] But it is countdown. And countdown is a lot of fun. I think this game is fun. And that's what Chuck

[02:05:23] work tells me. He has one of these two. I don't know why he's got all these odd god leaves. But he

[02:05:27] says this game is a lot of fun. And he enjoys a connoisseur of fine play fields. Yes, he just wishes

[02:05:33] that center ramp was a little bit different. Like for example, if you shoot up the ramp and the

[02:05:40] diverter is there, it goes to the left and to the right. And then it had a traditional plunge. He

[02:05:44] said other than putting the ramp in kind of gets it all in a weird situation. But he says he really

[02:05:50] likes this game. So I take his word on it. But what do you think about the theme? It's like

[02:05:56] knights and dungeons and dragons kind of thing. Medieval madness. It works. X caliber.

[02:06:04] Charge onto the battlefield of X caliber. As you choose your strategy with the plunge or shot,

[02:06:10] try to earn up to 250,000 points and select your shield targets for lock up. Battle your way through

[02:06:17] the shield targets to storm the castle and save the princess from the evil knight. Wow.

[02:06:23] Yeah, so the rules of this game were very much done by John Norris, who is very much

[02:06:31] engaged in the rules of his game. John Trudeau, for example, would often do the play field pass it

[02:06:37] on to the next. Do the play field pass it on. And somebody else would do the rules. John Norris

[02:06:41] really takes a lot of pride, a lot of energy into designing all the rules on his play field.

[02:06:47] Chuck word has told me that the rules here are actually very good and make this game actually shine

[02:06:54] regardless of kind of how of a bit of a disappointment that center ramp is.

[02:07:00] I find it interesting is they're using the term multi-ball, which was trademarked by Williams.

[02:07:06] So either Williams didn't feel like suing them because they made a data exchange it or they were

[02:07:11] paying Williams to be able to use that. Yeah, a 10 cents every time that a flyer was was printed.

[02:07:20] Now Connie and Janine, Genie, of course, Connie was, Connie Mitchell, of course, was always the

[02:07:29] kind of artist that really went all in on the ladies. Right. If you look at a lot of his Williams

[02:07:36] art, you can certainly see that. And this game had an original back glass, which was very sort of

[02:07:46] shiny, sexy robots. I don't understand how that's ex caliber, but that was nixed for the back

[02:07:55] glass that they inevitably went with, which was more of a night in armor leading the charge on a

[02:08:02] battlefield, which actually looks really cool. Yeah, they're going away from the photo back glasses

[02:08:07] too. Yeah, you can see that they're they're moving in this now. The last three games,

[02:08:15] you know, TX sector kind of had a mixture, you know, diamond lady had a mixture.

[02:08:20] Now they're moving back into those those back glasses. I would probably say that the photo

[02:08:26] back glass is probably had much higher budgeting than just paying Connie Mitchell to design something

[02:08:33] and along with the play field. You know what I mean? Oh, man, oh man, that bad girls translate.

[02:08:39] Whoo. We are coming into the home stretch here, Ron. We're talking about Big House,

[02:08:46] cops and robbers theme. April of 1989, standard body sells 1,977 units,

[02:08:55] designed by Ray Tanzer, Connie and Genie Mitchell on the art, software by Bob Wilson and Alan Edwell.

[02:09:07] We're seeing the return of a name here, Alan Edwell, who is on the software. Alan, of course,

[02:09:14] was a gifted programmer who was very, very fast at his programming. All of the games at this time

[02:09:21] were programmed in assembly language and the designer would often come to work early. They would

[02:09:26] play the prototype. They would create a bug or a change list by late morning and they would pass it

[02:09:32] back to Alan. Alan would always have everything completed on the designer's list for the next morning

[02:09:41] and the cycle would continue. This person was a machine. Now they typically only had a couple of weeks

[02:09:49] to tweak game rules once the play field was complete and to fix any bugs before production.

[02:09:56] I bet it was great to not have to worry about bugs when you were shipping a game and since they

[02:10:03] worked so closely with somebody like Alan and so fast, they could often pull a lot of those bugs

[02:10:10] out of the game. Gottlieb's policy, of course, was to never release a software update unless there

[02:10:17] was a major bug. They were on to the next thing. This was often why the programming and code for

[02:10:24] these games was kind of ho hum because they were banging out games and as long as it just didn't crash,

[02:10:30] it was good to go. Don't you think? Yeah, unless it was Alien Star, they actually did release

[02:10:35] update for that one. Yeah, so Big House is kind of a neat little game for sure. Now the back glass

[02:10:43] is really kind of fun because it's like a bunch of dogs who are breaking out of jail,

[02:10:50] but the dogs are drawn in a very distinctive format that look like some old school actors of the time.

[02:11:00] Do you know who these actors are? One is Edward G. Robinson, with the cigar in his mouth.

[02:11:04] But they're obviously not paying license for these. No, like this is. But they're those famous

[02:11:11] actors, those gangster actors in sort of the late 50s. Edward G. Robinson's like 30s.

[02:11:18] Oh, I have a question for you. Are your collections in solitary confinement?

[02:11:23] Oh, break out with bigger earnings with Gottlieb's Big House. I like this game.

[02:11:30] This is a cool game. I'm not going to lie. The Playfield art is a bit worrisome.

[02:11:36] It doesn't look very nice because it's going for kind of that, again, that world under glass of a

[02:11:43] bunch of people breaking out, but it's very blue and green and there's lots of inserts. It's just a bit

[02:11:50] modeled. Oh, they have a name for it. See, I always call it the corkscrew. There's a really cool

[02:11:54] like corkscrew thing that your ball goes in and it goes up and rises up. I didn't realize Gottlieb

[02:12:00] actually had a name for it. They called it the mechanical auger. Yeah, it's like a snowblower auger.

[02:12:08] Or when you go ice fishing, you use an auger to cut into the ice, but you wouldn't know that.

[02:12:15] Yay. And as a new improved Stargate ramp. Oh, God. But the best thing about this game is when you

[02:12:23] in multi ball starts, you're escaping from prison and all the lights go out and there's like a

[02:12:28] spotlight. And I think the spotlight moves around. So that's like when Guns of Roses came out,

[02:12:34] like, oh, moving spotlight sets new. I was thinking, wait a minute, I'm pretty sure Big House did that.

[02:12:39] Yeah, it's kind of in the back. It's like in the backboard. It moves left to right. And it makes

[02:12:44] a sign like a spot. You're escaping from prison. It also has like a ball and chain that hangs from

[02:12:51] the center. It's sort of like a bash toy thing. But if that thing breaks or is in like, rust it or

[02:12:57] something, it's basically impossible to replace because it's not like you could just take a regular

[02:13:03] pinball and drill a hole in it. It's really hard to do something like that. This is a very fun

[02:13:08] underrated game. I played this twice on location one time and I really enjoyed it. Again,

[02:13:15] Playfield Art is a bit busy and a bit muddled, but it is fun and different. It's super neat.

[02:13:20] I really enjoyed it. Ray Tanzard did a lot of really fun things with this game. He included what

[02:13:26] you wanted, dropped targets, a couple of cool ramps and a fun kind of experience. Hot shots from

[02:13:35] April of 1989, 2342 units. This thing was designed by John Norris and Art once again, Connie,

[02:13:49] Jeannie, the software Bob Wilson and Alan Ed will again. This is Carnival theme. Carnival's cool,

[02:13:59] Ron. I've really had them out here where I am, honestly. Are sexy carnivals cool, Ron? Oh,

[02:14:07] is that what this is? This is a sexy car. Well, enjoy the Carnival atmosphere with Gottlieb's

[02:14:12] Hot Shots. Shoot the blue elephants, red cuckoo clocks, yellow chickens, and green frogs.

[02:14:20] Yauza challenged the teddy bear targets to achieve extra ball and special. Hit the hot ramps for

[02:14:26] explosive action. Enjoy the Kaliope music and listen carefully for the bonus countdown freeze feature.

[02:14:34] Hot Shots is more fun than a monkey riding a blue elephant. That's pretty fun. Come one, come all.

[02:14:41] A kaleidoscope of fun. But on the back glass, this is where we're going to, this is where I get

[02:14:47] into it here. We've got like these 20 something girls and they're all in skirts and high heels. One is

[02:14:54] bent over spraying a water gun. The other girl has her shirt missing and she's hugging a teddy bear.

[02:15:02] And there's like this creepy like eight year old kid like looking up from underneath the cabinet.

[02:15:10] It's very weird. It again, it's the hottest action in pinball. But we've gone back to a photo

[02:15:17] backlash or translate. I should say. That's right. When it comes to like bad girls and hot shots,

[02:15:23] when we want ladies to entice teenage boys to put money in the pins, we're going photo

[02:15:28] backlash. If we're going robots in space, we're just getting somebody to draw it. And then

[02:15:35] interesting. I have never played hot shots. I've never even seen one. But it's got a boatload

[02:15:42] of drop targets up the center of the play field. Two massive, massive drop target.

[02:15:49] Tons of color. There are 16 drop targets in the shape of a V in the center of the play field.

[02:15:58] Almost reminds me of a cue ball wizard. Yeah. That's good observation. It's got a pop bumper

[02:16:03] in the middle that's got those things. It's got blue targets, red targets, yellow targets,

[02:16:08] red targets. And then it's got some ramps on the left and right sides. It's got lots of clowns

[02:16:13] before they were deemed to be evil. Yes. These were happy clowns and happy times.

[02:16:19] Yeah. You can see that the play field has a different direction than the backlash. You can

[02:16:23] obviously tell the backlash was like, how do we get teenage boys to play this game? And the

[02:16:27] artistic quality of the actual play field is really fun. It's really, really good. You haven't

[02:16:32] played this. I never remember playing that. You got me on that one. If you've played this,

[02:16:36] you've got a little bit of extra insight. The return of course of the drop target between the flippers.

[02:16:44] John Norris of course, one of his things. And then it also has a post behind it. So it gives

[02:16:49] you an extra save. I don't know if I've ever seen one of those. Interesting. This brings us to the

[02:16:54] end of the 80 B line. And that is Bone Busters. This is a spooky haunted skeleton ghost busters theme.

[02:17:06] This is from August of 1989 2000 units designed by Ray Tanzer, Constantino and Genie Mitchell with

[02:17:16] Brian R Johnson on art music by Dave Zabrisky and Craig B. Airewaltz and software by Bob Wilson

[02:17:25] and Alan Edgel. Hey, you know what this has? The first game to have? What's that? The new

[02:17:31] got the flipper bats. Ooh, the pointy ones. The crappy ones. This is a massive ghost busters ripoff.

[02:17:42] If you even look at the bone busters flyer for this down in the bottom left, there's a guy in a

[02:17:50] gray jumpsuit with a backpack shooting skeletons. Proton pack. But this isn't a proton pack. This is like

[02:17:57] it. This looks like a little radio. I imagine that and he has a logo. Imagine the ghost busters logo

[02:18:02] without the ghost busters. So it's just a circle with the cross through it. And that's exactly what it

[02:18:07] looks like. I don't know if this was supposed to be ghost busters and they just couldn't get the

[02:18:10] license or afford it. But they leaned pretty hard into the fact that this is a ghost busting

[02:18:18] game, if you will. From the flyer says new flipper design. New shaped bat. New lighter flipper

[02:18:25] assembly. Design with it. Design. I think it's misprinted design with the same. Yeah, I think it

[02:18:32] says design, but yes, design with the same quality we used for this flyer and reliability is our

[02:18:37] old flipper unit. Wrong. New longer stroke or flipper coil. Yeah. Way longer as in you can

[02:18:44] trap everything. Tundston and the stroke all new die cast plunger assembly. It's funny to see the

[02:18:51] marketing for that. When anyone would tell you it is far inferior flipper assembly than what

[02:18:56] they used before. Yeah, they just when you change something, you got to spend all your time convincing

[02:19:01] people. But when you read that, it's clearly better. Yeah, it's like when they change the

[02:19:05] arch on a cereal box, they just freak out and they got to put, you know, same cereal different look.

[02:19:10] And you know when they were plugging the new fluorescent tube and how great that was, that wasn't

[02:19:15] one of our previous flyers, right? What do they say now? They say let the game talk for itself.

[02:19:20] New cabinet design. New light box hinging. New reinforced cabinet to light box mounting.

[02:19:26] Light box mounting screws. New thumb screw design. No need to fumble with ratchets or wrenches.

[02:19:32] No more fluorescent tube. New insert with incandescent lamps for new more exciting light shows.

[02:19:40] Yes, remember those really crappy fluorescent tubes we had in there? This is the better one,

[02:19:46] which is basically what we used to do. Yes. Nice. Sales. They're on the sales hard. Let the

[02:19:52] game speak for itself. This game has one of the coolest toppers of all time. This nobody ever

[02:20:00] talks about the bone buster's topper. It's a skull that friggin talks with like a do rag and an

[02:20:07] eyeball that's missing. And he moves around and talks. So before black night sort of rage did it,

[02:20:13] it had a talking head topper. So cool. Now Ray Tanzer is the guy who's very much a kitchen sink kind of

[02:20:20] fellow. The plunge goes up to an upper play field made of like vacuum formed plastic. It goes up

[02:20:28] and then you go into another wire form which goes into a flipper. You can shoot back up into

[02:20:37] that area into the flipper. You open the flipper to go down the left side. You leave the flipper

[02:20:42] closed to go back into the shooter lane. It's all over the place. It's got springs with these two

[02:20:50] things in the middle of the play field that just sort of spring around on the end which make no

[02:20:55] sense. It's got a creepy, creepy skull in the middle of the play field. So creepy. Only one pop

[02:21:03] bumper on the left side. Two spinners count to two. What do you think of this game run? I haven't

[02:21:09] played it, but it must be something. It's something. It's interesting. Do you have any high points for

[02:21:14] this game that you're like, wow, I wish, wish Keith L one would steal that. I haven't played it

[02:21:20] enough to be honest. Drop targets maybe. We all love drop targets. Yeah. It's a bit muddled.

[02:21:27] I don't mind it. It's very pink. It's got other colors. But yeah, it's very pink. It's like

[02:21:33] class of 1812 on steroids. Now Brian R Johnson would say, I joined at the tail end of bone

[02:21:41] busters. Most of the art was already complete. I did, however, pencil and ink, some small spot

[02:21:48] illustrations of skeletons doing various activities like riding a tandem bike or playing catch.

[02:21:56] They were used in several places throughout the game. And if you go into IPDB, you can see all of

[02:22:02] these skeletons doing all these really weird things. It's a lot of fun. It's you could tell the

[02:22:11] team that made this had a good laugh while they made while they did it. Ron, that brings us to the

[02:22:18] end of our podcast today. We've spoke this month about one of the coolest and most trendy

[02:22:28] eras in pinball, which was the system 80 B era, which was the best game we talked about here, Ron.

[02:22:35] Best game out of all the ones. That's a good question. Well, we did mention Alien Star.

[02:22:45] There are a lot of good games in there. I gotta go bad girls. I think bad girls is probably

[02:22:53] the best shooter and has some really cool fun eight ball deluxe style multi ball rules.

[02:23:01] Heck of a heck of a game. Great designer. A cheesy and fun art package. A good close second.

[02:23:11] We gotta do a shout out to tag team pinball. Yeah, I like tag team. Heck of a game. I like victory too.

[02:23:18] Sue me. Yeah, what we're gonna do is I'm gonna throw up on our Facebook. What do you think was

[02:23:23] the best game that we spoke about in the system 80 B era? Leave a comment. I'd love to hear from you.

[02:23:30] So would Ron. Ron, if you could have any one of these games in your collection, which would it be?

[02:23:37] I like victory, but I also like tag team. But I think overall for the most or the most

[02:23:42] longevity, probably something like bad girls. There you go. There you go. We have now inflated the

[02:23:47] value of bad girls and nobody can afford it anymore. And I would say we had a pinball show.

[02:23:54] Don't be a ballie William Snob. You see these scott leaves. Give them a try. You might actually like

[02:24:00] them. Their playfills are completely different than anything else you're gonna play.

[02:25:20] Raven is a very decisive game. I enjoy the vyingness.

[02:25:30] Devasive. This is Raven is a very divisive device.

[02:25:36] What's divisive? Or is that a Canadian thing? I don't know.

[02:25:39] And don't forget my other podcast, which is much coofeier than this one. Not nearly as professional.

[02:25:46] That would be the slam tilt podcast. Me and my co host Bruce Nightingale, where we talk about pinball

[02:25:53] from beautiful upstate New York. I'm gonna start charging you for that. Hey, we mentioned this show.

[02:25:58] I'm my show cross pollination. Or no, I didn't use the right term there.

[02:26:05] John Trudeau would say that this was his homage to firepower and his homage.

[02:26:10] You're from you're from Albany. You guys know all about hockey. I'm from Albany and yes,

[02:26:15] we do know all about hockey. Is that right next? Is that right next to Albany?

[02:26:20] Genesis offers a multiplier.

[02:26:23] Genesis offers a multiple capability.

[02:26:28] Yeah, go ahead. Find out who it is so we don't look like idiots.

[02:26:31] Because of our poll, well, let me start that again.

[02:26:34] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, poll. I'm sorry, sorry.
