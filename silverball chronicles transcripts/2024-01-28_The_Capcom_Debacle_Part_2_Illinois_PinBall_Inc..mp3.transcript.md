[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:07] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:16] I wonder if Stewie likes Capcom.

[00:17] It's Stewie.

[00:18] What's your favorite Capcom game?

[00:20] Breakshot.

[00:21] Definitely breakshot.

[00:50] Hello there, Cronies.

[00:54] I'm really, really sorry I totally messed up the introduction in this month's episode.

[01:01] However, you can always visit our Patreon, remember to listen to all the commercials, and

[01:05] of course, nobody really likes that other show that Ron is on, the Slam till podcast.

[01:12] That's the one with Bruce Nightingale.

[01:14] Anyway, no introduction this month.

[01:16] We're just going to jump right into the content.

[01:19] Enjoy.

[01:20] Part 2 of the Capcom debacle.

[01:24] Illinois pinball ink.

[01:28] There's this romance of when companies go out, and we still have that today.

[01:34] So when companies go under, there's like this weird romance of like, what if it could

[01:38] have been?

[01:39] What if it worked?

[01:40] Let's take a look at those games from Deeproot pinball, or let's take a look at those

[01:45] games from Skippy.

[01:47] Skippy.

[01:48] They have one game, Predator.

[01:50] Right.

[01:51] But like, what?

[01:52] Oh my goodness.

[01:53] What would have happened if there's just this romance?

[01:56] Oh wait a minute.

[01:57] Skippy, actually they were going to make what, experts of dangerous.

[02:00] I don't know.

[02:01] Which was basically, what's the show?

[02:04] Help me here.

[02:05] I have no idea.

[02:06] Mythbusters.

[02:07] Oh.

[02:08] It was basically Mythbusters, but since they didn't own the rights to the name, like Discovery

[02:12] channel did or whatever, they had to.

[02:15] They was basically Mythbusters, but they called it Experts of Dangerous.

[02:18] God.

[02:19] But it was Skippy, so it never happened.

[02:21] But they, but they, we have this weird, like romance for these things, right?

[02:24] Like a pinball 2000.

[02:26] Like all these home brews for pinball 2000, right?

[02:29] This romance of what would have happened if Williams just hung on.

[02:33] Wizard blocks.

[02:34] What would it be like?

[02:35] Well, that starts to bleed into people.

[02:39] It corrupts them and thinks that they can do something to bring back the magic of pinball.

[02:45] Always chasing the next thing is very real.

[02:48] Pinball news in 2004 would say, one of the rarest games in modern times has to be Capcom's

[02:56] Big Bang Bar.

[02:58] Only 14 prototypes were ever produced, and it's generally regarded as the best game never

[03:05] to reach production.

[03:06] Huh?

[03:07] There's this lure, this magic.

[03:11] Pixie dust that Big Bang bars is greatest game ever to not reach production.

[03:16] What would happen if it did?

[03:18] Well by 2000 Stern was the only survivor in the industry.

[03:22] Part of the reason for that is they were always regarded as the cheaper, less packed, and

[03:26] boring alternative to Williams.

[03:28] And what would Joe Cam and Kowse say?

[03:30] He would say we won.

[03:32] That's right.

[03:33] So it was around this time that there were rumblings of various affluent hobbyists, and

[03:40] they were looking to start up a pinball company and they wanted to see what would happen.

[03:44] Well, one of those individuals would rise to the top, and he was looking to finish Big

[03:50] Bang Bar.

[03:52] The greatest game to never reach production.

[03:57] Um, I kind of like Kingpinmore, but it was good.

[04:00] That's good.

[04:01] So Gene Cunningham, this is the gentleman we're going to start talking about now.

[04:05] And this is where things get a bit wishy-washy because there's a lot of different sources.

[04:11] There's a lot of bullshitting.

[04:13] There's a lot of salesmanship amongst Gene.

[04:17] Those around him, other individuals.

[04:20] There's a lot of stuff of like people in the future telling what happened in the past.

[04:25] So this is very muddled.

[04:26] So I've done my best to try to pull out as much of that as I can and try to distill it down

[04:32] in a way that I think is most accurate.

[04:35] Now Gene Cunningham opened a skating rink in 1973 in Bloomington, Illinois.

[04:42] He saw the rink as a business, but not necessarily as a passion.

[04:48] All the kids there, they hung out, they met on a regular basis.

[04:53] It was a social sphere for that generation.

[04:58] They found love.

[04:59] They found heartbreak at the rink.

[05:02] It's just a movie.

[05:03] But Gene, you know, big bang or rink.

[05:08] Gene Cunningham just saw it as a business.

[05:11] And he got tired of all the crap you deal with with kids.

[05:13] And he sold the business in 1988.

[05:16] Now by 1993, he would eventually buy the business back.

[05:20] And by early, the early 1990s, Gene began to notice that pinball was booming.

[05:27] And that was why pinball entered Gene Cunningham's life, strictly transactional.

[05:34] Now what was it like to deal with Gene?

[05:37] I've never dealt with him.

[05:39] Well, here's here's some.

[05:40] Oh, it was reported that Gene was very difficult to deal with and was very overbearing

[05:44] with his competitiveness and business sense.

[05:46] Gene began buying up warehouses in the area.

[05:49] Some people saw him as a collector, a hoarder or a dreamer.

[05:52] Some people say he was a nut or something between a con man and a businessman.

[05:57] He's like a business accolade.

[05:59] And I'll tell you, I work with a lot of business owners, a lot of successful business owners.

[06:02] And a lot of people are very off put by them because they are kind of can be, you know,

[06:06] intense A type personalities.

[06:09] Sometimes that rubs people the wrong way.

[06:10] But Gene was a bit weird even for that.

[06:13] So in early 2000, Gene had heard through the grapevine that Capcom was shopping around

[06:19] to sell its pinball business to a buyer.

[06:23] The idea was that they have all these pinball assets and patents and stickers and drop

[06:29] targets and stuff somewhere in storage and you know, it's what gets some money for it.

[06:34] It was also said that Gene pursued the purchase of the old Valley Williams parts business

[06:39] at this time.

[06:40] Now, this begs the question, Ron.

[06:43] What happened with all of Valley Williams parts when they went under?

[06:47] That's a whole other episode.

[06:49] I can give some insight on that because I was there through most of it.

[06:53] There was, you had Gene, you had like James Loughlin of the pinball ink and the other art

[06:59] guy whose name is escaping me.

[07:00] Then you had Wayne in Australia, then you had battles going on and then eventually you

[07:06] had Rick at Planetary Pinball Bay Area musements, which is now Planetary Pinball.

[07:11] It's just, yeah.

[07:12] But pinball was, it was basically dead.

[07:15] Right?

[07:16] Like, who wants to buy a bunch of crappy pinball stuff?

[07:19] Yeah, you can sell the parts.

[07:21] Yeah, it's George.

[07:22] George Gomez says it wasn't like anyone was beating down the door for this stuff.

[07:26] It's not like as soon as Valley Williams went under that like there was like all these

[07:30] companies that were just super excited to start their own pinball company because people

[07:35] at a corporate level understood that that was a terrible business decision.

[07:39] But for some reason, these romantic business collector community, boy, they, they, they

[07:45] could smell opportunity.

[07:46] And according to David Dennis, we will cover this in greater detail during another podcast.

[07:50] I might.

[07:51] It depends if, if I give up or not.

[07:53] Illinois pinball corporation.

[07:55] It's got pinball is two words for some reason.

[07:58] It does.

[07:59] And pin is capitalized and so is ball.

[08:00] Yeah, but it's one word I believe in all of his material.

[08:03] Yeah.

[08:04] So here that will get into that in a second.

[08:06] In early 2000, Gene Cunningham purchased the rights to Alvin G and co games and Capcom.

[08:13] In addition, he also purchased the rights to reproduce Capcom's games.

[08:18] Yeah, he also got all their inventory.

[08:21] There are 200 driver boards and stuff like that, which he would use later.

[08:28] He just bought a bunch of stuff.

[08:30] Gene's company, which was called Illinois pinball corporation, purchased all the remaining

[08:35] inventory of replacement parts for Williams.

[08:39] And they could also remanufacture.

[08:42] And this is in quotes here, some replacement parts.

[08:46] Now here's the thing.

[08:47] Okay.

[08:48] It's really complicated to dig through a lot of this stuff and I've tried my best.

[08:53] So if you know anything more about this than I am able to sort of summarize here, please

[08:57] send me an email at silverbellcrontacles.com.

[09:02] The purchase of the inventory was one thing.

[09:04] The purchase to be able to, like, the rights to be able to sell the inventory was another

[09:10] thing.

[09:11] Being able to remanufacture replacement parts was another, like, license or another thing.

[09:18] So it's not like you just, oh, I've got to buy Williams.

[09:20] You bought Williams.

[09:21] It was like, no, you could buy the remanufacture of parts and then somebody else could buy

[09:24] the inventory.

[09:26] But then somebody could buy the sale of the inventory like it was ridiculous.

[09:31] So it was very, very confusing.

[09:33] It was in 2000 that an individual named David Vitulo, who was a Williams representative,

[09:40] released a press release.

[09:41] To our vendors, please be informed that we did not sell our tooling as a part of this

[09:45] transaction to Gene Cunningham.

[09:47] However, we have granted to Illinois Pinball a limited license to use the tooling specifically

[09:52] for the replenishment of Pinball replacement parts inventory.

[09:56] Yeah.

[09:57] So there's like, I found these press releases and information and contact back and forth

[10:02] that there, like, that Williams is like very much saying, like, we didn't sell them the

[10:07] parts of the tooling and the tooling is what makes the parts, like the tool that makes

[10:12] the parts.

[10:13] And I can tell you, when I got in in 2004, there was already rumblings that Gene was just

[10:18] not making the parts.

[10:19] Like, where's the parts?

[10:21] Yeah.

[10:22] He's got the parts.

[10:23] He could sell some parts.

[10:24] Yeah.

[10:25] Like, where's the new inventory that's, where is it?

[10:28] Right.

[10:29] But he doesn't have the machine to make the coils.

[10:30] And he doesn't have the machine to make the trunk on theater of magic.

[10:34] That stuff.

[10:35] It's a mess trying to figure out who owns what and what is owned by who.

[10:39] And then if somebody's a bit sketchy, maybe they are selling the parts when maybe they

[10:41] shouldn't be, right?

[10:42] But that's against licensing stuff.

[10:45] It's really, really sketchy.

[10:48] Oh, it's really, I was at shows where, you know, after Gene lost the rights and he was

[10:52] still selling stuff and people were there, like, filming him selling stuff because they

[10:56] were going to report him.

[10:57] And stuff like, yes, I'm, yeah.

[11:00] Apparently with, you know, the purchase of the Capcom parts and the rights to reproduce

[11:06] the Capcom stuff, which is different than the William stuff.

[11:09] He was going to remake Breakshot and he was going to call it pool player.

[11:13] So in an old article from pinball news, I was able to pull this quote.

[11:19] Gene was at the recent AMOA show and lost Vegas showing three games, but reports have been

[11:24] largely negative citing the facts that neither game was fully working and both broke down

[11:29] frequently during the show until they were on playable.

[11:32] The flyer looks rather amateurish with the picture clearly showing the reflection of

[11:36] the photographer's tripod in the back glasses.

[11:39] Most rangelies are spelling it Illinois pinball itself, which is spelled out as ILLIN OIS,

[11:45] so they misspelled their own name in the banner and Illinois pinball ink at the foot of

[11:51] the flyer.

[11:52] And it was capital P I N space capital B a L L.

[11:56] So it's just a mess.

[11:59] By 2003, by 2003, Gene picked up the rights to the tooling and artwork for Capcom and he

[12:06] also acquired the Balli name.

[12:09] Yeah.

[12:10] That's cool.

[12:11] Until Wayne in Australia also acquired the Balli name.

[12:16] And now was a whole thing there.

[12:17] But, see, isn't it interesting?

[12:19] You can make a haul episode out of the right stuff.

[12:21] It's great.

[12:23] So here's the thing.

[12:24] Okay.

[12:25] There's the rights to the tooling.

[12:26] There's the rights to the artwork.

[12:29] There's the right.

[12:30] So what's happening here, okay, is that Capcom, and to some extent Williams Balli, they

[12:36] can smell somebody who's kind of dumb, I think.

[12:39] And what they're doing is they're splitting all these rights up because they want to get

[12:43] maximum dollar for either their shareholders or the owners of the company if they're not

[12:47] a public company.

[12:49] They are looking to maximize every dollar.

[12:51] And if that means that they can split out the artwork from the rights to reproduce the

[12:56] pin to the rights to sell the pin and all that.

[13:00] They can get all these other people to pay more money little bits at a time as opposed

[13:03] to one big bitter to pay a bunch of money up front.

[13:07] This is where this hoarding thing gets into this hoarding mentality or this tunnel vision

[13:12] of that people get into sometimes is spending money on stupid things.

[13:16] Let's jump ahead to 2004.

[13:18] Pincombingham had made plans to then remake the 1996 game Big Bang Bar.

[13:26] He was going to make 101 units and eventually increased it to 183 units.

[13:32] So pinball, now he's got a new company, Gene Cunningham has created a new company called

[13:37] Pin Space Ball Manufacturing Inc.

[13:40] What the heck is that?

[13:41] I think it's one word.

[13:43] It's just, it capitalized to be in ball for some reason, even though it's the same word.

[13:46] Pinball news says the games will be branded Capcom despite being made by Pinball Inc.

[13:52] This is a company Gene set up for the purpose of making the games and was necessary because

[13:56] Williams licensing agreement with Illinois Pinball prohibits that company making any games.

[14:02] So you have to, okay, so you had to create a new company just to make this game, even

[14:05] though it's basically the same guy, the same company.

[14:08] Right, so confused.

[14:09] So you have to set up other companies, those other companies purchased various pieces

[14:13] of the rights because Williams won't let Capcom hone everything else.

[14:17] It's the same company as the different things ridiculous, ridiculous.

[14:21] Apparently at this time as well, Gene was working on replacement Adam's family side art

[14:28] and replacement parts for games like World Cup Soccer.

[14:33] So for example, the ball in the soccer ball.

[14:35] The soccer ball might be, I know the right pinball soccer ball.

[14:39] This is hard for people to understand if they're new to the hobby.

[14:41] If they came in sort of post COVID or like me just before COVID.

[14:44] This stuff wasn't available back then.

[14:46] Back in like 2000, if something broke on your Adam's family, what did you do?

[14:52] You hoped that there was parts inventory somewhere that hadn't run out yet.

[14:56] No one was making new parts, so.

[14:58] You stole parts from Popeye.

[15:01] You cannibalized a Popeye and tore it down.

[15:03] Or an NBA fast break.

[15:05] Or you found a game that was just destroyed, but it still had some ramps.

[15:10] So you were able to save the ramps and reuse them.

[15:12] And you only found those things if you were deep in the community at a pinball expo type

[15:18] of event, which were few and far between.

[15:21] So the barrier of entry to get into the pinball hobby was incredibly high.

[15:26] Because if you had no skills at soldering and you were as dumb as a post like I was.

[15:30] Oh, yeah, you had no chance.

[15:32] No, you couldn't do that.

[15:33] This brings me to I think a pretty exciting time in the pinball industry.

[15:38] We're going to call this Gene's Expo presentation.

[15:41] Oh, I thought you were going to say that's when I got into it.

[15:44] So it was more exciting.

[15:45] So was this your first expo?

[15:47] Yes.

[15:48] In 2004, I went to my first pinball expo.

[15:51] And as a complete newb, I attended every single seminar, including this one, which was

[15:57] the worst seminar you attended.

[15:59] Oh, God.

[16:01] You're so mean.

[16:02] I don't remember.

[16:03] I there was probably some like really boring seminars with stuff.

[16:07] I had no idea what they were talking about.

[16:09] I'm guessing replacing top side screws in your Valley single level playing field game.

[16:17] Gene had this grand presentation, which you attended.

[16:21] Yes I did.

[16:22] What was he pitching here?

[16:23] All right.

[16:24] Well, he was pitching Big Bang Bar.

[16:26] Now I didn't know what that game was.

[16:27] I had no idea.

[16:28] Capcom made games.

[16:29] I had no clue.

[16:30] I mean, I'm totally do.

[16:31] I have no idea.

[16:33] You don't know the lure.

[16:35] No.

[16:36] Greatest game to never be released.

[16:38] Is it the games seemed kind of expensive that he was pitching because I knew the stern

[16:43] games at the time were under 4 grand.

[16:47] And his game, like the base model was like 4,500, which is like, my God, that's expensive.

[16:53] The first machines of Big Bang Bar, you could order them.

[16:57] They were going to be $4,500.

[16:59] Oh, I have it right here.

[17:01] I'm just going to, I have from the presentation, the flyer, because I kept everything.

[17:06] I looked this up last night.

[17:07] I have the flyer, which I sent to David.

[17:11] I have the schedule of events from it.

[17:13] So I can tell you that this seminar was Friday, October 15th at 1115.

[17:18] Illinois Pinball Co. Update, Speaker Jean Cunningham.

[17:22] And he just sat on a stage in a sh**ty chair, right?

[17:25] Uh, yeah.

[17:26] Yep.

[17:27] It was just on a stage sitting on a chair.

[17:28] Yeah.

[17:29] With a microphone, that's it.

[17:30] Yep, that's it.

[17:31] I think there's a video of this.

[17:32] I'm going to post that.

[17:33] There's probably a video.

[17:34] There's probably a video.

[17:35] I used to film all the seminars on this big old camera with the kind that you put the

[17:42] VHS tape right in it, like that size.

[17:45] And they had that for years.

[17:46] I don't know where half that stuff went.

[17:48] I mean, it was old technology then.

[17:51] So, but I have the Big Bang Bar pricing document.

[17:56] It was handed out to everybody.

[17:57] All right.

[17:58] Break it down.

[17:59] Are you ready?

[18:00] Yep.

[18:01] Okay.

[18:02] There's three columns, machine number, trim package and price.

[18:04] So, we have machine number one will be gold plated, a special prototype and it will

[18:09] be $12,000.

[18:10] Now, apparently this machine was jeans, but he wanted to put it on the flyer anyway.

[18:16] I guess so.

[18:17] Then machines two through ten.

[18:19] Now, these are prototypes.

[18:22] So the first prototype, gene prototypes, two through ten will be brass plated, hand

[18:28] assembled prototypes, it'll be $7,500 each.

[18:31] Whoa.

[18:33] So I don't know where they ended up.

[18:34] Then we get to regular production.

[18:36] These are the hundred that eventually became 180, whatever, or 190, I think eventually.

[18:41] So the number one regular production model will be gold plated, $12,000.

[18:47] Two through 99, which are the ones everyone owns, will be black and $4,500.

[18:54] Then game 100, which I wonder who has this one, will be gold plated, $12,000.

[18:59] Man, oh man.

[19:00] So here's a quote from Gene Cunningham himself.

[19:04] He says machine number one will be plated with pure gold.

[19:07] Pure gold.

[19:08] $12,000 worth of gold in the side bars, legs, feet bolts, feet bolts.

[19:13] What about that?

[19:14] They're like casters.

[19:15] Yeah, casters.

[19:16] It will sell for $12,000 and it's already been spoken for.

[19:20] Okay, that would be his.

[19:21] The rest of the first ten would each have a plaque with a number of the machine, the name

[19:26] and the name of the original buyer.

[19:28] Ooh, exciting.

[19:29] So part of this tells me, okay, hey, he understands this collector thing, right?

[19:36] Like low number le thing, pricing pretty high.

[19:43] But by today's standards, not too bad.

[19:46] $12,000 is like a Elton John.

[19:48] Yeah, there you go.

[19:50] And the Elton John isn't made of solid gold.

[19:52] So the other thing is, I don't know if he knows gold plated versus pure gold totally different,

[19:59] like gold is really soft.

[20:01] You know what I mean?

[20:02] Like, you don't want gold ramps or legs that are going to get bounced around because they're

[20:09] going to mark and scratch.

[20:11] This is a stupid idea, but I can understand what he's doing.

[20:13] He told the crowd that he wouldn't start until he received at least 55 pre-orders by

[20:18] the end of the show, 121 people had already registered to buy a machine.

[20:23] That's crazy.

[20:24] Yeah, if I remember, he had two shows where you had the opportunity to buy in.

[20:28] It wasn't just Texbow.

[20:29] I think it was Expo in Texas.

[20:31] Yeah.

[20:32] I think Texas was actually the first one and then Expo.

[20:35] And if you were at those shows, those were all the people who got in.

[20:38] Now, he was asking, after a month, he sent out a letter to all these people and asked them

[20:42] for a 50% deposit.

[20:44] Now, what about these old guys at Capcom?

[20:46] Jeff Powell?

[20:47] He says, I heard through the grapevine that Gene Cunningham have bought off the parts.

[20:51] Everyone was skeptical.

[20:53] No one knew for sure if he had the rights to do it.

[20:55] But somehow he had gotten the dumpster drawings and everything.

[20:59] We were all skeptical.

[21:00] Is he really going to do it?

[21:02] What about Mark Richie?

[21:04] He says, I thought only a nut would do that.

[21:06] There's nothing easy about pinball, about producing them.

[21:09] It's a lot of work.

[21:10] Tons of people, tons of times.

[21:13] How's that guy going to make this in some Illinois sh** hole?

[21:16] Wow.

[21:17] I love Mark Richie.

[21:19] I could totally see him saying that too, yeah.

[21:22] So by June of 2006, assembly of the machines started taking place and he had a few of those

[21:27] machines together.

[21:29] Then Gene had started to ask for the rest of the payment.

[21:32] Boy, this sounds familiar.

[21:33] They will accept these actually did get made.

[21:35] Well, we'll get to that.

[21:38] At the time, people began selling their spots.

[21:41] Panic was starting to set in and this happens every time a pinball machine manufacturer starts

[21:46] up.

[21:47] Stupid people put their money in early before anything is proven and then they lose their

[21:53] money.

[21:54] So this time is just like every other time they're starting to freak out.

[21:56] Well, Gene Cunningham says, I had a lot of phone calls from people asking, when are they

[22:01] going to be ready?

[22:03] And I said, we're working on it because all these people trusted me with their money,

[22:07] then got word out that I was running way over and some of them said, let, let us pay

[22:11] you more.

[22:12] And I said, no, I gave my word that I made them for 4,500 and that's what it was.

[22:17] He says, now this was an interview with hindsight.

[22:20] Gene says that people were giving up saying, let us help you more.

[22:24] Let's give you more money.

[22:25] He's like, no, I'm going to stick to my guns.

[22:27] Those people are stupid.

[22:28] They're really stupid.

[22:31] Either that or they don't exist.

[22:32] Yeah, yeah.

[22:33] So leave it that way.

[22:34] Well, at the end of 2006, approximately one dozen machines were delivered to European

[22:39] customers.

[22:40] I remember that.

[22:41] The remaining machines were completed in Shipton June 2007.

[22:44] Okay.

[22:45] He did it.

[22:46] Yeah, and he lost his ass.

[22:48] Well, we'll get to that in a second.

[22:50] But here's the thing.

[22:52] He got them out the door.

[22:53] What was it like?

[22:54] What was it like chit-chatting around the thing where people like Holy Crappy actually

[22:57] did it?

[22:58] Yep.

[22:59] That was on our RGP, rep games, pinball.

[23:02] That's where all that's pre-pinside.

[23:04] That's where we all hung out back then.

[23:06] So that was before that was the pin side of your, you could say that.

[23:10] Complete, unmoderated pin side.

[23:12] It was the thing was it's when pigs fly and pigs flew.

[23:17] Pigs actually flew.

[23:18] That pigs actually flew.

[23:19] Someone had to make an apology video because they just busted on Gene Constantly, said he

[23:23] never make it and they said they would do an apology video if he actually ever made them.

[23:27] So he actually had to do an apology video.

[23:29] He did it.

[23:30] Yes.

[23:31] He did it.

[23:32] It's like those Dutch pinball guys that somehow, even after cheating everyone out of their

[23:36] money, they eventually, and there's still people who haven't been made hold yet, but it

[23:41] looks like they will be eventually only eight to 10 years after they bought the game.

[23:45] Amazing.

[23:46] Absolutely.

[23:47] Amazing.

[23:48] So anyway, the differences of the remake versus the original four prototypes.

[23:52] Ah, yeah, I read this.

[23:53] You're missing one.

[23:54] Oh, yeah.

[23:55] Okay, well point that out when we're done here.

[23:57] So they hit it like this, like this, electro-luminous at lights on the plastic ramps that used

[24:01] like a 12 volt in the remake and originally, apparently, it was a 24 volt, which is silly,

[24:06] but it's on the list, so I put it here.

[24:09] The tube dancer is 13% smaller in the 1996 game.

[24:14] Jean didn't have access to the original.

[24:15] No, then the 1996.

[24:17] Oh, it's okay.

[24:18] So it is smaller.

[24:20] So Jean didn't have the original mold, so they had to make a new mold for the dancing

[24:24] lady in the tube.

[24:26] All the remakes came with numbered plaques and card holders.

[24:30] Now not necessarily something was mounted there, but they were there.

[24:33] And reportedly, no manufacturer sticker was on the cabinet.

[24:38] The back of the cabinet.

[24:39] Right.

[24:40] Probably the back box I would assume.

[24:41] And there was originally a capcom cabinet sticker on the back there.

[24:44] So it was the thing that I missed.

[24:47] It's the easiest way to identify an original big bang bar from a remake, and it was something

[24:51] Cunningham did on purpose.

[24:52] Okay.

[24:53] And if you look at the pictures of an original and a remake, the side art specifically,

[24:58] on an original big bang bar, the side art does not go all the way to the edge of the

[25:02] cabinet, like on the bottom.

[25:04] It stops and there's like a black line that goes across.

[25:07] He did not like that.

[25:08] So on the remakes, the side art goes all the way to the bottom.

[25:12] It goes all the way to the edge.

[25:13] Well, that was a good move.

[25:14] So that's the easiest way from a distance you can look at one and immediately tell if

[25:18] it's an original one or a remake.

[25:20] But out even having to look into the play field, you can tell.

[25:23] Crazy.

[25:24] So three years later, in 2010, at the Northwest Pinball and Game Show, Game Room Show,

[25:32] Gene Cunningham reported that there were additional units of the games to be made because

[25:37] they had extra parts in play field sitting around.

[25:40] Yeah.

[25:41] So why not make a game?

[25:42] I think at that point, he was like, I'm not making Kingpan.

[25:44] I'm going to use the rest of the parts.

[25:46] Yeah.

[25:47] IPDB would say that you can see these other extra part games because they have EXP written

[25:53] in the serial numbers.

[25:55] And the guests, there's probably 10 or 11 of those machines.

[25:59] So there's probably 191 of these units out and about.

[26:03] Yeah.

[26:04] And Gene was said to set his sights on Kingpan.

[26:07] Yeah.

[26:08] He was going to make Kingpan.

[26:09] And then maybe Williams-Wizard blocks.

[26:11] Yeah.

[26:12] The problem was with Big Bang Bar, one of the cost savings was the fact that he just had

[26:18] the inventory from Capcom of all the board sets, like the huge driver board that takes

[26:23] up the entire back box.

[26:24] He had like a couple, you know, like a couple hundred.

[26:27] He used them all up, making all those games.

[26:30] So if he was going to do Kingpan, he was going to have to have the board's remanufacture.

[26:36] Yeah.

[26:37] And back in this time, you're not sending an email to Asia with the drawings.

[26:41] Oh, 2010 maybe.

[26:43] But still, it would have cost a crap load of money that he didn't have to pay the first

[26:46] time because he just had the inventory.

[26:47] Yeah.

[26:48] He was going to have to make more crap.

[26:50] Gene's troubles really started to become evident.

[26:53] And apparently it started to leak out.

[26:56] But Gene was having some serious fighting over his home and his business from various

[27:01] creditors.

[27:03] And it was believed that every Big Bang Bar that he manufactured was sold at a massive

[27:09] loss.

[27:10] Yeah, it was sold at a massive loss.

[27:13] So that is said that each machine actually cost about 7,200 to 6,500 American dollars

[27:23] to manufacture.

[27:25] Now where do we get that number?

[27:27] Well, it came from an article in Pinball News where Gene Cunningham shared that with Martin

[27:34] Ahab over there.

[27:35] Yeah, he said it was made in Aube.

[27:38] I think it's right.

[27:41] And a lot of this information, by the way, is from Pinball News.

[27:44] Check it out.

[27:45] A lot of the old stuff because he's been doing this since the 90s.

[27:49] So Gene told Pinball News at cost 6,500 a machine.

[27:53] And then in a polygon article, years later he said it cost 7,200.

[27:58] So which do you believe?

[27:59] Yeah.

[28:00] So it's either he doesn't know, which is probably really true.

[28:03] He probably doesn't know how much it cost him for machine.

[28:05] I'd say 6,500 is fair.

[28:07] So he basically lost at least $2,000 on every machine he made.

[28:11] I can totally see that.

[28:13] Yeah.

[28:14] And here's a quote from Gene.

[28:15] He said it cost a lot more than 45 hundred for a lot of them because we made some special

[28:19] ones for some people.

[28:20] Gold trim, brass trim, sidebar and legs.

[28:23] Case of my daughter's machine, which is probably the most viable one.

[28:26] It's all done in metallic green.

[28:28] Well, sometimes you got to say no to your daughter when it's going to cost you your home

[28:33] and your business.

[28:35] In 2009, Gene started to fight over the bank over four closures.

[28:41] He entered into an agreement with a Georgia-based Pinball company to sell off Illinois Pinball.

[28:48] And it's inventory for just under a million dollars.

[28:52] Instead, the deal soured, kicking off nearly a three-year mess of arguments, claims of theft,

[29:03] broken deals, counter deals and finally to major lawsuits.

[29:08] Yeah.

[29:09] The company in Georgia, that's probably Pinball Inc.

[29:12] That's probably James Lothlin.

[29:13] I think he was supposed to sell him the stuff and then it went in the crapper.

[29:17] Yeah, company in Australia and Georgia, they paid Gene Cunningham money for the inventory,

[29:24] but not all of the million dollars in the deal.

[29:26] Now, it seems like he sold stuff to both of them when they both probably assumed they

[29:31] were all buying everything.

[29:33] Yeah.

[29:34] And I think all the parts eventually did go to Australia.

[29:37] Like all the stuff in his warehouse, I think eventually went to Australia.

[29:40] Now, by 2013, all of the money had run out and by March, Gene was forced to sell off

[29:47] his warehouse of Pinball machines, his entire collection, and then 11 days after that, he

[29:54] filed for bankruptcy.

[29:56] Apparently, so this just keeps going.

[29:58] It just keeps going.

[29:59] Yeah, you know all this financial stuff, man.

[30:01] That's what you do.

[30:03] Gene fought with the bank's rupsy trustee.

[30:05] So when you go into bankruptcy, there's a person that sits in the middle.

[30:08] They're not the bank and they're not Gene.

[30:10] They're the person in the middle.

[30:11] And they have to inventory all of the assets.

[30:14] So they look at the company and they say, okay, where are these 3,000 coils?

[30:18] Or where is the building that it owns?

[30:20] Or where is the side art?

[30:23] And how many pieces of side art do you have?

[30:25] So they inventory everything.

[30:27] Allegedly, Gene had hid at least 20 pieces of property from the records of the trustee.

[30:34] He also transferred the ownership of some of these things, the various assets, to hide

[30:40] them from the trustee, which included cars, more pinball inventory, and even commercial

[30:47] workout equipment, which if you saw Gene, he'd never used.

[30:51] And he also held about $1.1 million dollar insurance policy.

[30:56] You can tell that Gene is a bit sleazy in these last few years.

[31:01] And generally that's kind of what happens when things start to go south is you start to,

[31:06] you know, try to hide your mistakes.

[31:09] And hiding things from a bankruptcy trustee, not a great idea.

[31:14] One of the other things, which is probably the biggest issue that he dealt with, was that

[31:18] Gene failed to mention that he had a warehouse sale 11 days prior to bankruptcy.

[31:26] So he sold off all of these pinball collections and all of this stuff 11 days before he filed

[31:31] for bankruptcy, which is a big no-no.

[31:34] Apparently, it was so bad that Gene moved from voluntary bankruptcy and people refer to

[31:40] that as chapter 11.

[31:42] We have something very similar here in Canada.

[31:44] And he was moved to a liquidation or a forced bankruptcy, which is called a chapter 7,

[31:51] where all of his creditors were then just like sicked on him.

[31:55] So Ron, do you remember hearing all about this?

[31:58] I read an article somewhere about some of this, but it was from Gene's perspective.

[32:04] So I didn't hear about a lot of the other stuff.

[32:07] Yeah. So most of the time everybody tries to spin this as basically being like the bank

[32:12] is being unfair and they're coming after me and look at me and how great I am.

[32:15] And everybody got their pinball machines.

[32:17] But really when it comes down to it, it's just a terrible business person.

[32:21] By August of 2016, Gene had a mountain of creditors and he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars

[32:30] in taxes. Then they finally were able to close his bankruptcy.

[32:36] I have included an amazing pinside thread about Gene Cunningham in the show notes.

[32:43] Zip on over to silverballacronicles.com.

[32:49] Click on the source, the sources page at the top there, and go to this pinside thread

[32:57] and read through some of this stuff.

[33:00] Have you seen this thread on pinside?

[33:02] I have not.

[33:03] You have not seen this pin.

[33:05] Oh, this is a good one.

[33:07] So in here, basically what it is, what we should also mention is Gene Cunningham passed away on November 27th, 2019.

[33:17] Yes.

[33:18] So artifacts, the thread is called artifacts of Gene Cunningham Illinois pinball.

[33:25] Like I said, it's included in the show notes.

[33:29] And what it is is a pinseider who is based out of Chicago, went on a bit of an adventure

[33:36] or a pilgrimage to Bloomington, Illinois and he decided to look at what was left over

[33:42] of Gene Cunningham's legacy.

[33:45] And in here are a bunch of photos of his old warehouse.

[33:49] Gene Cunningham's old home, where his warehouses used to be in his home, pictures of inside of his

[33:57] home.

[33:58] Okay.

[33:58] It's pretty crazy.

[33:59] Yeah, I think I've seen some of these.

[34:01] There's also other people chime in and they start showing off Gene Cunningham's pinball

[34:07] game collection of very rare and fancy, expensive,

[34:10] expensive,

[34:11] and huge warehouse.

[34:12] And they were all just stacked up.

[34:15] Other people have posted all of this old, cool stuff that Gene had taken over when he

[34:23] purchased Williams and some others.

[34:24] It's well worth its read.

[34:26] I'm not going to get into all of it here.

[34:28] You don't need to read everything.

[34:29] I just read most of the pictures and things with lots of upvotes because those are obviously

[34:33] the ones with the dirt.

[34:36] But it was really cool.

[34:38] It's really cool to see that and it's also kind of sad.

[34:42] Well, that it all got broken up and went, God knows where.

[34:45] Most of the parts went like I said, they went to Australia.

[34:48] Gene Cunningham would then pass away in 2019

[34:55] after I would say just a terrible downward spiral in the last 20 years of his involvement

[35:02] in the pinball community.

[35:03] It had highs and it had lows.

[35:06] But Gene, I guess you can just say that he has once again helped build up the Capcom

[35:14] debacle.

[35:15] Just kept it going for another 20 years.

[35:19] That's not very nice.

[35:21] Was Gene Cunningham a hero?

[35:24] Are we Zia Villan?

[35:25] People got their games as far as buyers are concerned.

[35:29] He's fine.

[35:30] Yeah, it's sad.

[35:31] It's sad to see the spiral of what had happened but they did get their games.

[35:34] Yeah, and I did buy something from Illinois pinball but it wasn't a game.

[35:38] It was a spinner for my no fear

[35:41] because no one else had it because it's a custom part.

[35:44] And at the time, that's all you can get it from was Illinois pinball.

[35:48] The funny part of that story is though I ordered it.

[35:50] I never got anything.

[35:52] I said, hey, I didn't get it.

[35:53] And they couldn't find where they'd sent it or a tracking number.

[35:56] So they sent me a second one, which I got.

[36:00] And then like a month later, I got the first one.

[36:02] Weird.

[36:03] Yeah.

[36:04] So I had two spares.

[36:05] There you go again.

[36:07] The reason why Gene Cunningham went bankrupt.

[36:09] Give it away stuff before.

[36:17] Hey, do it.
