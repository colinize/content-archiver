[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:14] You can send it into Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[00:17] And we won't read it. And we don't.

[00:19] We don't read that stuff. That's a waste of time.

[00:30] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is pinball chronicles.

[00:38] And with me is my co-host Ron. How you doing, Hallett?

[00:42] I'm doing just peachy.

[00:44] Just peachy. That's great. Have you had any feedback?

[00:48] So far, Fella about our first episode. They like us.

[00:52] Yeah, people thought we did an okay job, which is, which is really great.

[00:56] We've made a couple of adjustments, but I think this episode is going to really play out.

[01:01] I think it's going to play out really well. I'm really excited to get this going.

[01:05] I've been looking forward to this for a couple of weeks.

[01:07] But as you know, we are on a monthly schedule that gives us a little more time for research

[01:11] and editing. Plus it gives us a little bit of time out to not sort of get burnt out.

[01:16] Isn't that right? That is correct. That is very correct.

[01:19] You've been super busy in the last couple of last couple of weeks.

[01:23] You've actually put out two slam tilt podcasts.

[01:26] Yes, we have.

[01:27] Who's that guy? What's your other guy's name?

[01:30] What's his name? Is Brian?

[01:32] What's his name?

[01:33] It starts with a B, but it's not Brian. It's Bruce.

[01:35] It's Brian. It's Bruce.

[01:36] Are you sure it's Bruce?

[01:38] I'm sure it's Bruce.

[01:39] Okay. Well, anyway, that he's okay. He's doing pretty good on that podcast, which is nice.

[01:44] But you're, of course, tying it all together on your other podcast, the slam tilt podcast.

[01:50] But I'm glad I could steal you away this evening to jump into this week's topic.

[01:56] One that I think you hold very dear to your heart.

[01:59] That I do. I was very excited when I learned what our next topic would be.

[02:05] Well, you requested specifically that we do this on the next episode that was part of your

[02:10] contract to bring us that we continue to hyperinflate the stern electronics secondary

[02:18] market. And that was something that you specifically put forward.

[02:21] Sure.

[02:22] Yeah. So that's our topic this week. But before we get into that, Ron, this episode is

[02:27] brought to you by a bash toy and two ramps, a bash toy and two ramps really though.

[02:33] What else do you need?

[02:34] That's what John Borg says.

[02:36] Big sponsor this week. Big, big, big sponsor this week. We've got a couple of housekeeping

[02:42] items from our previous episode, which was Steve Richie before the mullet. We always

[02:48] take corrections from our mailbag at silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[02:53] Is is that the name? Do we change something?

[02:56] Nope. Everything is exactly the same as it was before. Silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[03:02] If you want to get a hold of us, please send us a message. So we did get some feedback

[03:07] from the one the only Dennis Kreisel. He wrote in because he actually wrote an article

[03:12] in the pinball news and that article spoke specifically about a tary pinball. I think

[03:19] it was you, Ron. You posed the question as to why did a tary choose wide bodies?

[03:24] Yep. All their games are wide bodies.

[03:26] All their games for wide bodies and Dennis wrote in simply it was money and then he linked

[03:32] to an article. I've put that in the show notes. So if you want to go back and read that,

[03:35] he also wrote down his sourcing. He quoted Nolan Bushnell from Atari and he said, I

[03:42] felt we could make a business meaning pinball, but we couldn't do commodity pinball. One

[03:48] that looked like it was the same as everybody else. So we created wide bodies and these various

[03:53] other innovations which allowed us to price them anywhere we wanted. They definitely looked

[03:58] different. They innovated max that no one used except them. I guess you could say they

[04:02] took risks and they could have paid off, but they certainly didn't.

[04:06] No, they had like what was it called rotary solenoids or some other stuff that yeah,

[04:12] and there are circuit boards at the bottom of the cabinet and other wonderful innovations

[04:17] that they did.

[04:18] Yeah, you can't you can't hear my hand in my face, but that's what I'm doing at the moment.

[04:24] So one of one of the other bits of feedback that we actually got was on my sourcing of

[04:31] what I'm referencing as we go through the episode. Some people wanted to dive a little

[04:35] bit deeper into some of that sourcing. So you will see in your pod catcher much deeper,

[04:41] much more pointed sourcing inside of those show notes. So I wanted to make sure that I

[04:47] updated that and we'll move on to the next bit. Some feedback from the first episode.

[04:52] Ron, do you want to read through some of that feedback? Sure. I'll read some of the feedback.

[04:56] Glenn says, loved it. Can't wait until you get the other 42 episodes of material you

[05:01] said you'd get in another episode. Okay. Thank you so much, Glan.

[05:06] Doosh. Wow. Hey, he started it. He started it. Danny from Virginia said, I thoroughly enjoyed

[05:13] the new show. I run between 80 and 100 miles a week and it's great to have new content

[05:18] to get through the miles runs 80 to 100 miles a week. So suffice it to say Danny's cardio

[05:24] is probably vastly superior to either of ours. No, I think he means he's like in a vehicle

[05:29] or a truck doing. It says run. I think you're taking a little too little.

[05:34] I'll take it completely literally. Okay. Tim says, I am really enjoying the Silver Ball

[05:39] Chronicles podcast. Oh, thank you, Tim. Thanks so much. Also, no one wrote in last week about

[05:45] the book that I couldn't remember. Remember I said that everybody read this book in high

[05:49] school and I couldn't remember what it was. The one that had the greasers in it. Well,

[05:53] I googled it after the podcast and it's the outsiders by SE Hilton and Ron, what did

[06:01] they miss out on? What they missed out on is whoever guessed it could have won a brand

[06:05] new Monsters pinball machine provided by last month's sponsor Dwight Sullivan's code. Oh,

[06:10] that's tough. Man, they could have if they would have got the secret question, they could

[06:17] have won a brand new Monsters pinball machine by Dwight Sullivan's code. Man, oh, man.

[06:22] That's all if they guess it, we would have said what that you you get the secret code, which

[06:28] is drink more oval team. That's right. That's our version of that, which is much, much better

[06:33] and much more lucrative. Well, let's jump into the today's topic and before stern pinball

[06:39] incorporated, which dominates today's pinball landscape, there was stern electronics. Ron,

[06:44] you know a lot about stern electronics, don't you? You can say that. I may have a few of them.

[06:49] So what how many stern do you have in your collection? Oh boy. Classic stern. Let's see.

[06:55] Well, I have stars, a cheetah, nine ball, big game, star gaser, meteor, dragon fist, oh

[07:05] in quick silver. And you've had more in the past? No, I pretty much kept them all. My

[07:11] father has a sea witch. Okay. And you're are you looking forward to collecting a few more

[07:16] of these classic sterns into your collection? Maybe one or two more. I have most of what

[07:22] I want at this point. Okay. Okay. So I've only played a few classic sterns. They do have

[07:28] a bit of a charm to them. And we'll get into the deeper dives as we get onto the today's

[07:32] pod. But you are a connoisseur, if you will, of the classic stern electronics. Yes, you

[07:39] could say that. You have you have your got leave connoisseurs, your ballet connoisseurs,

[07:44] Williams connoisseurs, and you have your stern connoisseurs. Yeah. So one one thing that

[07:49] you've always been criticized about on the slam till podcast is actually creating the

[07:55] stern electronics secondary market. Isn't that true? Yeah, they're really expensive now.

[08:01] We're being blamed for that. You've pumped that up. You were the one that was throwing

[08:05] the wood on the fire. But the cool thing is we got them all before they got expensive.

[08:09] Yeah. Isn't that funny? Isn't that great? So if I wanted to if I if I were looking for

[08:14] the next thing that you and I should pump over over the lifetime of our podcast to boost

[08:19] the prices, what should that be? What game should we pick to get expensive? Easy. Close

[08:25] encounters the third kind. Very expensive that no one wants to buy it. So I never have

[08:29] to play it. Got leave system one games. That's what we're going for. We'll get into those

[08:34] in another podcast. Where did stern electronics come from, Ron? It didn't just get started

[08:42] one day at a factory, right? That is correct. They came from the what was left of Chicago

[08:48] coin when Sam Stern bought him out. One of the earlier pinball manufacturers from, well

[08:53] you guessed it, Chicago was Chicago coin. And I want to get into a little bit of the background

[08:58] of Chicago coin. So to know where stern comes from, I think it's important for us to go

[09:03] back and look at what was the company that Sam and Gary Stern purchased to create stern

[09:09] electronics founded in 1933, the division of Chicago dynamic industries by Sam H. Ginsburg.

[09:17] At the time he operated a trade in business and trade in business models was very big

[09:21] in the coin op industry back in the late 1930s. Ron, do you know what the trade in business

[09:27] was? So the trade in business was early conversion kits where they take your game, pull it

[09:33] apart, put some stuff on it and boom, you got a new game. I mean, it's tough in the

[09:36] great depression and in the war times in the late 30s, early 40s around the time of the

[09:42] second world war to get material. So it was easier just to recycle those machines and convert

[09:46] them. And a lot of the games were very similar too. They were very, very similar. And one

[09:51] of the people that really got their start in this was the man himself, Harry Williams.

[09:56] That was really his business model. Chicago coin made a lot of bingoes, a lot of gun

[10:01] games, a lot of shuffle alleys. You have a shuffle alley? I do not have a shop all

[10:05] the rage. I noticed the big collectors, people that have big collections often people

[10:10] who have big basements with. Yeah, those bull. Room for that. And if you have like a ball

[10:16] boulder, you need a ton of room for one of those. Chicago coin never really made a huge

[10:22] impact in the industry. I mean, they were there. They were, they were always kind of

[10:26] around in the 1930s and 40s. They did a lot of bingo machines. Generally, they would

[10:31] sell 1500 2000 units and they really struggled when they got into the 60s and 70s because

[10:37] they spent most of their time on non pinball like bat games. And again, those shuffle

[10:43] alleys and gun games. Chicago coin made boards for the early bingo games. And we're not

[10:49] talking like electronic boards, but there was like literally a board right where on where

[10:53] they would put all of these switches and knobs and hooks that would create actual

[10:59] math, right? Yeah, bingo games are some of the most complicated electro mechanical devices

[11:06] you will ever encounter. Yeah, I don't know why anybody would want to get into so much

[11:12] math. But I mean, I guess that's kind of the the area that we're in, right? When a pinball,

[11:18] yes, there's probably a lot of people who are good at math. Now, Louis Ginsburg, David

[11:23] Ginsburg and Meyer Ginsburg in 1931, they had founded Genko, which is an amusement manufacturer.

[11:29] Basically, competitor to Chicago coin and they were actually relatives to the Ginsburg

[11:36] family or Samuel Ginsburg. I betcha that would be awkward Thanksgiving dinners for sure.

[11:41] That's very awkward. After 1953, the competitors kind of merged. I guess they sort of decided

[11:47] that they, you know, a company that's separate is probably less effective against the companies

[11:53] like the Gottlieb's and the Bally's that were mostly the industry dominators. Funny little

[11:57] note about Genko or Genko, I've heard it both ways. And I'm always confused. It was the

[12:03] proper pronunciation of that company. I've heard it called Genko. I've heard it called Genko.

[12:08] So if anybody knows, send us a line, send us an email and tell us how to say it properly.

[12:15] I've heard Steve Cordek who actually worked there. He said it was Genko. So I guess I should

[12:21] go by. He would probably be able to be the person we should lean on. Considering that it

[12:28] is Ginsburg is the last name of the owners is probably that way. Now, some of their biggest

[12:33] sellers, Killroy was 8,800 units. That was from January 1957 and 8,800 units back then.

[12:43] I mean, last episode, we talked about 10,000 units of selling something was a big deal. So when

[12:49] you're talking 30 years before that and they're selling 8,000 units, that's that's that's that's

[12:53] pretty staggering. These have flippers or with these older games. Killroy head. Killroy sounds like a 30s

[13:00] game. Sounds like a really old game. That's a 47. Let me take a look at this picture. It doesn't say it did

[13:06] not have flippers. Lipperless. So Ron, just a little bit of background. What when we talk about a

[13:12] flipper non flipper game, what are we talking about? Humpty Dumpty was the first game with the flippers.

[13:18] And after that came out, everyone had to have flippers on their game immediately. All the flipperless

[13:22] games became completely obsolete almost immediately. So pretty much anything before Humpty Dumpty,

[13:29] it's going to be referred to as a flipperless game. When we look at their second largest seller,

[13:35] which was Beam Light, that was from 1935. And that one actually had zero flippers. And it was more of

[13:42] like a bag of tell game, which is kind of where you shoot the ball up. It bounces around. It lands in a hole.

[13:48] It's pretty awesome. Oh, it is. It requires you to do math too. You have to you have to add up all of the

[13:56] the pockets, the holes that it goes in for your score. Yeah. And so this company, they're, you know, they're generating

[14:01] revenue. They've got some decent sellers. They just sort of are there, right? They're not they're not an

[14:06] industry leader. They're not innovating none of that stuff. Well, you know, around the 1970s,

[14:13] you're really trying to compete with the got leaves of the world, the ballies of the world. And they've

[14:17] really stepped up their game at that point, right? In the early 70s.

[14:21] They had a cranking amount, especially you go into the mid 70s and they start licensing things,

[14:25] especially ballet games like Wizard, captive, fantastic. Yeah. So the best way to compete with that is to

[14:30] not compete with that. And that's really what Chicago coin decided to do. And as I mentioned before,

[14:36] they did kind of more of those shooting gun games. They did a few more of the different style games

[14:41] as opposed to the flippers. And in 1973, they really moved into video because video was all the rage

[14:48] at the time. They had a knockoff pong, which was called video ping pong. Everyone had a knockoff

[14:54] pong. In 1974, they were actually sued along with a bunch of other companies by Magnavox,

[15:01] regarding patents of their Magnavox Odyssey from 1972, which is really the first commercial home

[15:07] video console. So we're talking before the Atari 2600 way before the Nintendo entertainment system.

[15:14] Way before, and the thing about the Magnavox Odyssey actually had, when people think of say,

[15:19] Nintendo, the NES, they think of the zapper gun that it came with. Magnavox also came with a gun.

[15:26] And it was a big ass rifle that looked real. Of course it did. Everything in the 70s was

[15:30] super like that, right? So this was, this was kind of an interesting time because during that

[15:36] lawsuit, they really, Chicago coin really got into financial trouble along with a lot of these other

[15:42] companies. So because of that, they moved into somewhat of a of a bankruptcy period. And they ended

[15:49] up selling their assets, the pinball assets, the manufacturing assets of Chicago coin to Sam

[15:57] and Gary Stern. When your company gets into kind of a bankruptcy, you can actually sell off those

[16:05] assets to a new company without that company actually assuming the debt. Chicago coins assets were

[16:12] purchased at bankruptcy sale, forming the core inventory for Stern Electronics Incorporated. And

[16:19] because it was a separate company, they didn't assume the debt that Chicago coin had a mass

[16:25] fighting this lawsuit. If I remember, Gary Stern's a lawyer, so I'm sure he had all that under

[16:29] control. The Sterns are such an integral part, particularly Gary Stern now in today's pinball

[16:36] landscape, being the owner of the dominant brand in the industry. You know, the guy has to at

[16:42] least know what's coming and going, right? And at this time, he's really sort of starting in

[16:46] the industry with somebody like Sam Stern, his father, you know, I think he's really, he's really

[16:52] got a hold of this. And today he's probably got a better hold than he ever has. So enter Sam Stern.

[16:57] Ron, Sam Stern was obviously the sort of the leader of this purchase, the person who really sort of

[17:03] came in with Gary. You know, who was Sam Stern? Well, Sam Stern started in the business in 1931.

[17:10] When he was talked into buying five coin operated amusement machines. So I believe he did some

[17:15] operating at the time he's working in a men's closing business. I took on a rockola

[17:19] distribution and Philadelphia and probably one of his most important contributions before Stern

[17:25] electronics was he was part owner of Williams electronics with Harry Williams. And that's the famous

[17:31] the airplane story where basically Sam Stern went in a Harry Williams office said, why don't you

[17:37] sell me your company? So Harry Williams who had a pilot's license, he went out in his private plane

[17:42] flew around Chicago a little bit. Just think about it came back and said, sure, let's do it. And he

[17:47] sells him 49% of his company, right? Not controlling share, but he gets, he gets basically half of the

[17:52] company. Imagine if I just sort of, you know, I went out and I got on my niece on Marano, jumping my car,

[17:59] drive over to Chicago. I walk into, I walk into Jersey Jack at their new manufacturing facility

[18:08] and I just go, hey, hey, Jack, sell me half the company. I got like a double-breasted suit,

[18:15] probably a cigar, feed up on the desk. Do you think that would pan out for me? No, I don't think

[18:21] it would pan out at all. Yeah. So he really, he was really integral Sam Stern, I guess and

[18:28] and William and Harry Williams at building the foundation for the coin op industry really kind of

[18:34] in that post-war era when the flipper started becoming, you know, much more commonplace. Yeah,

[18:39] and then you remember about Harry Williams was more, he was an innovator, he was a designer,

[18:44] he liked making games. He liked being an engineer. Yeah, I saw someone coming in saying, I'll run

[18:50] the company and they were buddies. It's like, sure, that's perfect. I want to just make games. Yeah,

[18:55] I mean, in the 1950s, they'd introduce so many innovations, things like the score reels,

[19:02] multiplayer games, sophisticated mechanisms, like something as silly as we think of today as

[19:09] like the tilt bob created by Harry Williams, he would much prefer doing that as opposed to actually

[19:15] running the ins and outs of a company. Those are two totally different skill sets, which will come

[19:20] into play later in our story. Yeah, one of the one of the funny things that that I read was that

[19:25] Sam Stern would often walk by people's desks and then he just grabbed papers and flipped through

[19:30] the papers and go, that number's wrong. And then just walk away. In 1959, Sam saw the opportunity to

[19:38] purchase the rest of Williams manufacturing and he kept the company until 1964 when he actually

[19:44] sold the company for an exchange of stock in Seaburg Corp. But he remained the president until 1969

[19:51] at Williams. What's Seaburg Corp? Seaburg's probably most known for making ju boxes. Yeah, some of

[19:58] the Seaburg's I think are probably the prettiest ju boxes out there in my opinion.

[20:02] And the thing about Harry Williams at this point, I think in 1960,

[20:07] thinking he made one of his last games, yeah, for Williams and kind of went into a semi,

[20:11] well, he never retired, but he kind of left Williams. I believe he went back to California and

[20:16] started making other things. Like little got that mini pro golf game he came up with and I think

[20:22] he had his own company there. So that's where he was hanging out for the time being.

[20:26] Yeah, so Harry Williams is always the innovator, right? He just can't stop tinkering. He's a tinkerer.

[20:32] So when Sam Stern's contract was up, he went over to Bali as an executive vice president for a year.

[20:38] But it wasn't too long until he was right back at Seaburg as president. And that's where he

[20:42] remained until December of 1976. What happened then? Sam learned that Chicago coined it to fault it

[20:49] on a loan and he and his son Gary jumped on the opportunity. Sam was obviously itching to get back

[20:55] into pinball or into manufacturing in general. He wanted to own everything. He wanted to do that.

[21:01] So he jumped in with his son Gary. Gary, as you had mentioned earlier, was a lawyer by education

[21:08] and he shortly practiced law before entering the pinball industry. And often remembers visiting the

[21:14] manufacturing line when he was young. Yeah, so he's a second generation pinball manufacturer. He's

[21:19] got a different perspective on the business. One of the interesting stories was it's 16. Gary

[21:24] spent the working summer at Williams. He worked in the stock room. He was a personnel manager.

[21:31] Yeah, and he learned he shouldn't use any tools because he would often destroy things on the

[21:35] manufacturing floor. So he was not very adept at actually building anything. Yeah, he was the opposite

[21:42] of a hairy Williams. He was maybe Sam Stern kind of in the middle. You got Gary on the other side

[21:49] who's more of the sort of the academic thought business person, right? Like don't give the man a

[21:53] hammer basically. So when Sam heard about Chicago coin, I mean, Gary, Gary was pretty much in at

[21:59] that point. And when asked on an article by this weekend pinball, what his first pinball machine was,

[22:09] Gary said that he had never bought a pinball machine. I've bought some pinball companies,

[22:15] but I've never bought a pinball machine. And that's a true answer. I totally believe that. I

[22:20] totally believe that. I guarantee you doesn't have a single game in his house. Quote from Gary Stern,

[22:25] I love Flight 2000, hairy Williams games like that. I love some of the Steve Kirk's games like

[22:30] Meteor, Stars and Nine Ball. A lot of our old games back in the day. Yeah, but what, I mean,

[22:34] if you ask Gary Stern what his favorite game was, what would he tell you? Whatever's on the line.

[22:38] Exactly. And I think it's pretty interesting to be able to say, hey, I found a quote where he

[22:44] actually talked about a game that wasn't on the line. So there you go. Good good job, Jeff Patterson,

[22:49] over at this weekend pinball to get Gary to actually say that. So do you want to get into some of

[22:53] the games that Stern Electronics released? So they buy the company, they start manufacturing. Do

[22:59] you want to jump into that now? Sure. The first game that actually did was a holdover from Chicago

[23:04] coin called Stampede. And remember, when they first took over Chicago coin, it was still

[23:10] electric mechanicals. We haven't gone into solid state yet. So a stampede was actually the first

[23:16] game. So there are stampede that are stamped with the Chicago coin logo. And then there's one

[23:21] stamp with the Stern logo. Oh, interesting. And then there's also, I believe, Raw Hide,

[23:27] which is, I think that's like a four player version of. Yeah. So let me, let me yippee-i-ki-e

[23:35] the stats here for you for Stampede. Yeah, we're still doing this though. Oh, man. Yeah,

[23:42] I hope you're enjoying it. So it's a cowboy like cowgirl western theme. It's from February

[23:50] 77. It's electric mechanical. So it still has the reels and the chimes and all of the,

[23:55] the shenanigans in the in the bottom. It doesn't have computer boards. They produced 1,100. It was

[24:01] designed by Albin Peters, Jerry Koki and Wendell McAdam. These were holdovers from Chicago coin time.

[24:12] They actually didn't do any other Sterns. These were the last machines they did. The artwork was

[24:17] by Christian Marschet who did art everywhere with Bally and Williams. I think it's Christian,

[24:22] I think it's Christian Marsh. He says Marsh? Yeah, Marsh, I believe it's him. He doesn't know how to

[24:27] say his real name. Maybe, maybe when he, well, he's French, maybe they, not non-French didn't

[24:32] when he came over. Oh my god. Anyway, he did the art for Grand Prix, Tri-Zone, hot tip.

[24:41] And space Odyssey, some of those sort of iconic EMs of Bally back in the 70s.

[24:46] I'm looking at our notes and I'm glad you skipped over Strato Flight because that is a terrible game.

[24:50] Yeah, I really know that one because I see it for sale all the time. Yeah, there's a reason.

[24:56] So of course you added raw hide in there, which was the four player game. It sold 1200 units. So

[25:01] together combined, you know, it's selling around 2500, 200, 300 units. So I mean, it's not a,

[25:09] it's not a failure by any means. It was, it's still sold. And then their next game was disco.

[25:15] Yeah, I wonder why that came out during the disco craze of the mid to late 70s, another EM,

[25:21] two player version. And the funny thing is, for my notes here, it has no designer credited.

[25:27] So no one wanted to take any credit for this particular game. Right. So that's just another

[25:31] machine that was sort of just there. They needed to kind of get something out, something on the line.

[25:37] And you know, my assumption would be that it would be Jerry Koki that did that. And

[25:45] Ron, do you have a copy of the pinball compendium book somewhere in this house? Yes, I do.

[25:50] Somewhere somewhere in the house. So I've got both copies. That's one of the resources that I've

[25:55] got in the show notes. One of the resources I'm using a lot. And I thought it would be a really

[26:02] good time to leverage that book to talk about Jerry Koki because he's probably one of those people

[26:10] that has done a lot in pinball, but I don't think it's a lot of recognition. So I thought this

[26:15] would be a really good point to bring him up, considering this is his last game. So he was the head

[26:21] engineer of Chicago coin. He was born on June the 12th, 1910 in Chicago. He really worked in TV

[26:27] and phone manufacturing until the depression in the 1930s when he went back to school for engineering.

[26:33] He joined Bali. And then in 1936 went to Chicago coin. During the war, Jerry repositioned Chicago

[26:40] coin into the war effort, making subassemblies for planes, tanks, and naval vessels. And he had a very

[26:46] good reputation at Chicago coin for making quality materials in 1950, even NASA contracted Chicago

[26:54] coin to manufacture some of their pieces. His first game that he created was Bermuda in 1947.

[27:01] And his last game design was Stampede 1977, although I kind of think he probably did disco as well.

[27:08] And he was kind of what he'd been 67 around the time. So he's probably nearing retirement.

[27:15] Yeah, I think at that time when there's such an upheaval in the in the industry, there's a lot

[27:19] of upheaval within the company you're in in general. At that point, you're probably like,

[27:24] I've kind of had it. So he's not a really well-known person. He's not a hairy Williams. He's not a

[27:28] Gary Stern. But I thought he needed to be recognized. Yeah. And now he is. So the next game,

[27:34] and I can say it's kind of the first real Stern game, has the least original title of any

[27:42] the best title. Yeah, what else do you need?

[27:48] Pinball by Stern has just a big silver ball on it. And the thing about this game is it was originally

[27:53] made as Electromechanical. And there's very few of them. There was there was only about 594

[27:58] produced of the Electromechanical version. And then they went to solid state. So there was

[28:04] way more solid state. Yeah, 1650 solid states produced. So almost triple the amount.

[28:11] And how they got there is very interesting. Because if you look at a Stern, a solid state Stern,

[28:21] and you look at a ballie of the same era, you're going to think, hmm, these are very silly. So you

[28:26] open up the head, you take the back glass off, you open up the cabinet, you look inside,

[28:30] and they look exactly the same. Pretty much, yeah. And how did that happen? Well, I mean,

[28:37] it's just a coincidence, obviously. Oh, I'm sure it was a coincidence. Now what happened is

[28:44] Stern invested in solid state technology and how they invested, they acquired universal

[28:51] research laboratories, you know, okay. And what they did is they produced circuit boards. And

[28:59] they were tasked with reverse engineering the body board. So Gary and Sam, let's assume,

[29:05] kind of showed up to this company that they purchased URL and say, hey, I got these boards.

[29:11] Can you make these boards? And they just copied them? Pretty much just, I mean, I guess you call

[29:20] it reverse engineering. Well, yeah, they reversed engineering. They called them different,

[29:24] but if they're the same, same boards, they use the same system, which consists of basically a

[29:32] ampute, a computer, a solenoid driver board. So the solenoid that drives the

[29:41] pop bumpers and the drop targets and stuff. And then you had your lamp driver board,

[29:46] which is for the lights. Lights, then you would have your transformer and your rectifier board.

[29:51] Great, which runs the power. Which they would add things like sound boards. So you're telling me

[29:57] that they are almost identical. They're pretty much identical because if you get one any repro

[30:03] board, like an all-tech or something like that, you can use it on any valley or stern of the air.

[30:09] Well, what are the odds of that? What are the odds that valley sued them? Because they did.

[30:14] Ultimately, stern had to pay valley a royalty for each one of the systems that were sold.

[30:19] Couldn't find the details of that through my research. And, you know, honestly,

[30:25] I think valley probably didn't mind because they saw it as their system as the system.

[30:30] So if they have another company using their system, I mean, valley tried from the very beginning,

[30:36] valley, when they came up with the soft, their solace system, they tried to trademark it.

[30:41] Not just their system, but any solace thing. So, so they like if you made an electronic

[30:47] pinball game, you had to use their system. Luckily, they didn't win that. Or we'd have, that

[30:53] wouldn't have been good for the industry. Yes. Well, I mean, when you look at it, valley, obviously,

[30:58] you know, wanted everybody to use their technology because then they could be able to sort of dictate

[31:03] what the industry went in which direction. In this case, they could grab a royalty. But surely

[31:09] Gary Stern learned a lesson right to never copy a board set again. Now, I did the same thing with

[31:16] Daddy East when they ripped off William System 11, but that's for a future episode. That's getting

[31:21] way ahead. Way ahead. Way ahead. Now, these first electronic games that Stern did, they use the

[31:29] M100 MPU board, which I'll mention that because when we get, when we get into what a lot of people

[31:34] consider their most classic games is the point where they upgraded their CPU board or MPU board

[31:41] to a more powerful board with more capabilities. They really ramped up the horsepower.

[31:47] At this point, they still, they had no sound board. Pinball actually has chimes just like an EM.

[31:53] They did not go, we do not have sound yet. So we're still inside the machine. We still have

[32:00] a chime box. It still sounds like an old EM machine, right? It's still, and Stern used actually a

[32:06] four chime, a four bar chime box as opposed to a three three bar chime box. Okay, so they got a

[32:12] different note. And yeah, they have a, I think it's the the bigger one, which will be with a lower

[32:18] note, but their their chime box is, they're terrible. They're terrible. They're like a little piece of

[32:24] wood and they literally destroy themselves over time. Actually, of the classic Sterns that I have

[32:29] seen the earlier M100 machines, they've all had Zachariah chime boxes in them. Really? Yeah.

[32:36] Interesting. This, the Stern chime boxes have a very distinct, very tinny sound, almost cheap,

[32:43] but it's kind of their charm. Would you say that the Sterns probably went for a cost-cutting version

[32:51] of their chime box? I would say, I think I've said this analogy before. Think of the companies,

[32:58] think of, think of Williams and Balley as a, a, well built, say, economy car. And Gottlieb is like

[33:07] a station wagon with a wood paneling on the side. The real fake wood paneling? But really built

[33:15] well, but not, you know, not something you actually want to drive around. And think of Stern is that

[33:21] really awesome sports car that's made almost entirely a plastic that if it hits anything,

[33:25] will just disintegrate. And that's a, that's, that's a Stern. A fiero of the pinball industry.

[33:32] As someone who's had Williams, old Williams, Solid State games and Balley Solid State games,

[33:37] I can say they definitely have a cheaper feel. The cabinets, just most things about them are

[33:44] cheaper, but that's what makes them play the way they do. They're mechs or cheap, they're light,

[33:49] but because of that, they just, they really work well and the games play super fast.

[33:54] It is part of the charm. Pinball was designed by Mike Kubin, right? So he did electronomo,

[33:59] Nuget, and Magic, and most notably CWitch. He was a very prolific designer at the old Stern.

[34:06] Fun fact. Did you hear that? I played a song there. He did? No. It uses the same roms as Stingray.

[34:15] They're next game. Interesting. Stingray is a water sports. No, not that kind of water sports.

[34:23] Scuba diving theme from 1977. In December, standard body sold 3000 units. Again, Mike Kubin,

[34:30] Sam Stern, and this fella, Roger Sharp. Roger Sharp? What did he do to the game?

[34:36] Roger Sharp showed up at the factory one day and just said, hey, you should put the stuff on the left

[34:42] side of the play field a little bit different. The one on the right side make these changes,

[34:47] and it evidently made the game worse. To your opinion. In my opinion, of course.

[34:52] Well, Dylan says, I love Stingray. I miss it and I regret selling it. The spinner was great,

[34:57] and the double scoop set up always made for fun. The potential of getting 55,000 from a scoop made

[35:02] them tempting. The artwork and theme were fantastic too. Only thing I had a problem with was how

[35:07] worthless and dangerous the drop targets felt compared to the rest of the game. When I find

[35:11] another one, I will certainly pick it up again. Yeah, those drop targets and that side of the game.

[35:17] Thanks, Roger Sharp. Actually, Dylan is from my hometown here in Frederickton, New Brunswick,

[35:21] and the person who really was able to bring me in to competitive pinball. I think the first real

[35:29] rocket that Stern electronics had was stars. And we received this email to silverballcroniclesatgmail.com

[35:37] from Chris and Chris said, dearest Ron, you wrote that in capitals and dynamite Dave.

[35:44] Steve Kirk and stars. That is all Chris. He's right. Everyone knows stars is one of the

[35:51] greatest games I've ever made. I have yet to play stars. Although stars really intrigues me.

[35:59] Stars is just one more game, just one more game over and over and over. Cannot stop playing it.

[36:06] I would say this is probably one of the definitely the best MP100 game that they did.

[36:15] And it still has the chimes. We still have no sound. We have no sound board yet.

[36:19] So it's like space exploration theme. It's from March 78, sold 5,127 units.

[36:25] They're big. Yeah. And the funny thing about it is this was Steve Kirk's first game.

[36:32] I mean, he has credits on other games before this, but this was his first solo design credit.

[36:37] And it has one pop-up or just one pop-up or at the top and his wide open game.

[36:43] And he actually had to fight with management to get the one pop-up.

[36:46] I mean, Gary Stern's thing is like three pop-up. Yeah, I could see Gary Stern's in there.

[36:50] Where's the three pop-upers? And he was incredulous. It's like, I don't get it.

[36:54] I'm keeping the cost down by not putting other pop-upers in here. And you're yelling at me.

[37:00] It had to have a very low bill of materials. If you ever should look at it,

[37:03] it only has two three banks and all the rest are stand-up targets, one spinner and one pop-up.

[37:09] It is quite barren underneath the play field. I could tell you that as far as Max.

[37:12] This could not have cost that much to make. It's probably why they made so many of them.

[37:16] So the cool thing about stars is there's targets throughout the machine.

[37:23] You shoot that target, which is a star. And then that star adds more value to the spinner

[37:29] on the right side of the play field, right? That is correct.

[37:32] So the thing is how many stars can I get to juice that spinner? And they're all in sort of

[37:40] dangerous places, right? Well, the two are. The rest are at the top and are a pretty safe place.

[37:47] Okay, so then you're like, okay, well, I can go for the two safe ones and then smash that spinner.

[37:52] Or I can try to eke out another one or two and try to juice that spinner.

[37:56] Or you just try to get a drop bank down to get the double bonus and just try to build your bonus up.

[38:03] Okay, so you skip that to stars. You can go it either way. There are multiple strategies. Yes,

[38:08] even on a game this old. You do not have to go for the stars if you don't want to.

[38:11] So that's kind of one of the first games where you could be like, well, wait a second,

[38:15] I don't have to just do the thing. But the thing is the funnest thing to try to do.

[38:21] Well, yeah, of course, everybody loves orbit spinners.

[38:23] It has other interesting rules with the drop targets where if you get the two outer ones down,

[38:29] but the center one's still up, it lights that one for I think like 7,000 points or something like that.

[38:35] It hasn't a lot of nice rules like that. Complete things but don't complete things.

[38:41] Like the drops actually control the value of the left spinner. But if you get them all down,

[38:46] then it resets the value. There's a lot of cool rules in a game like this. That's this old.

[38:52] That it just keeps you coming back. I can't say enough good things about stars.

[38:56] What do you think of the art of stars? It's passable. Passable. I think it's pretty cool.

[39:01] It's passable. I kind of really like it. That's done by my buddy Jorge.

[39:05] Your buddy Jorge?

[39:08] The hell is his name. Jorge Aburan.

[39:10] Aburagon. Jorge Aburagon. That's how it works.

[39:13] Jorge Aburagon. And he really did three games which surprisingly enough are all Steve Kirk games.

[39:20] Wow. He must have been his personal artist. He's like his buddy. Yeah. His home break.

[39:27] The thing about stars too, I never see a good stars backlash. They're always wasted.

[39:32] They are always a mess. But CPR has a new reproduction mirrored backlash and it looks gorgeous.

[39:38] That's another thing about the sturns. They used... Well actually, stars has the thicker backlash.

[39:44] But their backlash is for whatever reason. They just don't seem to hold up as well as some of

[39:48] the other manufacturers. Are you saying that they were probably made on the cheap?

[39:53] I don't know. That doesn't sound like a stern.

[39:55] I mean, I've seen some good stern backlashs but I mean, most of them just seem to get wasted.

[40:03] Interesting stuff. So I mean, I guess this is a good place to really dive into who is Steve Kirk,

[40:09] right? Steve Kirk is awesome.

[40:11] Yeah. So Steve Kirk best known for stars, meteor,

[40:15] nine ball, gamutron, swords of fury. We'll deep dive those in a moment. His first credited design

[40:22] was 1968 with Gottlieb Funpark with Ed Kinsky, the legend himself. What kind of brought him up

[40:31] into the fold and to bring him notoriety and I would assume what brought his attention to

[40:38] somebody like a Gary Stern was that he actually wrote a book about pinball and tournament pinball

[40:44] in 1978. In February of 1978, PlayMeter magazine actually named Steve Kirk,

[40:52] Coinman of the Month. And it was about the time that stars was going to come out. Steve Kirk,

[40:58] he's accredited for a couple of things but one of them was that he actually was the president

[41:04] and one of the main founders of the pinball association of America. Have you heard of that before,

[41:09] Rob? I have heard of that. I've seen the phone number. Yeah. So in 1975, the association held

[41:16] its first national pinball open in Chicago. It drew 1,400 players. That's more than pinberg. Wow.

[41:26] So that's, I mean, that's a big deal, which is probably one of the reasons why he decided to write a

[41:33] book. So his book was 128 pages, 5,000 words and really talked about the history of pinball,

[41:40] where pinball was going and tournament pinball and risk reward. Very cool read if you can get your

[41:45] hands on one, which is basically impossible. So since 1971, when they started signing memberships,

[41:53] they've actually sold about 9,000 memberships at the time by 1978 over a seven year period. That's

[42:01] a lot of players. So like, IFA before IFA. This is the IFA before the IFA. It's a big deal.

[42:07] Tournaments in fact would usually start on a Friday afternoon. They'd end on a Sunday. So it's,

[42:12] it's, he was a, he was sort of a big, I guess, mover and shaker in early competitive pinball,

[42:20] which is really, I think, probably one of the reasons he got moved into sort of a designer role.

[42:26] So one of the cool bits about stars, one of the things that you'll see is that there is a rocket

[42:32] on there flying across the back glass. There's an SK1, which stands for Steve Kirk 1 for his first

[42:38] design, which gets confusing later as you'll see. Yeah, it's going to get into a whole whole thing

[42:43] for, for people that are good at math, for some reason, it really got at a hand here with, with the

[42:48] numbering. One thing that's also really cool about stars is the Kirk post. What's a Kirk post?

[42:55] The Kirk post is the post that's in between the flippers because the, the game has a very wide

[43:00] flipper gap. The post is there. It's, it's meant to be, it's part of the game. You play the post.

[43:07] So what are some of the, what are some of the strategies you use with the, with the Kirk post?

[43:10] If it's going right down the center, you can save it. You can also use it to transfer the ball from

[43:15] one flipper to another. It doesn't always work, but you can try it. You can get it to, so if you've

[43:19] got your ball trapped on the left side, you can lower that flipper, it can roll down. Yep.

[43:25] Bounce off the post and land on the, on the right flipper. Hopefully. It doesn't always work.

[43:31] Depends. It depends on that particular stars you're playing. So you've seen people do that.

[43:35] I've seen people do that. Now, do they usually keep those in a pinburg style event, like a big

[43:41] event, do they usually keep the Kirk post in place? I've seen it removed, but not for a long time.

[43:46] It's usually always there. The game doesn't need to be made any harder. It's plenty harder.

[43:52] It's very hard as it is. Yeah. So what we'll do here is we'll follow Steve Kirk's career,

[43:57] and then we'll dive back into Stern in a moment, because we're going to get our timelines messed up

[44:02] here a little bit. Actually, before you do that, we should mention, we should mention the, uh,

[44:07] his name's on the play field. Oh, yeah. Very, yeah. Totally. Another thing that Steve Kirk

[44:12] brought to Stern, and I would say do pretty much all pinball, because I don't think this had occurred

[44:18] before Steve Kirk did it, but I'm sure someone can correct me. Steve Kirk consisted that his name

[44:24] be put on the play field as a designer credit. So before he didn't have that? Yeah. Before the

[44:29] designers usually didn't get credit, they might put their names or hide them in the art somewhere

[44:36] in a backlash, or the people who did the backlash could usually hide the put their names in there.

[44:40] There were other designers that might, they might have like, um, I can't remember his name,

[44:44] but one of the ballet designers he would put like a certain red post in every game. That was his,

[44:50] that was his trademark. It was the fellow that did Zeyn on. It's he did, um, Harlem,

[44:55] Glove Trotters. So if you look at, if you look at Harlem, you'll see a red post that's a little

[44:59] different than all the other posts. That was this trademark. Steve Kirk was like, no, I want credit.

[45:05] I want the design credit on the play field. So if you look at stars, it says right on it,

[45:10] design my Steve Kirk. Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken. So there you go. Great. Ken,

[45:14] Ken, I only know that because I did Zeyn on. And when I bought it and I went to rebuild it,

[45:18] but he was like, if you throw this post out, I will kill you. So is his name is and

[45:24] Stern started doing that for their other designers too, going forward and a lot of their games.

[45:29] Harry Williams, they started putting his name on there. Even the other designers, they started

[45:33] getting credit. Even games like if you go all the way to the end, like my dragon fist, it has

[45:38] Joe Joe's the designer, his name's right on the play field. And as far as I know, they were the

[45:43] only ones doing that at that. So why do you think that, why do you think that they didn't have

[45:47] their names on the play field before? Just wasn't a thing, I guess. I don't think anyone insisted

[45:53] on it. Like I want my damn name on it. I mean, I would probably say that, I mean, maybe it's because

[45:59] the manufacturer doesn't want anybody to know who the designer is because if the talent moves

[46:05] around in the industry, that individual is going to follow the talent as opposed to stay with the

[46:10] brand. So good point. It Kurds Stern doesn't put their name on the play field. Unless it's a

[46:16] signature on an LE or something. So what was Steve Kirk's next game after the the awesomeness

[46:22] that it stars? Yeah. So Steve Kirk really followed that up with I think one of the most fun games

[46:28] I've played when it comes to early solid state. And that's meteor. And I'm going to, I'm going to

[46:33] just jump right in here. Let the stats fall to earth like a meteor. Oh, very good. That's space

[46:42] apocalypse theme. It's from September 1979. It's an M200, the first M200 system. Yes, it is.

[46:49] It's that this one is a smash it. It sells 7,939 units and it is Stern's highest seller since stars.

[46:59] And it was once again the art and the programming by the same team with Steve Kirk leading them.

[47:05] I would say meteor may be the best Stern game. The backlash in the flyer were derived from the 1979

[47:13] movie meteor and the original printing of the poster is by the space artist Robert McCall.

[47:19] And the first game to actually have the SB 300 soundboard sounds fancy.

[47:26] Well, it was the first game they'd had with decent sound because their MPU 100 games when they

[47:32] got ditched the chimes and they started actually you sound they were bad very bad. So would you say

[47:38] that they are got leaps system one bad? Yes. Oh, I kind of at that level. Would you say that this new

[47:44] SB 300 is better or worse way better way better. In the first episode we talked about flash coming

[47:52] on the scene with Steve Richie and Williams and they added dynamic background sound and that's

[47:57] kind of really what the SB 300 soundboard did right it added this tone. Yeah, this droning sound.

[48:03] Yes, meteor was the beginning of what a lot of people consider the golden age or the best

[48:10] Sterns that will come out. They start with meteor when they did the upgrades of the MPU 200.

[48:15] Got the soundboard the new soundboard in there with the actual decent sounds. This is where it really

[48:21] starts where they really start kicking some butt. Yeah, so Steve of course we mentioned a few

[48:26] moments ago was the founder president of that the body that really managed pinball tournaments and

[48:32] his games from this point on actually had a sticker on the lower apron identifying that it was

[48:39] selected as a game for tournament play and reportedly these stickers which were Steve Kirk's idea

[48:46] were installed in each apron starting from this point on during long production runs. So you

[48:52] mentioned before you saw the phone number before and this is where you'd see that phone number, right?

[48:55] Yep, it was right on the sticker. The stickers I think they start to put them on about halfway

[49:00] through the production run. I actually have a earlier meteor it doesn't have the sticker,

[49:04] but the later ones do. That's one way you can you can tell if no one's removed it. That's one way

[49:09] you can tell where about you are in the run whether you have the sticker or not. Yeah, my friend Dylan

[49:15] had the quote from earlier on on Stingray. He has a meteor and I cannot recall if he has one of

[49:22] these stickers next time I see him. I'm going to check and see if it does. Yeah, on the meteor back glass

[49:26] and this is where it gets weird on the actual rock on one of the rockets. Have you ever seen the

[49:31] movie meteor? I haven't seen the movie meteor. I assume it's amazing. Well, people don't realize how

[49:37] tied into the movie the game is. In the movie it takes them three rockets to destroy the meteor

[49:43] and those are your three rockets in the middle of the play field. Oh, I see. So, but it's not it's not

[49:47] it's not a licensed title. No, it is. Totally licensed title. Is it really? Yes, it's based off the movie.

[49:53] I didn't know that. I just assumed that it was like, oh, we'll just make this game. It's kind of like

[49:58] the movie. No, if you look at the back glass, it's got the trademark right on it. It's from the movie.

[50:03] Very cool. And I just think it's funny that a tie-in to a movie where they actually

[50:10] they must have had the script or something to know what the plot of the movie is because it mirrors

[50:15] the plot. That's why there's three rockets in the center of the play field. Would you say that

[50:19] meteor is better or worse as a movie compared to Disney's black hole? Oh, I've actually seen black

[50:27] hole. It's on Disney plus. Nothing to do with the got Lee black hole. There was completely

[50:31] separate. They have nothing to do with each other. Last time I saw a black hole, I was a kid. I

[50:37] remember Maximilian was pretty cool. The robot. That's all I remember. Maybe we'll do a movies and

[50:44] pinball machines episode or movies Disney made when they were hurting episode. Yeah, so if you

[50:50] want to do an episode of movies with pinball machines, just send us an email at silverballacronicles

[50:59] at gmail.com. Do you mean movies with pinball machines and them or pinball machines about movies?

[51:04] No pinball machines about movies. There you go. We're talking like Tron Legacy. One of the greatest

[51:09] games ever created. Sure. I own one of those. I know. Okay. But on the meteor back glass on the

[51:16] side of one of the rockets, it says SK5. Well, that doesn't make sense. This is a second game. Exactly.

[51:22] It doesn't make sense. And that's why it's still upsetting that Mr. Kirk is no longer with us

[51:26] because that would literally be the first thing I'd ask him. Please, please, especially in this era

[51:31] of podcasts and everyone gets interviewed. He would still be getting interviewed now. I think so.

[51:35] If he wanted to, though, he might not have wanted to be interviewed. Who knows? That's true. So his

[51:40] next game was Nine Ball. And let's Nine Ball corner pocket some stats here. It's a pool gambling

[51:47] space wizard magicie theme. It's from December 1980. It's an M200 2,279 machines produced. And again,

[51:57] same programming, same art team and a mechanical and software nightmare. A mechanical nightmare. Please

[52:03] tell me why it's mechanical nightmare for one reason. It has a drop target bank that must weigh

[52:11] 15, 20 pounds. Okay. So it's on the left side of the play field. There's like how many drop targets?

[52:16] There's eight drop targets. Seven of them are individually addressable and can be dropped. There

[52:22] is literally, let me count here. Seven. There's eight coils on the mech. Seven little coils and one

[52:28] large reset coil. If you want each drop target to come down, it needs to separate up and down by itself.

[52:33] But well, it just goes down by itself. It doesn't go up by itself. So it still needs a coil for that.

[52:38] So what will happen is there's one through eight. It's number one through eight. They're all pool balls.

[52:43] Get it? So you need to hit them in order. So if you hit like one, it goes down. If you hit three,

[52:47] it'll go down. But then when you hit two, it'll reset all the targets and then drop everything except

[52:52] the one, the two and the three that you hit down. Oh, I see. And it resets and drop reset, reset,

[52:58] re-over and over and over. It works the mech so much that it literally just destroys itself.

[53:03] Believe me, from one who knows and the game has multi-ball, it has a lock area that uses a really

[53:10] bizarre, when you lock balls in there, they actually kind of stack on top of each other. Interesting.

[53:14] So it frequently, if the switches are even slightly out of adjustment and it doesn't know where the

[53:20] balls are, it will get horribly confused. And it has very poor, they did 60 revisions of the software

[53:28] trying to get it to work right. Wow. That's right. 60 revisions. And most of it had to do with

[53:32] multi-ball, not working right, losing track over the balls where are getting confused. It just,

[53:37] they could not account for if something went wrong in the game. I know I have one. I use an

[53:43] internments, but it's always an iffy proposition or whether it will get confused at some point.

[53:47] But it's still a great game. It was maybe a bit ambitious for the time. The mech is actually from

[53:53] another game that drop target mech from hell. It's from flight 2000. But on that game, it's not

[53:58] used the same way. It's not cycled over and over. So it doesn't really have the issues that it does

[54:02] on nine ball. I've never, I've never seen a nine ball. Nine ball also has a cool hanging spinner.

[54:08] Like it's only mounted on one side and it hangs out. It's like those modern spinners. It's like a

[54:14] spinner. I think Metallica, they hang out and it's just connected on one side. Very cool. It has to

[54:19] be one of the first to have that. I don't think too many of them have that back then. Yeah, so it's

[54:22] Easter egg. It has an SK3 on the on the wizard's hat. Okay. That's his third game. What's five? Why

[54:29] is it your five? It makes no sense. Maybe he designed it before they actually. Yeah, that's the

[54:35] rumor is that was actually fifth design. Well, what happened to all his other designs that I

[54:40] it's yeah, every time he wrote one like, no, that one sucks. I'm not doing that. Okay, SK3. Let's get

[54:46] rid of two. Two wasn't very good. It was based on ninjas. Nobody likes ninjas. They like wizards

[54:52] in space. It's still a weird game. It's pool, but there's a wizard. The art of this game was

[54:59] actually from a t-shirt, which can be seen in Roger Sharp's book from 1977 called pinball

[55:07] on page 13. Really? So the back glass. Yeah. I'm all about interesting, strange, annoying facts here.

[55:16] So one of the one of the things when I was doing my research on Steve Kirk was that I also found

[55:22] from a play meter from 1985. He really spoke about the creative crisis in coinop at the time. And

[55:33] this is again, we're jumping timelines around here a little bit. But in the 1980s when when

[55:39] sort of pinball was on its downturn, there was a big, you know, crisis at the time about creativity

[55:44] in pinball. We'll get into that maybe more in the Python angel low episode that we've got coming up.

[55:49] But at the time Steve Kirk worked for a company called pinstar. And just give us just a quick

[55:56] breakdown as to who pinstar was. Pinstar was the company that Gary Stern started after

[56:03] Stern Electronics went by by. So pinstar was a conversion type company. They made, yes, pinstar

[56:10] made conversion kits that you could use in older, usually like an older ballet game. Like if you

[56:16] had a lost world, which probably wasn't making much money anyway, because it's lost world,

[56:20] you could convert it to a different game using this kit. Yeah. So the most notable, I would say,

[56:25] game from pinstar was from 1985 called a gamutron, which was Steve Kirk's standard-bodied version

[56:34] of Harry Williams' very successful flight 2000 machine. It was a space theme from 1985. It had a

[56:42] ballet Stern board set surprise. And it also had a bit of an extra board that plugged into the

[56:50] computer unit. So it converted it. It has an unknown production amount. And the art was done by

[56:57] Shamus McLaughlin, who we had heard about in our previous episode. Really, the here we go going back

[57:03] into this sort of conversion kit or our trade in business model, right? It modified most

[57:11] existing Stern games from the previous era, as well as the ballet games at the time. The

[57:18] manufacturing flyer basically states it fits most standard body four-player ballet manufacturing

[57:24] corporation pinballs. And one of the major differences I would say between flight 2000 and gamutron

[57:30] was that gamutron does not talk. I think if you mod it, though, if you actually had a sound board,

[57:35] I believe it runs the same code. You could get it to talk. I'm trying to remember that. Yeah,

[57:40] so you're your co-host on slam tilt Ben. Ben. He has a gamutron, right? Yes, he has a gamutron.

[57:48] Another thing about gamutron, they didn't just make them for US market. They actually made kits

[57:53] for foreign markets. Okay. I got to play either Italian or Spanish gamutron. The the play field,

[58:01] the art was a little different. Okay. And it had an SK9. 9? Wow. He designed a lot of games that

[58:07] didn't make it. Yeah, absolutely. So we're just jumping all over the place. Maybe he's just

[58:11] making it up. One of the cool bits, I think, with gamutron on the back glass. It's awesome. It's

[58:16] art is awesome in my opinion. It's got that really cool 1980s robot destroying the world thing going

[58:23] on. And it has a bunch of initials all over the place. So there are characters on there. There's

[58:28] an SK for Steve Kirk. There's an HW for Harry Williams, JJ for Joe, Joe Jr. Gary Stern, G.S.

[58:36] S. S. Hamster. There's a shamist Mglochlin. S. M. And that one's handwritten almost like a signature

[58:42] on the back glass. There's also a couple of unknown initials on there is S.E.K.H. SBDS and 8F. We

[58:51] don't know who they are. But I'm assuming they were so important that IPDB just decided not to put

[58:56] their names on there. In 1988, he wasn't necessarily working for Williams, but he sold a game design,

[59:02] which would eventually become Swords of Fury, which is best known for what? Lion man. Lion man.

[59:08] It also has a Kirk post in the center. Does, which would be one of the signatures? As a consultant

[59:14] for Bali in 1988, he worked with Jim Patla, who designed ramp warrior under Steve's influence.

[59:20] Now that didn't quite make production because at around that time, Williams actually purchased

[59:25] Bali, which created then Bali Williams. And ramp warrior was made into a game called Truxtop,

[59:32] and they had about 1500 units were made of that. I would say Truxtop is probably best known

[59:39] for its back glass, and the fact that everybody in there was in a cold room.

[59:45] Yeah. So ramp warrior had SK13 on the prototype was a license plate on one of the trucks.

[59:53] And when it was changed over to Truxtop, the license plate was still there, but it was

[01:00:00] laying on the ground all crumpled up rather than being attached to the truck symbolism.

[01:00:07] You could say that. Yeah. So through my research, and I think you could probably hear it here,

[01:00:15] all that research. That's so much research. That's like four pages of research.

[01:00:19] I actually found a couple of pretty interesting little points about Steve Kirk. One of them was

[01:00:24] that he became very much involved in pinball for one significant reason. And that was that he had a

[01:00:34] heart problem as a child, which meant that he could not play sports. So because he had a heart

[01:00:38] problem, he ended up playing pinball and hanging out. Do you have anything else to add about Steve

[01:00:43] Kirk? I like to think Steve Kirk was three for three. That's how he called me. He's the three for

[01:00:47] three man. He did three designs and they were all awesome. I mean, Game of Tron, Game of Tron is

[01:00:52] the repurposed design. I actually think Hamadron plays better than Flight 2000. I've heard that.

[01:00:57] And as far as sorts of fury, I think a lot of that. There are parts of him in there, but I think

[01:01:01] that also was reworked a lot. I don't consider that a true full all-out Steve Kirk design. Yeah, so

[01:01:07] I think Steve Kirk is probably one of those people that everybody's kind of heard of, but I don't

[01:01:12] think everybody really appreciates necessarily what he has done, particularly for early solid

[01:01:18] state and tournament pinball and all of the things that come around with that. And we'll dive into

[01:01:25] Steve Kirk kind of after he left Stern pinball and kind of what he saw after that. And I'll sprinkle

[01:01:31] that through a couple of other episodes instead of deep diving it at the moment because today's

[01:01:35] topic is Stern pinball. But I did want to talk about Steve Kirk's passing Matt Sion Shetty.

[01:01:42] He wrote a great article in pin game journal from March of 2007. Steve Kirk passed away in

[01:01:51] September of 2006 from Heart Failure at the age of 61, which is quite young at that age. And that

[01:01:58] would come from his heart issue that he had. And I'll quote from the article here. I could tell

[01:02:05] the best years of Steve's life for when he was designing and making pinball machines.

[01:02:10] You could hear the excitement in his voice. He could go on and on and on about the glory days of

[01:02:16] the industry. And I enjoyed hearing most of all about what he had to say in those times.

[01:02:22] At the time of Steve's passing, he had been living in a motel in Rockford, Illinois and working

[01:02:27] at the Bank of America, Mbna's phone customer service department. I was a friend with Steve for

[01:02:33] about 10 years. And in the time he had bounced back and forth between homelessness and just getting

[01:02:39] by Steve lost most of his money he accumulated from pinball in a stock deal that went bad.

[01:02:45] There's actually a surreal moment that I head with Steve during pinball expo of 2000 or 2001.

[01:02:52] He had called me because he wanted to check out pinball expo that year and he needed a ride.

[01:02:58] During this time period, he was homeless and living in a suburban shelter program while trying

[01:03:03] to find work in the area. People often have a stereotypical vision of the homeless. However,

[01:03:09] this certainly was not the way Steve conducted himself. He rarely, if ever drank alcohol.

[01:03:15] He wore a regular button up dress shirt and slacks and was well spoken. If you didn't know his situation

[01:03:22] and ran into him at expo, he would have thought he was just another industry big shot.

[01:03:28] The minute he walked in, tons of people recognized him instantly and started catching up on old times.

[01:03:34] At one point, he was asked to sign autographs at a table. So there he was,

[01:03:40] signing autographs of back glass artwork and talking to fans of his games and no one realized

[01:03:48] at the end of the show, after he was done signing autographs, he would be going back to the shelter

[01:03:54] and trying to find a job the next day. Not many people who are homeless get to sign autographs

[01:04:00] or have fans tell them how much their work is enjoyed. Yet, for that night, Steve got to experience

[01:04:06] both and I feel fortunate to have been there to witness it. How about that story?

[01:04:12] Yeah, that's about two or three years before I started going to expo, so I missed that.

[01:04:17] That's pretty sobering to think that one of the greatest designers of all times fell on some

[01:04:23] serious hard times and I'm glad that we could pay homage to somebody like Steve Kirk on this podcast.

[01:04:30] If you'd like to read that article, I've included it in the show notes.

[01:04:35] Well, onto something I would say maybe a little less depressing.

[01:04:39] Memory Lane, or mammary Lane, if you've ever seen the back glass.

[01:04:43] Yes. This was, I believe, their last game with the chime box for they went with their

[01:04:49] wonderful early soundboard and this is also by Mike Kubin and it's actually a good game.

[01:04:54] I enjoy memory Lane. We have a local collector around here who has one.

[01:05:00] So around the time I had seen the flash that was up for sale, the same seller also had a memory

[01:05:08] Lane for sale and I was intrigued. I was in some ways almost desperate to play some pinball

[01:05:16] and I considered buying it. Wonderful little game. It's a bowling themed or drive-in

[01:05:24] kind of car hop thing, right? Like your A&W.

[01:05:28] It's going for a retro bowling vibe. It has a super, it's got a really cool shot on the left side

[01:05:36] where it's a spinner that leads to us, also in the middle of field. If you've played

[01:05:41] balli strikes and spares, it's kind of got a little bit of that going on, right?

[01:05:46] Yeah, the roll overs.

[01:05:47] In the middle, sort of the 10 pin bowling roll overs in the middle. Kind of a neat little game.

[01:05:53] I wouldn't say it was necessarily great. I wouldn't say it's bad. It would be maybe the

[01:05:58] the BB plus of its time, right? I like it. I don't love it. I mean, I wouldn't own one.

[01:06:04] Sam Stern actually got to sign that play field, right? Very cool.

[01:06:09] Oh, he did. One of the coolest Sterns I think around this time was certainly

[01:06:14] electronomo, horrible sound in general, but I thought it was one of the best lookers of its time.

[01:06:21] It's got some interesting art. It's got like a Pegasus lady thing going on.

[01:06:27] Very cool. We didn't really get into the art yet, but all the art was outsourced for Stern.

[01:06:32] By ad posters, a company called ad posters. But a lot of the artists you would have heard of before,

[01:06:38] guys like Doug Watts and we did a bunch of stuff for Williams. There were a lot of pinball artists

[01:06:43] there that you would come out later. But they pretty much let them do anything they wanted.

[01:06:50] So at the time, Stern really outsourced a lot of that. Gottlieb did it as well. And they spent

[01:06:57] a lot of their time maybe giving some guidance to these folk at advertising posters. You can read

[01:07:03] all about them in the pinball compendium and Stern much preferred to outsource the art. And a

[01:07:10] lot of those artists preferred working with Stern over Gottlieb because of the freedom they could

[01:07:15] get from Stern because they used a four color process as opposed to Stern, which traditionally

[01:07:21] use sort of those old sort of lines and straight edges. I believe that backlash is also ripped off

[01:07:27] from something. That's not original. Yeah, I would say that those ad posters fellows usually

[01:07:34] went elsewhere for inspiration. Yes, yes, you could say that. Well, the next game is actually a big deal.

[01:07:42] Whether you like it or not, it's wildfire, but it's a big deal because of the designer who is

[01:07:48] coaxed out of retirement by Sam Stern. That's right. And this of course is the legendary Harry Williams.

[01:07:55] Yeah, so this machine is a bit interesting because at the bottom of the play field, it doesn't have

[01:07:59] those traditional slings where the ball comes down and hits the kicker. The kickers are actually

[01:08:06] in the mid play field. That's kind of interesting. Yes. And Harry Williams, during his time after

[01:08:12] he left his own company, he would do designs and send them into Bali and Williams, but whether they

[01:08:20] made him or not, I mean, he wasn't there officially. So sometimes this game games would get made.

[01:08:25] Sometimes they wouldn't. If you look at a list of the games, he actually had that were produced.

[01:08:31] You'll notice these gaps in his bizarre. You'll see a couple of games by Williams, a game by Bali.

[01:08:36] Like, what was going on here? That's what was going on. He would just submit these designs, tons of

[01:08:40] them. And most of them did not get made. I mean, he's always an innovator, right? If you're, you can't

[01:08:45] just tell the guy. You can't just say Harry Williams, retire, go play some golf, go learn to cook,

[01:08:52] watch a whole lot of the home and garden television. He's not doing that, right?

[01:08:56] No. To me, that was one of the, one of the best things about Stern Electronics is they brought

[01:09:01] him back and he got right back into it. No issue. These were like his first solid state games

[01:09:08] because he had just done nothing with electric mechanicals, but he had no issues transitioning

[01:09:12] to solid state. So that's wildfire. Spelled fire with a Y. Yep. Makes a fancier.

[01:09:18] And then we got the next game. Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about maybe Stern's version of

[01:09:24] licensing. Stern, I mean, I guess a lot of the others at the time, particularly your gotleab

[01:09:33] and your ballies. They were really kind of diving into licensing. You know, you had things like

[01:09:39] wizard, ballet did kiss, you know, some really sort of big bands on the gotleab side. You've got

[01:09:46] their, their association with Columbia pictures. They're picking up things like Charlie's Angels,

[01:09:51] the Hulk, Spider-Man, you know, you know, licensing kind of was a thing. Not to be outdone.

[01:09:58] Stern joins in the fray. Yeah. And they go for the biggest singer songwriter of all time.

[01:10:05] Ted Nuget.

[01:10:12] The funny thing about this game is if you look at the backlash and I don't have one in front of me

[01:10:17] here and I can't remember the the the art. It has a credit to a magazine on, honestly,

[01:10:23] the backlash of the playfield somewhere. The magazine to get credit to was an adult magazine.

[01:10:28] Really? Yep. I mean, who's Ted Nuget? He's a singer songwriter. He's a guitarist and a

[01:10:33] conservative political activist. He's initially gained his fame in the early 70s from being in the

[01:10:41] band, Amboy Duke's. And in 1975, he started his own solo career. His first album, The Self-Titled

[01:10:48] Ted Nuget, was two times platinum, which is two million copies sold. At the time, the pinball

[01:10:54] machine was released, Ted Nuget had three solo albums, some of the most popular songs on the

[01:11:00] radio. Some of them still heard today. The only one that I know is Cat Scratch Fever, which you

[01:11:05] alluded to a moment ago, and it sucks. But it's a license. And he was involved. I've seen pictures

[01:11:12] of him actually playing the game act factory with Gary Stern. Did it sell? Did it? It sold 2400 units,

[01:11:18] right? Yeah. That exactly stars like numbers. Now, the worst part about this machine is it

[01:11:24] actually used the SB 100 soundboard. All that it's the sounds are terrible. So they went back,

[01:11:31] probably because they had a few laying around the factory, sort of like your iron man by Stern

[01:11:37] machines. They're just sort of laying around in parts. You just slapped it together and sent

[01:11:41] them out the door, right? No. Yeah. All right. Well, I mean, the next one, I would say probably one of,

[01:11:48] again, the bigger licenses they could have gone with. And that was Dracula. Really? Big license

[01:11:54] Yes. So actually, this was based on Count Dracula. And you'll remember Count Dracula. He moved

[01:12:01] from the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania, Romania to England in 1897. Now, this individual,

[01:12:09] he had a phobia about garlic, sharp sticks, and daylight. Now, the details about his early life

[01:12:15] are very, very hard to find. Some would say they're undisclosed. But as mentioned, he was in life,

[01:12:23] the most wonderful man. He was a soldier, a statesman, and an alchemist. He had a mighty brain

[01:12:30] and learning beyond compare a heart that knew no fear or remorse. Now, he allegedly studied the

[01:12:37] black arts in Skola Man's in Transylvania, where he later took up arms against the Turks

[01:12:44] across the Danube River. According to his nemesis, Abraham von Helsing, upon his death, he was buried

[01:12:51] in a great tomb in the chapel of his castle. Some say Dracula returns from death and lives for

[01:12:58] several centuries in his castle with three terrifying, beautiful female companions beside him.

[01:13:04] And that must have been a tough license to get. And you know what? It's all in the game,

[01:13:09] all of it. All of it. That whole story. Yeah, sure it is. It's in the game. That's a tough license.

[01:13:14] This is made by Harry Williams. And it's a pretty good game. It is a really cool plunge, right? So

[01:13:20] usually when you pull the plunger back, it shoots the ball up into play field, it goes to the top.

[01:13:26] And in this era, it would bounce back and forth and usually fall into lanes, right? Not this one.

[01:13:31] Not this one. It comes all the way up and almost hooks around into a pop bumper. Actually,

[01:13:37] hooks around into a dead bumper. Or if you do it right, it'll actually go right to the upper

[01:13:41] flipper where you can go at the forebank on the top. It is a really unique and very odd pinball

[01:13:49] machine has awesome play field art. Backlash is terrible. And it's always completely wasted on every

[01:13:55] Dracula I've ever seen. The back last Dracula looks like he is going to a hair club for a man

[01:14:00] meeting or something. He sees like going bald. It's not a very good back glass. But the play field

[01:14:05] art is excellent. The plastics are excellent. It's got every the fire skulls, all the kind of

[01:14:10] stuff you expect to see. He's got a, I would say probably one of the nicest fences I have ever seen

[01:14:16] on that back glass. Gorgeous. Just gorgeous. Rod Iron, very nice, very expensive.

[01:14:21] Count Dracula was a very classy person. There's some lightning or that might be the back glass,

[01:14:26] actually. He spared no expense on his landscaping. Very nice. He's got his, the ladies are on the

[01:14:34] left side too and some sort of staircase. Very cool. Good for him. Good for Count Dracula.

[01:14:41] One of the legends in our industry by the way. Who Dracula or Ernie?

[01:14:45] Dracula. Next game we have Trident. Yes. Again, you'll notice it's turned, they were

[01:14:53] settled into a lot of these one word title games. That's why it was like Trident. Stars. Dracula.

[01:15:00] Yeah, they did want to get very convoluted. Yeah, I like it. They kept it simple. Yes.

[01:15:05] Trident is some green dude and I don't know what, I don't even know how to describe the

[01:15:10] back glass, but it's typical with a lot of their stuff. It's out there. This machine, I've seen a

[01:15:15] few of these for sale in Ontario. It's got a lot of the same kind of flavors as previous

[01:15:23] turns. They were really big on these orbit spinners. An orbit is the outside top arc of a pinball

[01:15:31] machine and one of the sort of most fun places to put a spinner or the target that flips around

[01:15:39] is on the outside of the game because you get a lot more kind of speed and a lot more angle to

[01:15:44] hit that. They really nailed that at Stern. I would say that the more spinners the better

[01:15:50] and Stern understood that and they said, you know what, we're going to spinners on this game.

[01:15:54] And the other interesting thing about Trident from the tech side, it was the first game. I believe

[01:15:58] it's the first game by any manufacturer to use the programmable drop targets. Basically you can

[01:16:03] drop them at will on its own and they would use that a lot in upcoming games. Very cool.

[01:16:08] It has a bank of five targets and it'll start with like two up and you hit the two down, the reset,

[01:16:13] so like three of them are up. You hit them down and then four of them are you get it. It's a fun looking

[01:16:18] machine. Little bit different. Again, it's not overly complex. It's not overly exciting, but it is

[01:16:26] a bit different than everybody else. One of the, I mean, I guess one of the big differentiators

[01:16:31] of this machine is on the left side. There's no inline and outline. There's only an inline,

[01:16:35] which is kind of interesting. Following Trident. They're speaking of interesting. We have

[01:16:41] hot hand by Harry Williams, which has this crazy, huge, rotating flipper at the top of the game.

[01:16:48] Yeah, so this is, this is, this is unusual. Let's just put it that way.

[01:16:53] But again, it's Harry Williams doing what he does. There is a large, I have to say,

[01:16:58] twice as long as a regular flipper. It rotates and there are several like saucers where

[01:17:04] a ball can go in and it spots you different things. It's actually not a bad game. I mean, I guess this is,

[01:17:10] you know, when you're not a ballie, when you're not a godly, you know, you can try different things,

[01:17:15] right? Like it's not like you're worried about upsetting the formula. So this is a great example

[01:17:21] of a way of, of, of trying something because, you know, you might come up with the greatest

[01:17:25] innovation of all time. You never know, right? So after hot hand, we have a game that probably

[01:17:31] most people have not seen called cosmic princess. I've never even heard of that. It only

[01:17:37] 336 were made and it's an export. It was made in Australia. They were assembled in Australia.

[01:17:43] They were sold by leisure and allied industries under licensed by Stern. And it definitely,

[01:17:48] it looks like a Stern plays like a Stern. It was just made in Australia. So you do see these in

[01:17:52] Australia. You'll notice this on the internet pinball database where a lot of them will talk about

[01:17:58] the L.A.I.s version of that game, which is really the export into Australia. Stern exported a lot

[01:18:07] to Australia. Now, this is where we get into games like magic, uh, meteor, and I think probably,

[01:18:14] one of the more notable ones beyond Steve Kirk's meteor is Galaxy designed again by Harry

[01:18:20] Williams. This is the game that Keith L.W.n. regret selling. It's an M200 MPU sold 4,947 units.

[01:18:31] Very, very cool design in my opinion. That's good. Have you ever played a Galaxy?

[01:18:36] Have I ever played a yes? I have played every single Stern except laser, except laser lord.

[01:18:42] Why don't you have a Galaxy in your collection? It's okay. Are you saying that Keith L.W.n.

[01:18:48] the greatest pinball player of all time and let what some would say the best up and coming designer

[01:18:54] of all time is wrong? Uh, no. You heard it here, folks. Ron Hallett hates Keith L.W.n.

[01:19:01] When we get back on to the licensing train, Oli is the last major license that Stern would land.

[01:19:09] Now, this is based on Muhammad Ali or Cassius Clay Jr., who was the American professional boxer.

[01:19:15] He was nicknamed the greatest, and he's widely regarded as one of the most significant and

[01:19:20] celebrated sports figures of the 20th century, and one of the greatest boxers of all time. He was

[01:19:26] best known as one of the greatest trash talkers. He was a Muslim convert and a philanthropist,

[01:19:31] and a civil rights activist in the 1970s. He was also a huge pro wrestling fan. That's where he

[01:19:38] got a lot of his basically, he's cutting promos on other boxers. Yeah. He knows that he has to sell

[01:19:43] tickets. He has to sell the event and people are going to want to pay to come. And he really learned

[01:19:49] that from professional wrestling. By 1980, around the time this machine was released, Ali was really

[01:19:56] starting to suffer from trembling hands, verbal stutters. He lost his match in October of 1980 to a

[01:20:05] stoppage. He was later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984. Even in this advanced age in his

[01:20:13] career, Ali was still a massive brand and to get somebody like him to partner with your company

[01:20:21] must have been a big deal at the time. Yeah, he's on the flyer too. By on the flyer, I mean,

[01:20:26] he actually came in and they did a photo shoot. It wasn't a stock photo. This picture of him with

[01:20:30] a game like in his trunks. Yeah. And we're talking pretty close to 3,000 units here. So it's sold

[01:20:36] okay for the most part. But we're getting into that sort of transition period into the 1970s,

[01:20:41] into the 1980s where sales weren't quite what they were on a consistent basis because we have so

[01:20:49] many players in the industry, right? We've got Bally, we've got Gottlieb, we've got Stern. And

[01:20:55] you're deluding the market at this point. And the production runs were fairly short for Stern,

[01:21:00] as we'll see on a lot of these upcoming games like upcoming game such as big game, another

[01:21:07] Harry Williams game. So I actually posted in the Pitball Network thread on Pinside at pinside.com

[01:21:14] for comments about games and topics about Stern electronics. So I could include some of those

[01:21:20] comments and I listed a few games on there. One of the games I neglected Ron and I know you're

[01:21:26] disappointed in me was big game. And I got a lot of messages regarding this game that I had left

[01:21:33] out of that list. So Chuck Wirt, one of the streamers here on the Pitball Network said,

[01:21:38] you forgot the best game of the bunch, big game. Well, Ken also yelled at me and he said,

[01:21:44] no conversation is complete without mentioning their first wide body game, big game.

[01:21:49] Big game has become my favorite wide body pin due to its varied flowy for a wide body and

[01:21:56] rewarding shots. The effective use of four flippers unique jungle art package, including the

[01:22:01] amazing and intimidating, growling tiger head on the back glass and the fun digital sounds from

[01:22:07] the era. It also features multiple valid scoring strategies for competitive play that makes it a

[01:22:14] favorite in league play. I have let everybody down by not mentioning big game. Yeah, it also didn't

[01:22:22] mention it has the wonderful red on the back glass that always completely dissipates. So your

[01:22:27] your tiger's tongue is just transparent built on the cheap. Yeah, the back glasses are almost

[01:22:35] always trashed on this one. But the other interesting thing is and maybe someone can correct me on

[01:22:40] this, but at least the little blurb I have here says that this was the first game with seven digits

[01:22:45] going. Wow, which they did advertise because they would count. I hope nobody just took their car

[01:22:50] right off the road here. Listen to this podcast. That's a big deal. That's pretty exciting stuff.

[01:22:55] Yes, I have a big game. It's a great game. What's so when they talk about the varied scoring,

[01:23:00] but like I've never played a big game. I don't like wide bodies in general because I find you need

[01:23:05] you need to change your mind on that. You need to play a stern wide body. It's different. It's

[01:23:10] different. It's totally different. Number one, it's not as wide. It's not as wide as like a

[01:23:15] ballie wide body. It's not wide as a paragon or something like that. It's only it's only a few

[01:23:19] inches wider. It will not play like a wide body. It will play super fast. So it's to get any

[01:23:25] preconceptions out of your mind. So when I look at the play field, I have an X and a Y and a Z.

[01:23:32] That's right. Z card. It's got one through nine. It's got lines and squares and circle. Like what

[01:23:41] is going on in the center of the center? Try to fill the cards up. It is most basic. You try to

[01:23:45] fill the cards up. You get line bonuses for any lines you make. It's like three down, three across,

[01:23:52] over. That's where the lines are. So you get extra line bonuses. You also can spell big game,

[01:23:58] light spinner, hit spinner. You have the wonderful four flippers at the bottom, which are all to

[01:24:03] hit specific shots. So you don't you can't scissor yourself on those, right? No, you cannot

[01:24:07] scissor it. Scissoring for those who don't know is if there's two flippers on the right or left side

[01:24:13] and the flippers open up, sometimes there's a gap in the bottom. And in this game, there are no

[01:24:19] gaps, right? It's solid. It's solid. And it's pretty easy to get used to the flippers on this,

[01:24:24] to be honest, but it's a good game. It's a really good art package. So surprisingly, I didn't think

[01:24:29] they, yeah, but it's like jungle. When you look at it, it's very detailed, very detailed art

[01:24:34] package. You see this? How big is your big game? Oh, with the flyer. Brilliant. Yeah, I love some

[01:24:40] of the flyers. The Cheetah flyer is ridiculous. It's like, what does this have to do with the game?

[01:24:45] Now we're into May of 1980. And this is when we release Sea Witch. Sea Witch. Yeah, so we're talking

[01:24:52] fantasy sea theme. It's the M200 board set 2500 units. Mike. Coo-Bin again. Mike Coo-Bin. And now we're

[01:25:02] talking software by a fellow named Bill Futzenruder, who's a big deal. And he'll be popping up a lot more

[01:25:10] sort of in the Williams days later on. Yes, he will. So yes, this is Sea Witch. Sea Witch is

[01:25:16] the later re-themed Beatles. It fixes some of the limitations or some of the annoyances with Sea Witch.

[01:25:23] Sea Witch has the nice loop at the top. It goes all the way around that you can hardly ever loop at all.

[01:25:29] Yeah, so there's a Sea Witch for sale not too far away from me. And it's for sale for

[01:25:35] 4000 loonies. How much is that? Two bucks? It's whole about a hawk. You're so mean. So let me take a look

[01:25:44] here. So 4000 beaver peltz. You got to take that by dogs led to Toronto. And then in Toronto,

[01:25:53] you got to take it down to Detroit. It's got to cross the river. Give me one sec. Then the

[01:25:57] mountain's got to let you through. That's 2980. No, that's too much. That's too much. That's too much. I

[01:26:05] wouldn't do that. So why is it that Sea Witch is all of a sudden worth so much money now with the days?

[01:26:10] Ah, besides you and Barry, the other guy on your podcast raising the prices. I don't know. I mean,

[01:26:18] for people who wanted Beatles, but that was too expensive. So they got Sea Witch instead.

[01:26:21] Kent wrote in to Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com and said, hey, Davie and Ronnie, I don't

[01:26:27] like what is with these? Ronnie's fine. Ronnie's fine. Are you going to talk about the Beatles?

[01:26:33] Keep on sleeping with that chicken. What the hell does that mean? I have no idea what that means.

[01:26:39] Maybe we'll dive into this whole Beatles thing here. So Stern's the Beatles. It was released in

[01:26:44] November of 2018. It's a Stern Spike 2 system standard body. They have 1,964 units designed by

[01:26:53] Mike Kubin, but redesigned by George Gomez, art by Christopher Franchi, software by Dean Grover

[01:27:00] and Soundby Jerry Thompson. This is broken into three editions. The first one being the gold edition

[01:27:06] 1,614 units, platinum at 250 units and diamond at 100 units. Or as I like to call them, too expensive,

[01:27:15] really too expensive and obscenely expensive. I really, really, really like the Beatles, but if you

[01:27:21] lay the Beatles down to Elvira, House of Horrors or Deadpool Premium or Batman 66, I'm sorry,

[01:27:30] I'm not choosing the Beatles. Yeah, that's one expensive license. Yeah, George says, Joe Kamen

[01:27:37] Cowan, I did the overall concept for the rules of the game and collaborated on conceptualizing

[01:27:41] the game features. I felt strongly that should be built on a simple single level board from that

[01:27:45] era. We settled on C, which even though it's from the 70s, okay, George doesn't know when the game

[01:27:50] was made based on its popularity. So George Gomez thought that C, which is made in the 70s.

[01:27:55] So it took 10 years of relationship building between Joe Kamen Cow and the folks at Apple

[01:28:02] and we're talking phone calls, gift baskets every year. You're given the folks at Apple a call.

[01:28:09] Now rumor has it that this is the highest cost for a license ever at over a million dollars.

[01:28:16] Yeah, I believe that. Joe Kamen Cow says there's never been a license in pinball as expensive as

[01:28:21] the Beatles. We took a big risk to make this game. It's a specialty boutique product, which

[01:28:26] Stern does once a year or two. We had to do it right and make it different. Everything was sent

[01:28:30] to Apple and England and when they were happy, it has to be taken to Proy. Proy stands for Paul

[01:28:35] Ringo, Olivia and Yoko and it was the Beatles, the Invision and Light, so it was approved.

[01:28:40] When you're talking about Paul Ringo, Olivia and everybody's favorite Yoko, I don't know,

[01:28:46] you're going to have to get everybody on side for something like that. What they decided on Joe

[01:28:52] Gary Stern and the group was that it had to be the coming to America's Beatles. It had to be

[01:28:59] not the controversial Beatles that they would later become. Joe Kamen Cow, the way he decided

[01:29:06] that they came to that was that he and Christopher Franchey started to get the proposal together with

[01:29:12] the backlash and cabinet art and he wanted those coming to America's Beatles. This was the

[01:29:17] biggest era of the Beatles and really the Beatles that the Baby Boomers would remember, particularly the

[01:29:23] Ed Sullivan show Beatles. There were a bunch of play field changes to the Sea Witch design.

[01:29:30] Yes, there was. George Gomez started with Mike Coopens, Sea Witch Layout. He made modifications

[01:29:36] to update and modernize it and fix the problems with the original. From conversations with Stern

[01:29:41] guys like Keith L and his X-sharp who knew the game very well, they complained that Sea Witch top

[01:29:45] orbits were not accessible from the bottom flippers, sometimes even from the upper flipper.

[01:29:49] It's supposed to be designed to have a repeatable loop sort of like flash, right?

[01:29:53] Yeah, but it just doesn't work. It doesn't work most of the time and the other thing about

[01:29:59] Sea Witch is primarily it's a drop target game. You're trying to hit drop targets. The spinner,

[01:30:03] you hear they ever hit the spinner, you hear they ever hit the loop, it's about drop targets.

[01:30:07] But Beatles, they made it so you can actually hit the loop. So there's a reason to loop now.

[01:30:12] There's a reason to hit spinners now because they added a second one.

[01:30:15] I went to New York City down to Manhattan for a portfolio manager meeting being

[01:30:22] in finance and up in New York from time to time. I went to Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn

[01:30:27] and modern Pitball over in Korea Town in Manhattan and I played a Beatles at both.

[01:30:33] Do you think that I would also really like Sea Witch or do you think Sea Witch

[01:30:36] would just make me angry? You would say Beatles is better. Why can't this

[01:30:41] Beast go to the Beatles? Yeah. If you really, really want to see which by the Beatles.

[01:30:47] If you can afford it. Yeah. The next game on the docket. Cheetah, yes. I don't know if I'm

[01:30:54] really into games with cheetahs on it. I have a bit of a cheetah phobia. I once attacked by a

[01:31:01] cougar and it was horrible. In Canada? Yeah. She was 40, 45-year-old. It was in a bar. I had too

[01:31:09] much drink. Very good. Very good. So why do you... Besides trying to hyper-inflate the cost of

[01:31:19] the machines in your basement, why do you like cheetah? It's another great Harry Williams widebody.

[01:31:24] Actually, he did. I believe he did all the stern wide bodies except two of them. So he was on his

[01:31:28] widebody kick at this point. So this is his second widebody in a row. And again, play super fast,

[01:31:35] wide open play feel. Just tons of things to hit. And you just got to play it. Just feels great

[01:31:41] to shoot the shots. That could be said for most of the sterns that are really good. They just

[01:31:46] feel good to play. The shots just feel so good on these games. So at this time in Harry Williams

[01:31:52] career, he's very much about geometry, right? Yeah. And in this game, you have an upper left flipper

[01:31:59] where you can sweep a five-bank, all five targets. I hope everybody was sitting down because that

[01:32:05] sounds amazing. Just did it two days ago. Every once in a while when it happens, like holy crap,

[01:32:10] I don't believe that just happened. Now, it also has a three-bank target directly across from that

[01:32:15] top flipper. And that's for like multipliers? It has a grid with various grid awards if you can get

[01:32:22] the lights in order. And it has three other tar, you got another three-bank way at the top,

[01:32:27] like as far back as you could possibly mount a Mac. But that's Cheetah, another great game.

[01:32:33] Now, released almost at exactly the same time is Quicksilver. Oh boy, yes. Designed by Joe Joe's

[01:32:41] Jr. Who would have ended up at Williams eventually. So this is like space theme? I don't know what it is.

[01:32:50] The the artists, specifically Doug Watson, he took inspiration and by inspiration, I mean,

[01:32:56] directly ripping off a heavy metal magazine cover, which is at Propol. Now that Stern is going to be

[01:33:02] doing a heavy metal game. So I'll include a link to that magazine cover in the show notes. And

[01:33:10] to be totally honest, the original magazine, I think looks much better. Oh yeah. But I mean,

[01:33:15] it is not even a question whether it's directly ripped off because it is directly ripped off.

[01:33:22] Yeah. So I mean, I guess probably one of the best unsung, you know, pinball artists out there

[01:33:28] was certainly a Doug Watson. Oh, games like Terminator 2. I mean, that everyone knows that back glass.

[01:33:34] That's iconic. Yeah. Doug, Doug studied art at North Illinois University. And he half completed

[01:33:40] a master's before dropping out because he was broken couldn't afford any more time. He created

[01:33:46] artwork for pinball from 1979 to 1996. And he started with advertising posters, which we mentioned

[01:33:53] a little bit earlier. And through 1979 to 1982, he did most of the art for Stern and Gottlieb.

[01:34:00] This is where I would love to really touch on what made him a little bit different.

[01:34:07] As we had mentioned before, Stern sort of let you do whatever you want.

[01:34:12] Gottlieb was much more kind of stay within our box, which Doug Watson learned when we get into

[01:34:19] some of our Gottlieb system 80 conversations in a future podcast. We'll talk a little more about

[01:34:25] Doug Watson and the limits that were placed on him by Gottlieb. But when you're able to sort of

[01:34:31] sit back and say, you know what, I want to make a game. And I want to use this heavy metal

[01:34:37] magazine. That's pretty pretty cool. Ron, can we talk about penises?

[01:34:41] Oh, I don't know. It's just the right show for that. This isn't the pinball show. This is the

[01:34:45] suburb of all chronicles. But the reason we can talk about that is because they're all over this game.

[01:34:51] Are you sure they're actually penises or are they supposed to be blobs of...

[01:34:56] They're supposed to be blobs, but once you see them, you cannot not see them.

[01:34:59] It's sort of like Gandalf's beard in Lord of the Rings, right?

[01:35:04] The Lord of the Rings, Ellie. Yes.

[01:35:06] It just once you see that kind of hang in there, you just can't quite get it out of here.

[01:35:12] Yeah. And the game is very green. Very green.

[01:35:18] When you look at the original heavy metal magazine, which Doug pulled the inspiration from,

[01:35:26] it was more sort of gray. It was a little more sort of devoid of color. And you can see that

[01:35:32] Doug Watson went for, okay, let's add some greens and some purples or some pinks. And the green,

[01:35:39] the green does not do it for me. It doesn't do it for you. It does not. It looks horrible.

[01:35:45] Well, don't worry. When this comes out as Led Zeppelin, I'm sure it'll have a different

[01:35:49] art package and maybe you'll like it. Maybe. We'll see. But that's a big bet.

[01:35:53] That's also a rumor. Who knows if that's true? You own one, right?

[01:35:56] I own half of one. Yes.

[01:35:58] So you own half of a quick silver with Ben. Ben. Yes. The other guy from Slantel.

[01:36:03] Yeah. I'm looking at Pinside right now, which is sort of one of the major sources for

[01:36:09] buying and selling machines. A lot of the archived ads at the moment have this machine in the five

[01:36:16] to six to seven thousand dollar US range for sales. Crazy talk. Why does this machine sell

[01:36:26] for more than a stern premium? Brisk. It's awesome and it's rare. So is there is there something about

[01:36:35] this game that is just so amazing that you just have to have one besides besides the penises?

[01:36:41] The sweeping the center bank. If you sweep the center bank and hit the spinner all in one shot,

[01:36:47] what is sweeping a set of drop targets mean? Basically you hit they all go down in one shot.

[01:36:53] You can roll the pinball kind of a long along the bank and they all fall down at the same time.

[01:37:01] And that's sort of a stern staple, right? That was a thing that stern sort of figured out.

[01:37:05] And they even had the certain games had sweep bonuses. If you sweep the target, you got extra

[01:37:10] like five thousand points or something. So yes, even before Iron Maiden, I know Iron Maiden has a

[01:37:15] sweep bonus, the new Iron Maiden, but stern was doing it back in the 80s. And actually the

[01:37:19] aforementioned Keith L. Wynn, the sweeping the targets to the left spinner shot, he called one of

[01:37:25] his favorite shots in early solid state pinball. So there you go. So the next machine that stern

[01:37:30] sort of ventured into in August of 1980. So later on in the year is Stargazer and Ron, tell me

[01:37:40] about the amazingness that is Stargazer. You like spinners? I do, I do indeed love spinners.

[01:37:46] We got three of them and they're all awesome. And it has the great feature upper left drop target

[01:37:52] bank. You hit one of the three targets that locks in the value of the spinner. If you complete the

[01:37:57] bank, it'll start rotating again. So again, you want to hit it, but you don't want to complete it.

[01:38:03] Kind of thing that the stern did on a lot of games that I bought. Has a very unique flipper area.

[01:38:11] Does not have conventional in lanes. It has like little pockets with rollovers that give you very

[01:38:16] s awards, pockets and the out lanes and just spinners. It's spinners, man. When it comes to the

[01:38:22] bottom, third of that play field. Now it does not have that traditional Italian bottom. In summary,

[01:38:29] an Italian bottom is that it has out lanes that go around the flippers and into the into the out

[01:38:35] hole. It has in lanes that then feed the flippers and it has, you know, usually a pop bumper or a

[01:38:42] sling or two slings or or something in the middle. This does not have slings in the bottom.

[01:38:49] Oh, one hundred percent has slings, but they're up higher though, aren't they? Yeah, they're up

[01:38:52] a little higher, but they're still in the same sling area that you would call the sling area.

[01:38:57] I've never played a star gaser because they only made what like like a thousand of them.

[01:39:02] I mean, like 800 of them. Yeah. So why did they why if this game is so great?

[01:39:07] I know this was coming. If this is so great. If it's so great, why did they only make 800?

[01:39:12] Because of what the next game was. Well, what was the next game? It was going to be a wide body.

[01:39:17] It was going to be their first game with speech. It was going to be their first game with

[01:39:21] multi ball and it was going to be designed by Harry Williams. And that game is flight 2000.

[01:39:26] Their second highest machine behind meteor by selling 6,300 units. So they were all in and

[01:39:33] flight 2000. So unfortunately, star gaser had to be taken off the line. So they just, they were

[01:39:39] like, nope, we don't need any of that. We need some of this Harry Williams. We got Doug Watson on

[01:39:43] on on art here. We got Bill Fittzenreuter on software. We're done. We're jumping in here.

[01:39:51] And this is the first one to use the VSU 100 speechboard. Does the countdown? Yep. And their speech

[01:39:57] and all their games pretty much sounds the same, like the same voice. And this has a spinner with

[01:40:02] a sweepable set of drop targets, right? Yeah, it does. Now, there was one of these not too long ago.

[01:40:08] For sale, not too far from here, it had a brand new CPR play field, all rebuilt brand new boards,

[01:40:16] gorgeous looking machine. And it sold for 2000 loonies, 2000 US, 2100 US. Now, why is it that

[01:40:26] something like quicksilver with a bunch of penises and horrible green vomit cells for almost

[01:40:33] the same as a Stern Pro? But a machine that sold tons because it was probably a great machine

[01:40:39] has speech. It's got probably lasers on it. It's made by a legend, Harry Williams. It's got gorgeous

[01:40:45] art. You answered your own question, though. It's got an amazing lock on the tongue. They made a ton of

[01:40:50] them. They made a ton of them. That's why they're not hard to find. There's lots of flight 2000s

[01:40:54] out there. They made a ton of these. All right. That's why it's all supply and demand.

[01:40:59] The multi-ball on this can be a pain. You want to talk about newer rule sets, trying to explain

[01:41:05] to somebody how to get multi-ball on this thing. It's like first you have to actually hit the left

[01:41:10] spinner shot and lock two balls. Yeah. And then you got to count it down. You have to spell, you know,

[01:41:16] no, you have to spell blast off by hitting the lanes. And there's no lane change. So you can't...

[01:41:22] lane change. Yeah. Turret, you can't move those lit things around. You have to get the in lane

[01:41:27] lights, which means you better be able to alley pass because that's the only way you're going to get

[01:41:31] a couple of them. But then the one you can't alley pass, so you're going to have to go through

[01:41:35] there eventually to get it. Then after you do all that, they'll say you're ready. Then you have to

[01:41:40] count down. So you have to count down five, four, three, two, one in order. And then when you do that,

[01:41:44] it's still not ready yet. You got to hit one more ball up in the lock to finally start multi-ball.

[01:41:49] Yeah. That does not seem very convoluted method as opposed to something like say,

[01:41:54] firepower when we were talking about Steve Richie where you just lock three balls and it starts

[01:41:58] way easier to understand. That's horrible. It's still fun. I haven't played one. I'll let you know.

[01:42:02] Okay. So that's when we get into nine ball into December. Next, we're moving into 1981.

[01:42:09] We've got Stern free fall. Yeah. Never seen one of those ever. Yeah. Now it's when we start. We

[01:42:15] start... Yeah. Starts getting a little painful. Free fall is it's almost like a repurposed

[01:42:21] flight 2000. They use like the same Mac, I think the same ball lock or Mac or similar. It has

[01:42:27] similar rules set where you're trying to lock balls and then spell something start multi-ball.

[01:42:31] It has crazy artwork where basically there's women flying around commando. Literally if you

[01:42:37] look at the back glass, when I said they did anything with Stern, I met that. So they wore

[01:42:42] military fatigues in some sort of brain? No, not that. No, not that kind of commando. But it was

[01:42:48] another wide body from Harry Williams again. It's not a bad game. It's not as good as flight 2000.

[01:42:53] So then we move into a game called Lightning. Ooh, that doesn't sound good. One of the few

[01:42:59] classic Stern games that I just hate. So this is when you can see the influence from the industry

[01:43:06] changing, right? The industry is very much again in flux. So when we move from

[01:43:11] electro-mechanical, we're moving into the solid state era, things are in flux and they're changing.

[01:43:16] We get into that early 80s. We're getting into sort of black night territory. Now we're talking

[01:43:23] about multiple play fields, right? And this is Stern's first stab at a multi-level play field. Yeah,

[01:43:30] sure is. So this is one of the classic Sterns that you haven't been able to find because it's so

[01:43:38] popular, right? I wouldn't say that. Actually, I've seen a lot of them. It has crazy back glass.

[01:43:43] Where it almost looks like there's a nipple on it. If you look at it, it's insane. It's just

[01:43:49] crazy. It has an upper play field that you may stay on for three seconds before you lose it.

[01:43:55] It's extremely difficult to stay up on the upper play field on this game, which is not a bad thing.

[01:44:00] I don't mind that, but the whole rule set of this game, at least in my opinion, is painful.

[01:44:06] It has, but it has, they put everything in this game. They pack this sucker. It has by-level.

[01:44:11] It has an extra display in the center of the play field, like a little digit, like four or five

[01:44:16] digit display in the center. It has speech and multi-ball. But multi-ball, this is how you start

[01:44:21] multi-ball. The locks are on the upper play field. Neither is really completely shootable. They

[01:44:26] literally just fall in half the time. And then you have to hit one of like nine stand-ups. Get them

[01:44:31] all to start multi-ball. Yeah, and it's like a fantasy god of lightning thing going on. Yeah,

[01:44:41] like Norse mythology. Yes, it has the speech is like Thor, Thundercut, or whatever it says.

[01:44:47] Yeah. The wheels are kind of start to come off here, right? It seems like it's all over the

[01:44:53] base. They put everything in this game. Everything's in this game all out. I mean, when you're trying

[01:44:56] to compete with something like a black knight, which when we talked about this in our last episode,

[01:45:02] about how much research kind of went into that and how much time and effort that a Steve Richie

[01:45:09] granted one of the greatest minds of pinball ever spent on trying to perfect an upper play field.

[01:45:15] And then you kind of have, you know, Joe, Joe Jr., just kind of throwing this together to try

[01:45:21] to compete with that. And the thing is they're also competing with video games at this point. So

[01:45:26] they got to they got to pack more and more stuff in these games. So how do you how do you combat

[01:45:32] maybe a lackluster two level play field? You do another one. You double down, right? And you go

[01:45:37] with split second, which is a wide body. So now we're doing wide body body by level game.

[01:45:43] Let's hurry again into the stats. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. We're talking August of 1981.

[01:45:54] You said it wide body M200 board set. It's got the most annoying speech of all time.

[01:46:02] Hurry, hurry. It literally will say that. Hurry. It just over and over. But it does say a lot of

[01:46:08] other things. It's a circus theme. And it will say, you know, welcome to the whatever. It's

[01:46:13] there's a lot of different things. That's the one that gets stuck in everyone's heads. So this is

[01:46:17] a much better. This is a much better kind of kick at the can, right? Like the upper play field is fun.

[01:46:22] It's not it's not a bad game. It's kind of got like a high wire plank ball trapeze thing. That's

[01:46:30] kind of fun. Another Harry Williams design. You know, this guy, he just he just keeps, I mean,

[01:46:36] it's not his greatest game, but it is definitely better than the one that preceded it and the one

[01:46:41] that will follow it, right? Oh, no, catacombs. I like catacombs. Yeah. So catacombs is a great game

[01:46:47] if you like toast. So with catacombs, again, we have we have speech. We have multi ball. It's the

[01:46:53] last turn game that actually has artwork on the cabinet for the game. They will they will

[01:47:00] cheapen out on future releases. One of my favorite pinball artists outside of Christopher

[01:47:07] Franchi or zombie Yeti is Larry Day. And this was his first pinball game that he did the art for.

[01:47:14] And I think he did a lot of really kind of fun cool art through his career, even though they're

[01:47:20] on, let's say it kind of some of the crappiest games. Yeah, and catacombs, no one understands the

[01:47:25] back box rules. Yeah, there's like a bag of telling the back. Yep. And it gives you instructions.

[01:47:30] It talks. It tells you exactly what to do. It gives you spoken instructions on what to do. It has

[01:47:36] two ball locks, neither which are really accessible to shoot. They bounce off the pop-uppers and lock

[01:47:41] that way. And you're trying to complete remember big games trying to complete bingo cards. Here,

[01:47:46] you're trying to complete. It's supposed to be the catacombs. It's supposed to be like a. It's

[01:47:49] like a hallway or something, but it looks like a big piece of toast. It is just the worst. I like it.

[01:47:55] Oh, the problem is in tournament play, you just plunge the correct lane. I think it's the right

[01:48:01] most lane you want to get it in, which lights the spinner. And then you just hit the spinner repeatedly

[01:48:05] and ignore everything else. So if you ever plan to tournament, that's what you need to do. Yeah,

[01:48:08] it's it's almost like there was a bit of a we got something here. And this is kind of what we

[01:48:13] want to do, but they just maybe too many cooks in the kitchen or it's a more cerebral game and

[01:48:19] people don't like to think. Yeah, I mean, at the time, right? It might be a bit too much. I know

[01:48:25] Gottlieb had a game called time zone. And it was very weird that way, right? When it came to really

[01:48:33] odd rules. I think at the time, people still really liked sort of spinners and interesting locks.

[01:48:40] They didn't like maybe complicated rules. And we have the next game iron maiden. No, not that one.

[01:48:47] Not the good iron maiden. The one with the crazy backlash, which is the thing you remember about it.

[01:48:52] It has a weird like pulsating light in the backlash. The thing I remember most about it. It's it's

[01:48:58] a wide body by level, multi-ball. First wide body, not by hairy waves. Yeah, it does have really

[01:49:05] cool art. It is really cool art. And it's just not good. They did not. I think most of these ended

[01:49:11] up being exported. Really? Yep. And this was done by the art is done by a fellow named Keith Parkinson.

[01:49:21] And he did iron maiden crawl and viper everybody's favorite pinball machines of all time. Wow.

[01:49:28] Another interesting factoid about Stern is they were actually owned by Seabird. It was part of

[01:49:35] the part. So when you see those S's on those classic sterns, the S that you see on the drop targets,

[01:49:41] everyone thinks that's Stern. It's not. It means Seabird. It's a Seabird. Yeah.

[01:49:47] And the other thing I forgot to mention, I'll throw it out there. Starting with Star Gaser,

[01:49:52] they started to use the block like Stern logo that they would use all the way up like when they

[01:49:59] restarted Stern. Yes. All the way up till they changed it to what it is now with the where it has

[01:50:05] a little flipper thing on it and all that. But if you look at the logo on Star Gaser, on Star Gaser,

[01:50:10] that Stern logo is the same one you'll see like on Spider-Man, Elvis, you know, all those games.

[01:50:15] I always thought that was interesting. After iron maiden, then we get to Viper. And another thing,

[01:50:22] Iron maiden and Viper, they do not have any cabinet art. It literally just says Stern. So again,

[01:50:27] Cosscott it. Do it on the cheap. Yeah. By this time, videos winning, pinball's dying,

[01:50:33] Viper is crazy. You want to talk about crazy artwork. You want to put nudity on the back glass and

[01:50:37] get away with it. Make it metal because that's what they do. They have a topless woman, snake woman on

[01:50:42] the back glass, but she's metal. So somehow they get away with it. Crazy. It's got like this robotic

[01:50:49] theme going on. It's got again, orbit spinner on the left side, triple flipper. It's kind of

[01:50:56] almost got an inner loop. But the thing of whole gimmick of the game, though, is the turret.

[01:51:01] And the center, the top center of the game, there's the turret. You load a ball in the turret,

[01:51:05] it spins full 360 all the way around. You can fire it anything you want. There's extra buttons

[01:51:10] on the side of the cabinet. One is the fire button, one is the reverse. You can make it go either way.

[01:51:15] Wow. Yep. And the whole game is designed around that turret. There are shots you can only hit

[01:51:19] with the turret. Is it as much fun as it sounds like? I've warmed up to it. It's not one of

[01:51:25] their greater efforts, but trying to get, you're trying to get all the different arrows by hitting

[01:51:31] with the turret and it increases the multiplier on the play field. So you go from like no scoring

[01:51:35] to insane scoring if you can do it. So they're small and nimble enough that they can just kind of

[01:51:41] throw anything at the wall and see if it works, right? And that's a great touch. And it has

[01:51:46] multi ball also. I guess after that, the best one that we can, like the last two that I want to

[01:51:52] talk about, maybe there's a couple more that you want to talk about. Oh yeah, we got to go

[01:51:56] into laser lord. I guess we could talk about dragon fist. Yes, this is their last conventional size

[01:52:02] regular I would call pinball machine and typical fashion of using a license without using a license.

[01:52:07] It has Bruce Lee on it, but they put a headband on them. Is it actually Bruce Lee? It's Bruce Lee.

[01:52:12] Or is it just it's Bruce Lee. It's Bruce Lee. They put a headband on him because Bruce Lee never

[01:52:17] wore a headband. So it's obviously not Bruce Lee, but on the play field artwork, it's totally

[01:52:21] Bruce Lee. And it's another JoJo's game and it's awesome. Now you have one of these. I do. Now what

[01:52:28] makes it so awesome besides the fact that you have one? Um, it's just the speed. So it's a really tight

[01:52:34] fast play field. I only have one game that plays faster than this. I remember I have a lot of

[01:52:39] new work games to you. I only have one game that places fast or faster than this and that's TNA.

[01:52:43] Would you say that because you've got that series of drop targets kind of a bit lower?

[01:52:47] On the play field or uh, it's just the way it's designed. It's all loops. The way you hit the shots,

[01:52:53] everything is built around, generating as much speed as possible. Very cool. It's just

[01:52:58] obscenely fast. I have it has the best spinner. I get I could get 60, 70 spins of rep on the

[01:53:04] spinner on the right. Why do you think it didn't sell? Because they were dying. So we'll get into

[01:53:08] that. Just making video games. Yeah, they're they're dying at this point. The software of this,

[01:53:13] just from someone I know who's decompiled and working on it. It has so many, it has band-in features

[01:53:19] in it and it's a complete mess. They were obviously just trying to get this out the door and get it

[01:53:23] done with. Yeah. So at around 1980. So we're, you know, when we move into that, that time frame of

[01:53:30] sort of cheetah, quick silver, uh, flight 2000, we really ramp up around that period in 1980.

[01:53:40] And then it's almost like the wheels come off in 81. Pretty much almost immediately in, in

[01:53:46] January of 1981. And a lot of that comes from, and you said it, Stern's kind of motion more into

[01:53:54] video. And I've included a link in the show notes to the Stern Wikipedia page where it talks a

[01:54:01] little bit about their pinball machines, but it also lists their video game machines. In 1988,

[01:54:10] Stern released Astro Invader, which is actually programmed by Konomi. And that was very much sort of

[01:54:18] a space invaders kind of knock off. That machine sort of started, I would say, an odd shift in the

[01:54:27] business model that they had at Stern as they kind of got that first taste of manufacturing arcade

[01:54:35] games. They created Berserk in 1980. And Berserk became just an absolute smash hit for Stern. They sold

[01:54:44] 37,500 units, which when you look at selling 2000 pinball machines, that is an astronomical number,

[01:54:52] isn't it? That is. So you can see the allure of this low overhead machine, right? It's got a cabinet.

[01:55:01] It has the monitor inside and it's got one board and a couple of joysticks, right? It doesn't have

[01:55:06] solenoids. It doesn't have stolen technology from Bali. It doesn't have all these moving bits and

[01:55:12] pieces. It's very straightforward, right? So this is where that sort of love affair that Stern had

[01:55:18] with video. And it's almost like they took their eye off of the ball, right?

[01:55:23] I would too. It's way more profitable. That's the, they're a company. Gotta stick around. That's

[01:55:29] what's going to take to survive. Yeah. So then this is where really the double whammy comes into

[01:55:36] the industry, right? All of a sudden video takes a nose dive. People aren't playing video games as

[01:55:41] much as they are anymore. Pinballs now sort of declined as well with the arcades in this time. So now

[01:55:47] we're talking 1983. We're getting into some tough times in the industry, right? Yeah, there's a

[01:55:53] lot of video games at this point. There's just too many games. There's too many manufacturers,

[01:55:58] too many games, too many arcade games, too many pinball companies. The pressure starts to build,

[01:56:04] right? They've they've moved out of that. I would say the real beginning of the end was the fact

[01:56:09] that Stern and video ended up in a bunch of lawsuits. And I've added one to our show notes, which is

[01:56:16] Stern Electronics Incorporated versus Kaufman, where they actually were sued for the underlying

[01:56:22] source code for a lot of the video games that they made. And this is really the spiral that sort of

[01:56:28] ended the company. Not orbit or one? Well, they try. Where do I put orbit or one in? Really? That

[01:56:34] that train track up in ball machine. Stern came out with orbit or one, another wide body,

[01:56:40] which if you've ever seen it, this is where they're trying to save the company. They're trying

[01:56:44] something crazy. And Gary Stern, remember this? He had it. There was an interview recently where he

[01:56:50] brought up orbit or one like, yeah, we tried something crazy there. It has a play field that looks

[01:56:55] like the moon. It is not flat. And the ball just goes all over the place. You would think there's

[01:57:01] magnets, but there are no magnets in this game. And the thing is it uses some newer technology in

[01:57:06] that it has these spinner things in the center of the play field, two of them. And they actually use

[01:57:12] like an opto. Interesting. So when you hit it, when you hit it, it slows down the spinner and the

[01:57:17] opto detects it. And that's how it gets gets the hit. And it has multi ball and speech. And it's

[01:57:23] insane. It is the ball will go behind the flippers. And the plunger is so low in the cabinet.

[01:57:30] Like it's you got to reach down to to to plunge the ball. The game actually has a light there

[01:57:35] flashing just so you know where it is. Shoot pinball. It's crazy. It's it's something else. This whole

[01:57:43] video game thing that they're doing kind of 80, 81, 82, 83. The last thing that they really try is

[01:57:51] I forgot about the Q C U E. It was my hairy Williams. His last game. There was actually one on

[01:57:59] location by me. There was one of like six or seven made. They put it out on test and the location

[01:58:05] called Stern and asked for them to take it back. Oh my. Yes. It is a very bizarre. The flippers face

[01:58:11] the other way and you hit the ball up and it hits a bunch of bumpers and it's it's wild. It's a

[01:58:18] crazy game. Has a huge magnet in the center of the play field. What are they doing, Ron?

[01:58:24] Anything. They went they went from meteor and big game and stars and alley and

[01:58:32] hey anything you can. They are just flailing. Probably sometime after it might even been after

[01:58:38] Viker. We're around the time they're doing orbit and one because orbit or one I think was

[01:58:41] outsourced. It was designed originally by someone else and they brought it in and finished it.

[01:58:45] They were working on laser lord which was to be a wide body and it never really got too much pass

[01:58:51] a white wood. Fast forward in 1984. The last what's left of Stern is still there and they decide

[01:58:56] to take a game to one of the amusement shows. So they have these flyers printed up and these flyers

[01:59:02] exist and they said like laser lord or the future of pinball or whatever. You know the usual flyer

[01:59:06] flyer nonsense and what they did is they took a quick silver and they re-themed the artwork and

[01:59:11] made it in the laser lord and they brought it to the show. Hoping nobody would notice and it was

[01:59:16] one made it still exists. Sold on eBay a few years ago. That would have been the end of the laser

[01:59:21] lord's story however just a few years ago somebody in Michigan I believe they were I think was a plumber.

[01:59:27] They were doing a service call at someone's house and they noticed they had this pinball machine.

[01:59:32] No. And it was the laser lord white wood. The original laser lord laser lord white wood that Jojo

[01:59:37] said mocked up so he bought it and it eventually went to a collector who got it working and they

[01:59:42] were supposed to bring it to a show or something. One of the Michigan shows I don't know if it ever

[01:59:47] made it but it would have had multi ball. It had some crazy like a ton of stand-up targets if I

[01:59:53] remember or maybe they were drop targets. It was a crazy looking play field. It was a wide body.

[01:59:57] It was in a viper cabinet. Wow. And that was just discovered a few years ago. I'm looking at

[02:00:04] the flyer that you mentioned here. It's on the internet pinball database and it says stern pinball is

[02:00:11] back old style excitement with challenging features and solid state technology is laser lord and

[02:00:20] it says features. Oh, this is exciting pop bumpers bonus multipliers advanced features special

[02:00:28] bonus spinners kick out targets center banks and extra ball. In other words, any other game.

[02:00:36] A pinball machine basically. Yeah. They had laid off their marketing department by the looks of

[02:00:43] it. You know, it's sad to sort of see that we had this stretch. I would say between you know,

[02:00:49] late 78 to mid 80 end of 1980 with maybe nine ball with Steve Kirk's nine ball and then it was just

[02:00:59] like falling down as set of stairs with rakes at the bottom. But they left us a great legacy of

[02:01:05] awesome games in 1985 stern electronics left the amusement industry. Gary Stern finally declared

[02:01:10] bankruptcy over the whole ordeal as we know that this wouldn't be the end of Gary Stern. He's

[02:01:16] always been a fighter. He's always been a striver in the industry. And I'd like to assume that he

[02:01:20] there has a massive fear of failure or he doesn't like to fail because the personnel from stern

[02:01:27] electronics actually moved to a venture called pinstair. We spoke about that during the Steve Kirk

[02:01:32] section and they started producing conversion kits for old ballet and sterns and it wasn't too

[02:01:38] long after that that Gary Stern and Joe Kamenka would convince a Japanese company called Dad

[02:01:44] East to create a pinball division and man that's in a totally different podcast. So there you go.

[02:01:50] There's episode two Ron any thoughts? If you see an old stern play it they're awesome. They have

[02:01:55] a different feel than any other manufacturer. I mean every manufacturer has its own feel. I mean

[02:02:00] most of the play fields especially when they get into their really golden era every playfields

[02:02:04] totally different. They're totally different experiences totally different looking play fields but they

[02:02:09] still play like a stern. Yeah they didn't have a lot of the conventional sort of crutches that some

[02:02:13] of the other pinball manufacturers had. First time I ever played sterns or saw any of them one of my

[02:02:19] first pinball expos they had a row of them and I'm looking at them it's like yeah it looks like a

[02:02:23] ballet because they have the bigger flippers. Yeah so I figured like oh it's a ballet and then I play

[02:02:28] these things like wow this is not ballet. They had the orbit spinner down and they had maybe an extra

[02:02:34] layer of of rules down that some of the other manufacturers just didn't. They had speed down. I'll say

[02:02:42] that. Go to a pinball show find some sterns. Go play some classic sterns there are a lot of fun. Play

[02:02:47] of stars you'll see what all the fuss is about. Sarah wrote to me on pinside and said hey love the

[02:02:53] first episode but it would be cool if you told us what the next episode was about so we could write

[02:02:58] in with some comments. Keep up the great work. Cool you can tell me. Yeah well Sarah our next
