[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Oh yeah, we have to announce the death of pinball network.

[00:17] Yeah, I can't say pinball network anymore.

[00:20] No, this will be our last episode of the pinball network.

[00:23] Oh, do we have a new, do we have a new feed?

[00:27] So there's one that says silver ball chronicles brackets TPN.

[00:31] And then the new one says silver ball chronicles pinball history podcast.

[00:57] Hello everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is silver ball chronicles.

[01:07] And with me is Ron coffees for closers. How you doing, my friend?

[01:13] Okay. What was that coffees for closers coffees for closers?

[01:17] You don't get coffee unless you close.

[01:19] I don't drink coffee. So that's that's fine.

[01:21] Didn't you see you see Glenn Gary Glenn Ross?

[01:25] I don't know what that is. It's a film from like 92 or 90s.

[01:30] Yeah, that's probably what it's got Jack Lemon in it.

[01:33] Alec Baldwin. I know who he is. I know he is too.

[01:36] Yeah, Ed Harris. Yeah, I know him.

[01:39] So what's up fellow? How was Tpf?

[01:41] Tpf the Texas pinball festival.

[01:44] All of the shenanigans that partake in the rumors.

[01:48] It was good. Yeah. Any breaking news that we should be aware of coming

[01:52] from a very credible source recorded online?

[01:56] Well, it would kind of relate to our upcoming episode.

[02:00] But Jack Winery confirmed that Harry Potter is coming up next.

[02:04] Okay. So don't buy any of the current JJP games and wait for the next one.

[02:08] Don't buy anything, which is weird because this was in a seminar for Avatar.

[02:12] So I was going to buy an Avatar, but you know, Jack said don't buy anything.

[02:16] Don't spend a dime.

[02:18] Because of that anticipation, I wanted to bump this episode up.

[02:24] Because of that breaking news, I wanted to get this episode underway

[02:29] in anticipation of one of the largest licenses from the pinball hobby.

[02:36] Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?

[02:38] Yes, I have. And I've started reading the books with my daughter.

[02:42] Oh, guess who hasn't seen the movies or read the books?

[02:45] I'm going to have probably say you.

[02:47] Yes. Yeah.

[02:49] You're not a, you're not a, you haven't seen a movie since 1998.

[02:53] That's not true. I see movies all the time. I just don't go to the theater.

[02:57] Do you see movies made after 1998?

[03:00] Yes. Actually, I just saw movie, in a movie theater at T.P.F.

[03:05] Whoa.

[03:06] Because we get there way too early before the show starts.

[03:09] Is it the Looney Tunes movie? The Day the Earth blew up?

[03:11] No, there's no.

[03:12] That was super good.

[03:13] Mall across the street, they have iMacs and stuff, but we saw, it wasn't in iMacs, but we saw a black bag.

[03:20] Oh, I heard that's good. That was good.

[03:22] Only an hour and a half. That's, that's even better. I like that.

[03:25] Go Michael Fastbender. Where's, where's our Michael Fastbender pinball man?

[03:28] As opposed to last year when we saw Dune, which was good, but like three hours.

[03:32] Oh, it's so long.

[03:33] Yeah, especially when you're like over 50 and you got to pee all the time.

[03:36] Okay.

[03:38] So everybody, we just wanted to point out that this is our last episode on the pinball network.

[03:44] Oh.

[03:45] So you did still hear the Stinger at the beginning of this episode.

[03:48] We are not leaving because there's a kerfluffle or we all hate each other or we're all mad at each other.

[03:55] We're leaving because of the incorrect use of the word Stinger.

[03:58] That's correct. The Stinger will be the end of the show.

[04:01] Isn't it?

[04:02] What's the thing at the beginning?

[04:04] The bloopers at the end of the show you put in. That's like the Stinger.

[04:07] Well, what's the thing at the beginning?

[04:09] I don't know. The preamble?

[04:10] Yeah, there you go.

[04:11] I only get Stinger from Mystery Science Theater because that's what they called the thing at the end.

[04:15] All right.

[04:16] All right.

[04:17] I love correcting you. It's great.

[04:18] But anyway, it's just easier for us to upload our own episodes.

[04:23] And if there's an error in the sound or the editing, I can correct it very quickly.

[04:29] I can review our stats to see why everybody still only downloads our Steve Richie episodes and none of the other ones.

[04:35] So that's the reason why and most of us on the pinball network hate Joel Engelbirth, the second worst person in pinball.

[04:45] So we've all just decided to leave.

[04:46] But other than that, we all like each other.

[04:48] And you're leaving your other podcast, the SlamTill podcast.

[04:52] No, I'm not leaving it.

[04:54] Oh, you still dealing with Bruce then.

[04:56] Yeah, I still deal with Bruce.

[04:58] My other podcast, the SlamTill podcast, you can check us out.

[05:01] We were never on the pinball network. We're independent.

[05:04] Okay. Well, we have also sold out on Patreon as everybody knows.

[05:09] You can swing on over to patreon.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[05:12] Stop in for a month or two.

[05:14] Say, hi, drop us a $3 a month to become a pro crony.

[05:19] At $6 a month, you get early ad free access to the show.

[05:23] On the Patreon, rather than the individual feeds.

[05:26] And after three months, you get a free sticker.

[05:30] I love stickers.

[05:31] Top tier cronies. They are our elitist cronies.

[05:34] After three months, they get a silver ball chronicles t-shirts.

[05:37] I want to say a big welcome to our new Patreon members this month.

[05:42] Derby and Paul, they have joined us.

[05:45] And I also want to make an announcement that are three month,

[05:49] Ellie cronies, your T's have just been shipped.

[05:52] So they should arrive shortly.

[05:54] Are they powder coated?

[05:56] They are not powder coated.

[05:58] I don't want them to chape the nips.

[06:00] Yes.

[06:01] Of course, you can swing on over to facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[06:05] That's where you can find all of the latest links to the new feed for silver ball chronicles.

[06:12] Now you'll notice there's two feeds.

[06:14] If you search silver ball chronicles in your pod catcher,

[06:17] one will say silver ball chronicles.

[06:20] And then in brackets, TPN, the new feed will say silver ball chronicles a pinball history podcast.

[06:27] Make sure you get the correct one.

[06:29] And if you don't know the correct one, swing on over to facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[06:34] It is pinned at the top and you can choose the link to your favorite pod catcher.

[06:41] Ron, you have already subscribed to the new feed.

[06:44] Actually, yes, I have.

[06:45] That's right.

[06:46] I'm excited that so many people have jumped on already.

[06:49] I can see those stats now.

[06:51] If you just want a t-shirt, Ron, sometimes you just want a t-shirt.

[06:54] I love t-shirts.

[06:55] You don't want to deal with the shenanigans.

[06:57] Swing on over to silver ball swag.com. Pick up that shirt.

[07:01] There's also hoodies, mugs and stickers.

[07:04] If you got that weird thing for stickers like Ron has.

[07:07] We've got corrections.

[07:10] Corrections were never wrong.

[07:12] Come on.

[07:13] Silver ball chronicles at gmail.com if you want to get a hold of us.

[07:16] We had a lot of back and forth in the last month or so with a few of the cronies

[07:23] over at silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[07:27] Some of those I think are better kept private because, you know, quite frankly,

[07:34] they were a little bit chit chatty, little chit chatty.

[07:39] However, I have pulled out a few of my favorite comments.

[07:42] One of them from David Lee who dropped us an email about roller games

[07:47] because people only listen to our Steve Richie episodes for some reason.

[07:52] Rock, rock, rock and roll their games. Rock, rock, rock and roll their games.

[07:58] So we only get emails about past episodes, about Steve Richie episodes

[08:03] and oddly enough our down under series where people are listening to this stuff from down under Australia.

[08:13] That's pretty cool, but thank you Dave for dropping us an email.

[08:17] We also have Chris Davis. What does Chris Davis say?

[08:20] Hello guys. Love the show. Sir Dittamus didn't ride a horse.

[08:24] He wrote a dog name and brogius.

[08:27] Embrojus. Embrojus. He's the show's coming.

[08:30] Who's Sir Dittamus?

[08:32] Who's Sir Dittamus? What's that from?

[08:34] He's the guy in labyrinth.

[08:36] Labyrinth? Okay.

[08:37] He's a knight, but he rides.

[08:39] I said incorrectly, he rode a horse, which he does not.

[08:43] He rides like a sheep dog, which is really funny.

[08:46] It's got to be a big dog.

[08:47] Yeah, it is. It's a big sort of big puffy, hairy dog.

[08:50] And then you got this like puppet sitting up on it.

[08:52] And it's a real dog, which makes it even funnier,

[08:54] because then there's a puppet sitting on top of a real dog.

[08:56] They're not puppets. Come on, they're real.

[08:58] Yeah, they're muppets, actually.

[08:59] Muppets, yeah, say it right.

[09:00] But I don't want to get another correction.

[09:02] A correction to my correction.

[09:03] And then we've got Corey Hughes. What does Corey Hughes say?

[09:06] I don't know, but Corey Hulse, he says,

[09:09] so I've written a long email that has nothing to do with pinball or pinball history.

[09:12] Thanks for all the work on the podcast.

[09:14] I personally thought the bingo one was great. Hey, somebody liked it.

[09:18] I know your focus is generally on machines, manufacturers,

[09:21] but I think a history of the pinball competition side would be fascinating.

[09:25] Oh, you think the bingo episode had low ratings?

[09:27] We did competition, but oh, and you can probably get

[09:30] Stubick Vicar to comment on his 1978 Playboy launch party championship.

[09:35] Corey, he wrote a huge email about how cricket works.

[09:41] Because he spent some time, I believe it was in Europe.

[09:44] He wrote us all the rules of cricket.

[09:46] Crickets a little more like baseball than you'd imagine, actually,

[09:49] which I thought was really fascinating. I really enjoyed reading it.

[09:51] Well, have a bat.

[09:52] Yeah, it's got a bat, but the bat is flat, like the one you smack people on the ass for

[09:57] if you're in a college.

[09:59] A paddle, yes.

[10:00] What do they call those? A pledge or something?

[10:02] Thank you, sir. Can I have another?

[10:04] So thank you, Corey, for that email and the chat back and forth.

[10:09] That brings us to today's topic.

[10:12] Are you sitting down?

[10:13] I'm sitting down.

[10:15] He talks quickly and his salesmanship is even faster.

[10:20] Jack Gwynari grew up in Brooklyn, New York,

[10:23] and quickly became a master of salesmanship and relationship.

[10:30] He knew how to grow his business.

[10:33] He knew how to build a business.

[10:36] And eventually, he wanted to change pinball.

[10:40] This month, we're talking about Jersey Jack pinball

[10:44] and the creation of a new pinball company.

[10:49] This is the first pinball company that's lasted more than three years

[10:54] since data east in the early 90s.

[10:58] This episode, episode 44, can you believe it, Ron?

[11:01] 44 episodes.

[11:03] We've done this 44 times.

[11:06] Is called even Jersey Jack pinball left, New Jersey.

[11:10] Oh.

[11:12] So mean.

[11:14] That's a good one, isn't it?

[11:15] You can call him Gwynari.

[11:17] I'll call him Gwynari. That way, one of us will be right.

[11:19] Let's start in the beginning.

[11:21] Okay. Can you give me one of those like movie theater voices?

[11:24] In the beginning, there was New York City, Brooklyn,

[11:30] the Dodgers, Lee, Ferlaille.

[11:33] I'll tell you what, Brooklyn back in the day

[11:38] was not the Brooklyn that it was once, that it is today.

[11:41] Wasn't quite as gentrified and fancy and cool.

[11:45] Brooklyn was kind of rough. It wasn't Manhattan.

[11:48] I don't know. I don't go to New York City.

[11:50] Growing up on the mean streets of Brooklyn was Jack Winari.

[11:54] Jack graduated high school in the mid 1970s

[11:59] and right around that time pinball was being legalized in New York City.

[12:04] And you remember that from our previous episodes,

[12:07] the token Roger Sharp series.

[12:10] Now, Jack, looking for a job in the mid 70s,

[12:14] he would become a coin op and pinball repair person.

[12:18] Now, I'm going to open up a picture here from 1976.

[12:21] Yeah, before you even do that, I know what it is.

[12:23] Yep.

[12:25] Let's describe what is going on in this photo.

[12:27] The 70s is what's going on, basically.

[12:30] Yes. So what color are these pants?

[12:33] They're like baby blue.

[12:35] Yep. And then the shirt, the super flowery colorful shirt

[12:39] of the 70s, with the 70s collar.

[12:41] We're thinking it's like silk probably.

[12:44] White belts. Jack probably weighs 120 pounds in this picture.

[12:48] Yes. Pants are very wide pants that look to be wider

[12:53] as they get further away from the bottoms.

[12:55] Yeah. In the background, we have a very loud looking

[12:59] sheet window covering, perhaps.

[13:02] And a serious mustache.

[13:05] Classic 70s mustache. Yep.

[13:07] Very thick, very full as a person who can't grow facial hair.

[13:11] And especially at what is he probably in this photo?

[13:14] 18.

[13:15] I'd be only that. Yeah, it's early 20s.

[13:17] To this day, I'm 40.

[13:19] I can't grow facial hair.

[13:21] But here he is. My family, obviously.

[13:24] Well, Shaven, British wristocrats did not have the Italian heritage.

[13:32] Yes. I'm like half a tie.

[13:34] So my mustache is growing as we're recording right now.

[13:37] That's right. I can hear it.

[13:38] You can literally hear it through the microphone.

[13:40] Yes. What pinball machine do we have here?

[13:43] This is the beginning of somebody who is going to change pinball.

[13:47] Is it not?

[13:48] It is.

[13:49] Somebody who is going to really make a big difference in our hobby.

[13:53] And quite frankly, somebody who deserves an episode of silver ball chronicles.

[13:58] I mean, if Bingo can get an episode, surely Jack Winari can get his own.

[14:04] Huh?

[14:05] So Jack would eventually with his mustache spread out into operating in the downturn

[14:12] of the mid 1980s.

[14:14] So he worked as a repair person in the late 70s.

[14:16] And as things started to kind of downturn into the 80s,

[14:20] Jack was able to sort of take advantage of that.

[14:25] He quickly moved into video games like Pac-Man,

[14:28] asteroids and Defender, because when pinball was falling off a cliff,

[14:32] it was video that was still treading water.

[14:35] Well, video was one of the things that made pinball off a cliff.

[14:38] He had a territory and a territory is like your area, right?

[14:42] Like as people are falling off in that time period or selling off their pins,

[14:47] they don't want to deal with the headache of whatever has become the 1980s pinball market.

[14:55] He developed his territory.

[14:57] Now, do you know the Waldorf Astoria?

[15:00] I've heard of it.

[15:01] That is the famous hotel down by Central Park in Manhattan.

[15:07] That's the one in Home Alone 2.

[15:10] I've never seen Home Alone 2.

[15:12] Oh, my God.

[15:13] I've seen Home Alone.

[15:14] Come on.

[15:15] I've seen that.

[15:16] I didn't see Home Alone 2.

[15:17] What happens?

[15:18] They leave him at home again?

[15:19] No.

[15:20] Oh.

[15:21] He gets, he gets on the airplane this time and then in the airport

[15:24] and he ends up on an airplane that goes to New York and his family goes to Florida.

[15:28] He's trying to candy in it?

[15:29] No.

[15:30] Oh, that's a fail then.

[15:31] Yeah.

[15:32] Anyway, he also had the World Trade Center's Sky Dive restaurant.

[15:37] That was also in his territory.

[15:38] Oh.

[15:39] So we're not talking like sketchy bars out somewhere.

[15:42] We're talking very busy, high traffic, like highest in probably the world area, something like

[15:51] the World Trade Center, trade, the World Trade Center's Sky Dive restaurant and the Waldorf Astoria.

[15:57] Pretty exciting stuff.

[15:59] Jack's business was so profitable, or Jack says his business was so profitable, that he had

[16:05] a hard time making the rounds to empty the coin boxes before they were full again.

[16:12] Can you imagine getting in there and there's so many quarters in those things that you can't

[16:16] like lift it out of the pinball machine?

[16:17] That would be awesome.

[16:18] It would be pretty, pretty great.

[16:21] Pinball goes through bust, growth and bust.

[16:25] And what happened in the 1990s?

[16:28] Boom at the beginning and bust by the end of the 90s.

[16:31] Yeah.

[16:32] Jack saw the writing on the wall when it came to arcades and location play and he began

[16:38] selling pinball machines and video games online in 1999.

[16:44] So here's the thing.

[16:46] Jack is obviously able to look at the market very well and then he's able to sort of slightly

[16:53] move around, change direction and change his business.

[16:59] And I think somebody who had the foresight to go online in 1999 and 2000 definitely had

[17:08] some forward thinking, right?

[17:11] Wouldn't you say?

[17:12] Mm-hmm.

[17:13] Did anybody buy anything online in like 2000?

[17:16] 2000?

[17:17] Yeah, that was like when eBay was first started kind of thing, right?

[17:22] Like buying things online in around 1999 or 2000 was crazy talk.

[17:26] The thing is I'm so old, I was around when eBay wasn't owned by when they were actually

[17:32] separate companies.

[17:33] I was around when YouTube, all the videos were 10 minutes or less.

[17:36] They had to be 10 minutes or less.

[17:38] Yeah.

[17:39] Having a website alone in 1999 was a big deal.

[17:44] In the 90s, Jack, he had all of this territory that he had collected in the in the in the

[17:51] 1980s.

[17:52] He had all these amazing games from the early 90s that came out, right?

[17:57] Your T2s and your Jurassic Park and all those amazing games.

[18:03] But then by the end of the 90s, that was dead.

[18:06] And he had enough foresight to say, well, I need to sell these machines.

[18:10] I'm going to go direct to consumer and I'm going to focus on in-home entertainment.

[18:15] I'm sure in the late 90s or really all the time, I bet you people like Jack up for

[18:21] phone calls all the time asking if they could buy a machine for their home.

[18:26] There just wasn't a market to actually buy those machines direct to the consumer being

[18:31] you and I.

[18:32] Now, the industry, Ron, is direct consumer mostly.

[18:35] It's bars.

[18:36] It's some location, but it's mostly selling it into a home.

[18:41] Who did Jack partner with to make it a little easier to sell it direct to the consumer?

[18:46] Well, before that, do you know what the name of this company is?

[18:49] No, I have no idea.

[18:50] I've never heard of this company.

[18:51] No, I mean, Jack's company.

[18:53] Oh, no.

[18:54] Yes, but go ahead and tell the folks.

[18:56] Pinball sales.

[18:58] It's pinball sales.

[18:59] They for that's like the best name ever.

[19:01] Yes, and they still are on the internet.

[19:03] I'm actually went there to see what's there now because it's used to be his main site.

[19:08] And they are still doing what we're saying or selling all kinds of equipment.

[19:12] You got pinballs, you got video games, you got jukeboxes.

[19:17] Pinballsales.com.

[19:20] Unfortunately, the website still looks like it was made in 1990.

[19:24] Yes, it does.

[19:26] Like, come on, get a template for the love of God.

[19:29] Go over to silverballcronicles.com and just check out our easy to use template that we literally drag and drop.

[19:41] These websites.

[19:42] But I mean, it's probably working well for him, so there's no need to redo it.

[19:46] Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

[19:47] Yes.

[19:48] Jack would partner with a fancy pants retailer in New York City called Neiman Marcus.

[19:56] Yes, so this I don't know.

[19:57] Can you explain this to me?

[20:00] I don't know.

[20:01] I've heard of Neiman Marcus in a way that I know they're expensive, you know, like a fancy thing.

[20:06] And I know it's a New York City thing.

[20:08] Other than that, I don't really know what they do.

[20:10] Is it like sacks?

[20:12] Is that like a sacks fifth avenue kind of thing?

[20:15] See, I don't know what that is either.

[20:17] So in Canada, we had seers, of course, that went bust back in the day.

[20:20] And that's where we would get a catalog and you'd look through the catalog and then you'd order.

[20:26] And then it would show up at a seers location.

[20:29] This, by the way, for the younger folk, I'm not particularly old by any means,

[20:34] but I kind of still remember the catalogs and things like that.

[20:37] Basically, what happened was Amazon became these retailers and destroyed those retailers,

[20:44] like seers and Hudson's Bay here in Canada as another one.

[20:50] Those companies used to ship directly to you and you would pick them up at like a location.

[20:56] That's basically what Amazon does now.

[20:58] And those old companies were too dumb to do it before Amazon because they just decided to give up.

[21:02] It was terrible.

[21:03] Anywho, enough of that rant.

[21:05] Now, they would often advertise a special edition or a limited production pinball

[21:13] or arcade machine that was sold by Jack and pinball sales.

[21:21] What's an example of one of those special editions that was in the Neiman Marcus?

[21:25] Well, special edition would be something like monopoly, platinum edition,

[21:30] could be a special edition.

[21:32] I don't know if they made that specifically for Jack.

[21:34] Who has one of those?

[21:37] Bruce Bruce Knight and Gale has one of those.

[21:39] Bruce Knight, Gale from your other podcast, the slam tilt podcast.

[21:43] They did make a special LE4 Jack.

[21:46] Jack was the main, but what we'll get into that maybe at some point.

[21:51] So we're getting like, we're laying the seeds here.

[21:54] Folks, follow us along on the narrative that is the Jersey Jack episode.

[22:00] Now, this was where Jack would make one of his most important friendships.

[22:08] So that brings us to the time that Jack made his most important friendship

[22:13] and built a strong and lasting relationship.

[22:16] Brett Abyss says, I think it was 1998.

[22:20] We purchased the X-Files.

[22:21] We got it from the Neiman Marcus catalog and it said there were only 10 units available.

[22:26] So we contacted them to see if we could get one of these special edition Neiman Marcus

[22:30] games.

[22:31] And we met Jack.

[22:32] Jack assured us that there was only one left and it was ours.

[22:36] We had this cheesy, shiny cardboard Neiman Marcus copper on it.

[22:40] So we thought it was so awesome.

[22:42] And that's how we met Jack.

[22:43] We ended up buying more games after that every Father's Day or another birthday.

[22:48] Yeah.

[22:49] So Jack sort of was like, obviously, the safe, oh boy, this is the last X-Files.

[22:54] This is the last thing I like.

[22:55] I like how the LE Neiman Marcus basically put a top round.

[23:00] Yeah, that's it.

[23:01] The toper and there was probably like a certificate of authenticity.

[23:05] I don't even think they went that far.

[23:06] They probably just put top round.

[23:07] So Brent's mother would buy a game for a birthday or a Father's Day and they just built

[23:16] this amazing relationship between the two because Jack is an awesome guy.

[23:21] But you can sell, I love this quote because you can see that Jack is like this like used

[23:26] car salesman.

[23:27] We only have one left, but it's yours.

[23:29] We only have one left here, but you better get coming in because they're, oh, I got Mrs.

[23:33] Janus.

[23:34] She's calling me to I got to fly all the way down to New Mexico to bring it to her.

[23:40] But this baby's yours.

[23:42] It's the last one.

[23:43] I like what you do.

[23:44] Your accent that I don't know what it's supposed to be.

[23:47] And then, and then he goes and he goes like this.

[23:50] That's this baby's built like a Cadillac.

[23:53] Right?

[23:54] Right?

[23:55] It's just I can see it happening before my eyes.

[23:57] And damn well, I know there was more than 10 units.

[23:59] You know what I mean?

[24:00] Well, there's 10 limited edition Neiman Marcus units available.

[24:05] So there's 10 of them with the top.

[24:07] Yeah, BS.

[24:08] I guarantee that there would be 45 if he could sell 45 of them.

[24:12] How do you actually know there's only 10, but anyway, I wonder if he has a pile of Neiman

[24:16] Marcus top or somewhere.

[24:18] He probably has them like he could just put on the game.

[24:20] Even Marcus limited edition unit.

[24:23] Like in his basement, he just has it down in his basement like a box of them.

[24:27] Well, I mean, pinball really started to die around this sort of ex files time.

[24:31] Oh, yeah, late 90s.

[24:32] Sega becomes Sega becomes stern William exits complete Williams exits completely.

[24:38] And that's of course where pinball sales.com really starts to sort of take off because

[24:43] now people who want to play pinball kind of only have one way to get there.

[24:48] And that is to purchase their own machine.

[24:51] And then, you know, being nerdy enough, you might be able to search on the internet.

[24:54] This is like pre Google days.

[24:57] You got to find the website.

[24:59] Well, at its peak, apparently pinball sales.com sold 1000 pinball machines annually.

[25:06] And that was mostly to home consumers.

[25:09] Now that didn't last forever.

[25:10] Yes, by 2010, Jack said he only sold 50 units for the year, saying that there were no product left to sell.

[25:17] He said he only sold nine stern avatar machines, I believe that.

[25:21] That's how bad it was getting by 2010.

[25:25] So this is what's happening, right?

[25:27] Jack kind of comes in as a repair person in the late 70s.

[25:31] He sort of builds his chops.

[25:32] He knows how to fix machines.

[25:34] He knows how to collect the money.

[25:35] And you know, that's kind of your first step is like, I got a pinball machine.

[25:39] How do I solder?

[25:40] How do I fix something?

[25:41] How do I diagnose a problem?

[25:43] And then go ahead.

[25:44] Yeah, and the other thing to remember in this era, Jack was the one who heavily lobbied for these

[25:52] Ellie units, like the stern spider man black.

[25:56] And you've got one of those like it has a pinball sales plaque on it.

[26:01] Because I have one actually sitting in the other room.

[26:04] And it has pinball sales plaque on it.

[26:06] And the Lord of the Rings limited edition, that was all Jack just pushing stern to do an

[26:14] Ellie run because he knew they would sell.

[26:16] Absolutely, absolutely.

[26:17] And see, the thing is his business keeps kind of changing.

[26:22] So he goes from that late 70s kind of, he pulls into actually operating.

[26:28] Then he expands and consolidates his territory by the 90s.

[26:32] Then he's got to change because the industry has changed into home sales.

[26:36] He's doing really well at a thousand units.

[26:37] I would say in a time when pinball was dead.

[26:41] But then by 2010, the industry has changed again.

[26:45] There's no more units.

[26:46] So this is where you're getting to.

[26:48] He's got to change again.

[26:50] And another quote from Brett Abbas, we ended up buying more games for Father's Day or

[26:55] a birthday.

[26:56] We ended up having a little collection.

[26:58] We had Doctor Who, Scorpion, Lord of the Rings, and one of our favorites, the Simpsons.

[27:04] Scorpion.

[27:05] How did that one get in there?

[27:07] One of these does not belong.

[27:10] We bought more and more stern games over the years.

[27:12] And we eventually just kind of stopped buying.

[27:15] They just got old and we stopped playing as much as we used to.

[27:19] So this is the problem.

[27:21] Now one of one of these really big deals, one of your tip top clients is really starting

[27:27] to struggle, right?

[27:28] You're going from Lord of the Rings in the Simpsons to Iron Man, Tron, like these stripped

[27:35] down games.

[27:36] Wasn't that the problem?

[27:37] That was what people were complaining about in round that time.

[27:40] Maybe Iron Man, but not Tron.

[27:41] Tron, they had an LE.

[27:43] Okay.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:45] NBA, Big Buck Hunter, Avatar, Iron Man, stripped down games.

[27:51] And they even said they were stripped down.

[27:52] Yeah.

[27:53] They took the service rails out of the bottom.

[27:56] Those metal service rails and they replaced with pegs.

[27:59] The pegs of doom.

[28:01] That's how things were getting.

[28:02] So these people who were buying these late 90s, early 2000s games that were still, let's

[28:09] call them Williams, Williams Esk, they can see that the quality and things are changing.

[28:14] And that's turning them off.

[28:16] Well, Stern would have always been considered a step down from Williams.

[28:20] Yeah.

[28:21] But by, you know, 2008, 2009, the spark in pinball was kind of gone by 2010, right?

[28:30] Yeah.

[28:31] I think 24 was the last full feature game.

[28:34] Then after that came all of the aforementioned NBA, Big Buck Hunter, Iron Man, Avatar.

[28:42] The magic was gone.

[28:43] The magic was gone.

[28:45] The magic was gone because there's only one pinball manufacturer at this time, right?

[28:49] Stern, pinball.

[28:50] That's it.

[28:51] Well, what does Roger Sharp say about that?

[28:53] One of my favorite quotes from Roger Sharp.

[28:54] Oh, I'm letting you say it.

[28:56] Oh, thank you.

[28:57] So Roger Sharp says, I don't care what industry it is.

[29:01] You need at least two manufacturers, which is hilarious because Gary Stern had a quote

[29:07] that pinball could not survive with two manufacturers.

[29:10] Meaning only him.

[29:12] Like if anyone else came in, they would just muddy everything up and it would just take

[29:17] it down.

[29:18] Yeah.

[29:19] Pinball was pinball is done.

[29:20] Yes.

[29:21] He said he had to like quote, like pinball cannot survive with more than one manufacturer

[29:24] like these exact opposite.

[29:25] Wow.

[29:26] If he had a time machine in the beginning, let's talk January 2011.

[29:32] This is the, this is the watershed moment where Jack, let's say over the previous 12

[29:39] months had realized something's got to change here or I'm not going to have a business.

[29:45] Well, Brett Abbott says, I'll sum it up by saying Jack did something really incredible.

[29:51] He started the first new pinball company in over a decade.

[29:55] Stern was a monopoly and had an innovated in years.

[29:58] Jack saw an opportunity and he took it.

[30:00] But this requires, of course, funding.

[30:03] You know what I mean?

[30:07] The easiest way to earn a million dollars is to start with two million.

[30:12] Here's the thing.

[30:13] You need somebody to help fund that endeavor.

[30:16] And with Jersey Jack, ever the sales person, this is our last opportunity.

[30:22] This is the last one and it's yours.

[30:24] That guy, he strives I think on the challenge.

[30:29] He strives on the hunt.

[30:31] And basically that hunt became what we would eventually called crowdfunding, getting deposits

[30:38] from consumers and distributors, which has become in some ways a very negative way that

[30:43] the industry has evolved over the last 10 years, where this becomes kind of a common thing.

[30:49] What does Brett say about that?

[30:51] Brett says, Jack did the Wizard of Oz by basically crowdfunding the company with customer

[30:56] and distributor deposits.

[30:58] Even vendors were in on the action.

[30:59] Brett built a huge following.

[31:01] The company had stakeholders across the industry who believed in him in his vision.

[31:05] It took him a few years to deliver the Wizard of Oz and suddenly the industry was reborn.

[31:10] There is a lot of hyperbole.

[31:11] There is a lot of this like, you know, the Wizard of Oz saved pinball.

[31:16] Well, you know, the momentum was there already.

[31:19] But the Wizard of Oz was in fact a watershed moment for pinball.

[31:24] 100%.

[31:25] It actually was.

[31:28] Because Stern looked at that and said, people will pay that much.

[31:31] And the pricing hasn't ever been the same.

[31:34] The industry was in fact reborn around that time.

[31:37] And Jack did have that.

[31:39] But Jack had spent 30 years, 20 years building relationships with manufacturers and people

[31:48] in the industry and other distributors.

[31:51] The play field manufacturer person because he spent all of his time at, you know, coin

[31:56] op, expos, Chicago expo, building those relationships.

[32:01] So people knew that the Jack was a legitimate person who actually cared and could actually

[32:07] pull this off.

[32:09] What did Jack say about the beginnings of Jersey Jack pinball?

[32:17] Okay.

[32:18] Huh.

[32:19] All right.

[32:20] Where do I start at the top here?

[32:21] Yes.

[32:22] Okay.

[32:23] I'm going to use the perfect way to say thanks.

[32:25] And it starts at $3 a month.

[32:27] Want to get early access to episodes before everyone else have a strange love for stickers?

[32:31] Do you know what a discord is?

[32:33] Interested in having your comments and questions take priority on our episodes?

[32:36] Jump on.

[32:37] Wait a minute.

[32:38] This is on twice.

[32:39] Idiot.

[32:40] Uh boy.

[32:41] You can't what you paid for.

[32:42] I guess.

[32:43] All right.

[32:44] Hold on.

[32:45] Jump on is $6 a month premium crony.

[32:46] What all the other perps and a shirt after three months?

[32:50] $620 a month as an Ellie neatest crony.

[32:53] Wow.

[32:54] Can I have my money now?

[33:01] He said the main focus of me starting the company in the beginning certainly was not

[33:05] to lose money, but it was not to make money.

[33:07] It was to make great gains.

[33:09] And I knew if we accomplished our mission, the money would come later on.

[33:12] I mean, a lot of people know is when you start a business, you operate in the quote unquote

[33:17] the red for a little while.

[33:19] And then you want to get that turned around.

[33:22] Jersey Jack, what would become Jersey Jack pinball started using licensing to help them manufacture

[33:29] their pinball machines.

[33:30] So they went to planetary pinball supply who we know that we've spoke about in our

[33:34] previous episodes.

[33:35] And they licensed the Williams flipper assemblies.

[33:38] They got a new Jersey company to build their wiring assemblies.

[33:44] They worked with a Massachusetts based pinnivators to build the sound boards.

[33:50] There was a woodworking firm in Illinois who made cabinets and play fields for them.

[33:56] And they actually sent those unfinished product to another company who had them add the

[34:02] artwork and ship it to New Jersey for assembly.

[34:06] This is kind of turning pinball on its head because the way stern works is most of that

[34:11] stuff is in house, right?

[34:12] Well, the cabinets were out.

[34:14] I think the cabinets were made outside and the assemblies are made by them or designed,

[34:19] but like, I mean, sir has all the vendors they usually use.

[34:23] So they already have all these relationships.

[34:25] The people who make their play fields make their cabinets, etc.

[34:28] What Jersey Jack did so they didn't have to reinvent the wheel.

[34:32] Most of their basic mechs are all Williams mechs.

[34:36] For someone who has two of them, if you lift up play field and you look underneath their

[34:40] Williams flipper mechs, Williams pop up her mechs, even things like on dialed in, the

[34:46] trap door mech is literally the exact same trap door mech that's used on fun house.

[34:51] It's the same, it's the same mech.

[34:53] You literally can use some of the same parts to repair it, which is, which is a pretty

[34:57] smart way to do is no need to reinvent the wheel.

[35:01] And if you're going to take other companies mechs, who do you take it from?

[35:04] You take it from Williams.

[35:06] Yeah. And I think Jersey Jack, of course, being a person who worked on games for years

[35:11] and years and years, understands the fact that it would be pretty great to just have the

[35:16] exact same coil that the previous companies worked with as opposed to trying to invent your own,

[35:23] which is, which is basically kind of what Dad East did, right?

[35:27] They kind of had to create all their own stuff.

[35:29] Well, they ripped off Williams system 11.

[35:32] So that's that's what they do.

[35:36] Yeah, take take a look at at our previous Dad East episode, fake it till you make it.

[35:42] But the thing is that they took all the mechs and they really went down the path of all the Williams

[35:48] terminology, especially when they eventually hire Pat Waller and all the other games they call

[35:53] the pop-upers jets, which is what Williams called them.

[35:57] The cabinet design, when they stop doing the wide bodies, it's just very simple.

[36:03] Actually, even the wide bodies, it's the same dimensions relatively than the Williams one,

[36:08] like the Williams super pins.

[36:10] If you have like the glass for that, it's the same exact size that fits in a Jersey Jack.

[36:16] So they really used Williams as their guide because he knew everyone loves the Williams stuff.

[36:21] So if you just say, to this day, if you just say, it's like that old 90s Williams feel,

[36:26] everybody just like, where's my money? I mean, I'm sorry. I said that wrong.

[36:31] What was the quote I'm trying to go for?

[36:33] Oh, so if you tell everyone, it looks like Williams, it's Williams, like take my money.

[36:39] Yeah, they know right away.

[36:40] This was turning pinball on its head because not only were they just going and grabbing all those

[36:46] bits and pieces and parts from the Williams thing, they were also saying, what can we put into

[36:53] this pinball machine? The narrative at the time was that Stern almost was like, how much can we

[37:01] take out before people know that's not a narrative? That's the truth.

[37:07] I'm going to say it's the narrative you're going to say is the truth. It was like, how much could we

[37:11] take out? It's because if you look, even if you look at a game like, I'll just take Tron,

[37:18] and you put it next to, I don't know, get away like a Williams game and you tell somebody like,

[37:24] okay, which game is newer? Especially if it's a pro without the ELWire on the, not LA.

[37:32] They were going to say like, well, it looks like they were made in the same era to me,

[37:35] and there are how many years apart? Like almost 20 years apart, and they still have the DMD,

[37:40] they still look relatively the same.

[37:43] Here's the thing, put a Simpsons, Simpsons pinball party next to a big buck hunter,

[37:51] and say which one of these costs more?

[37:55] And they actually ended up costing the same, or a big buck hunter was slightly more.

[38:00] I honestly forget how much stuff was in some of the earlier Stern games when you look at them.

[38:05] They'd have the little extra little mini display, just tons of crap on the play field compared to

[38:10] what they did later. They started serving everything.

[38:14] It sort of became, we need the one Mac. What is the one Mac?

[38:19] Because if you didn't have any Macs, people would like be like, what's going on here?

[38:23] Where before you'd have two or three, you'd have the big one, and then two more.

[38:28] And the smaller one's by stuff from Walmart and put it in the game.

[38:32] Yeah, there'd be action figures that became quickly became like a flat plastic,

[38:39] or nothing on the other Mac.

[38:40] And Iron Man is just a toy that they cut. I think they cut the feed off or whatever in a mounted.

[38:47] But literally that's all it is.

[38:49] That's completely flipped, where Jack is sitting around with his designer and his programmer,

[38:55] and a few people that he starts cobbling together.

[38:57] And he starts thinking like, what can I do here? What can I add?

[39:00] What else can we put here? Like on the flipper bats, they put ruby red slipper stickers on top of them.

[39:06] They're not stickers.

[39:08] It's like a, what is that like material?

[39:11] It's actually like a rubbery piece and they always fall off.

[39:15] It's like a siliconey kind of thing, right?

[39:17] So they stick that on top of there. Now Stern is going to go, well that's like two cents or

[39:21] five cents a pin, and if we're selling, you know, a thousand pins,

[39:25] like that's money that we could put in the pocket and save this company.

[39:29] Where Jack is like, no, no, we're putting these things on the flippers.

[39:32] We're talking about wizard of Oz, by the way.

[39:34] I don't think we said this.

[39:35] Yes, that's right.

[39:35] The Wizard of Oz.

[39:37] Well, well, Joe Balser, the designer, he says, pretty much everything we did,

[39:43] I spent time trying to talk Jack down.

[39:45] Do we really need to have a game with an upper play field as our first game?

[39:48] No, we want a game with two upper play fields.

[39:51] We want to go to display how big is the biggest one we could fit?

[39:54] What about RGB LED lighting?

[39:56] Yeah, let's put that in there.

[39:58] How about RGB LED GI?

[40:00] There were no limits.

[40:01] Jack says, when you look into the crystal ball and see a moving image,

[40:06] you say, holy s**t, how much more could you put into this game?

[40:11] So here's the thing, that little crystal ball that I mentioned a second ago,

[40:15] nobody else sees the image in that crystal ball, but the player.

[40:20] Most players that step up to that pinball machine will probably never even

[40:25] notice that that crystal ball has an image in it that changes because there's an LCD screen

[40:31] under it. Why would you put something in that nobody else would notice when they're seeing it?

[40:35] And most players don't even notice either, but that's what Jack did. He said, let's do it.

[40:39] Would pinball have died if Jersey Jack didn't exist?

[40:43] That's a question, right? So if Jersey Jack just gave up, he went on from pinballsales.com

[40:49] and he just started selling used volvos in Brooklyn somewhere.

[40:53] Would pinball have died?

[40:54] I don't think so. It would have been cheaper and Stern wouldn't have been pushed to actually

[40:58] do something different. Do you think somebody else would have filled that void if it wasn't

[41:03] Jersey Jack? There's been a lot of failures out there, especially every single year.

[41:09] So I'm not going to say yes on that one. But you know what Gary Stern says.

[41:14] I would love to know what Gary Stern says. He says, we are the only pinball manufacturer in the world.

[41:18] That will sound arrogant, but pinball will survive if Stern pinball continues to make pinball

[41:22] machines in a meaningful volume. There you go. So Gary Stern says it doesn't matter.

[41:27] But I mean, clearly they are the biggest competition to Jersey Jack.

[41:30] And then would Jersey Jack appear?

[41:31] Jack says, Stern is not our competitor.

[41:34] Any other game that goes into an amusement center is our competitor.

[41:37] Two companies are better than one. I hope Stern sells a million games and we sell 10 million games.

[41:43] But there's some some serious hurt feelings here between even still two today

[41:49] between Gary Stern and Jack. Oh, yeah. They do not do you not get along?

[41:54] Do you think that Gary Stern would slash Jack when Ari's time was you know, Gary Stern,

[42:00] he feels Jack turned on him because Jack was their number one distributor and he goes from their

[42:05] number one distributor to now he's their competitor. And I think he still feels like he got turned on

[42:11] for whatever reason. Yeah, he stabbed him in the back. And even like there's a lot of times

[42:16] today where you can see with Joe Kamenkao who's like best friends with Gary Stern. Oh, yeah.

[42:22] Right. Every now and then he'll pipe up somewhere to sort of knife Jack. Now does Jack deserve

[42:27] that knife? Yeah, probably. But at the same time, he did change pinball for the better.

[42:32] Yes, they will also yes. And Jack is not above making little jabs at Stern and the back and forth

[42:39] they go. It's pretty funny actually. So what does Brent Abbes say? He says, Gary Stern once told

[42:44] me we're not competitors. You sell the home and we sell on the street. There you go. So they're

[42:50] in different markets. So the way Gary Stern, of course, then he starts out with there's only

[42:55] there's only us. There should be nobody else. We can survive with only one company. And then it's like

[43:00] we do operators and we do operators and you do the home. So we can still co-exist together. But

[43:06] we're bigger and better than you. However, starting with AC DC, that kind of goes out the window.

[43:12] That's right. So what is what is this we're talking about here? This change around kind of 2010,

[43:17] 2011. The deal with it was always Stern is for operators. When Jersey Jack comes around with

[43:24] Wizard of Oz, like this is for the home market because no operator is going to buy this,

[43:29] you know, 6,500. We haven't talked about the pricing yet. But although I have seen them at locations.

[43:36] But Stern started to experiment on some of their games. They had Tron where they did the LE

[43:43] version with like EL wire on the ramps and stuff. Yeah, they added some drop targets where they

[43:49] stand. And then they had transformers where they did three different LEs. Remember they did the

[43:55] Decepticon, the Autobot and then the hybrid Decepticon and half Decepticon, half Autobot.

[44:02] Yeah. And then they also tried the pin models. Do you remember the pins?

[44:07] So there was like a there was like an Avengers one, not the Avengers and not L wins Avengers.

[44:13] But the pin.

[44:15] Avengers, yes. Which was sold in like Costco or something.

[44:18] Yeah, they didn't sell well.

[44:21] Because it was like a one quarter or three quarter size pinball machine.

[44:25] And then what was the other one that was there? Transformers one too?

[44:29] Yes. Yes. There was a Transformers to pin. There was also there was an Iron Man Costco version too.

[44:35] Think about that. I guess that's pretty stripped down as it is. It basically is a flipper and a ball.

[44:40] And that's it. Whether Gary will admit it or not went when Wizard of Oz came out the whole game

[44:46] changed. So starting with ACDC now Stern would have the the pro model. Then they would have the

[44:55] LE. But then they offered the premium, which is basically the LE without some of the bling.

[45:02] Yeah. Kind of the ownership had changed at Stern pinball. And they were trying to find ways to

[45:08] to move into different markets and things like that. And that's because really I would say in

[45:13] November of 2010, that's when Jack told Gary Stern about his plans for Jersey Jack pinball.

[45:21] And it was they say at the IAPA trade show, the IAAPA trade show. When Jack kind of took

[45:30] Gary off to the side and said, Hey, this is what we're doing. And Gary wished him the best in his

[45:37] endeavor. And then I'm sure went to P and Jack's cornflakes. Gary has often said that if another

[45:45] pinball company came to start up, one of two things would happen. Either they will lose a lot of

[45:50] money really quickly and close the door or they'll end up taking down Stern pinball. So it's a very

[45:57] catastrophic thing that Gary Stern says, right? It's like, you're going to destroy us or you're

[46:03] going to destroy yourself. Both of us can't coexist, which I think is proven wrong. Oh yeah.

[46:09] Well, Jack says, how can we really design and manufacture great games? And that was the focus of

[46:15] what I wanted to do. People believed in me in the vision. They joined the company. And as a team,

[46:20] we went forward and we created our first game. He tells Gary, Hey, we're building this company.

[46:26] And there's been rumblings. I'm sure you can't keep anything secret in an industry as small as

[46:32] pinball. Surely the planetary pinball had mentioned something to somebody who mentioned something

[46:37] to somebody like, you know, you can't keep it quiet in such a small industry. Well, there was an

[46:42] expo where Jack is walking around and he's with all these different pinball people who weren't

[46:49] currently with pinball companies. And somebody was like, was he starting his own company? Well,

[46:55] guess what? He was. And he's bringing around a fellow named Joe Balser, the king of clunk.

[47:00] You remember Joe Balser who did the aforementioned Simpson Spinball party. Yes. Probably one of the

[47:05] better sterns of all time. I owned a Simpson Spinball party. Oh, then it's got to be great. It was good.

[47:12] It was good. It it after 2000 plays, you're done. But it's great. You know what Joe says? Joe says,

[47:20] Jack had been in touch with me. And that was one of the first hires to come over and start Jersey

[47:25] Jack pinball with him. When we went to dinner one night, Jack and myself and a couple others had

[47:29] been with a company at that time. Jack said he had a surprise for me. We're sitting there and just

[47:35] before dinner, I turn around and there's Keith Johnson. Jack was putting together what he thought was

[47:39] the best team. Jack knew the success of the Simpsons. There were some hogs in here. We were again

[47:45] going to do something great. That's that. I mean, that's a pretty good team. Yeah, basically,

[47:49] the Simpson Spinball party team together. Yeah. Like you're putting together a team, a guy that knows

[47:54] mex. He knows how to build a pinball machine. He knows how to manufacture a machine. Joe

[48:01] Balser knows what's up. Now Joe Balser might struggle with other things, particularly side ramps.

[48:09] But he knows that if he teams him up with somebody like a Keith Johnson, who at Stern through

[48:14] the 2000s, made a lot of really great coded games, even games that were terrible. Keith pulled

[48:20] them out of the fire. If you had to design a whole new system and control a whole thing,

[48:26] you need a ball search and you need a menu system and you need how does the trough work? You

[48:33] need somebody to actually program that. I'd say Keith Johnson is the guy and quite frankly,

[48:38] he was the guy that made all of that. He had the most work to do with anybody with this poor guy

[48:45] had so much work to do. Like he had to make everything. He had to make an operating system. He

[48:50] had to make a one to four player game. Yeah, they didn't take it. It wasn't like it wasn't like a lot

[48:55] of the newer companies that took existing architectures like the p-rock or the fast boards or all that.

[49:03] They didn't do that. They came up with their the entire system from scratch. Man, that must have

[49:09] been expensive. Couldn't have been that fun. What happens when the ball drains? You need to have

[49:14] programming for that. So the best part about Keith Johnson was that he was still kind of working

[49:20] in coin up. He was working at play mechanics after he left Stern. They were still a he still

[49:25] kind of was in the industry, right? Like he didn't leave and disappear for 10 years, which was really

[49:29] helpful. So Keith says Jack came knocking. The risk or war for going to Jersey Jack versus staying

[49:35] at play mechanics was essentially infinite. It's all kinds of work that has to be done to make a

[49:40] pinball system. That's not glamorous and not fun. But without Keith, Jersey Jack would have failed.

[49:46] They wouldn't have existed. They wouldn't have existed because you had a guy who worked so hard to

[49:53] make sure that this operating system was successful. And quite frankly, it's pretty impressive. I've

[49:58] never I've never been into the menu system of a Jersey Jack pinball machine. I've never kind of

[50:04] gone through the audits and things like that. But I'll tell you, it's pretty archaic when you're

[50:07] working through even today's modern Stern in comparison to what Jersey Jack's menu system looks like,

[50:14] isn't it? It's a lot fancier. Well, it's more gooey. I mean, you have a much bigger screen to

[50:19] look at all the stuff in. Stern is using the same menu system for like 20 years. It's probably

[50:27] longer than that, right? Let's see. It's yeah, it's still in yeah, going back to Sega, almost like

[50:33] white star had a similar system. I'll give I'll give it to at least Sam. So we'll say from

[50:38] World Poker Tour on it's pretty much the same menu system, which in its own right has been kind

[50:44] of the same since Williams DMD era. You kind of got the three or four buttons and once forward and

[50:49] once back Stern white star had like the three buttons and then they went to four when they went to

[50:54] Sam with World Poker Tour. So it became to yeah, it became more like the William system from the 90s.

[51:01] And that's where I think something silly like the pin bar came from. Remember the pin bar?

[51:06] Oh, did we do that episode yet? No. Oh, it's a deeper episode. I'm sure that'll be a great one.

[51:11] Nowadays, everything is touchy, right? You got your phone and a screen and a whatever. So it's really

[51:17] weird to have three or four buttons in a coin door going through almost like a DMD display on an LCD

[51:24] screen. So of course, they came up with the pin bar, which was an LCD screen in the lockdown by

[51:29] the dumbest thing I've ever seen to be able to swipe and move around in your menus.

[51:34] How did Jack leverage his relationships to announce Jersey Jack pinball to the world? Well,

[51:40] Jack went on the spooky pinball podcast. They had a podcast. They had a podcast originally.

[51:45] It was a podcast long before they created their company. So they were like an operator or something.

[51:50] Um, I can't remember what Charlie actually did, but he was in. He worked for some company that

[51:56] made amusement based products. I think we'll find out on our spooky episode whenever that was

[52:01] January 1st, 2011, 2011. He went on the spooky pinball podcast. He announced Jersey Jack pinball.

[52:09] So it's a few months after he told Gary Stern and and and and slash Stern's tires. So what did

[52:16] what how does Jack how does Jack position himself? How did he how did he announce it? Well,

[52:22] Jack says it was a big surprise to Charlie Charlie Emory of spooky pinball podcast because he

[52:27] didn't know it was coming. Charlie just kind of lost it. He was very, very excited as was I and

[52:33] the reaction was amazing. Yeah, the name was Jersey Jack. And this came from the original pen name

[52:40] that Jack Winari head in replay magazine. So this is kind of an industry coin op magazine. Yep.

[52:47] And anytime Jack Winari would like write a letter to the editor write an article, the pen name

[52:54] would be Jersey Jack. This was suggested by a person who's become known as Jersey Jen. And who's

[53:01] Jersey Jen? Uh, Jersey Jen is Jack's daughter. Behind every great pinball man is a strong pinball

[53:10] woman making all the actual hard decisions and making the company actually work. Isn't that right?

[53:16] Well, Gary Stern had Shelley Sachs Joe Camman cow. He would say in all of our previous episodes about

[53:21] Daddy East and that stuff that without Shelley Sachs the late Shelley Sachs that there would be no

[53:28] Stern pinball as we know it today because she made all of the critical and crucial decisions.

[53:32] Well, Gary and Joe did all the salesmany stuff. What does Jack say about Jersey Jen?

[53:38] Jack says Jen really should be wearing the badge of co-founder of the company because she was

[53:42] there when I had the idea. All I got from her was encouragement and support. And she was my left

[53:47] arm through the process. She just stepped up and she rose way above the occasion on so many

[53:51] different levels of what we needed done in the company. It was not just the details. It was the

[53:56] building the relationships and paying salaries and making the orders and like doing that Jack of

[54:02] all trades like this, this Shelley Sachs Jersey Jen still at Jersey Jack pinball today.

[54:07] Which is pretty great. So I wanted to give her a tip of the hat.

[54:11] Yes. She was at expo. So are there super important part of Jersey Jack pinball.

[54:16] January of 2011, this is there. There's a pinball news article which I have included in our show notes.

[54:22] And this is where Jack announces the company, wizard of Oz as the license. And Jack was working with

[54:29] a new Jersey based company that made assorted a coin up grabbing and pushing novelty games. They

[54:36] were going to be doing the manufacturing. Jack said that they currently make more complicated

[54:41] products than pinball machines. So manufacturing pinball machines should be no problem at all.

[54:47] Wait, what do you get? What do you laugh at? Everyone always says that. Jack also said that he was

[54:53] looking beyond their first game already. So he's announced their first game and he's already

[54:58] talking about game two and game three. And he was even considering bringing back non license

[55:05] themes. Everybody knows that that is how you grow a pinball machine company. No.

[55:10] And saying the second game probably wouldn't be licensed. But game three might be end up being

[55:16] the opposite. The second one wasn't a third one wasn't. So we talked about you and mentioned

[55:20] price a couple of times. Yeah. So a stern was selling at this time for what like $4,000?

[55:27] Yeah, that might have been the manufacturer suggested real-tail price, but you could get them

[55:31] under that. So like iron man's were like $3,500 bucks or something?

[55:36] Maybe not that cheap, but yeah, somewhere in that ring.

[55:40] High three thousand. Yes. Yep. Plus shipping. What's the Wizard of Oz going to sell for?

[55:45] $6,500. God, I would love to pay $6,500. Yeah, but then when that came out, it's like, oh my god,

[55:52] it's like $2,500 more. What the hell? So there better be a lot of crap in that pinball machine

[55:58] to justify that, right? You better wow me to say that you're going to have to pay $2,000 more

[56:03] than a stern. But that price is only valid for pre-orders made before March 1st, 2011.

[56:09] So there's the catch. That's the cheap price. And there was a $250 non-refundable deposit.

[56:15] And then when the pre-order deadline is reached, an additional $1,500 deposit is required to

[56:20] continue with the pre-order. Otherwise the pre-order lapses and deposit is returned. Oh, that's not,

[56:25] that's not okay. So you put $250 down then on March 1st, which is like three months later,

[56:31] you got to put another $1,500 down. And if you don't put your $1,500 down, you lose your $250.

[56:38] Well, no, it says, no, it says that deposit is returned. Ah, okay, right. Okay, so you get your

[56:42] $250 back. So if you forgot about it, you're just going to get $250 back and like, what was this?

[56:46] Like, oh yeah. You get your $250 back, but somebody gets your spot. Yeah. What if you bought the game

[56:51] outside of the pre-order release window? Then it was $7,500. Holy crap, that's expensive.

[56:59] So $7,500 when Stern was selling them for like four grand. And you know who got a pre-order?

[57:04] My podcast mate on the Slantel podcast. Oh, he was, he, yep, he was in the original batch.

[57:11] He was in the original batch. And that is Bruce Nightingale from the Slantel podcast.

[57:15] Yes, your other podcast. And he was the reason that I got to go on the factory tour when they

[57:20] were building though. That's so cool. In New Jersey. In New Jersey, they had a thing where all your,

[57:25] your people had deposits down could come to the factory and get like a private tour of everything.

[57:30] So you could see that they were actually like a real company. Oh, yeah. So like when you go to the

[57:36] the Stern manufacturing facility in New Jersey, like you get to, Stern doesn't have a manufacturing

[57:43] facility in New Jersey. When you get to the Jersey Jack manufacturing facility in New Jersey,

[57:48] right? So you show up to the factory. It looks like every, what every industrial park you'd ever

[57:53] see before. That's kind of what the image is. Fairly large. I would say at least the size of

[57:59] what Stern had at the time. So you walk in, you get like a hard hat, some glasses, you get a leather

[58:05] jacket and a white shirt because you have to dress like you're from New Jersey. A lot of it was

[58:10] space, frankly. They just had like one line. There was a lot of unused space. They had to fill out

[58:16] a bit. Then Dennis Nordman jumped aboard. So somewhere along the line, Dennis Nordman, the Nordman

[58:23] himself, he joins J.J.P. to help sort of what put some some spit polish on was. Well,

[58:30] then the rumor was that he was doing game number two. Well, Dennis says, words can't describe how thrilled

[58:36] I am to be given the opportunity to design pin games again. Jack is a great leader and motivator

[58:41] and I know we will build an exciting product. He also revealed how Whizbang Pinball, which was

[58:48] a collaboration between him and Greg Ferreris, who is the artist, who would eventually end up

[58:54] being the art director of Stern. They were creating the Playfield artwork for Wizard of Oz

[59:00] and Dennis' own game at Jersey Jack. And what was Dennis Nordman's Jersey Jack game?

[59:07] I didn't have one. Yeah, that's right. So what happens is Dennis Nordman swings in. He has a cup of coffee.

[59:13] He helps you out a little bit in some manufacturing stuff. He talks up your company. And then he leaves.

[59:22] That's kind of his thing, right? Dead silence. Oh, the test units of Wizard of Oz, right? So

[59:30] back in the day, you had test units. Now that doesn't happen nowadays. Now the pinball machine

[59:36] just shows up and you have to buy it really quickly. Yes. Now you are the testers. And we see that

[59:41] that causes problems. Yes, it can cause problems. I mean, still happened, but they made all of these

[59:46] test units in April of 2013. So we announced in 2011, we collected all those deposits kind of in

[59:54] the beginning of 2011. And then people waited like two years to get those machines. Now we don't know

[01:00:00] how many units were actually made. The design was Joe Balser. The art was Greg Ferris and Matt

[01:00:07] Reisner. Reis Tuner. Yeah. And Jerry van der Selt. Stelt. Yes. I think I was at the factory and it was

[01:00:16] probably spring of 2012. And they were on the line. The original Wizard of Oz's were just insane.

[01:00:24] The cabin, it's alone. It must have been pretty wild to see that. There were so extreme cabin,

[01:00:28] it's with like clear coat on them. Basically like the equivalent of what's spooky caused the butter

[01:00:33] cabinet. And they were just gorgeous. Now they brought another individual Chris Gran are back to

[01:00:38] do sound and music with Bob with Rob a berry Williams veteran Brian Hansen Dennis Norman did the

[01:00:43] mechanics. So they're the ones that are doing the actual like max and stuff underneath Balser is

[01:00:49] basically doing just the the kinetics or the design of the play field. And a new individual did

[01:00:55] animation. So they have this LCD screen that you had mentioned earlier that how big does this

[01:00:59] LCD screen have to be 27 inches. So we're going to replace the back glass and the DMD with a 27

[01:01:08] inch LCD screen. We need graphics for that. And we're bringing on an individual named Jean Paul

[01:01:13] DeWin. Yeah. Who works remotely from the what the Netherlands. Yes. Not the Netherlands regions.

[01:01:18] The Netherlands. Very, very good. Yeah. So Keith Johnson on the software with Ted Estes. Alex

[01:01:23] Levy. Joe Katz and a JT Harkey. They did the software. So they had a pretty good team there.

[01:01:30] Ted Estes, other Williams veteran. Joe Katz has been there since the beginning. Exactly. And what does

[01:01:35] Brent say Brett? What does Brett Abyss say about this crazy machine? When I laid my fingers on

[01:01:44] the machine, I couldn't believe it. It was honestly the coolest thing I'd ever seen. I was enamored

[01:01:48] by the LED light show, the screen, the wide body, two upper play fields, the art package, higher

[01:01:54] quality, everything, and the shiny armor. It was really everything we had always wanted in a machine.

[01:02:00] The reason we stopped buying was the lack of innovation. And here it was sitting in front of me in my

[01:02:04] basement. One of these early adopters, these lapsed pinball purchasers. Yes. Did we mention it was a

[01:02:11] wide body too because it's off of everything else. Of course it had to be a wide body. You had to

[01:02:16] cram as much stuff in there. Now if you want to learn a little bit more about this kind of more in

[01:02:22] depth, go listen to our Joel Balls or a King of Clunk episode in the archives. You can search that

[01:02:29] up in the podcast feed as well as you can check it out on silverballcronicles.com in the archive as well.

[01:02:38] Dennis Nordman, he did that upper play field with the original house model and the concept as well as

[01:02:43] he did the pop bumper mech thing on the bottom left. Yeah, that was his ideas supposedly.

[01:02:49] Well, remember the pop bumper was the balloon. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, where the whole

[01:02:54] theming in the game was like the pop bumpers or on top of them they have the trees with the apples,

[01:03:01] holy apples. I love those things. So good. It's pretty cool. Now I have played Wizard of Oz a few

[01:03:06] times and I've always played it on location. I haven't had a lot of sound. So I've been able to

[01:03:10] get the full experience and it is a little clunky with its shooting as per the Joe Balser design.

[01:03:16] However, it's it's pretty unique and different and fun and I would love to actually have this in

[01:03:22] a home environment to really I think get the deep feels for this pin. What about you? Have you

[01:03:29] headed in that situation? I was never too crazy about Wizard of Oz. You were you were more impressed by

[01:03:34] I was impressed by yes, what was in it, but actually how it shot. I like the upper play fields.

[01:03:41] The best actually, especially they the house trying to get that to get the the loops going and

[01:03:46] their house just starts turning. I thought that was super cool. The monkey mac is pretty cool where

[01:03:51] it kind of comes down and picks the ball up with a magnet and puts it up on the upper play field.

[01:03:54] You get tired of that pop up because you keep draining and you're like, oh god, you're trying to

[01:03:59] hit all the targets with it. Yeah, you just wanted to hurry up. Yes, it's pretty cool. Now that

[01:04:03] Keith Johnson was known especially for Lord of the Rings, the Simpsons pinball party,

[01:04:10] Wheel of Fortune, like a lot of really complex code. That's the other thing we should mention. That's

[01:04:16] the stern at this point, they were getting simpler. Well, they were simpler with the code.

[01:04:21] They would get more complicated later, but you know, in this they're stripped down era of games,

[01:04:26] like NBA, Big Buck Hunter, etc, etc. With Wizard of Oz, they went the opposite direction. We want

[01:04:33] the deepest game possible. Game that you can just play for hours on end and not see the end of it.

[01:04:37] Got what you've got the modes with the crystal ball thing, I think, right? And then you got the

[01:04:43] horses of a color. Horses of a different color. Yeah, so that I don't know or get, but I know that

[01:04:48] there's something where you got to collect the horses or the colors and then all the different shots.

[01:04:53] I know somewhere over the rainbow is the final Wizard mode or whatever that I'll never ever see.

[01:04:58] Yeah, so Jack would say, I just said, I want you guys to do the best you can. The danger in that

[01:05:05] is that it almost never ends and that you don't know what it's going to cost. Oh, yeah.

[01:05:10] So he just kept pushing them. Do more, do more, add more, keep going, but it just kept adding to

[01:05:16] the cost of the company. And then Waz had some struggles. The Wizard of Oz had some struggles,

[01:05:21] didn't it? Oh, they had lightboard issues. So what was the lightboard? It was like the light

[01:05:26] boards were these boards underneath the inserts, the colors because everything's LED. So all the lights

[01:05:33] are on light boards underneath the play field. And they had issues with them to the point where

[01:05:38] they actually had to redesign them and then he had to replace them. Did they was it for free? I don't

[01:05:42] remember. Some of them, some of the, I remember there was a fellow in Halifax that I knew he had a

[01:05:47] Ruby red edition and they replaced them for free. Nice. So he has the best edition. So if you have the

[01:05:52] early Wizard of Oz with the, the super like butter cab and you get your lightboards replaced,

[01:05:57] you have like the perfect Wizard of Oz. Yeah. And the Ruby red edition one is just gorgeous because

[01:06:02] it's got that red candy apple red. Don't forget flying monkeys and the flying monkey Mac,

[01:06:07] right, which they removed in the, in the yellow edition, yellow burger. But then put it back in

[01:06:11] some other edition. Yeah, they're like, oh, actually in the game, I believe it's called like winged

[01:06:16] monkey. Yes, because that's the official name or something. Even everyone calls it flying monkeys,

[01:06:21] that's not actually their official name. That's right. I remember that. I remember that detail. It's

[01:06:26] like what winged monkey? Not only did they have struggles with that, that created a lot of financial

[01:06:31] challenges. Oh, yeah. Because I don't know if you know this or not, Ron, pinball's hard.

[01:06:34] It's really expensive. What is the first sign of trouble within your company?

[01:06:39] Dennis Norman leaves it. If you've got Dennis Norman at your company and Dennis

[01:06:43] Norman leaves, sh**ts, not going well. He's always the canary in the coal mine. He was developing game

[01:06:50] number two. He had a long slog and then he was out of there. How does Jack, the ever so awesome

[01:06:57] sales guy? How does he spin his financial troubles? Well, Jack says in early 2015,

[01:07:03] financial people were looking to advise me to recapitalize the company so that we didn't have to rely

[01:07:08] on customer deposits and things like that. Jen was the person that told me to get in touch with

[01:07:13] the Abyss family. Jane Abyss, who was Leonard's wife and Brett's mom, had become really a friend.

[01:07:20] I reached out not knowing that they might be interested. So there was no NDAs, no fancy agreements,

[01:07:27] Jack just wanted to have a chat with Jane and her husband Leonard about the company.

[01:07:33] And this is kind of what started the ball rolling with a significant change in the ownership

[01:07:40] of pinball. And this is why they were working on Hobbit, their next game. That's right. So they're

[01:07:48] trying to, they're running out of money. They're running out of money. They brought it to expo

[01:07:53] in October. Everyone hated the art. So they end up redoing the art for the game. They're kind

[01:08:01] of like in it. They're in trouble. Let's just put it that way. I don't know how terrible that

[01:08:05] trouble was, but enough that they had to use the dreaded word recapitalize. You never want to hear

[01:08:10] that word. And who is the last company that used the term recapitalize? Hagus. Hagus pinball,

[01:08:15] who nobody remembers and now they were, they were unable to recapitalize. They could not find an

[01:08:21] Abyss family to help them out. Now we have mentioned quite a few times somebody by the name of

[01:08:28] Brett Abyss. And he is a very important figure in the Jersey Jack pinball sphere at this moment.

[01:08:38] But before we get into who Brett Abyss is, let's talk about the ownership change. Andrew Paul,

[01:08:45] he is the general counsel, who's a lawyer basically, and managing director of tutor investment

[01:08:52] corporation. So he is one of the investors that came aboard. They call these angel investors or

[01:08:59] old white guys with money. Scott Flanders. Now he became the CEO of Playboy Enterprises in 2009.

[01:09:08] And he is the former CEO of a company called McMillan Publishing. And he was also the CEO of

[01:09:15] Columbia House Company. You remember Columbia House? Columbia House. Yes. He loves Columbia House.

[01:09:21] So then there was Leonard Abyss. And he is the chairman and executive officer for Think Lab ventures.

[01:09:28] And Brett's dad. Yeah. So Leonard Abyss is, you know, so Think Lab Ventures is basically a investment,

[01:09:36] you know, company, so a family office. So this is where Leonard is investing money, his money,

[01:09:42] other people's money in specific, you know, some people call it venture capitalism, I guess. Right?

[01:09:48] That's the kind of thing what that is. So what does what does Jersey Jack say about the relationship?

[01:09:53] Well, he says, with this capital infusion, we can now take our company to the next level. Our goal

[01:09:58] is to consistently deliver the finest games in the industry. And the best game experience for our

[01:10:03] players is the photo of confidence in me and our team and in our products leaves no doubt that

[01:10:09] Jersey Jack pinball have the resources to develop and manufacture many more great games for expanding

[01:10:14] worldwide player base for many years to come. Okay, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. What

[01:10:20] is Leonard Abyss? Abyss, the lead investor say. Well, he says, I have been a pinball fan by

[01:10:25] entire life in Jersey Jack pinball. I saw a company that has both the creative vision and the

[01:10:30] technical abilities to renew and reinvigorate this industry. I have known Jack one area for many

[01:10:36] years and delighted in watching him develop the ultimate pinball game to date the Wizard of Oz.

[01:10:41] What about Andrew Paul, the co-investor? Is this the playboy guy? Yeah. Oh, that's fine. I am

[01:10:47] pleased to be associated with Jersey Jack pinball. I have been a pinball fan since my teens. And with

[01:10:52] Wizard of Oz, Jersey Jack is delivering an absolutely state of the art product. I'm excited to be

[01:10:57] part of Jersey Jack pinball as they developed the industry's most significant innovations and

[01:11:02] exciting games. Oh, that was a heck of a press release, I think. I wonder if he played the playboy

[01:11:07] pinball machine as a kid. Who are the Abyss's? Well, Leonard Abyss senior began a bank in Miami in

[01:11:15] 1947. And later led by his son Leonard Abyss junior junior sold the bank firm in 2008 for $927

[01:11:24] million. Well, okay. That's pretty wild. Leonard Abyss junior was voted reader digest America's top

[01:11:35] boss after using $60 million of the proceeds from that sale to give bonuses to all $399 of his bank

[01:11:45] staff. And this was during the 2008 financial crisis. President Barack Obama spoke about Leonard

[01:11:52] junior in his 2009 state of the union address as an example of what positive CEOs can do for America.

[01:12:02] Wow, name drop by the president. And as we know, Ron, that example has been upheld by all American

[01:12:09] CEOs since that day. Oh, yeah, I'm sure. After selling the bank, Leonard junior started think lab

[01:12:17] ventures, which is an Abyss family investment office. Now family office usually invests in

[01:12:24] real estate mergers and acquisitions. Now, who is Brett Abyss? And why has Brett Abyss been coming up

[01:12:31] with all of these quotes throughout this episode? I don't know why. Well, he is the grandson of Leonard

[01:12:38] senior and the son of Leonard junior and Brett is listed as being the owner of City National Bank of

[01:12:47] Florida since August of 1990. Hey, penets, when I'm not doing this podcast, I'm Dave the financial

[01:14:05] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How is that possible?

[01:14:09] So, and I reason I say that is because I saw Brett at Jersey Jack factory just like this past summer

[01:14:20] and he looks like he's 25 years old. Okay, so if you look up Brett's LinkedIn page,

[01:14:28] you'll see all of his accomplishments there. Fairly accomplished individuals, one would say,

[01:14:34] because he was the owner of a bank in Florida in August of 1990 when I think he was like two.

[01:14:41] That's impressive. So that's how successful Brett is. In 2010, he also helped co-found

[01:14:49] Orion Jet Center, which is a private jet company that was sold seven years later in 2017

[01:14:57] to Atlantic Aviation. And this was when Brett was like 18. Skyd must know what he's doing.

[01:15:04] Brett is currently a volunteer and young leader on the executive board and an executive board member

[01:15:12] of the United Way in Miami, Dade County. So he's an avid volunteer to help sort of get down and out

[01:15:20] kind of youth or younger youth up and running with the United Way, which is awesome. Good for him.

[01:15:27] So here's the thing, right? Brett is 34 years old or 35. He looks younger. And he is the owner of

[01:15:35] Jersey Jack pinball. Now he doesn't have a title like president or CEO or CEO or COO. Leonard

[01:15:43] Jr. is above Brett in the company hierarchy and Brett is left to run the day to day of Jersey Jack.

[01:15:53] And what does he say about being involved with Jersey Jack? Well, he says, we're going to continue

[01:15:59] to push boundaries. We want to grow our customer base. There's a lot of pinheads and stern fan

[01:16:05] voids that have yet to own a Jersey Jack pinball machine and really experience it in a home environment.

[01:16:11] We want to convert those people. Are you going to ask me if I've been converted? Have you been converted?

[01:16:16] Not really. But I mean, it is like a Jersey Jack machine. It is so much heavier than a

[01:16:22] stir machine. There's so much more stuff in it. It's insane. So it's unique. It's a different kind

[01:16:29] of experience. When you lift up the play field of a Jersey Jack, it's for like, oh my god. What have

[01:16:35] I got myself into? So Brett is the is the owner and has been an owner of a lot of big companies along

[01:16:42] the way. He's not it's not hurting. It's not hurting for a sandwich. But it's still not easy

[01:16:48] to be in the kit of a billionaire. And like, let's face it, everybody loves his father. His father

[01:16:53] is very charitable. His father was very successful and made a lot of money. That's a lot of pressure.

[01:16:58] The other thing is everyone thinks you've kind of been given everything. I'm assume there's a lot

[01:17:02] of people that think, oh, here's a 35 year old kid who's running a company. And it was just sort

[01:17:08] of given to him by his father. That's a lot of pressure. Brett in 2020 did an interview with Ken

[01:17:14] Cromwell on the Jersey Jack pinball podcast. I think it's a great listen. He comes out as a fighter.

[01:17:22] He presents himself as though he's got something to prove. He also makes a few mistakes,

[01:17:28] which hopefully he has learned from a PR perspective. But I think all in all, he comes across as a

[01:17:35] great dude. He really is, I think, very smart. I think he's really got the passion for the company.

[01:17:45] And I think he's a lot of fun. Of course, this is five years ago from the date of this recording.

[01:17:51] And Brett, he compares himself to Tesla. And this was something that a lot of people did

[01:17:57] like 10 years ago, five years ago. They always compared themselves to Tesla. And I always hated

[01:18:02] that right because it's this startup mentality, right? Like starting a manufacturing company from

[01:18:07] nothing. So what does Brett say? Yeah, I forgot about that. You're right. He did do the Tesla thing.

[01:18:13] I'd like to compare us to Tesla. Most people don't realize that Tesla was founded in 2003.

[01:18:19] I've been following them for many years. I've been to the factory. I drive one and I'm a proud

[01:18:24] shareholder. Today, this morning, the stock had a milestone of 1000 per share. And I think they'll

[01:18:29] eventually overtake Toyota as the biggest car company in the world. Yeah, that did not age well.

[01:18:35] Oh, yeah, Tesla shares are now at 240 or 240. And I don't have to tell anybody who's tuning in.

[01:18:40] The controversy around Tesla. The idea is, okay, we've got the startup. We're going to go. We've got

[01:18:47] these great sort of vision that we want to do. It's not easy being Leonard Abbas's son. It's not

[01:18:55] easy running a company. But I think the changes we have seen in Jersey Jack as they started to prepare

[01:19:03] for game number two. And then they moved into game number three. And where they are today, I think,

[01:19:09] has been a big, big deal. And we'll get into that in our Jersey Jack episode number two.

[01:19:15] Yeah, where does that leave Jack in all this? Ah, Jersey Jack, the pinball manufacturer itself

[01:19:22] is in a different market than Stern. And it appears, though, it has taken them six years to come

[01:19:27] with terms to that, right? Like they're not really the same company they were when Jack started them,

[01:19:32] right? Not just from an ownership standpoint, but also from a manufacturing standpoint. What do you

[01:19:36] think? I think they've gone back and forth. They started, they started out as, you know, we're making

[01:19:41] machines for the home. You know, these are super packed machines with super deep rule sets for the

[01:19:47] home. Then they had a stage where they actually made some more stripped down versions of the machines

[01:19:54] for operators to try to get them in locations. And then they kind of just gave up on that.

[01:19:59] And then they've kind of come back, come back full circle to the original. Like we're going to

[01:20:03] make the best. We are the Cadillac of pinball manufacturers. We're going to make the most

[01:20:08] feature-filled packed games possible. And the thing is that they're selling more complex games.

[01:20:15] But they're selling fewer units of those games than they might expect that they want to.

[01:20:21] But they are starting to release them in faster succession. Are they not?

[01:20:25] No, then they used to, yeah. Yeah, it's where they've really started to kind of ramp up the amount

[01:20:29] that they're doing. Now they might be selling 2,000 or 1,500 games or whatever, but they're in rapid

[01:20:34] succession replacing moving them along on the line. And when they were selling the more,

[01:20:40] like some stripped down versions of their games, they did not sell at all. They did not sell well

[01:20:44] at all. That's why they abandoned that. Those are truly the limited editions. I don't think they

[01:20:48] told us that when I was there. That's why they stopped doing that. And so what does Brett say about

[01:20:54] working with Jack? He says, I'm super proud to be Jack's partner. I love working with him.

[01:20:59] His guidance and decades of experience. When he did to build this company is an amazing story

[01:21:04] on its own. The pinball community coming together to support an amazing man on his dream. And I feel

[01:21:10] really lucky to be his partner and to have him by my side. Not my wildest dreams that I think

[01:21:15] that I would own the coolest gaming company on earth. I mean to be able to work with these guys.

[01:21:20] These legends to create such an amazing product. I think what we do is so special.

[01:21:24] My dad always told me that it's not about being the biggest, it's about being the best at what you do.

[01:23:31] I don't get that. Columbia House, I thought was the thing where you bought like stop music or

[01:23:39] whatever. You know, books or what the hell it was. Oh yeah, that's right. I thought it was the

[01:23:44] coffee place. I don't think so. I think you're right. I'll cut that out. Columbia.

[01:23:48] Let me look that up right now. Columbia House. Yeah, there's Columbia Coffee. Columbia. Yeah,

[01:23:53] but I think Columbia Houses, the publisher company. Yeah, record company. They were a record company.

[01:23:57] Yeah, you could buy records via mail order. There was all mail order. That's why I remember.

[01:24:02] Yeah, because commercials used to be on. You would get them and then you send your payment back

[01:24:07] or something. Yeah, or they hunt you down. Okay, not the coffee company.

[01:24:16] All right, there we go. And I love my out in John. And my dialed in.
