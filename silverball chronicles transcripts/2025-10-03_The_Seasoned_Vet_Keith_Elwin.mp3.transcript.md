[00:00] Hey, want a cookie?

[00:02] Oh, I know you're just eight, so you're craving some a little sweet.

[00:06] Besides, one cookie isn't going to kill you.

[00:09] Have on half.

[00:10] Just a bite.

[00:11] Bite it.

[00:12] Bite it.

[00:31] Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

[00:33] I went through your notes and made some corrections.

[00:37] Keith L. Winne is never won an IFA.

[00:42] Ever.

[00:43] Okay.

[00:44] That's like the one more championship he's never won.

[00:46] But he's won tons of poppas and pinburgs.

[00:48] Okay, so here's the thing.

[00:50] I used AI to build this episode.

[00:54] I could see like I looked up evil dead, you know, I'm getting an evil dead at some point.

[00:59] And I'm like, how heavy is evil dead?

[01:01] It's got to be closer to life.

[01:03] 400 pounds.

[01:04] I mean, it's got to be at least 350, right?

[01:06] According to AI, it's 485 pounds.

[01:09] I'm like, no, no, it's no, it's not.

[01:12] And I found where one of the distributors has that as the weight, which is totally wrong,

[01:16] but that's where it must be grabbing it.

[01:18] 485 pounds.

[01:21] So if you're not an expert of your content, it's very dangerous.

[01:27] Well, definitely.

[01:28] Right?

[01:29] Because I made a bunch of corrections already.

[01:31] Oh, it said Tim Sexton was on Jaws.

[01:33] I took it out off.

[01:34] Exactly.

[01:35] And it also said, it said a bunch, it was a bunch of that stuff.

[01:38] And I'm like, no, that's not right.

[01:51] Hello, everyone.

[01:52] I'm David Dennis, and this is Silverball Chronicles.

[02:19] And with me this month is Ron Rip the spinner, Halette.

[02:22] What's up, I like that?

[02:23] I like that.

[02:24] Rip the spinner, Halette.

[02:25] Yeah.

[02:26] Yeah.

[02:27] You are the spinner expert.

[02:28] Everybody knows you know how to juice the spinners.

[02:32] This was a big topic on slam tilt.

[02:35] Slam tilt podcast, my other podcast.

[02:37] We got that out of the way early.

[02:39] Excellent.

[02:40] Two months in a row.

[02:41] Get her done.

[02:42] Get it out of here.

[02:43] And we know that you're the expert of all things to get that spinner to go,

[02:47] and which spinners to avoid.

[02:49] So that's why you were Ron Rip the spinner, Halette.

[02:52] I love Optospinners.

[02:54] That's a trend I can get behind in Pinball.

[02:57] There you go.

[02:58] There you go.

[02:59] What's going on?

[03:00] We got, we're on the verge of Star Wars.

[03:01] We've had Harry Potter.

[03:03] Yes.

[03:04] Yes we have.

[03:05] Very exciting stuff.

[03:06] And by now that I say that on the verge of Star Wars,

[03:08] it's coming up like probably tomorrow.

[03:10] And I'm not going to edit this for like a couple of weeks or maybe a week.

[03:13] And then it'll be totally...

[03:14] Anyway.

[03:15] We were invited to the media event.

[03:17] Did you know that?

[03:18] Ah, I saw that.

[03:19] So Stern is doing the thing where they invite the people to the media event to come in

[03:23] and play the games and shoot the pictures and stuff.

[03:26] And I would love to do that, not travel under the States right now.

[03:29] Do you know how much it would cost?

[03:31] Do you know how much it would cost for me if I were to go for like just one day?

[03:34] Flying, I have a direct flight from Albany to Chicago.

[03:38] You know how much that would be?

[03:39] $400.

[03:41] Ah.

[03:42] That's not even for the...

[03:44] I have to get a hotel, take uppers around to the different things,

[03:48] and then be back the next day.

[03:50] Near in Chicago, you could just sleep at Cubs Stadium like all the fans.

[03:55] You just roll in and just never leave.

[03:57] But I do appreciate the invite.

[03:59] The shower in the washrooms in there.

[04:01] Oh, the bathrooms, yes.

[04:03] Anyway, Patreon.

[04:06] Hey, we've had a couple people join us over on Patreon.

[04:10] Welcome Jason and Robert.

[04:12] It's wonderful to see you.

[04:13] New cronies.

[04:14] And we've got a couple new cronies.

[04:16] We've had a few people go up in their tears from pro to premium.

[04:21] And then we've had a few people drop out and a few people join us.

[04:24] But that's what it's all about.

[04:25] Just come in and say thank you.

[04:27] You want to shoot us a couple of bucks just to give us a tip of the hat.

[04:32] We greatly appreciate that.

[04:34] The $3 a month premium crony.

[04:36] $3 a month pro crony is where you can start out.

[04:39] But if you want the perks, you got to jump up to $6 a month.

[04:42] That's where you get access to the discord chat room where we spill all the secrets that I discover.

[04:50] Most of it is stuff that other people tell me in.

[04:54] And you know what I mean?

[04:55] I just throw it in there.

[04:56] I knew it was Star Wars.

[04:57] New Star Wars all along.

[04:58] Everyone knew it was Star Wars.

[05:00] It was all I knew forever.

[05:02] It was a big deal.

[05:04] And I also know that it's Beetlejuice.

[05:06] Oh, really?

[05:07] Do you think it's Beetlejuice?

[05:10] When you haven't heard any other rumor like litter, that is the only one I've heard you know it's Beetlejuice.

[05:16] Those, those, nope.

[05:17] Those are the ones that that I've discovered through my active research.

[05:22] My dream is that it turns out it's actually Beavis and Botan.

[05:24] I'm like, oh my god.

[05:26] Yeah, no, no, it's not.

[05:29] It's not.

[05:30] So I'll give you that.

[05:31] Yeah.

[05:32] Now the big one is the early ad free access.

[05:35] So we've got ads on silver ball chronicles now.

[05:39] If you want to avoid those $6 a month is where you got to be.

[05:43] If you like t-shirts, if t-shirts are your thing, join us for three months at the LE-letist crony level.

[05:52] And you'll get a free t-shirt shipped to your door after three months.

[05:57] You know, being worth saying all this at the beginning, this means we don't have to say to the end, right?

[06:01] Yeah, no, we'll say it multiple times because if you want to get ad free access,

[06:06] I want to make it as annoying as possible on the free fee.

[06:09] Okay, okay.

[06:10] Yeah, please leave us a five star review wherever you found us.

[06:13] It helps the algorithm push us up to the top to help others find us.

[06:18] Silverball Chronicles can also be found at facebook.com slash silverball Chronicles.

[06:24] And you can grab a t-shirt alone over at silverballswag.com.

[06:28] You can choose from a couple of different design choices.

[06:31] Hoodies, mugs and stickers.

[06:33] You're a big hoodie guy, Rod.

[06:35] I see you wearing hoodies all the time.

[06:37] Really? I never wear hoodies.

[06:41] Thanks, sir. Thanks for supporting the show.

[06:45] I love sweaters, but I don't like the hood in the back.

[06:48] Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com is where you can get a hold of us for corrections, comments, anything you want to get.

[06:55] There's a couple of pretty good comments, a couple of good emails in here as well.

[07:01] So we want to thank everybody for that.

[07:03] Couple of controversies last month by trying to avoid the whole Taiwan and the two China's conversation.

[07:10] I stepped in it.

[07:11] So I've added a note as well as if you don't know what we're talking about.

[07:15] Just throw it into the Google.

[07:16] Yeah, you told me to do that one, bro.

[07:18] Mike from home pin.

[07:20] He did.

[07:21] He actually emailed us.

[07:22] And he didn't hate us.

[07:23] So I think we won.

[07:25] Tip of that.

[07:26] Do you want to jump in here, Ron, and read a couple of things?

[07:29] Sure.

[07:30] I've condensed the email.

[07:31] I've taken a few pieces out that I thought were particularly relevant because I didn't want to read the whole thing out.

[07:36] So I've kind of picked and I've chosen and I've misaged it a bit just to make it a little more condensed.

[07:45] And of course, I added a nice part here from the email to feed our ego.

[07:50] Mike said there are a couple of small things that I would like to clarify and or correct if I may.

[07:55] Okay.

[07:56] The Blues Brothers machine you played that had the continuous ball save.

[08:00] This was at Texas Finball Festival was a very early prototype.

[08:04] In fact, probably one of the first batch of 10 we made, especially for our best agents to get them out there.

[08:12] Dick was very quick and he means Dick Hamill is the programmer was very quick to correct it all for us.

[08:18] This problem actually turned out to be a combination of hardware and software that caused this so it was a little tricky to pin down.

[08:25] Now I've heard that they are re-manufacturing some boards to send out to correct that issue because it's a mixture of software and hardware.

[08:34] So that's likely why the one that you played was still not quite up to date.

[08:40] So we'll take it on the chin for that one.

[08:43] It was very respectful.

[08:44] Now this is my favorite part.

[08:46] Yes, as far from hating Americans I get along fine with most.

[08:51] Just not the dickheads who seemed so prevalent on Pinside.

[08:55] What a complete cesspit that place is.

[08:57] Mostly under unmotorated mess.

[09:01] I'm glad to be well shot of the place.

[09:04] Oh, that's gonna be an Australian, Australianism well shot of the place.

[09:09] I gotta remember that one.

[09:11] I liked it.

[09:13] Good, it classes us up.

[09:14] You also said you didn't mention it at the machine.

[09:16] Actually ships with three licensed blues brother songs.

[09:19] Can you name them?

[09:20] Yeah, no.

[09:21] Oh, it was one of them.

[09:22] One was Shake Your Tail Feather.

[09:25] Oh, good one.

[09:26] Yeah, and there was two other ones.

[09:27] I can't remember what they were.

[09:29] They started to remember one of them.

[09:31] Yeah, so here's something neat about the move to Taiwan specifically.

[09:36] It says, I downsize drastically when we move to Taiwan.

[09:41] So we just don't have the same staff level or space that we did in China.

[09:46] In fact, the factory is one quarter the size of our place in China.

[09:51] Sales are strong and we are still backlogged heavily at the moment.

[09:56] I would like to address the comments about Taiwan.

[09:59] Taiwan is a free and independent country and has never been part of the CCP,

[10:04] the Chinese Communist Party, or today's mainland China.

[10:10] That is not what the CCP wants the world to believe, of course,

[10:14] as they falsely claim Taiwan to be part of a renegade province of China.

[10:19] Living and working in Taiwan is a breath of fresh air compared to China

[10:24] and actually even Australia.

[10:27] Oh, burn!

[10:29] I've never lived in any other place so I have no...

[10:32] I can't really say anything.

[10:34] A whole two China's thing.

[10:36] Probably going to step in and again here but just throw it into your Google machine

[10:40] and read about the two China's.

[10:42] And you can see the controversy there.

[10:46] Ignorant Canadian, typical.

[10:48] Anything else we want to talk about there?

[10:51] No, no, no, no.

[10:52] We're going to talk about this one there, yeah.

[10:54] Oh, of course.

[10:55] Our latest and greatest sponsor is Flippin' Out Pinball.

[11:00] You can check them out at flippin'outpinball.com.

[11:03] You're a big proponent of flippin'outpinball, is that correct?

[11:07] Yes.

[11:08] We were talking, I don't know, a couple of months ago, I was like,

[11:11] I got to get these arcade machines down into my basement.

[11:14] And I said it was very much like dreading that whole situation.

[11:19] So I did the thing, right?

[11:21] We're on the bottom, I put the cardboard and I ratchet, strapped it to my James Bond, right?

[11:28] And then I laid it down kind of flat and let it slide slowly down the stairs.

[11:36] Have you ever done that?

[11:37] No.

[11:38] Why don't you do that?

[11:39] So you do it, you slide it down, then when it gets to the bottom,

[11:41] you just lift it back up again and put it on a little cart.

[11:43] I did it all by myself.

[11:45] I used the stair climbing hand truck.

[11:49] The Escaler, which you can also get at flippin'out?

[11:53] I look like an idiot doing this all by myself, carrying this thing down there.

[11:57] You just have to reach out to Ken or Greg at Flip the letter N out pinball.

[12:04] And they will set you up with something so you don't look like an idiot,

[12:08] you don't throw your back out, very, very good.

[12:11] Oh, speaking of Ken and Greg at Flip and Out pinball, have you heard their new podcast?

[12:17] Yes, I have.

[12:18] It's really good.

[12:19] It's not like, it's like one of those like chit chat podcasts

[12:23] as opposed to like what's going on in the industry stuff that usually get on the pinball show.

[12:28] This is very, very good.

[12:30] Well worth the listen.

[12:31] I don't really like Greg.

[12:33] Him and I have had some serious issues in the past.

[12:35] You have a lot of issues with people.

[12:38] I have a lot of enemies with very good looking people in pinball.

[12:42] If you're a very good looking person in pinball, you and I got heat.

[12:46] And I put Greg at the top of that list.

[12:48] However, podcast is really good and Greg will help you out in any way.

[12:52] If you order your pinball machines from Flip and Out pinball.

[12:59] Pinball has had a dramatic change since the end of the modern DMD era at Stern.

[13:06] The names we all knew and loved from the 80s and 90s have all begun to retire, slow down or leave the industry.

[13:14] A new wave of designers has had to come in to breathe fresh air

[13:19] and to continue the love of the hobby and learn from the masters of the past.

[13:25] The first major new designer to come along was the tournament player Keith Ellwyn.

[13:31] Some say Keith is the second coming of our Lord and Savior Steve Richie.

[13:37] Others say in Ellwyn we trust.

[13:41] But is this all hyperbole?

[13:43] Has Keith Ellwyn actually changed pinball design?

[13:48] Are we looking at a new era or just another designer?

[13:53] Join us this month as we talk about the second coming of the golden age of pinball with the season vet Keith Ellwyn.

[14:01] So what are your first thoughts right out of the gate when I say Keith Ellwyn?

[14:06] Until he started designing it was pinball world champion.

[14:09] So somebody's like somebody sitting around, you're at a you know a fantastic or something like 12 years ago.

[14:16] And somebody's like, yeah, he had a Keith Ellwyn.

[14:19] My first expo in 2004, the tournament came back then the tournament at expo was whatever the new game that was out.

[14:28] That's turn head out which at which at the time was Elvis.

[14:33] So they had a big role of Elvis's and I see these players and there's this one guy Keith Ellwyn.

[14:39] And I heard someone like that's that's Keith Ellwyn. He's like the best player.

[14:43] He's the best player in the world. So I watched him. It's sure enough by the end of the tournament.

[14:47] Guess who won the tournament and got an Elvis. Keith Ellwyn.

[14:50] And then the next year it was Pirates of the Caribbean and guess who won the tournament and got a Pirates of the Caribbean.

[14:55] And to be Keith Ellwyn.

[14:56] I mean the joke back in the day when I joined the hobby was Raymond Davidson kept winning WWE L.E.

[15:02] And he just had a pile of these in a container somewhere.

[15:06] So before him was very much Keith Ellwyn then.

[15:09] Keith grew up in Carl's Bad California where he spent much of his childhood playing pinball machines at a local pizza parlor and a 7-11.

[15:19] He started taking the game seriously at around age 12. Eventually becoming a competitive player, then an operator and a technician and of course the designer we all know today.

[15:31] When did you start taking pinball seriously?

[15:36] Well you define seriously. To me it's always been a hobby. I've never done it for a living so I can't really take it seriously.

[15:43] So in the podcast that I have pulled this from and you can see them in the show notes that I talk about.

[15:49] I reference head to head pinball podcasts. Some of the earlier of those there's an article in the canetticist.

[15:58] Just another pinball podcast. There's a good flipping out pinball podcast. All of that information they're very much talking about.

[16:08] This kind of the idea of taking it seriously. He took it seriously all of a sudden.

[16:15] And like I've run like with you this pinball podcast you're on two pinball podcasts. You play a lot of competitive pinball.

[16:22] It's part of your vacation time and stuff like that. Like some would say you take it seriously. So if we are serious, what kind of serious is Keith Elwin at 12?

[16:33] It's pretty serious.

[16:35] I would think he would take it serious when he's an operator and he has to make money from it.

[16:39] Operating and maintaining pinball machines. It sounds like a lot of fun. Doesn't it operating pinball machines? But then it comes with the maintaining part.

[16:47] That's the crappy part is this stuff breaks. You always got to monitor it. You know quarters get stuck in the slots like all that seems like the pain in the butt.

[16:57] So when you're maintaining and operating machines across San Diego and Los Angeles, which of course includes like placement.

[17:06] You got to get the thing up and down stairs and things you got to repair things. There's the daily upkeep.

[17:11] This is a huge deal that I don't think people understand because this very much sharpened Keith's mechanical understanding and know how of how things work on location, how things break and how to design things in a solid manner.

[17:30] Doesn't that make sense? It makes perfect sense. I mean, if you're a person that just plays pinball, you don't ever think about, oh, what if I have to take the DB five vertical up kicker off and clean underneath or get a coil or something stuck.

[17:44] And it becomes this god awful mess to try to take it off. No, no, not Keith Elwin, not George Gomez. They understand I need two screws and this thing's got to come off and it's going to be heaven.

[17:55] And I think that really helps Keith in the future. Well, Keith says Milo for the game really grew in addition to operating and doing tech work around Carl's bad.

[18:05] It was less of a job, less of work and more of a training ground for what would eventually bubble to the top for Keith.

[18:15] But while he's building and maintaining these this empire over in California, he's also playing competitively all across the country.

[18:25] Keith dominated competitive play for well over a decade, earning the nickname the one. If you ever called Keith the one, I have not called him the one, but yes, you have heard that.

[18:37] My podcast made Bruce calls him the one all the time. Yeah, and the gag is that he is like Neo, right? Like he can see things in the matrix better than everyone else.

[18:50] Before the major existed. So he is in the IFPA, which is the official ranking, whenever of pinball. He everyone has a player number. And it's usually whenever you join the IFPA.

[19:04] Yeah, I'm like 10,000, like 365 because I'm old. But Keith is player one. What? Because when they originally did the rankings, the numbers, it was whatever you were ranked at at the time they came up with. And he was number one. So he will always be player one.

[19:22] That's pretty awesome. So when I go to a tournament and I got to give them my IFPA number, whatever when I fill out my card, it's always like, oh God, and I got to look it up.

[19:30] Yeah, five figures. That's got to be a pain. I'm pretty sure it's five. It's either 8,000 or 10,000. Because I remember last time I looked it up. I'm like, geez, that's a really big number.

[19:41] Now he is a multi time world champion and clearly a staple of IFPA leaderboards where like even today he's he's like huge on these lists. Is that right?

[19:54] He doesn't play that much anymore. But when he doesn't play much, but when he does, he usually reaches quarter final semi final somehow. Yeah.

[20:03] So he is a six time Papa world champion. He is just skill is unparalleled and his competition successes is wild. He has this weird, deep understanding of like ball physics.

[20:17] Like, and it's almost a second nature or muscle memory. He understands play field flow almost on a like a granular level. It's really weird when you watch him on a stream play. Like he's just he's dialed in.

[20:32] He's not panicked. He's not emotional. He's not he just kind of is there. He's very zen like how would you describe his playing style more intense than it appears.

[20:44] Because everyone's like he's super calm. He's no, I've been next to him playing and I could hear him talking to himself in a derogatory matter.

[20:55] Like hit the hit the track. Well, I can't I'm not going to swear here, but you know, you get the idea hit the track. Come on. So you don't see. So he's he's in he's in there. He's in there. They named terms after him like the Ellen.

[21:07] The Ellen is when you have four balls trapped to on each flip. So he is like he is the one. Is that fair to say he was the one now all the kids have come in and taken over.

[21:17] Yeah. So consistently ranked number one. Yes. He won he won pop us. He won pinbergs and pinberg being back in the day was was a huge huge.

[21:27] A thousand people. Yeah. His analytical play, I think, is the most interesting thing. You can see in his head kind of the math calculations of following.

[21:38] So this is the thing that I can't do. When I'm playing pinball, I'm focused on trying to keep it like nudging it out of the out lanes. That's like the biggest thing that I'm focused on, right? And trying to hit a shot.

[21:51] And then there's like this next level that you probably know.

[21:56] The high level tournament players, I these these guys like key figured out on like creature from the black lagoon. There's there's some weird way.

[22:07] It works. We're a multiplier increases by so much, but he figured out exactly what bug or something made it work the way it did. So he could exploit it. Like my mind just doesn't.

[22:19] I would never I would never be able to do anything like that. I'm just like. Yeah. That's the high level where he's able to think like a chess player so many steps. I'm like, can I light a spinner and hit it a lot?

[22:31] Right. But your thing is your thing is I can light a spinner and hit it a lot, but you're focused more on that strategy as opposed to just trying to survive.

[22:40] Where I'm like, just keep the ball and play, shoot the ramp, get the blinking light. And I'm not a terrible player. Right?

[22:48] You know, so it's it's funny to see these different like levels of of knowledge and understanding. Now Keith for the fun of it started to kind of design his own pinball machine.

[23:00] And he started to build a custom home brew named after the intellectual property of Archer, the television show.

[23:09] And it started to impress some industry insiders. Yes. So let's let's take a look at it. Before we talk about that, I could also mention.

[23:18] He did a couple of pinball instructional videos. Also pinball 101 and pinball 102.

[23:26] Yeah, he was like the first Patreon guy. Well, I don't know what is the major, but I have them. And they are they are very helpful and entertaining.

[23:35] They were not just and he did some and he does animation. I know only people know that like he does the animation that's in the videos.

[23:45] He had like a he had I'm trying to remember the name of the character. It wasn't Tommy. It was some other kid who like he watches the videos and becomes a pinball wizard.

[23:55] Okay, I recommend them. They're out there. So our pinball 101 and 102 everyone forgets about that. He did that before before he started the design stuff.

[24:04] Yeah, it was sort of like how can I how can I monetize my skills? Well, I can tell people how to like, you know, if you shoot the ball further down the flipper, you shoot this part of the play.

[24:14] Make quick flip.

[24:16] Make quick flip.

[24:17] You're not hold the flipper up. Yeah. Oh, that's yeah.

[24:20] You know what really you know it really opened pinball for me. The one thing that like was like the ultimate epiphany.

[24:28] And I think this is probably one of the first things that most people learn. But for me to this day, I'm still like, oh man.

[24:33] If only I had figured that out sooner was the dead flip where the ball just bounces on the flipper and then you catch it.

[24:42] That was the other. That was like game.

[24:44] The most important skill, according to his video. Fire. Remember was that. I remember the first time I saw someone do that at expo on Adam's family.

[24:52] Ball just comes down. He just lets it hit the one flipper and bounce to the other and my mind was blown.

[24:57] Like, why didn't he flip? He didn't flip. What was that?

[25:01] It's like when kids learn to not double flip. Like that's like a big skill to learn.

[25:07] I mean, to en mash in the that you know, but the the archer game.

[25:12] I think all of us in the community were kind of watching that because he had his YouTube channel.

[25:19] He would post updates for archer and you'd have gameplay on there and we kind of saw it develop over time.

[25:27] And he had stuff in there that end up not being in Iron Maiden, which we'll talk about.

[25:32] But he had like a very target in there.

[25:34] If you go over to and it's tough to kind of find stuff for archer. I mean, you can find it like, but it's an effort.

[25:43] The easiest place to go is to go to pin side and then you can kind of go to like Keith L.

[25:49] When you can look up Keith L. When and then scroll to the bottom and you find archer.

[25:53] And there are a couple of photos there of this prototype archer.

[25:57] When you look at this thing immediately, you say, oh, it's Iron Maiden.

[26:00] Yeah, I played it.

[26:01] But it's but it's not Iron Maiden. There's a lot of significant things.

[26:04] I believe you brought that to show this after Iron Maiden was out.

[26:07] Super cool. It's a very cool looking pin.

[26:10] And here's the thing. Okay. Back when he was doing this.

[26:14] And this was what 2000 like 10 design.

[26:18] I think his brother Randy did the code.

[26:21] Yeah. And this was I want to say it was like 20 like 12 20.

[26:25] It was like the early 2010s. I can't recall. I apologize.

[26:28] There's no like there's no community support to be able to sort of build your own pinball machine.

[26:37] Right? Like there probably was, but it's probably much smaller than it is.

[26:41] But that's like you can't just go and buy a P3 rock board.

[26:45] Yeah, I don't remember what any of this ran on. I think it's just a PC in there.

[26:48] So we're talking a whole other, a whole other adventure here when it comes to, you know, doing that.

[26:55] And then nowadays it's a lot easier to go to like a local woodworking community

[27:01] where they have like a CNC machine that you can borrow for a couple of hours.

[27:06] The effort that I think it took Keith and his brother just to get started, I think was it was a big, big deal.

[27:14] I think that is what really sort of started to impress those within the pinball industry was, hey, here's a guy that's coming up with some great ideas.

[27:25] And eventually he would be considered the most consistent and celebrated modern pinball designer.

[27:30] But why did Keith decide, you know, competitive pinballs, okay, but I want to try home brew.

[27:36] I mean, he wanted to build a game. He spent all this time working on him and playing him. Why not build one?

[27:42] Yeah, it seems like the next kind of logical step.

[27:45] If we wind it back, it was the last generation of sort of pinball designers that all just kind of started building their own pinball machines at home.

[27:56] And then they would present those to the industry leaders at the time at Williams.

[28:02] And they would, you know, they would try to kind of audition for a job.

[28:06] I don't know if that was exactly Keith's end solution was to get a job at Stern.

[28:11] However, I think it was inevitable when you start playing with pinball design.

[28:17] What does Keith say?

[28:19] Oh, sorry, I'm on YouTube right now trying to find his channel.

[28:22] I think it's actually pinball 101 is where he has his videos.

[28:27] I thought you had to buy them.

[28:29] I think, yeah, I think you still can, but I don't know. He doesn't have the whole pinball 101 out there, but I'm trying to find like the archer videos and stuff.

[28:36] It's just where he would have things like he would do like straight dude overhead shot of the game and do like a walkthrough of stuff like Ripley's Believe it or not.

[28:47] Like, you know, if you want to see a 40 minute game or at least believe it or not.

[28:51] Cool.

[28:52] Keith said it made sense to try and make something new.

[28:55] I was already thinking about layout ideas.

[28:57] I wasn't planning on working in the industry.

[29:00] It kind of just happened after archer.

[29:02] It was a passion project, but it would actually end up being more of a proof of concept.

[29:06] The thing with the animated show.

[29:08] Have you seen archer?

[29:09] I've seen parts of archer.

[29:10] I enjoy archer.

[29:12] It was never...

[29:14] I'm a guy. I love James Bond.

[29:16] I love spy stuff.

[29:18] I love spoof.

[29:19] I love all that stuff.

[29:21] I really liked archer, but it didn't like suck me in.

[29:24] Some people it was really like.

[29:26] Some people were like, this is one of the best shows of all time.

[29:29] It was good.

[29:30] I enjoyed it.

[29:31] But it never really was like the craziest thing.

[29:34] Keith really liked the art style.

[29:37] He also said that he liked the spy theme and of course comedy.

[29:42] So Stern noticed archer and George invited Keith for a visit to Stern.

[29:49] I think George specifically noticed archer.

[29:52] Because I think around this time, let's call it 2013, 2012,

[29:58] it's very obvious the industry is starting to kind of go through a bit of a change.

[30:03] The other thing is a lot of these designers that we all know and love are like 60, 62.

[30:11] They're getting up there.

[30:13] So they're looking at like 10 more years and it's like, oh, you know, now I'm 72.

[30:18] It takes a long time to get up to speed when you're bringing in a new crew.

[30:23] And almost everybody in that era was an old Williams or Balli designers.

[30:30] Or Tady.

[30:32] Yes, they've been around for a while.

[30:34] Yeah, there's like John Borg's like the youngest guy and he's in his mid 50s, right?

[30:40] At that time.

[30:41] Yeah, I don't know how old he is, but yeah.

[30:43] So it's like he's like the young kid on the block and he's been designing for like 30 years.

[30:49] So we need to get some new blood in there.

[30:52] And I think George correctly, you know, George being the architect, right?

[30:56] He just, he's a genius in my opinion.

[30:59] He knows we need to start bringing in some new blood and you know what?

[31:03] He's keeping his eye out and boy oh boy, was he impressed by Keith Lwynn?

[31:08] Keith, of course, initially hesitant to go into designing, but was pretty excited and eventually accepted the offer to take Archer and turn it into a Stern cornerstone pinball machine.

[31:22] Keith says, I chatted with George about Archer.

[31:24] He gave me some feedback and then Stern flew me out to visit.

[31:28] I thought, yeah, let's do this.

[31:30] Let's go all in.

[31:31] Right.

[31:32] We went over to Harry Carey's stake house and I was body.

[31:34] This, as soon as he was hired, we all knew it was going to be Archer, at least the play field, because he immediately pulled, as you can see, because you can't find them.

[31:42] He pulled all of the videos he had for Archer from his YouTube channel.

[31:46] They immediately just, and I don't think they've been back since then.

[31:50] So we knew, we knew the play field was going to look like.

[31:55] So when you hear, when you hear, hey, Stern just picked up Keith Lwynn.

[31:59] What, what's the tournament community think?

[32:01] Are they all like, yes, he's gone.

[32:03] No, not like that, but they're thinking like, yes, maybe we can get some new designs.

[32:08] So like the quirky pinball designer was John Trudeau, right?

[32:11] Like he had the weird designs.

[32:13] That was his gimmick.

[32:15] That was his gimmick.

[32:16] There was the flow and speed guy, which was Steve Richie.

[32:20] That was his thing.

[32:22] You know, some of the J.J.P. crew is coming together.

[32:26] You got the King of Clunk Joe Ballsir.

[32:28] Pat Lawler's back.

[32:29] The incredible dialed in, yes.

[32:31] Right. So he's all about kind of max and a little more stop and go mixed with flow.

[32:38] So what kind of excitement are we looking forward to here with Keith Lwynn?

[32:45] A guy that's never done a game.

[32:47] So he's not going to be repeating himself over and over.

[32:51] There's some danger in that, right?

[32:53] The danger is that he hasn't sort of learned the, you know, the do's and don'ts or the,

[32:58] oh, you never put a target there because, you know, this reason that's just inherent in a lot of those designers.

[33:05] But I think his combination of operation, operating machines, his tech work and his tournament play

[33:13] gave him this holistic view of pinball machines that I don't even think the previous generation had.

[33:19] So the previous generation grew up with electro mechanical and, you know, the birth of maybe like high speed

[33:26] in those kind of early pinball machines, they didn't grow up with a modern DMD games and deeper code and stuff.

[33:35] How do machines behave?

[33:37] How does the play field interact with the code and what breaks and what engages players?

[33:42] I think Keith had a leg up in that.

[33:44] I would say he was the best player to become a designer.

[33:48] Let's just say that.

[33:49] There have been great players who were coders.

[33:52] Keith was the first, I would say, you know, world class player that was a designer at a pinball.

[33:59] And well rounded too, right?

[34:01] Like he operated, he fixed his own machines.

[34:05] He did all.

[34:06] He ran his own business and he played high level.

[34:09] Like he's got this weird kind of rounded vision where when you look at somebody like a, like a Keith Johnson,

[34:15] Keith Johnson's kind of, you know, a computer nerdy kind of guy in a top player.

[34:20] Don't forget.

[34:21] Don't forget that.

[34:22] Well, yeah, exactly.

[34:23] But the thing is his knee, his knee sure high understanding is code and how things interact and things like that.

[34:30] And then he kind of moved over into pinball and then he was a high level player and a big winner in his own right.

[34:39] But I don't know if he had that breadth of knowledge that somebody like a Keith L. went ahead.

[34:43] So Archer becomes Iron Maiden legacy of the beast.

[34:48] And this is released in 2018.

[34:52] And a little, a little trivia for you.

[34:54] So when John Trudeau had his incident when he was fired left, sir, Keith got his office.

[35:03] I'm sure he cleaned it thoroughly.

[35:06] Iron Maiden.

[35:07] So I joined the hobby in the fall of 2018.

[35:12] Iron Maiden is released in the beginning of 2018.

[35:17] There was some initial disappointment in the theme.

[35:22] Is that correct?

[35:23] Not from my end.

[35:24] You got to remember, for my end, I hang out with a lot of the Orange County guys, you know, rock fantasy, that area.

[35:32] And Iron Maiden was like, this is the theme.

[35:35] Like holy crap.

[35:37] Oh my god.

[35:38] I think rock fantasy had, they had a pro and an Ellie.

[35:43] They had multiple Iron Maiden.

[35:45] Wow.

[35:46] So Iron Maiden, the heavy metal band from sort of 19 late 70s through the mid 80s, right?

[35:55] No, no, into the early 90s, probably.

[35:57] They're a significant era, I would say.

[36:00] I mean, they're still together.

[36:01] They are like what the grandfathers of metal.

[36:04] They inspired the likes of...

[36:07] Well, I would say blacks have it through the grandfathers of metal.

[36:10] They are, they made their way through live shows.

[36:14] There were a lot, there's concerts, because they got almost no radio play.

[36:18] Okay.

[36:19] Yeah, because they were two skits or metal.

[36:21] They never really get any radio play a pop radio.

[36:24] They talked about the number of the beast being their largest, you know, one of their largest sellers.

[36:30] And, ooh, you'd Ostatin and Oscarace.

[36:32] Probably one of your just harder working bands as far as just the amount of concerts they played, the amount of tours they were on.

[36:39] They would go on to influence, like Metallica and kind of all those big bands.

[36:45] And their live shows with the big Eddie and all this.

[36:48] Eddie, can you explain what Eddie is?

[36:50] He is their mascot.

[36:51] It's like this Dead Zombie thing, right?

[36:53] So that's their thing, is that they have this Eddie thing.

[36:58] He's on their plane.

[36:59] I think their plane is like Eddie one or something like that.

[37:02] Like, no, Air Force One, Eddie Force One, something like that.

[37:06] Iron Maiden was big and huge and whatever.

[37:08] But they've had a very much like this odd resurgence.

[37:11] I was never an Iron Maiden fan when I was in high school.

[37:15] I much preferred kind of that, you know, radio head kind of new stuff that kind of came along.

[37:23] I enjoyed Iron Maiden.

[37:25] They've had a resurgence recently where what is old is new again.

[37:29] And I would say very cool nowadays, very much like Iron Maiden.

[37:35] This machine is designed by Keith L.

[37:38] It has the artwork by Jeremy Packer, zombie Eddie.

[37:42] And this is what his follow up game to Ghostbusters.

[37:45] Is that correct?

[37:46] Deadpool might have been before this.

[37:49] I'm trying to remember.

[37:50] No, Deadpool was in the fall.

[37:51] The program by Rick Nagle and Mike.

[37:55] Kisovat.

[37:56] Kisovat.

[37:57] Kisovat.

[37:58] Mechanics by Harrison Drake.

[38:00] He's the engineer.

[38:02] Jerry Thompson, our buddy Jerry over there on Sound call outs by Brandon Small and the British lady.

[38:09] Whose name escapes me?

[38:10] The British lady.

[38:11] Yes.

[38:12] If you have a lady in your game, she must be British.

[38:13] Those are the rules.

[38:14] The thing we should talk about when Ellen started wasn't just him that was new.

[38:18] The new he has the team.

[38:20] And typically at Stern, they didn't have the same teams going, you know, to do multiple games.

[38:28] They would move them around.

[38:30] Yeah, you don't want the same feeling every time, right?

[38:34] Since Ellen started, he has had the same team, which is basically him, Rick Nagle and Harrison Drake.

[38:42] It's like the three of them.

[38:43] I've been like, I've done all these games we're about to go through.

[38:46] And zombie Eddie's done art.

[38:47] Like, yeah, many of them.

[38:49] All but like two, maybe.

[38:51] But it's like when they talk about the Ellen team, that's what they're talking about.

[38:54] And that's unusual, right?

[38:56] You don't want things to get stale.

[38:58] Usually you're switching up the programmer.

[39:22] But then again, if it's working, why would you do that?

[39:26] See, that's my thought about that.

[39:28] Steve Richie has always said there's only one dad.

[39:31] There's only one pinball dad when you're playing pinball or when you're building a pinball machine.

[39:36] And that's like the designer project manager, right?

[39:39] So you're not only just designing a play field, which seems like fun.

[39:44] But you're managing the budget.

[39:45] You're managing some supply chain stuff.

[39:48] You're managing the programmer.

[39:50] You're giving the programmer guidance as to how you think the play field should be leveraged.

[39:55] It should be leveraged with the code.

[39:58] You're managing the mechanics and what works and what's fun and what's easily designable.

[40:04] Like you're not just designing a play field, which I think some designers struggle with.

[40:10] But this was Keith.

[40:13] I would say on top of that pyramid has really shown.

[40:18] And especially right out of the gate with Iron Maiden, that he's able to manage a lot of those moving pieces.

[40:23] Was it pretty obvious when it sort of came out right away that you're like,

[40:28] aha, we were right.

[40:30] It is arch.

[40:31] Well, yeah, that's that too.

[40:33] Maybe we all knew it was going to be the play field.

[40:35] We also knew it wasn't going to be archer.

[40:37] Right.

[40:38] Yeah, exactly.

[40:39] And there's some cool themes about this that he kept from the original Arthur archer layout.

[40:45] But he did make some significant changes as well.

[40:47] There was like an up and down ramp, I think on the left side through the shop.

[40:51] Very target was removed.

[40:53] Most of that was for service ability.

[40:54] There was a subway originally that came up from the scoop on the left side.

[40:58] So there's been some changes and a lot of that probably has to do with build of materials, service ability, and flow in general.

[41:05] And yeah, whether it worked or not.

[41:07] Yeah, exactly.

[41:08] And I think Iron Maiden really emphasizes like loops.

[41:12] So there's two loops in there that you're always kind of you're able to loop a lot, which is a lot of fun.

[41:20] Combo chaining.

[41:22] So shooting a ramp and then another ramp and then a loop and then a scoop and then a corner like it's.

[41:27] It's designed to not just be like shoot the ramp and then shoot the target and then shoot the target and shoot.

[41:33] It's made to be flowing and constantly being chained together.

[41:37] And it really rewards skillful control.

[41:41] Do you have skillful control, Ron?

[41:44] I try to, but it doesn't always work out.

[41:46] So you're able to kind of keep the ball going like what two or three combos, four combos maybe.

[41:53] I wish.

[41:54] I've been, my accuracy has been going in the toilet.

[41:58] But usually with loop shots, that's more timing than actual accuracy.

[42:02] So if I can get into a good flow, you can still loop a bunch of stuff.

[42:05] I just, I get addicted to looping on that game and then it kills me.

[42:09] Exactly.

[42:10] Because I'm draining myself, but it's totally worth it.

[42:13] So what does Keith say?

[42:14] Keith says I wanted to make something that rewarded shot accuracy and gave players choices.

[42:20] It's all about the choices.

[42:23] Yeah, you can play, you can go down different paths.

[42:27] So one thing that I think is really unique about the way that Iron Maiden came together is its play field clarity and rules.

[42:36] It's very obvious of what to do.

[42:39] But then there's like this extra level.

[42:42] There's these extra levels of that skillful players can go after.

[42:47] So it's not just trying to get so many loops.

[42:50] It's like, oh, now I've got super loops.

[42:53] And my score goes up.

[42:55] And then, oh, now I've got ramps and ramp modes.

[42:58] And now I'm into a mode.

[43:00] And then, oh, if I bring in like this drop target thing into something out,

[43:06] like it's really cool the way that it all kind of melds together.

[43:10] Yeah.

[43:11] Ellen has this thing that he likes.

[43:14] And this game, like modes.

[43:17] A lot of your modern games, they have like 10 modes, 15 modes.

[43:20] They have tons of modes.

[43:22] Ellen's idea was, why don't you have less modes?

[43:25] And just have them be more memorable.

[43:27] Do five modes, six modes.

[43:29] Don't do like 10 or 15.

[43:32] That was really, that was really Keith Johnson's thing was,

[43:37] let's have a dozen different modes that do different things.

[43:40] His other thing was have some kind of thing that builds throughout the game that you can get to.

[43:45] And that in the case of Iron Man, it's all the power features.

[43:47] You know, the power ramps, power loops, power this power that it leads you to the,

[43:53] what's the multi-boi cyborg?

[43:56] That's how you get to cyborg.

[43:57] Yeah.

[43:58] So then you're even rewarded at the end of that path.

[44:00] When I played, which is really cool, Iron Man, it felt to me like this,

[44:04] this is what Williams would have made.

[44:06] Had they still existed?

[44:08] Oh, honestly, because the callouts were really good.

[44:11] There was only two voices, which I like.

[44:14] I'm sick and it gives it like 10 different people doing callouts.

[44:17] Just give me one or two that are really good.

[44:20] And I'm fine.

[44:21] So the first time I played in Iron Maiden, I was buying a pinball machine from somebody,

[44:27] kind of in the random rural Canada.

[44:31] Raven?

[44:32] No, it wasn't Raven.

[44:34] Oh.

[44:35] It was xenon.

[44:36] Oh.

[44:37] So I'm driving out to this place and he's like, oh, we're going to go to my brother's place.

[44:40] I'm like, okay, so we zip over to his brother's place.

[44:42] I'm like, you know, I'm like, I hope I didn't get murdered.

[44:45] So we go over to his brother's place.

[44:46] And in there is a brand new LE Iron Maiden.

[44:50] And of course the game had been out for, I don't know what, four months, six months,

[44:55] or something at that point.

[44:56] And I'm like, what?

[44:58] And I played that game and I immediately felt like a superstar.

[45:04] And I think that's why this game achieved so much so quickly.

[45:09] Because somebody who hadn't played pinball very much could keep the ball alive and felt

[45:14] like they were accomplishing things really quickly, even though I was doing almost nothing.

[45:21] Right?

[45:22] And I was like, oh, I can shoot up the middle on this ramp.

[45:26] I can, oh, I can shoot the loops a couple of times.

[45:29] I can shoot that spinner very easily.

[45:31] Right?

[45:32] It was like, ah, this is exciting.

[45:35] And I think that that was one of the big pieces of it.

[45:38] Is it felt like a big deal?

[45:41] Some people had some commentary about the animations.

[45:43] They didn't like the animations because it was used from like a mobile game or something.

[45:47] They're fine.

[45:49] They were, I think they're great.

[45:50] They're fine.

[45:51] I have no issues with them.

[45:53] Okay.

[45:54] So you look at the premium.

[45:56] I'm sorry, if you look at the pro, the pro is like an eclectic group of a bunch of the

[46:02] different eddies.

[46:03] Right?

[46:04] You got like a zombie eddie.

[46:05] You got like a cyborg eddie.

[46:08] You've got the revolutionary kind of soldier eddie.

[46:12] They're all kind of in there.

[46:14] The premium.

[46:15] Oh, that's the Egyptian theme.

[46:18] It's the art package, right?

[46:19] And that's from the power slave.

[46:23] Was that the other?

[46:24] I think that's the one with this all Egyptian.

[46:26] Awesome.

[46:27] It's so cool.

[46:29] I love that art package.

[46:31] The premium is very, very cool.

[46:34] And then the LEDs got that sort of war theme.

[46:37] This game looks great.

[46:40] Sounds great.

[46:41] Plays great.

[46:43] Like did Keith L. Wynne just kill it on his first game?

[46:48] He did.

[46:49] And he showed his love for Congo, which we'll see.

[46:52] We'll see.

[46:53] We'll see come up a couple more times.

[46:55] So explain that.

[46:56] So, so Keith took this design and he played homage to a couple of other designs.

[47:03] Is that right?

[47:04] Well, he, I believe in an interview he stated, the left ramp on Iron Maiden goes through the

[47:08] pops and goes up.

[47:10] That's kind of his version of the Congo volcano ramp on the right, which was on the right

[47:16] side of Congo.

[47:17] Yeah, of Congo.

[47:18] Yeah.

[47:19] And we'll see more Congo later.

[47:21] So he really had a really cool thing.

[47:23] The thing is he's got four flippers.

[47:25] He's got two at the bottom, one on the right.

[47:26] And then a mini flipper kind of up on the top left that shoots another small one.

[47:32] Four flippers.

[47:33] That was.

[47:34] Stern wasn't making games with four flippers.

[47:36] But they were making games with three pop bumpers.

[47:38] He had to have three pop bumpers.

[47:39] He saw the three pop bumpers.

[47:41] He's got three drop targets that are in this sort of the center, kind of almost sweepable.

[47:46] But not quite.

[47:47] Oh, they're 100% sweepable.

[47:48] Are they?

[47:49] I always have a hard time getting them.

[47:52] And I think if you sweep them, if you sweep them, it gives you like two completions or

[47:56] something.

[47:57] There's like an award for sweeping them.

[47:58] Oh, yeah.

[47:59] So there's like the scoop on archer on the left side is sort of replaced with a clairvoyant

[48:05] mystery orb stand up target, which I think was a smart decision.

[48:10] Oh, but definitely on the pro because I can tell you having a premium myself, the orb

[48:14] doesn't always register and you have to screw with it.

[48:18] Oh, bummer.

[48:19] There's a couple.

[48:20] I think there's two orbs in the premium.

[48:21] So what does Jeremy Packer say about Keith?

[48:24] I says Keith is great.

[48:25] He's quiet, but when he is a vision, you see it fast.

[48:28] And would you say that the vision of this game was fully completed?

[48:32] I say so.

[48:33] Yeah.

[48:34] You know what?

[48:35] The only thing that I think would make this game better is a magnet on the backboard.

[48:39] Oh, what to suck the ball in.

[48:41] So like, like Lord of the Rings tight.

[48:44] The middle ramp.

[48:45] Yeah.

[48:46] Not suck it in.

[48:47] Just when it goes up that it sticks to the back panel under the Egyptian Eddie.

[48:51] That's the other thing we didn't mention to target you hitting the back is like a special

[48:55] target.

[48:56] It's supposed to it's able to detect a closure.

[48:57] You are to the center of the target.

[49:00] But I think if that was a magnet where you shoot it up and it holds it and drops it,

[49:04] I think that's cool.

[49:05] That's the only way I can improve this game.

[49:07] It's like kiss.

[49:08] Yeah.

[49:09] Exactly.

[49:10] Now on the left side when you shoot the pro, when you shoot that through the pops up the

[49:14] ramp, it goes all the way around.

[49:17] But on the premium when mummy multi ball is lit, the it kind of raises a secret entrance.

[49:23] Mummy, mummy lock is lit.

[49:25] It'll raise, it'll raise the back panel like a slot in it.

[49:28] It'll actually go behind the back panel and it locks in the sarcophagus.

[49:33] So cool.

[49:34] That's when it works.

[49:37] Not always the most reliable.

[49:38] Let's put it this way.

[49:40] I have an iron maiden premium when we use it in a tournament, we turn all that off.

[49:44] Yeah, turn players are all weird when you do that stuff.

[49:47] You're like, I don't want any physical.

[49:48] I've left it on and it will something will go wrong with it every time.

[49:54] So premium, the premium has the and the alley has the 3D molded toys, the Eddie toys.

[50:01] It is the better package.

[50:03] The premium is the way to go.

[50:04] Ellie is nice.

[50:05] That's the drill beans with flash.

[50:06] That's your thing in the back that does different colors or whatever.

[50:09] I don't think that's in the pro.

[50:11] First of all, I'm not an iron maiden fan.

[50:14] I love iron maiden music when I play this game.

[50:17] I love the animations.

[50:18] I love the art.

[50:19] Like this game was a complete home run.

[50:22] But here's the thing, was it a home run because he had been spending years building archery

[50:26] in the factory?

[50:27] So you're thinking the way I'm thinking.

[50:29] It's what they say about bands.

[50:30] They have their whole career to make the first album.

[50:32] But how about the second album?

[50:35] That's where the real test is.

[50:37] And that's what I was thinking when this came out and it was this big hit.

[50:40] Like, okay, what's he going to do for a second game?

[50:43] He's got to come up with something new now.

[50:45] Yeah, come on, man.

[50:46] Let's see what you got here.

[50:47] And then the rumors started that Stern had Jurassic Park.

[50:51] Jurassic Park.

[50:53] Yes.

[50:54] Yes.

[50:55] So this is released in 2019.

[50:57] So a follow up the following year.

[50:59] So Keith is on a 12 month development cycle.

[51:02] It appears.

[51:04] This is the Jurassic Park adventure theme designed by Keith L.

[51:08] One artwork by Jonathan Bergeron, who goes by Johnny Crap recently did do programming

[51:14] by Rick Nagel, sound Jerry Thompson and call out by various voice actors.

[51:19] And don't forget Harrison Drake and a British lady.

[51:22] Oh, another British lady.

[51:24] I think there's a British lady.

[51:25] Definitely a British guy.

[51:28] So this is based.

[51:29] There's a guy that's supposed to be Australian or New Zealand, whatever acts that he's

[51:32] supposed to do.

[51:34] Yeah.

[51:35] So the theme of this pinball machine is loosely based on the 1993 film and the novel by Michael

[51:45] Crichton.

[51:46] We say loosely based because they had no assets.

[51:49] So Steven Spielberg buys the novel rights in like 89.

[51:53] He purchases the movie rights for one and a half million.

[51:57] We're getting all into this thing here.

[51:59] It is a childhood tentpole for many of the younger Gen X and the millennials.

[52:08] And I'll tell you, I liked Jurassic Park.

[52:11] It was not like I had friends that were like, oh my God, they had all the toys and they

[52:14] wanted to see it every time.

[52:15] And then when Jurassic World came out, they're like, oh my God, this is the greatest thing.

[52:19] It's got to follow up.

[52:20] This is not really based on the films.

[52:24] It's more based on the idea of Jurassic Park with the John Williams music that people

[52:31] know.

[52:32] Yes.

[52:33] Ellen got to have his first experience of having a license but with no assets and see

[52:39] what he can do with it.

[52:40] They basically had the name.

[52:42] Obviously, they can use dinosaurs.

[52:45] They had the John Williams music and they had Nedry and they can use like the logo.

[52:50] Yeah.

[52:51] That's it.

[52:52] Have anyone from the movie, any clips from the movie, anything from the movie?

[52:57] There's no video.

[52:58] Yeah.

[52:59] Let's see what you can do.

[53:01] Now there's pros and cons to this.

[53:02] The pro is, I want to get the movie.

[53:05] I like the movie.

[53:06] The movie is the greatest.

[53:08] That was my Zach Manny impression.

[53:09] And then on the other side of the spectrum is like, oh, I have the world and I can do

[53:15] whatever I want.

[53:16] I can make any story I want.

[53:19] It's almost like a pseudo open license, right?

[53:23] Or original license.

[53:24] Which is from what Keith said.

[53:27] What they went with was you're like working, you're a worker on the island and you need

[53:33] to get off the island because of all these dinosaurs.

[53:35] This is their story.

[53:37] All the employees on the island.

[53:39] You need to rescue people.

[53:40] You need to capture dinosaurs.

[53:42] You need to get the hell off the island.

[53:44] Now this, I think that adds a lot of fun to it.

[53:47] The code is really where this pin shines.

[53:51] You capture, you have to lay traps.

[53:55] You got to capture dinosaurs.

[53:57] You travel.

[53:58] There's a map on the middle of the island and you kind of travel from one place to the

[54:02] visitor center.

[54:03] And you can travel different ways.

[54:05] You can go to the right, the left.

[54:07] You can pick any dinosaurs you want to capture or avoid if you don't want to battle the

[54:12] T-Rexes you don't have to.

[54:14] And there's somebody like me who's like, I just need to just anything.

[54:19] Just I'll play anything.

[54:21] It's too hard for me to try to navigate my way through.

[54:24] And you navigate your through way through with this brilliant mechanic known as, what

[54:29] is it the George Gomez Jeep?

[54:31] Oh, the, yeah, the Jeep.

[54:33] They have a Jeep.

[54:34] You hit, it's a captive ball in the front.

[54:36] You hit it and it spins the Jeep back and forth and it chooses your path.

[54:41] So whichever way that this pseudo target flips left to right is depending on which way

[54:48] on the map you travel.

[54:50] The other thing that I think is absolutely brilliant about this pinball machine is that

[54:56] instead of using the term like jackpots, oh, I'm going to shoot the blinking light and

[55:01] I get a jackpot.

[55:02] I'm involved in the story because I'm rescuing people from dinosaurs.

[55:08] I'm rescuing people from.

[55:11] Death or they get eaten.

[55:13] They couldn't show that.

[55:14] But there's the blinking light on the play field is like the dinosaur moving towards the

[55:19] person to get eaten.

[55:21] So there's like it's it's brilliant.

[55:23] It is absolutely brilliant.

[55:25] According to L when they did have some pretty funny death animations, but the licensors

[55:29] said no, you can't use those.

[55:31] Like, so I want to know what they are.

[55:33] I want to see what that looked like.

[55:34] It's a pretty deep rule set.

[55:36] Like it's pretty smart.

[55:37] So there's so you set traps, you capture or you rescue people, then you can capture the

[55:44] dinosaur and then you can collect like dinosaur bones by completing a task or not completing

[55:50] the task.

[55:51] I say for getting the whole rule set, I think the play field is a masterpiece.

[55:55] I still think it's its best one.

[55:56] That's where we'll go now.

[55:58] Let's talk about why the play field stands out like no.

[56:02] I mean, after after maiden, when this came out and I'm playing this thing, it's I was like

[56:10] this guy is at a different level when it comes to the play fields.

[56:13] The amount of shots that are in this thing and it's not a wide body.

[56:17] Was he a did he did you go?

[56:19] All right, let's see what's going to happen here with Keith.

[56:21] And then this thing came out.

[56:22] You're like holy crap.

[56:24] Let's put it this way.

[56:25] It's sitting downstairs right now.

[56:27] So you can yeah.

[56:28] Of course, so is maiden.

[56:30] So when I played this game for the first time, I was dumbfounded.

[56:35] I was like, oh my god, this is great.

[56:38] However, I think there's one shot too many.

[56:41] Yeah, wrong.

[56:42] It's perfect.

[56:43] I think I think that left orbiddy shot or the plunger 180 ramp thing, I think it's

[56:52] just a bit tight in there.

[56:55] I think everything could be opened up just slightly.

[56:57] Well, it's perfect.

[56:59] You're right.

[57:01] But so when we're talking about this play field, the only criticism I've really ever heard

[57:07] from this and that was people who didn't like the art.

[57:10] I liked the art and I think people don't like maps for some reason.

[57:15] They don't like maps in the center of the play field.

[57:17] I see that as a trend people as soon as there's a map there, it's like, oh, it's the

[57:22] art's bad.

[57:23] So there's a couple of really interesting things on this play field that I don't think

[57:28] had been done before.

[57:31] One of them is the plunge.

[57:33] The plunge ends up in a 180 ramp.

[57:35] You mean like on any John Papa Duke game?

[57:38] World Cup soccer.

[57:42] It's a 180 ramp.

[57:43] No, but what I'm saying is that they've got it on the plunge.

[57:46] Now he's integrated it into the play field, not just the plunge.

[57:50] He has a really cool Raptor pit on the left side.

[57:55] The premium is the better one obviously.

[57:57] The pro is really good as well.

[57:59] Yeah, that's the other thing should mention about the elements games.

[58:02] Most cases you lose and you do not lose a lot with the pro.

[58:05] Yeah, they're pretty similar.

[58:06] They're very like you'll still get great gameplay with the pro.

[58:10] You still get the shots.

[58:11] You get the shots in the gameplay.

[58:13] You might lose some of the mechs.

[58:15] The wow factor here is the T-Rex that eats the ball.

[58:21] Which supposedly wasn't even in the original plan.

[58:25] That was a Gomez thing.

[58:27] He's like, you don't have a T-Rex eating the ball?

[58:29] You got to have a T-Rex eating the ball.

[58:31] Yeah, if it didn't have a T-Rex eating the ball, I think there would have been a riot.

[58:35] What do you think?

[58:37] I don't know.

[58:38] We have a King Kong that's that which we'll get to, which he doesn't really eat anything.

[58:42] Or a shark that doesn't eat anything.

[58:44] Yeah, we'll get into that too.

[58:46] It seemed to work pretty good there.

[58:48] The cool thing is that ramp on the right side, which I think is too tight, if you shoot

[58:53] that ramp, it comes around and then it drops it on the play field.

[58:58] Yeah, right to the upper right side.

[58:59] It doesn't return it to the flipper.

[59:02] That's so smart.

[59:03] No, it comes right down to the upper flipper.

[59:04] I know, but it doesn't go back to the, it doesn't feed it like a, like a Steve Richie

[59:09] would bring that right back to the, to the flipper.

[59:12] Unless it's Seltzen John, then he jumps in it that falls in front of the flipper.

[59:15] Oh, then he just stole that from Keith.

[59:18] Oh, okay.

[59:19] So it's got, it's, it is a great play field.

[59:22] Then I thought, so I'm new to the hobby.

[59:25] There's this Keith L. Wing guy that I know it's a high level tournament player.

[59:28] He releases Iron Maiden, which I really like and I don't like Iron Maiden.

[59:32] Then he releases Jurassic Park and I'm like, whoa, this is really good.

[59:38] Really, really good.

[59:39] He also again played homage to a few other pinball machines in here where, or he ripped

[59:45] off some ideas, if you will.

[59:47] Well, it has the smart missile.

[59:48] It's done a little differently.

[59:50] The original Jurassic Park had the smart missile, which was the button on the launcher.

[59:55] This one, it's actually a shot.

[59:56] You got to squeeze the ball past the, the Jeep, the truck and you hit a target in the

[01:00:03] back right.

[01:00:04] The left in lane has a up post, which I think is

[01:00:09] from cactus canyon, is that right?

[01:00:11] Well, it's usually cactus cam.

[01:00:12] I'm sure it's probably used in other games, but this has become more a Keith staple also.

[01:00:16] He likes when he stops the ball.

[01:00:19] He likes to stop it in the end lane.

[01:00:21] There's no scoops.

[01:00:22] Nope.

[01:00:23] This is a second machine with no scoops.

[01:00:24] Yeah, he doesn't like scoops.

[01:00:27] Slows down the gameplay because it goes into the scoop.

[01:00:29] It sits there for a second and it goes, and spits it back out.

[01:00:32] He doesn't like that.

[01:00:35] Scrooves up the flow.

[01:00:36] Right.

[01:00:37] There's another mech that he can use somewhere else or another coil or another spot on the

[01:00:42] node board.

[01:00:43] Wow.

[01:00:44] This game.

[01:00:45] Yeah.

[01:00:46] This comes out.

[01:00:47] It was great.

[01:00:48] And they had it as a new game.

[01:00:49] It was at pinburg in 2019.

[01:00:51] A pinburg that L win one.

[01:00:53] So I remember seeing him.

[01:00:55] He was walking to the section where all the Jurassic parks were probably checking out, you

[01:00:58] know, how they were holding up.

[01:01:00] Meanwhile, he's winning the tournament and I'm thinking, man, it's a pretty good weekend

[01:01:03] for him.

[01:01:04] He's doing pretty good.

[01:01:06] He's doing okay.

[01:01:07] How about the artwork on here?

[01:01:09] So this is not, this is not a, you know, it's not Zambietti, but it's also not a traditional

[01:01:17] old yard.

[01:01:18] I had no issues with it.

[01:01:19] I like it.

[01:01:20] I like it.

[01:01:21] This premium art package with the raptors in the kitchen and the raptors on the back

[01:01:26] glass.

[01:01:27] Here's a second example of Keith L. Winsang.

[01:01:30] I want the premium to be the coolest art package.

[01:01:33] And boy oh boy, is it ever the coolest art package?

[01:01:38] So good.

[01:01:39] Ah, wonderful.

[01:01:41] That's the second L win game that I have downstairs.

[01:01:45] Has Keith made a better game than Jurassic Park?

[01:01:48] A better game?

[01:01:50] I mean, let's see how King Kong ends up.

[01:01:52] So his next game, this was the COVID game.

[01:01:56] Yes.

[01:01:57] The second COVID game.

[01:01:59] This is a Vengeance Infinity Quest.

[01:02:02] So I had some money on the sidelines to buy a pinball machine.

[01:02:06] And I was getting ready to, I was just warming that money up.

[01:02:09] I was rubbing it, getting it all, getting all ready.

[01:02:14] And then I was about to pull it out of my pocket and then the world ended.

[01:02:17] And then I put that, I didn't touch that money.

[01:02:21] So then all of a sudden, the first COVID game comes out, which is Ninja Turtles.

[01:02:29] And that is a theme that speaks to me.

[01:02:34] Loved the Ninja Turtles.

[01:02:35] I was all in on Ninja Turtles.

[01:02:38] But then Infinity Quest comes out after Avengers Infinity Quest.

[01:02:42] And I am a big fan of superheroes.

[01:02:46] So I'm like, holy crap, what do I do with this money now?

[01:02:50] Is burning a hole in my pocket during COVID?

[01:02:53] And Stern is just smashing it out of the park with everything they do here.

[01:02:59] And then I'm going to put it on these releases.

[01:03:01] And of course, we know in L.

[01:03:03] When we trust, designed by Keith Alwin, artwork by Zambia,

[01:03:08] he programming by Nick Rick Nagle and Raymond Davidson.

[01:03:14] There's a name you should recognize.

[01:03:17] Sound by Jerry Thompson and call out spy.

[01:03:20] Custom voice actors for Marvel and mechanics by Harrison Drake.

[01:03:26] Yes, the voice actors.

[01:03:27] How many Marvel games have good callouts?

[01:03:32] I recommend because they just use the movie.

[01:03:36] Deadpool somehow.

[01:03:37] I don't know what happened there.

[01:03:39] I don't know how that occurred.

[01:03:40] Spider-Man, because they got Jameson.

[01:03:43] But not the redone.

[01:03:44] No, not the Vault 1.

[01:03:45] No.

[01:03:46] When Vault met something different.

[01:03:48] This is based on Marvel, not the Marvel Studios film,

[01:03:54] the Avengers.

[01:03:55] This is based on the comic books.

[01:04:00] So not endgame, not the movies, the Infinity Gauntlet saga.

[01:04:06] That again, very much like Jurassic Park,

[01:04:11] is giving Keith some freedom.

[01:04:13] He can kind of make the story, as he will,

[01:04:17] with familiar characters that everybody loves, like Thanos and the Avengers.

[01:04:23] But he's given that flexibility to make them do whatever he wants.

[01:04:27] But not a flexibility when it came to the video assets.

[01:04:32] Or they had to use basically static stuff that they had to use

[01:04:36] and figure out how they were going to use it.

[01:04:39] We're well into the Spike 2 era now.

[01:04:44] They're still learning how to use that back LCD screen.

[01:04:48] How to not have too much images or too much distracting stuff.

[01:04:52] I thought in this case, it's just what they were given.

[01:04:56] Like you must use these.

[01:04:58] It did not go.

[01:05:00] No.

[01:05:01] Great.

[01:05:02] So when this game launched, I saw this and I said,

[01:05:05] what this looks amazing.

[01:05:07] At first glance, this game looks awesome.

[01:05:10] There's this under the play field subway that you can see through the play field.

[01:05:17] Which is basically like 2000 ball lock.

[01:05:20] I think Gomez and the team gave Keith some more leeway when it came to his weird ramps

[01:05:29] that are zigging and zagging and crossing the play field.

[01:05:32] And then you see that Captain Marvel ramp on the premium LE.

[01:05:38] And it kind of goes up into the left and you're like, holy crap.

[01:05:44] What is going on?

[01:05:45] Also, the ramps in the back look very like they look a lot like Gottlieb.

[01:05:49] Like Gottlieb metal ramps.

[01:05:50] Right out of the gate, most people assume this is Keith's worst game.

[01:05:54] No.

[01:05:55] I think they do.

[01:05:56] I think a lot of it is just the rules, confused people, with the whole gems and everything.

[01:06:02] That doesn't bother me.

[01:06:05] What bothers me is that it just, it seems like a bit of a mishmash.

[01:06:12] I don't know what it was about this game, but at first glance, I'm like, I'm all in on this.

[01:06:17] And then after I played it, I thought, I like Jurassic Park more.

[01:06:24] You know, like I'm one of those weird people that kind of liked Ninja Turtles more.

[01:06:29] Because I like the ass kicking of Ninja Turtles over the constantly shooting the same shots

[01:06:35] over and over again that I felt like I was doing with the Avengers.

[01:06:39] The other thing was, there's a couple of like, so Keith gets into the 180 ramps.

[01:06:46] He loves the 180 ramps because it can give him more playfield space, I think.

[01:06:51] So I'm like, oh, he's doing the same thing again.

[01:06:54] Right?

[01:06:55] It's like, I thought the portal lock, although really cool, was a disappointment.

[01:07:01] It takes a while for it to go down there and, yeah, you don't miss it when you have

[01:07:07] a pro.

[01:07:08] Let's put that one.

[01:07:09] So the thing is, I thought it was, what I thought it was is you would hit that spinner.

[01:07:13] The spinner would raise up, you'd shoot into the portal lock and it would roll down to

[01:07:17] the vuck and pop up.

[01:07:19] But what it does is it kind of sits there and goes clink clink, dunk, clink clink,

[01:07:24] dunk, clink clink, it's, it's, it's really terrible.

[01:07:27] It's like 2000.

[01:07:28] It's like the, it's the lock stepper thing that's on flight 2000.

[01:07:32] That shouldn't have made it through to be totally like, and I'm not an pro.

[01:07:35] I'm not an expert.

[01:07:36] I get it.

[01:07:37] I'm sideline quarterbacking here.

[01:07:39] That shouldn't have made it through because it is not fun.

[01:07:43] If somebody like Keith doesn't like scoops because it slows down gameplay, whoo, whoo,

[01:07:47] boy does that ever slow down gameplay.

[01:07:49] They still sold a bunch of them.

[01:07:52] They sold them.

[01:07:53] But yes.

[01:07:54] They did have some problems with that Captain Marvel ramp, didn't they?

[01:07:58] If it wasn't quite bent correctly, it didn't quite.

[01:08:01] Yeah, it didn't feed right.

[01:08:03] It was good.

[01:08:04] It was good.

[01:08:06] After the rule set centers around collecting gems from the gauntlet, battling Thanos and

[01:08:13] his fellows, you got to get those six gems.

[01:08:16] Each of the gems have like a perk.

[01:08:18] It gets confusing.

[01:08:19] Well, Keith says we wanted it to be replayable like a good comic book arc.

[01:08:24] Every game you can take a different path.

[01:08:27] It's the most strategic L win.

[01:08:29] There's a lot of strategy in where you put the, the gems and stuff.

[01:08:33] And even I think the high level tournament players got all whiny because they didn't

[01:08:37] know exactly what the perfect strategy was.

[01:08:41] Well, no, the high level ones all loved it.

[01:08:42] I'm sure.

[01:08:43] And they would all come up with their own perfect strategies because why their top level

[01:08:47] players.

[01:08:48] Because like most of the games are like, do the thing, right?

[01:08:50] Like you're playing Batman 66 and you're like, oh, I want to.

[01:08:53] Yeah, Mr. Flanagan.

[01:08:54] What's the reason then, Eggman and Evan whatever.

[01:08:57] Whatever.

[01:08:58] Okay, which one am I supposed to go through and like, where, what, where am I supposed

[01:09:01] to put the gem on?

[01:09:02] You're the influencer in the, in the, in the hobby that's like, I don't like it.

[01:09:06] I don't like it.

[01:09:07] Which then influences other people.

[01:09:09] You are.

[01:09:10] People listen to you.

[01:09:11] They shouldn't, but they do.

[01:09:13] I'm pretty stupid when it comes to rules and stuff.

[01:09:15] So I'm frequently confused.

[01:09:17] But if more of you with a microphone end up kind of complaining about that, the more it

[01:09:21] brings people down.

[01:09:22] I would say out of all of this games, this one is the one that confused me the most.

[01:09:27] Where I just, I, I don't really have a clue.

[01:09:30] Still what I'm doing.

[01:09:31] I think though this is the third game.

[01:09:33] You can't, I mean, come on, the follow up game of Jurassic Park.

[01:09:36] Yep.

[01:09:37] Yep.

[01:09:38] Like, how do you keep up to that?

[01:09:40] But this game does solidify L1 signatures of aggressive flow.

[01:09:44] This game does indeed shoot really well.

[01:09:48] The layered rule sets.

[01:09:50] So kind of the base level, multi balls and, you know, stuff for me.

[01:09:54] And then kind of the, the extra little bits and wizard modes and then advanced collectibles

[01:09:59] and things like that.

[01:10:01] The theme integration, I think, was really good with the toys and stuff.

[01:10:06] But I feel like if you took this game, you could, you could take the art off, put a totally

[01:10:12] different theme on it and be none the wiser.

[01:10:15] I don't, I feel like this game could easily be any other theme.

[01:10:22] Whereas Jurassic Park, I don't think it could be any other, it has to be Jurassic Park.

[01:10:27] And I think that that is kind of the let down.

[01:10:29] There were some rumors that in fact, this originally was Ninja Turtles.

[01:10:33] Yeah, I never heard that.

[01:10:34] And then it was switched.

[01:10:35] I never heard that.

[01:10:37] Okay.

[01:10:38] Well, Keith L. when you can email us at silver ball chronicles at gmail.com to let us know

[01:10:41] if that's true.

[01:10:42] Well, what Keith said about this game, because it was the second pandemic game, he says,

[01:10:46] it was really weird doing everything remote, art, code, sound, normally, we're all in

[01:10:51] the same building, seeing each other's progress and bouncing ideas around.

[01:10:55] That energy was different over zoom.

[01:10:57] That I think is actually the linchpin.

[01:10:59] Is our energy different over zoom?

[01:11:01] We're over zoom right now.

[01:11:02] It's, I don't know, we'll work together.

[01:11:05] There's a lot more hugging.

[01:11:07] Dare I say those hugs are so long and warm, they're almost a couple.

[01:11:11] So it is, it is a little bit different, but not that different.

[01:11:15] But I think it, I think the camaraderie that you get in a, in an office space where it's

[01:11:21] all like testosterone and harassment and, you know, you got Steve Richie walking around,

[01:11:26] yelling at everybody playing on a guitar.

[01:11:29] I think you're missing something in that chaos.

[01:11:32] Will that hold up?

[01:11:33] I don't know.

[01:11:34] Even though it was the pandemic, they still sold a ton of them.

[01:11:36] And Keith says, I was shocked.

[01:11:38] People were still so excited.

[01:11:40] We had no shows, no launch parties, but the buzz was still there.

[01:11:43] That was encouraging.

[01:11:44] Stern did this really cool online head to head event.

[01:11:47] I remember that.

[01:11:48] Did you, do you remember that where everybody kind of was online and you would play against

[01:11:53] each other?

[01:11:54] Yeah.

[01:11:55] We did stuff like that.

[01:11:56] We did a lot of stuff like that during the pandemic.

[01:11:57] Yeah.

[01:11:58] That was a whole thing.

[01:11:59] I like how you haven't known it to bomb.

[01:12:01] Terrible call.

[01:12:02] I'm Iron Man.

[01:12:04] Jurassic Park struggled.

[01:12:06] It depended who like the voice.

[01:12:08] I'd the one guy like, welcome to Jurassic Park.

[01:12:12] That guy was good.

[01:12:13] But then, you know, the guy was supposed to be New Zealand or Australian, whatever he was.

[01:12:17] That was pretty bad.

[01:12:18] Or the guy who was, who was trying to be the non offensive African American.

[01:12:23] Oh, the guy was supposed to be Samuel Jackson.

[01:12:26] Yeah, but he's trying to like not be Samuel Jackson who was pretty awesome in Jurassic

[01:12:31] Park.

[01:12:32] But the same thing kind of happened here in Avengers is that they had these like requirements,

[01:12:39] I guess.

[01:12:40] Yeah, you have to use their voice talent.

[01:12:42] And that's why we get stuck with these crappy call outs and all these games, including

[01:12:46] the latest X-Men.

[01:12:47] For example, it's like if you say Iron Man, you have to say it with this cadence.

[01:12:52] I'm Iron Man.

[01:12:54] And I'm playing.

[01:12:55] I'm playing the game and I'm like, no, you're not.

[01:12:57] You're not Iron Man.

[01:12:58] The one you can't screw up is a Hulk.

[01:13:01] You can't get Hulk wrong.

[01:13:02] Yeah.

[01:13:03] Once you got a yo me Hulk smash, you know, you can't really screw that up.

[01:13:07] But the worst one, I think that basically ruined this entire game for me that I could

[01:13:11] never own.

[01:13:12] Literally, the only reason I would never own this game is one call out because it would

[01:13:16] drive me crazy.

[01:13:17] It said Rush sucks and you just, you can't.

[01:13:20] It's the Captain Marvel ramp.

[01:13:22] Okay.

[01:13:23] She's like, by the code of binary, binary, where you're like, what?

[01:13:31] What the hell does that mean?

[01:13:33] I know it's something from the comic books.

[01:13:36] I know it has to do with, I don't know, we see binaries, a set of ones in zeros and

[01:13:41] that's the way it works.

[01:13:43] It just, oh, God, it's terrible.

[01:13:46] So I think it was after this game where things really, really changed for Keith.

[01:13:54] Like he was, he was, he was on the pedestal, right?

[01:13:57] People were like, wow, Keith is like three for three.

[01:14:01] He hit two just grand slams and then one like what, double.

[01:14:09] And then now it's like he's doing something else.

[01:14:13] And this is I think when he became what the savior, the savior of the people, I didn't

[01:14:19] know he did it to be saved, but yes.

[01:14:22] He became, he became the goat at this point.

[01:14:25] Is that, is that probably right?

[01:14:27] He's always been the goat.

[01:14:28] Come on.

[01:14:29] We didn't mention that in his games, that's kind of a theme that there'll be a goat in

[01:14:35] there somewhere.

[01:15:15] just from shopping around for a more competitive rate.

[01:15:48] Yeah, yeah, there's lots of really cool little easter eggs.

[01:15:52] If you see them from time to time in the pinball machines.

[01:15:54] I think members of his team did that to try to get a reaction out and then they just started

[01:15:59] just kept doing it.

[01:16:00] But I think Keith just is emotionless and doesn't show that that's actually funny.

[01:16:04] So there were some rumors.

[01:16:06] I remember when I would listen to all these podcasts, head to head pinball podcast,

[01:16:10] when I would listen to the pinball show or the twip podcast back in the day, they had these

[01:16:15] conversations around the excitement at spooky that they were going after the Godzilla license.

[01:16:24] Because they were big horror Toho fans, right?

[01:16:27] Horror and Toho fans.

[01:16:29] I would never consider Toho horror.

[01:16:30] I'm sorry, yes.

[01:16:31] Horror, comma Toho.

[01:16:34] Kaiju.

[01:16:35] They like Kaiju.

[01:16:36] Spooky used to have a podcast back in the day.

[01:16:40] And one of the probably their highest rated podcasts was the one where they revealed that they

[01:16:44] did not get the Godzilla license and how it was snatched out from underneath them.

[01:16:52] And the anger and horror that came from that afterwards.

[01:16:56] Yeah, they were pissed.

[01:16:57] They weren't just angry.

[01:16:59] They were furious because they thought that there was some underhanded tactics or indeed there

[01:17:05] were underhanded tactics.

[01:17:06] I don't know in how that license was snatched away.

[01:17:11] And the community said, I don't want Stern to do Godzilla.

[01:17:15] Stern will do a terrible job.

[01:17:17] I want spooky to do it because they'll have all the cool toys and mechs that you want.

[01:17:22] It's kind of like when you find out your theme is being made by a certain company.

[01:17:26] And you're like, I want my theme to be made by this company instead.

[01:17:32] One collapsing building later.

[01:17:34] Everyone forgot about that.

[01:17:38] How did Stern create a redemption arc for the ages?

[01:17:43] And that was giving the one Keith L.

[01:17:45] when the Godzilla theme.

[01:17:48] 2001.

[01:17:49] So this is the sort of the 2021.

[01:17:52] I'm sorry.

[01:17:54] 2000.

[01:17:54] We went back in time.

[01:17:56] Yes.

[01:17:57] 2021.

[01:17:58] This is the second pandemic game for Keith L.

[01:18:01] when this is the one that had all of its development

[01:18:05] through the pandemic.

[01:18:06] Not just the end.

[01:18:07] This is the Toho Monsters Kaiju theme.

[01:18:10] Keith L. went on design.

[01:18:12] Jeremy Packer on artwork.

[01:18:13] Rick Nagle and his team on programming.

[01:18:16] Jerry Thompson on sound.

[01:18:18] Harrison Drake on mechanics.

[01:18:20] I got to keep bringing him up because he's not in your list here.

[01:18:22] And he's very important in this one.

[01:18:23] And the callouts by various voice actors

[01:18:26] and the classic Toho film samples.

[01:18:30] The voice acting.

[01:18:31] Much better on this game, but does have a couple of issues.

[01:18:34] But those issues are more fun.

[01:18:36] Yeah.

[01:18:37] It's the same guy.

[01:18:38] It's the same guy does all the, yeah.

[01:18:40] Let's start on the high level.

[01:18:41] So the classic theme here is Godzilla.

[01:18:44] Godzilla or Godzilla.

[01:18:46] Gojira is a Japanese monster or Kaiju franchise

[01:18:49] setting, uh, centering on the title character.

[01:18:53] Uprehistoric reptilian monster

[01:18:56] awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation.

[01:18:58] So this film series is recognized in the Guinness world records

[01:19:03] as the longest continuing running film series.

[01:19:06] Having an ongoing production since 1954 with several hiatuses,

[01:19:12] a various lengths, uh, reboots, revisionings, and redoes.

[01:19:18] The Godzilla franchise has 38 films as of

[01:19:22] this recording.

[01:19:23] 33 Japanese films produced and distributed by Toho Co. Limited.

[01:19:28] Five American films.

[01:19:30] They don't count.

[01:19:31] One by Tri-Star Pictures and four films in the Monsterverse franchise,

[01:19:36] which is the the King Kong Godzilla legendary pictures thing.

[01:19:42] The films have been considered to basically be an allegory for nuclear weapons.

[01:19:47] The earlier Godzilla films, especially Godzilla portrayed

[01:19:51] Godzilla as a frightening, frightening nuclear monster.

[01:19:55] The first two basically.

[01:19:56] Godzilla really represented the fear of many Japanese

[01:20:00] that they held about the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

[01:20:05] during the Second World War and the sort of the trauma that came from that.

[01:20:09] I thought this was really cool in my research.

[01:20:12] Godzilla is a combination of two Japanese words.

[01:20:15] Gorilla or gorilla and Juryra or whale.

[01:20:22] So he's a gorilla whale.

[01:20:23] Gorilla whale.

[01:20:24] That's kind of cool.

[01:20:25] And then you kind of stick it together in his Godzilla.

[01:20:29] It's cool.

[01:20:30] It's really cool.

[01:20:30] Japanese culture is a whole thing, hey?

[01:20:32] Yeah, awesome.

[01:20:33] I would love to go to Japan someday.

[01:20:35] So the game design, like I said, 100% COVID lockdown game from start to finish.

[01:20:42] And he says, usually I could just go into the lab and tweak something in the middle of the day.

[01:20:46] During lockdown, I had to be more methodical.

[01:20:49] Make notes.

[01:20:50] Wait for the right time to test.

[01:20:52] Sometimes even ship the game for someone else to test.

[01:20:55] That's wild, hey?

[01:20:56] But I think this game benefited from that extra kind of learning

[01:21:01] that maybe they didn't get during Avengers.

[01:21:04] But now he's like making notes.

[01:21:06] He's kind of figuring out what to do.

[01:21:08] He's learning.

[01:21:09] He's these, what do they say?

[01:21:10] Like, going with the punches.

[01:21:12] Now this game is heavy flow and creative loops

[01:21:17] with some seriously really unique ramps

[01:21:20] and some awesome mechs that are built into that.

[01:21:25] What, like when you step up to Godzilla,

[01:21:28] let's talk about the premium because all the other ones don't matter.

[01:21:30] Oh, actually you can have a pro and it would be perfectly fine.

[01:21:35] When you step up to that game, what do you notice immediately?

[01:21:39] The building and actually mecha Godzilla on the right side.

[01:21:43] I notice him too.

[01:21:44] There's like this building and it's in the pro

[01:21:47] and it's in the premium.

[01:21:48] So you still get the building, right?

[01:21:49] It's still there.

[01:21:50] It's still ominous and like big.

[01:21:53] And to the left of that is like a bridge

[01:21:56] with a Godzilla toy behind it or a flat plastic.

[01:21:58] And then on the right side,

[01:22:00] you've got that mecha Godzilla,

[01:22:01] which is like a Godzilla that was made to attack Godzilla,

[01:22:05] but was like a robot.

[01:22:06] Yep.

[01:22:06] It looks impressive when you first look at it.

[01:22:08] You're like, what is going on here?

[01:22:11] This looks awesome.

[01:22:12] I cannot wait to play this game.

[01:22:14] And I think that first kind of impression

[01:22:18] that you get when you say, holy crap,

[01:22:21] I think that's maybe the worst part of this game

[01:22:24] because it just keeps getting better

[01:22:25] as soon as you put a quarter in

[01:22:27] and you start pressing that start button, isn't that right?

[01:22:29] Oh, yeah.

[01:22:30] When you look at some of the other games

[01:22:32] released around this time

[01:22:34] and you look at Godzilla,

[01:22:36] the only thing that goes through your mind

[01:22:38] is why do they give Keith more money

[01:22:41] than everybody else to build a game?

[01:22:43] They say they don't.

[01:22:44] Stern has said that.

[01:22:45] It's not true.

[01:22:46] They have said repeatedly

[01:22:47] that they do not give Keith any kind of extra

[01:22:51] bill of materials.

[01:22:52] Maybe if they saved $50 on one game,

[01:22:55] they might give the $50 to Keith on his next game.

[01:22:57] But we're not talking a big deal,

[01:22:59] a big difference.

[01:23:00] But man, when you look at this game,

[01:23:02] come on.

[01:23:03] They had to give him a little extra on this,

[01:23:05] didn't they?

[01:23:06] Like, come on.

[01:23:07] It's loaded.

[01:23:08] When they did the reveal stream on this game,

[01:23:11] the first time multi-ball started

[01:23:13] and it starts playing Godzilla

[01:23:15] by Blue Oyster call

[01:23:17] and the building collapses,

[01:23:18] I saw someone in chat put like,

[01:23:20] they just sold a thousand more units right there

[01:23:22] with that, just that intro on this stream.

[01:23:25] And I totally like, yes,

[01:23:27] that person is 100% correct.

[01:23:29] So specifically on the premium,

[01:23:30] you shoot kind of

[01:23:33] in the building like the main floor

[01:23:35] or the bottom of the building, right?

[01:23:36] Like, yeah,

[01:23:38] and it has a vuck that pops

[01:23:39] and puts it on the ceiling of the building.

[01:23:41] And you lock what?

[01:23:42] Three balls up there?

[01:23:44] Yeah.

[01:23:44] And then when you go to launch,

[01:23:46] Godzilla multi-ball,

[01:23:48] Blue Oyster calls starts,

[01:23:50] which is this kind of fun go-go Godzilla kind of song.

[01:23:54] The fact that everyone knew

[01:23:56] that they were doing this game

[01:23:57] because of the whole spooky steel and all that.

[01:23:59] And I was just like,

[01:24:01] man, they should have whatever the main

[01:24:02] multi-ball is,

[01:24:03] it should play Godzilla by Blue Oyster call.

[01:24:06] Yes, brilliant.

[01:24:07] And I figured they might be able to get that

[01:24:09] because if you go to Toho's

[01:24:11] own YouTube channel,

[01:24:12] they have a video on their channel

[01:24:14] that uses Blue Oyster call,

[01:24:16] it's Godzilla.

[01:24:17] So I figured it can't be that hard to get.

[01:24:19] Yeah, and Blue Oyster call needs all the money

[01:24:21] they can get.

[01:24:21] So licensing is,

[01:24:24] but I figured it wouldn't be too hard to get that.

[01:24:27] Yeah, we're not talking stairway to heaven

[01:24:28] from Led Zeppelin.

[01:24:29] When I saw that on the stream,

[01:24:31] like, oh my god, they did it.

[01:24:33] Like, it literally is exactly what I want it.

[01:24:36] So then all the lights are going off

[01:24:38] and the building lowers down

[01:24:40] and then the front of the building opens up

[01:24:42] and all the balls drain right down the middle.

[01:24:45] Well, they come right at you, but yeah.

[01:24:48] So it's really cool.

[01:24:50] It is a pinball moment

[01:24:52] like we haven't seen for years.

[01:24:54] But that mech is kind of like

[01:24:57] a mech we've seen before.

[01:24:59] It is?

[01:25:00] Yeah, it's kind of like the Doctor Who thing.

[01:25:03] Well, okay, it is different levels,

[01:25:05] but the shot paths change depending on what level it's on,

[01:25:08] which is cool.

[01:25:09] That is the best part of this entire pinball.

[01:25:11] Don't forget mech Godzilla too.

[01:25:13] He ain't no slash.

[01:25:14] I mean, he's basically just, um,

[01:25:16] a sculpt with like a magnet.

[01:25:18] He's got a tummy grab.

[01:25:19] But he tummy grabs the ball and it's still cool

[01:25:22] because he's mech Godzilla.

[01:25:23] It's so I know we're fawning over this game.

[01:25:27] I know it's number one on the pinside top 100.

[01:25:31] I know I get it.

[01:25:32] It's got some weak points.

[01:25:34] And we'll talk about some of those weak points in a moment.

[01:25:38] But the impact that this game had right out of the gate

[01:25:42] was like, I mean, Jurassic Park was like, whoa,

[01:25:45] Jurassic Park is awesome.

[01:25:47] This thing nobody had even played it yet.

[01:25:49] And immediately they were like, oh my goodness.

[01:25:52] What is going on here?

[01:25:54] So that building will move up and down.

[01:25:56] And then that changes where the ball enters and exits

[01:26:00] on different ramps.

[01:26:02] It's a diverter that moves around.

[01:26:05] And it looks great.

[01:26:06] And it's called the Drake Industries Building.

[01:26:08] Yes.

[01:26:09] Because it was built by...

[01:26:10] Harrison Drake.

[01:26:12] And this, you've got a Godzilla, right?

[01:26:15] Yes.

[01:26:15] So how does the mech work?

[01:26:17] I mean, it's on a motor and it goes up and down.

[01:26:20] Yeah, but it's like, it's not going to jam your finger

[01:26:22] and cut it off, right?

[01:26:23] I hope not.

[01:26:25] If there is, there's no warnings.

[01:26:26] But you haven't had any problems with the building.

[01:26:28] I have not had any problems with the building.

[01:26:30] I don't think anybody has had any problems with the building.

[01:26:33] The only issues they had were on the early production runs where sometimes the

[01:26:37] fuck wouldn't kick the ball up well enough

[01:26:40] because like part of the ramp underneath was catching.

[01:26:43] So you had to put like a business card under there.

[01:26:45] But they fixed that pretty quick.

[01:26:47] And the game, the other question is when everyone knew it was going to be Godzilla.

[01:26:50] Like what Godzilla is it going to be?

[01:26:52] Because there's different...

[01:26:53] There's different eras of Godzilla.

[01:26:55] And I mean, if you were Godzilla fanatic like me,

[01:26:59] I think the best era of Godzilla is actually the 90s.

[01:27:03] The Hase era.

[01:27:04] The Hase era?

[01:27:05] Yeah, there's some of the best.

[01:27:07] So when were the really cheesy ones?

[01:27:09] When were those...

[01:27:09] But the cheesy ones that everyone's going to remember

[01:27:11] that I figured they would do the game on.

[01:27:13] That's the original Shoah era.

[01:27:15] So that's what we're doing here.

[01:27:17] That's yes.

[01:27:18] So he, it's off of the invasion of Astro Monster

[01:27:22] from 1965.

[01:27:23] That's when Godzilla goes to the moon.

[01:27:26] Oh gosh.

[01:27:27] Not the moon.

[01:27:28] He goes to another planet.

[01:27:31] And that's where he gets the aliens in the game from...

[01:27:35] What are they?

[01:27:35] The Zillions?

[01:27:36] Zillions, yeah.

[01:27:37] The Zillions?

[01:27:37] Yeah.

[01:27:38] Yep, that's where all that's from.

[01:27:40] So most of the plot is from that movie.

[01:27:41] Including the Shoot the Wampz guy.

[01:27:44] Shoot the Wampz who's supposed to be like a New York accent.

[01:27:47] He's in that movie.

[01:27:48] Okay.

[01:27:49] More useless crap.

[01:27:51] But yeah.

[01:27:51] That's what we're here for is useless knowledge.

[01:27:55] That's what the game is based around

[01:27:57] invasion of Astro Monster.

[01:27:58] But then he also has all the other villains you would want.

[01:28:02] Villains, other Kaiju,

[01:28:03] Kinky Dora,

[01:28:04] Rodans in there,

[01:28:05] Mothras in there,

[01:28:06] Angeares is in there.

[01:28:09] What Godzilla's son?

[01:28:10] Oh, yes, son of Godzilla.

[01:28:12] Meania.

[01:28:13] Meania.

[01:28:14] I thought it was Terry.

[01:28:15] Yeah, Terry.

[01:28:15] Jesus.

[01:28:16] Terry Zilla.

[01:28:17] He also has the Hedera,

[01:28:20] the Smog Monster,

[01:28:21] one Megalon,

[01:28:23] Geigen,

[01:28:25] like all the characters you would want.

[01:28:27] They got,

[01:28:29] I believe in what they said that Tolo was very like,

[01:28:32] yeah, go ahead.

[01:28:33] Like, yeah, just do your thing.

[01:28:35] Just do your thing.

[01:28:36] They didn't have much in the way of restrictions.

[01:28:39] The best licenseers are the ones that are like,

[01:28:41] do your thing.

[01:28:43] We're good at our IP.

[01:28:44] You're good at pinball, make good pinball.

[01:28:46] Licensors who put too many restrictions

[01:28:49] or handcuffs,

[01:28:51] the game suffers.

[01:28:52] A great example,

[01:28:53] my favorite pinball machine

[01:28:55] that I happen to own,

[01:28:57] the greatest pinball machine of all time,

[01:28:59] James Bond,

[01:29:00] tends to struggle a little bit

[01:29:02] with the licenseer restrictions

[01:29:03] and thus made the game slightly worse.

[01:29:06] Still the greatest game ever made,

[01:29:07] but that and Tron,

[01:29:09] two greatest games ever.

[01:29:10] Not from sales.

[01:29:12] That would be this one.

[01:29:13] Let's talk about a couple of the little bits and pieces in here.

[01:29:15] One of them is the Godzilla

[01:29:17] grabbing magnet thing.

[01:29:19] What do they call that?

[01:29:20] The Godzilla.

[01:29:21] Oh.

[01:29:21] The thing.

[01:29:24] Yeah, what is that called?

[01:29:26] Magnum Grab.

[01:29:27] Magnum Grab.

[01:29:28] Yeah.

[01:29:29] So you shoot into the building

[01:29:32] and it loops around

[01:29:35] then this magnet, which is like a cylinder,

[01:29:38] grabs the ball and flicks it

[01:29:41] up to the left orbit

[01:29:44] because it kind of goes in an arc.

[01:29:46] You can hit this magnet and it will stop it dead

[01:29:48] and then flick it.

[01:29:49] Yeah.

[01:29:50] And it goes almost,

[01:29:51] almost a hundred percent of the time.

[01:29:53] Perfectly to that left flipper.

[01:29:55] And then you can shoot the orbit

[01:29:57] or you can shoot the ramp

[01:29:58] or you can shoot the spinner.

[01:30:00] It's unbelievable that that works.

[01:30:03] And on this game,

[01:30:04] it's got the lane on the right.

[01:30:07] It's basically kind of like the hippo lane

[01:30:09] in Ongo.

[01:30:11] He has the floating upper flipper on the left,

[01:30:14] which I think he said one of the inspirations for this

[01:30:16] of all things was from Doodlebug.

[01:30:19] Cool.

[01:30:20] If you remember Doodlebug has like the flippers

[01:30:22] or in a little bit so it's a space

[01:30:23] so you can drain behind the flipper.

[01:30:26] Supposedly that's where you got the idea

[01:30:28] having just the floating flipper.

[01:30:30] But you know what it has?

[01:30:31] It's got a scoop.

[01:30:32] It does have a scoop.

[01:30:33] He relented.

[01:30:35] He relented.

[01:30:36] He has a scoop.

[01:30:37] He does, but the scoop,

[01:30:38] although very important,

[01:30:40] you're not in it all the time

[01:30:41] and it's not really easy to shoot it in there by accident.

[01:30:44] Which is nice.

[01:30:45] I don't think we mentioned earlier.

[01:30:47] Like this Avengers doesn't have any pop umbers, does it?

[01:30:50] Yeah, it does.

[01:30:50] It's got two.

[01:30:52] It's got two.

[01:30:52] I think in the back.

[01:30:53] It says one.

[01:30:54] So we're not stuck with the must have three pop umper stuff.

[01:30:58] Keith is the first guy in forever

[01:31:01] that was able to break Gary Stern's rule

[01:31:03] of no three nest pop umper's.

[01:31:07] Yeah, now we're down to one in Godzilla.

[01:31:09] And it's in a tough place

[01:31:11] because it's right by that scoop

[01:31:12] and it screws me almost every time.

[01:31:14] Which is what it's designed to do.

[01:31:16] This game is pretty, pretty great.

[01:31:19] It was really important to Keith

[01:31:20] to make sure that you weren't on one linear path as well.

[01:31:24] So with the code,

[01:31:25] they were able to use a lot of the video assets,

[01:31:29] cut them up in various ways

[01:31:31] and make their own paths,

[01:31:33] which was really cool.

[01:31:34] So kind of on a high level

[01:31:37] with the code,

[01:31:38] you shoot what, two ramps

[01:31:39] and then you can start a battle.

[01:31:41] Yeah.

[01:31:42] And then you choose which

[01:31:43] Kaiju you're battling against.

[01:31:45] Yeah, you want a battle.

[01:31:46] Which I think that was one of the few restrictions

[01:31:48] is they couldn't use clips

[01:31:50] with Hedora in it, the smog monster.

[01:31:53] So they had to use like,

[01:31:55] they made their own.

[01:31:57] So they could use this likeness

[01:31:58] but they had to make it from scratch

[01:31:59] and couldn't use the movie clip,

[01:32:00] which was bizarre.

[01:32:01] Yeah, well he has a really tough agent.

[01:32:04] Ah!

[01:32:05] Oh, yeah, Jaguar.

[01:32:06] He's in there too.

[01:32:07] I forgot.

[01:32:07] They've got like everybody.

[01:32:09] Everybody can think of his in this game.

[01:32:11] So then the other thing is you can summon an ally

[01:32:14] so you can get like a buddy to help you out

[01:32:17] like a mothra I think, right?

[01:32:19] Mothra is your friend.

[01:32:20] And then they team up against.

[01:32:22] And Gyrus is your friend.

[01:32:24] So there's a lot going on.

[01:32:27] But let's talk about, okay, now that we've fond over it.

[01:32:30] Oh yes.

[01:32:31] Let's talk about a couple of the things

[01:32:35] that people rag on.

[01:32:37] Okay, one of them is that the era of Godzilla

[01:32:41] that they used for the art,

[01:32:42] which Zombie Yeti, the master that he is,

[01:32:46] they went with like the comic bookie Godzilla

[01:32:49] which kind of looks more like...

[01:32:50] Super bright.

[01:32:52] Yeah, super bright, not quite as gray or

[01:32:55] kind of muted colors.

[01:32:57] It's more of a bright color.

[01:32:59] Looks a little bit more like a cucumber.

[01:33:01] Do you have thoughts on that?

[01:33:02] Eh, he still looks like Godzilla to me.

[01:33:04] I had more issues with the figurine they used.

[01:33:08] Okay, so the figurine that they used

[01:33:10] for Godzilla on the back left behind the collapsing bridge,

[01:33:14] Mech to the left of the door.

[01:33:16] What's going on there?

[01:33:17] That he's green.

[01:33:20] I know he's green on the art, but

[01:33:22] it doesn't, and he's too small compared to like the Mecha Godzilla.

[01:33:26] He looks like Mecha Godzilla twice the size is him.

[01:33:30] One thing that does upset you,

[01:33:31] and you've said this multiple times on the podcast,

[01:33:35] is you don't like when scale is off.

[01:33:37] Yeah, so I have a different Godzilla in mind.

[01:33:40] One that's much bigger and the scale is correct.

[01:33:42] Another thing that I find kind of strange is that

[01:33:45] that the Mecha Godzilla with the tummy grab behind the rotating

[01:33:51] target spinny.

[01:33:52] All the turntable.

[01:33:53] Yeah, with a spinner riding.

[01:33:54] We forgot to mention that.

[01:33:55] Super awesome, which is his defense shield, I think.

[01:33:58] One thing that I find particularly unrealistic is he's cut in half,

[01:34:02] and when you lift up the play field,

[01:34:04] there's no legs under there.

[01:34:05] Well, no.

[01:34:06] No.

[01:34:07] Jesus.

[01:34:08] So there are some gripes to be had.

[01:34:11] A lot of it around art, which I think is not actually that.

[01:34:15] I think all that, all that gravy art is good.

[01:34:17] Come on.

[01:34:18] The art is amazing.

[01:34:20] I mean, this, this is like their best selling game.

[01:34:22] Yeah.

[01:34:22] They've ever done.

[01:34:23] I don't know if it sold as much as like,

[01:34:25] when they were daddy's like Star Wars.

[01:34:27] Was there a number one seller?

[01:34:29] I don't know if it sold that much, but this is definitely,

[01:34:33] do you think it sold 8,000 units?

[01:34:35] More than that, I would say.

[01:34:36] You think I, did you think it hit 10?

[01:34:38] I think it did.

[01:34:40] I think if it hit 10, we would have heard.

[01:34:42] Don't you?

[01:34:43] I would think they would have announced something like,

[01:34:46] like there's no way that Keith Ellman would not walk into, you know,

[01:34:49] Papa or something, it'd be like sold 10,000 and then just walk out.

[01:34:53] Like, come on.

[01:34:54] I tell everybody.

[01:34:55] But I think we keep saying they sold.

[01:34:57] They sold.

[01:34:57] They're still selling these.

[01:34:59] This is still in production.

[01:35:00] Not only is it production, they made another version of it.

[01:35:03] The 70th anniversary, Black and White and Red.

[01:35:06] Which I think is cool.

[01:35:07] Even though it's the same game just with Black and White and Red.

[01:35:11] 70th anniversary.

[01:35:12] Can you believe it's been 70 years?

[01:35:14] Yes.

[01:35:15] Man.

[01:35:16] Godzilla's old man.

[01:35:17] So is this Ellman's masterpiece?

[01:35:19] Ah, I mean, as far as selling games, yes.

[01:35:22] I'm still partial to Jurassic Park, honestly still.

[01:35:26] Okay, that's fair.

[01:35:27] As far as pure gameplay and just the layout.

[01:35:31] But as a Godzilla fan, I mean,

[01:35:34] you couldn't ask for a better version.

[01:35:37] So again, I'm an okay player.

[01:35:39] I'm not really great.

[01:35:40] Anytime I play to tournament,

[01:35:41] like if it's a real tournament, I'm like,

[01:35:44] lower half.

[01:35:45] If it's a local tournament,

[01:35:46] I'm like,

[01:35:48] just out of the playoffs or I'm first one out of the playoffs.

[01:35:51] So local tournaments aren't real tournaments.

[01:35:53] That's mean.

[01:35:54] That's right.

[01:35:54] So I'm like first out of playoffs or just barely making it in.

[01:35:59] Like, I'm an okay player.

[01:36:00] I find when I play this game,

[01:36:04] I feel like I'm accomplishing so much.

[01:36:08] There's so much going on.

[01:36:09] I'm collecting fighter jets.

[01:36:11] I'm doing tailwips.

[01:36:13] I got, I'm charging up like electrical stuff.

[01:36:18] I'm locking things in a building.

[01:36:20] I'm fighting it.

[01:36:20] Like, I have no idea necessarily what's going on.

[01:36:24] But man, I feel like I'm accomplishing everything.

[01:36:27] And by doing that, I feel like it's taking away

[01:36:30] some of that accomplishment.

[01:36:31] Oh, it's too nice.

[01:36:32] You wanted to say you failed sometimes.

[01:36:34] No, it's just, it feels like it's just,

[01:36:36] it's too rewarding, right?

[01:36:38] It's like I'm always eating cake.

[01:36:41] So I don't know if it's like,

[01:36:43] I don't know.

[01:36:43] So then when I actually get like a really good slice of cake,

[01:36:46] I can't tell the difference between the cake I've just been eating

[01:36:49] and this really fancy $500 cake.

[01:36:51] Like, it's just, it's a bit too much.

[01:36:54] And it's fine.

[01:36:55] I still like it.

[01:36:56] It's still a masterpiece.

[01:36:57] But that is a bit of the gripe.

[01:36:58] Is I feel like I am getting everything?

[01:37:01] Like I always say, from some more from the business perspective,

[01:37:05] the amount of games they sold, it's perfect.

[01:37:07] There are no problems.

[01:37:09] As far as endurance concerned, it is perfect.

[01:37:12] I don't know.

[01:37:13] Maybe it's like when they made the Adams family, right?

[01:37:17] And they're like, ooh, did we do too much?

[01:37:19] Did we, did we put too many modes?

[01:37:21] Did we, is the code too confusing?

[01:37:23] You mean Adams family, the game that everyone's these days says they hate,

[01:37:27] even though it sold like 20,000 units and still commands like a ridiculous price?

[01:37:31] Right.

[01:37:32] So it's, I feel like it's almost the same thing.

[01:37:34] Like the code has now gone to a whole other level,

[01:37:36] where you're like being rewarded for everything and everything is wonderful

[01:37:40] and you get a big hug all the time.

[01:37:42] Anyway, the thing about code, and I figured,

[01:37:45] might as well bring this up now.

[01:37:47] One of the things, and I had discussions with other people about this,

[01:37:51] and it kind of an agreement, the Ellen team,

[01:37:54] it's just, it's different than any other team.

[01:37:57] And that typically in these teams, you'll have the person who does the play field,

[01:38:02] and they're like the project manager and they're coordinating everything.

[01:38:05] Then you'll have the main software person, and they're the one coming up with the rules,

[01:38:10] you know, all that stuff.

[01:38:12] On the Ellen team,

[01:38:13] Ellen's doing the play field and he's doing the rules.

[01:38:17] Like he's the one like, I want the game to do this,

[01:38:20] and they make it do that.

[01:38:22] And it's different than any other team.

[01:38:24] No other team is like that.

[01:38:26] And I don't know if any other team can do that.

[01:38:28] I think it's, I think he's got all that capacity in his brain somehow.

[01:38:32] And the other thing he said, the other thing that,

[01:38:34] and I don't know if you feel this way, like all these games released now, not just Stern,

[01:38:39] but they're generally released, they're always incomplete code.

[01:38:42] Like they're not at 1.0, they're not done yet.

[01:38:45] And a lot of them, you'll play and you can tell like,

[01:38:47] man, this game's missing all kinds of stuff.

[01:38:49] Like this is, this is like alpha.

[01:38:51] This is like alpha level code.

[01:38:52] Oh, I live through James Bond.

[01:38:53] I know.

[01:38:54] You never get that with an L-Win game.

[01:38:57] Like no matter how early the code is,

[01:38:59] if it, when it's released, when the game's out,

[01:39:01] you like, you feel like you got to play a complete game.

[01:39:04] Even though if there's not a ton of stuff in it yet,

[01:39:06] you never feel like it's at alpha.

[01:39:09] It's like Keith gets it a little bit like he's like,

[01:39:11] I got to have these things.

[01:39:13] These particular things in the game for people to feel, yeah.

[01:39:16] And the other thing, I can't remember which game this was,

[01:39:20] but he said like,

[01:39:21] they purposely, the game was released at a certain code level

[01:39:24] because he wanted to see where people went with it.

[01:39:28] Yeah.

[01:39:29] To decide where he would go with it.

[01:39:31] Because he might have a feature that you didn't think much of,

[01:39:33] but the, you know, most of your players are like,

[01:39:36] we really like this feature.

[01:39:37] Like, okay, I guess we'll go that direction instead.

[01:39:40] Like a lot of teams, like clearly you can just sit back and say,

[01:39:44] I got to have the basic multi-ball.

[01:39:45] And I got to have this mode in that mode.

[01:39:47] But it's more than just that.

[01:39:49] Keith for some reason understands that each game is uniquely different.

[01:39:53] And each game needs to have these basic building blocks in place.

[01:39:58] Not just the multi-ball, not just the this, not just the that,

[01:40:01] but it's got to have this basic thing.

[01:40:03] And then what he's doing is he's kind of tweaking and refining.

[01:40:06] We're a lot of the other code teams and teams in general.

[01:40:10] What they do is they're like, okay, I got to have those basic things in.

[01:40:13] But then they will absolutely change like the way the scoring works on those things.

[01:40:19] Or the way things stack because they're like, oh, I don't want to stack that with that,

[01:40:23] because then it'll create this problem.

[01:40:25] Where it's like Keith has already thought that out.

[01:40:27] It's pretty crazy that he's able to do that.

[01:40:30] But the thing is it's also pretty crazy that his team is able to back him up with that.

[01:40:35] And I think people always like, we need games released at one point.

[01:40:38] Oh, like complete code.

[01:40:39] Like, not really.

[01:40:40] No, don't do that.

[01:40:41] I don't, because do you want it like a got leaps situation where here it is,

[01:40:45] it's done.

[01:40:45] And then you find out something about it.

[01:40:47] It's like, nope, it's done.

[01:40:48] And nor do you want to have the situation we've had with with Wic and X-Men where it's like,

[01:40:54] this is terrible.

[01:40:55] We have to change everything.

[01:40:57] Okay.

[01:40:58] If Godzilla is Keith L.

[01:41:00] one's blockbuster, his next pin is really like his, his like indie art house,

[01:41:06] Darling.

[01:41:07] And that's James Bond 007 60th anniversary edition.

[01:41:11] And it's a spy James Bond film series pin artwork by Kevin O'Connor programming

[01:41:19] like Mark Pinacho, Jerry Thompson on sound.

[01:41:23] And it's got classic Bond clips and music by John Barry, the James Bond legend.

[01:41:31] So Harrison Drake also did a lot of the engineering here along with Robert

[01:41:36] Blakeman.

[01:41:37] So this is a pretty unique pin in pinball today.

[01:41:42] Is that right?

[01:41:43] Yeah, single level play field.

[01:41:45] It's supposed to be like an old throwback machine.

[01:41:48] It has, it has reels in it like an EM.

[01:41:52] It's a, it's like a homage to the older pins.

[01:41:55] The last version of this that Stern did was really the Beatles.

[01:42:00] And I think the Beatles is an amazing pinball machine.

[01:42:04] And I would totally have one of those if I had money.

[01:42:08] Well, speaking of money, that was the issue with this machine.

[01:42:12] This machine is polarizing for a couple of reasons.

[01:42:18] That first reason was the cost.

[01:42:20] Do you remember the cost of this pinball machine?

[01:42:22] $20,000.

[01:42:24] So a lot of manufacturers will set a suggested retail price.

[01:42:30] And then they'll send it out to the distribution network.

[01:42:33] And those distributors will just sort of, oh, I'll sell it for this or that or whatever.

[01:42:37] But some of them in fact demanded like $25,000.

[01:42:41] Because there's only 500 of these pinball machines made world-wide.

[01:42:45] Now as a huge James Bond fan who has James Bond memorabilia,

[01:42:52] who's who can quote like every machine or every movie has the pinball machine in his basement.

[01:42:58] Like loves James Bond.

[01:43:01] I can tell you that there are some crazy collectors in the James Bond kind of background universe.

[01:43:09] That would totally buy this.

[01:43:10] That would totally buy this.

[01:43:12] And most of them would be like affluent, like European,

[01:43:17] people or Americans.

[01:43:20] But boy, oh boy, I think they missed the mark.

[01:43:24] A little bit on this.

[01:43:25] I think what piss people off is it's an L one game.

[01:43:29] So everyone wants it.

[01:43:30] But then it's priced completely out of where most people are going to be able to ever buy this thing.

[01:43:35] When the Beatles came out, they were like, this is the most expensive license of all time.

[01:43:39] And it was like a fortune at like what, like $10,000, $12,000.

[01:43:45] Something like that.

[01:43:46] And then this thing was just ridiculous.

[01:43:49] It was ridiculous.

[01:43:50] But it wasn't for pinheads.

[01:43:51] This truly was not for the pinball players.

[01:43:55] This was for rich bond collectors.

[01:43:57] Yes.

[01:43:58] And I think the issue here, one of the other things that steamed a lot of the clams in the pinball hobbyist,

[01:44:06] you know, groups were that this was the James Bond pin that most of the pinheads wanted.

[01:44:13] Which was done by Keith L one was every James Bond.

[01:44:17] Every bond.

[01:44:18] Not just Sean Connery.

[01:44:20] This is one of the few things that has that, like as far as,

[01:44:24] or like I can't think of any other of the James Bond games at all that have like every bond on it.

[01:44:30] So you've got Connery?

[01:44:32] If it's George Lazard Bees.

[01:44:33] Lazard Bees on there.

[01:44:35] Like come on, he was in one film, one of the greatest.

[01:44:37] But come on.

[01:44:38] And then you got Roger Moore, Daniel Craig,

[01:44:41] Pierce Brosnan, and Timothy Dalton in two films.

[01:44:44] You've got them all.

[01:44:45] You've got A job, you've got JAWS, you've got Trevellian,

[01:44:49] you've got LaShif, you've got Blowfeld, you've got Zorin,

[01:44:51] you've got all the bonds are holding guns.

[01:44:54] They're all there.

[01:44:55] Like it's, yeah, it's like the thing.

[01:44:57] But what we didn't get that, we got George Gomez and Lonnie Robb,

[01:45:01] which are fine.

[01:45:03] George Gomez, my favorite designer.

[01:45:06] Lonnie Robb?

[01:45:06] You said it was the greatest game ever just a few minutes ago.

[01:45:09] It is the greatest game ever,

[01:45:11] but it could have been the greatest game that we will ever see ever without being surpassed.

[01:45:17] Okay.

[01:45:18] Okay.

[01:45:19] It really kind of upset folk because this was not for you people.

[01:45:24] It has four spinners.

[01:45:25] It has four spinners.

[01:45:26] Four spinners.

[01:45:27] Keith L. Winstead, we wanted to honor the early days of Bond and pinball at the same time.

[01:45:33] Did he do that?

[01:45:35] Oh yeah.

[01:45:35] Look at all the drop targets.

[01:45:37] Look at the in lines.

[01:45:38] He got in line drop targets, all the regular drop targets.

[01:45:41] He got a spinny toy.

[01:45:43] He made flow without any ramps.

[01:45:46] Four spinners.

[01:45:48] He got reels.

[01:45:49] In the back box, instead of an LCD,

[01:45:52] they have actual physical moving reels rotate.

[01:45:57] They had to prove to people that they were real.

[01:45:59] They everyone kept thinking they were video.

[01:46:01] I remember that.

[01:46:02] It's like, that's not actually real.

[01:46:04] That's video.

[01:46:05] It's like, no, they're actually reals.

[01:46:07] So I think the thing is here that trying to get around the requirements of what is to be

[01:46:13] on the LCD screen because it was such a pain in the ass.

[01:46:18] During the other James Bond, the Gomez did with Lonnie,

[01:46:22] that they probably said, let's stay away from all of that in this pin somehow.

[01:46:26] And they came up with this gimmick.

[01:46:28] And unfortunately, I don't like this gimmick.

[01:46:32] I don't.

[01:46:33] The thing with the movies was, I believe you can use movie clips,

[01:46:36] but you can't have any graphics on top of them.

[01:46:38] And you can't interrupt them under certain circumstances.

[01:46:41] So yeah, that's why it doesn't have any, yeah, that's the way it's the way it is.

[01:46:46] And you can't use any cult, like you can't cut callouts or clips from the film.

[01:46:50] And there were so many amazing opportunities to be able to take things that

[01:46:54] characters said at certain times.

[01:46:56] Like there's not very many quips of James Bond

[01:47:00] played unless it's in a clip.

[01:47:03] Right?

[01:47:03] Like he doesn't make any of his gags or jokes or double entendras unless it's in the videos.

[01:47:08] Yeah, my favorites.

[01:47:10] But he does that, but it's on the video.

[01:47:12] He doesn't just say it when you shoot a target.

[01:47:15] So like it's disappointing.

[01:47:17] The spinner, the odd job hat spinner.

[01:47:19] Do you see that in the middle of the play field?

[01:47:21] I do.

[01:47:22] So awesome.

[01:47:24] That spinner was originally supposed to be on George Gomez's game.

[01:47:28] And it was supposed to be in the middle of the play field.

[01:47:30] However, George did not like it because it messed up some of his shots.

[01:47:36] So he removed it.

[01:47:37] And Keith is like, yonk and stuck it in there.

[01:47:41] I think, I think it, I think that was a mistake.

[01:47:43] I think that still should have been in the other pin.

[01:47:46] The greatest pin of all time.

[01:47:47] Yes.

[01:47:47] The greatest pin of all time.

[01:47:48] Would have been better.

[01:47:51] But they read a no-word space as I assume.

[01:47:53] Have you played this?

[01:47:55] Yes.

[01:47:55] Is it great?

[01:47:58] It was fine.

[01:47:59] It's the same feeling I had.

[01:48:00] It plays shorter, so you'd really have to have it

[01:48:03] and play a bunch of games on it for a period of time.

[01:48:06] It was at, uh, fantastic.

[01:48:08] And I played it quite a few times.

[01:48:09] And I'm like, hey, this is kind of fun.

[01:48:11] But I kind of, I prefer the other pin.

[01:48:13] Is it $20,000 of fun?

[01:48:16] No, not even remotely close.

[01:48:18] Okay.

[01:48:19] It's fun.

[01:48:21] But I don't know.

[01:48:21] There's one of these for sale new in a box

[01:48:24] on like a forum here in Canada.

[01:48:26] And they still want, I don't know, $23,000 Canadian.

[01:48:32] And I'm like, there's no way.

[01:48:33] There's no way.

[01:48:35] What is that like 5K US?

[01:48:39] The art was also panned.

[01:48:40] Because it's like a mixture of hand drawn and photographs.

[01:48:45] But some of the photographs are more washed out

[01:48:48] than the others because you can tell they were taken

[01:48:50] in different eras with different cameras.

[01:48:52] And it was clearly a licensure requirement

[01:48:54] that you're not able to criss-franchi the art.

[01:48:57] Yes.

[01:48:58] So he can't take the art and jazz it up.

[01:49:01] It's like, no, you got to use the photos.

[01:49:03] It's like, so it, they kind of look like.

[01:49:06] Like Roger Moore is washed out.

[01:49:08] James Bond.

[01:49:09] Like, sorry, Sean Connery is more like it almost looks hand drawn.

[01:49:13] The owns Bond now.

[01:49:16] So here's the thing.

[01:49:17] James Bond licensing is quite complicated.

[01:49:20] So there's a company called Die Jack.

[01:49:23] Die Jack owns like the IP.

[01:49:27] But then like the movie rights,

[01:49:30] those were owned by the broccoli's.

[01:49:33] They've sold the movie rights and everything to Amazon.

[01:49:37] Amazon.

[01:49:38] Okay.

[01:49:38] And then my understanding is that the licensing has also moved

[01:49:42] from Die Jack somehow.

[01:49:44] But it's, I don't know how this is going to work out.

[01:49:47] And you know what?

[01:49:48] It's pretty scary to think Amazon might have James Bond.

[01:49:52] It's going to be great.

[01:49:53] It'll be a whole James Bond universe.

[01:49:56] You'll have the adventures of money penny.

[01:49:58] You'll have a maybe cue.

[01:49:59] We'll get his own show.

[01:50:01] Like where he invents all kinds of new spy equipment.

[01:50:04] It's going to be great.

[01:50:05] Yeah, it'll be great.

[01:50:06] Just whatever one wants.

[01:50:07] Yeah.

[01:50:07] But the only saving grace is the Denny Velnov

[01:50:10] apparently has signed on to be the director

[01:50:12] of the next James Bond film.

[01:50:13] I don't know.

[01:50:14] Is that the dude guy?

[01:50:15] That's the dude guy.

[01:50:16] That's the only reason I recognize that name.

[01:50:18] I just remember it was like a French sounding name.

[01:50:21] The guy just from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

[01:50:25] So how do we follow up an indie art house?

[01:50:29] We go with the first summer blockbuster.

[01:50:33] Summer blockbuster of all time.

[01:50:36] Jaws.

[01:50:37] Which just had its 50th anniversary.

[01:50:40] I think I just watched this with my kids.

[01:50:42] It was my kids.

[01:50:43] They loved it.

[01:50:44] Actually it's playing in theaters now.

[01:50:46] My kids love this film.

[01:50:48] I love this film.

[01:50:50] Wait a minute.

[01:50:50] You had your kids watch this?

[01:50:52] Of course I did.

[01:50:52] Yeah, they're telling nudity.

[01:50:54] There's people getting their limbs chopped off.

[01:50:56] Yeah, they're ten and ten and eight.

[01:50:58] And they loved every minute.

[01:51:00] So this is Keith Elwin's design.

[01:51:04] We got Harrison Drake on engineering software

[01:51:06] by Elizabeth Giskey, who is a new new comor.

[01:51:10] Rick Nagel, Michael Bernard on artwork,

[01:51:14] who is a new name as well.

[01:51:15] Jerry Thompson on Sound.

[01:51:20] It's a great game.

[01:51:22] Yeah, it's, remember, it's not just Jaws.

[01:51:25] It's technically Jaws one through four I think.

[01:51:28] It goes up to like Jaws revenge.

[01:51:30] Even though I don't remember seeing too much stuff

[01:51:32] from the other Jaws, Jaws is in the game.

[01:51:34] This coming from the guy who says

[01:51:36] there's only three Star Wars films.

[01:51:37] That's true.

[01:51:38] The weird thing about Jaws was this was a game.

[01:51:41] This license was out there for a while

[01:51:43] and was rumored.

[01:51:45] And Jersey Jack supposedly turned this down

[01:51:47] because they would only get the shark.

[01:51:49] Yeah, so you can only have the shark.

[01:51:51] There's no video clips.

[01:51:53] When Sturard got this, I was like,

[01:51:54] well, how's this going to work?

[01:51:56] And then it came out and literally they had like everything.

[01:51:59] Yeah, so everybody assumed it was going to be like,

[01:52:01] like Jurassic Park, right?

[01:52:02] Where it's like the the Jaws universe.

[01:52:05] I mean, they didn't have Brody.

[01:52:06] They didn't eat Roy Shider.

[01:52:08] They didn't have, because they couldn't get a hat.

[01:52:10] What is it? They couldn't get a hold of his family.

[01:52:12] Like his family would not respond to them

[01:52:14] to give them permission to use his likeness.

[01:52:16] But they could use it in the actual video clips.

[01:52:18] So he's in the game.

[01:52:20] He is basically your hero.

[01:52:21] You're kind of playing as him.

[01:52:23] But it's cool.

[01:52:25] Jaws is the 1975 American thriller film by Steven Spielberg.

[01:52:30] Stars Roy Schneider as the Shider.

[01:52:33] Shider.

[01:52:33] Shider.

[01:52:35] Everyone says his name, Rob.

[01:52:36] There's no end.

[01:52:37] Roy Shider as the police chief of Martin Brody,

[01:52:41] who was helped by a marine biologist who was Richard Dreyfus

[01:52:45] and a professional shark hunter, Robert Shaw.

[01:52:48] Quint.

[01:52:48] Yes.

[01:52:49] Yeah, it's awesome in the taking of Pellum123.

[01:52:52] Hunts a man eating great white shark

[01:52:54] that attacks beachgoers in New England,

[01:52:57] summer resort town.

[01:52:59] It was shot mostly on location in Martha's Vineyard

[01:53:02] in Massachusetts.

[01:53:04] From May to October of 1974,

[01:53:06] Jaws saw some major,

[01:53:09] major motion picture issues when it came to

[01:53:13] malfunctioning shark toy thing

[01:53:17] and trying to shoot it on the water.

[01:53:19] Yes, it was still in the Spielberg's assistance

[01:53:21] and actually doing it in the ocean.

[01:53:23] Went way over budget.

[01:53:24] He thought he was going to be fired.

[01:53:26] It was really, it was really, really a whole thing.

[01:53:30] It brings out John Williams in his like beginnings

[01:53:35] as a musical composer.

[01:53:39] It had a $9 million budget.

[01:53:42] It made 477.9 million in the box office

[01:53:47] and destroyed the entire beach season

[01:53:50] for probably.

[01:53:51] Ah, John Williams has been around since the 50s.

[01:53:54] FYI, two in movies.

[01:53:56] Yeah, but he like really hit it

[01:53:58] when he got into blockbusters, I think.

[01:54:00] Well, when he got with Spielberg, that's for sure.

[01:54:02] Right, like him and

[01:54:06] you know what's crazy?

[01:54:06] You know what's crazy?

[01:54:08] Jaws are shot.

[01:54:09] Robert Shaw is it.

[01:54:10] Yeah, that was a suggestion from Spielberg.

[01:54:12] Hey, you should use my guy, John Williams,

[01:54:14] to do your Star Wars movie.

[01:54:16] That worked out.

[01:54:17] Robert Shaw is in two pinball machines.

[01:54:21] Oh, technically.

[01:54:22] Maybe three is he in the $20,000 one?

[01:54:24] He's in your James Bond, your greatest game of all time.

[01:54:28] He's one of the henchmen.

[01:54:29] From Russia with love, he's the main henchman.

[01:54:32] So he's in two games, possibly three if he's in the $20,000 one.

[01:54:36] I just thought that was funny.

[01:54:38] I've always celebrated his own in games,

[01:54:39] who won't be in games.

[01:54:40] And he got Robert Shaw, who probably is

[01:54:42] not while he died in like 78.

[01:54:44] So he has no ideas in all these games.

[01:54:47] I guess his family's been very accommodating.

[01:54:49] Yes, so what about the game?

[01:54:51] Wow!

[01:54:52] That blew my mind.

[01:54:53] It blew your mind.

[01:54:55] Yeah, he's good as a henchman in that.

[01:54:57] He is so good.

[01:54:58] Yes.

[01:54:59] So good.

[01:55:00] So the narrative and design of this game is pretty cool.

[01:55:04] It's designed very much like the film,

[01:55:08] to create like some suspense intention.

[01:55:11] I love it.

[01:55:12] And hurry ups, like it's really good.

[01:55:15] You put Shawman in the water, to get the shark out,

[01:55:18] then you got to hit him with the harp,

[01:55:20] get the barrels on him.

[01:55:22] It's so good.

[01:55:23] All this stuff from the movie.

[01:55:24] So you got like beach attacks

[01:55:26] that lead into an investigation,

[01:55:29] and then you're on the boat to hunt him.

[01:55:32] And it's really cool the way that it goes there.

[01:55:34] So you can tell that Keith understands the IP.

[01:55:39] He's probably a really big fan of the film.

[01:55:42] Well, Keith says,

[01:55:43] I wanted the player to feel the tension of the hunt.

[01:55:46] That third act is everything.

[01:55:48] So the chumline is like a drop target that pops up

[01:55:52] under the play field and moves left to right.

[01:55:55] And it's a fin.

[01:55:56] And it's a fin.

[01:55:57] And there's some issues with that,

[01:55:58] because it's sometimes a craze air balls.

[01:56:00] Yeah, well, it was even worse.

[01:56:01] They originally tried to make the drop target shaped like a fin.

[01:56:05] And what happened there is the ball just went everywhere when it hit it.

[01:56:08] By everywhere, like fly out of the game,

[01:56:10] all kinds of crazy stuff.

[01:56:11] So they couldn't do that.

[01:56:13] Yeah, so they kind of did that.

[01:56:14] Now, that's in every model, pro and premium.

[01:56:18] It also has a really cool small flipper on the right side.

[01:56:22] That can actually be auto flipped up and kind of lock balls

[01:56:26] that shoots then drop targets on the other side of the play field,

[01:56:29] which is super cool.

[01:56:30] Yeah, you can also shoot up the lane with it.

[01:56:32] It's super cool.

[01:56:34] It hits way more things than you think it does.

[01:56:36] It's really well placed.

[01:56:38] It's very well designed.

[01:56:40] Now, the premium alley has a boat that lifts up,

[01:56:43] that has a captive ball.

[01:56:46] And then it lifts up and the shark comes up and you bash the shark in the face.

[01:56:49] It also has the Orca boat on the left side, which is like a mini play field.

[01:56:54] That's an upper play field.

[01:56:55] This is Keith Ellwyn's first upper play field.

[01:56:58] He did a pretty good job.

[01:57:00] Yeah, it's got one left flipper and three right flippers in this game.

[01:57:03] So here's the thing, shark no eat ball.

[01:57:06] Ron, why shark no eat ball?

[01:57:07] Because they tried it and it didn't work.

[01:57:09] Shark no eat ball, no fun.

[01:57:11] Ellyn says, I wanted the shark to be the star.

[01:57:14] But also, we wanted you to feel like you're in the water on the boat

[01:57:18] and under constant threat.

[01:57:19] They tried to make the shark eat the ball.

[01:57:22] It was not fun.

[01:57:24] As well as it was a licensor requirement that the shark pop up from the play field.

[01:57:30] The shark had to scare you like in the film.

[01:57:33] That was a thing, a licensor requirement.

[01:57:36] So if you wanted the shark to eat the ball and pop up out of the play field,

[01:57:40] it just ended up not being all that fun.

[01:57:42] Now, if Keith had another six months, could he have figured it out and made it more fun?

[01:57:46] Yeah, probably.

[01:57:48] But I don't think it's actually that.

[01:57:50] I think it's great the way it is.

[01:57:51] I love it.

[01:57:53] Another Ellyn first, actual video clips in narrative format.

[01:57:59] He had video clips in Godzilla.

[01:58:03] But that was interspaced a lot with their own custom graphics.

[01:58:07] Here is an actual video clip movie.

[01:58:10] Like when you think about film, what do you think about that?

[01:58:13] Do you think it's cool?

[01:58:15] Does he pull it off?

[01:58:17] Yeah, I mean, when you do the, shoot the barrel, go, go, go, and it's right on the screen.

[01:58:22] Like all the scenes from the movie.

[01:58:24] So good callouts.

[01:58:26] It's got great callouts, finally.

[01:58:28] Yeah, they got, well, the calls from the movie and they somehow got richer drivers in there.

[01:58:32] They got richer drivers.

[01:58:34] Yeah.

[01:58:35] The actual richer drivers.

[01:58:37] And he sounds enough like richer drivers to still be richer drivers.

[01:58:40] Yeah, it's not like richer drivers' brother,

[01:58:43] who's the guy that does other things when richer drivers needs to talk about things.

[01:58:47] Tom Hanks.

[01:58:48] To be fair, Tom Hanks's brother does sound just like Tom Hanks, so.

[01:58:52] So it's pretty, like it comes together really, really well.

[01:58:55] However, not everybody loves this game.

[01:58:59] Aww.

[01:59:00] Which I find strange.

[01:59:02] It also has all these extra little mini games that they put in there.

[01:59:06] You talk about that.

[01:59:07] I just remember they exist.

[01:59:08] I don't remember what they are.

[01:59:10] So like the video mode has a JAWS 3D thing and it comes with 3D glasses and you could put it in.

[01:59:15] Oh yeah, yeah.

[01:59:15] I was thinking more than many games they put in later,

[01:59:17] where you can just play a completely different game.

[01:59:20] Very well done.

[01:59:21] In general, I think this is a great game.

[01:59:23] I don't think it is Godzilla.

[01:59:26] I don't think it's Jurassic Park, but I, you know,

[01:59:29] I haven't played any Godzilla, so I haven't played any King Kong.

[01:59:32] I think it might be some of the biggest game played difference between his pro and premium,

[01:59:37] because as the upper play feel, and I did feel that that added a lot.

[01:59:42] Like I would prefer the premium if I was going to get one of these.

[01:59:46] Yeah, agreed.

[01:59:48] It also has a 180 ramp.

[01:59:50] Keith still always repeating and recycling 180 ramps.

[01:59:55] And a spinning disc thingy.

[01:59:56] Yeah.

[01:59:57] So we're starting to see now, I think a lot of Keith's fingerprints.

[02:00:04] He's in enough games now.

[02:00:06] He's made enough games that we're starting to see similarities and commonalities.

[02:00:11] However, he's still finding ways to make things very different, which is really impressive.

[02:00:17] I'm really impressed with how he's still able to find kind of weird shots here and there.

[02:00:22] But he's starting to develop a style, right?

[02:00:24] And I would say, I think Joseph's probably the longest they took to get to 1.0.

[02:00:28] Yeah, it took a little bit of massaging.

[02:00:31] And they also released the new 50th anniversary jaws, which is a premium with a sticker

[02:00:38] and the art package that everybody wanted, because the premium art package

[02:00:43] didn't go over really well.

[02:00:44] What's I don't understand?

[02:00:46] I'm not as infatuated with the movie poster that everyone, you know,

[02:00:51] the one where he's coming up, iconic movie poster, the woman's swimming, and he's coming up.

[02:00:56] I liked the premium translate, where you're basically quint about to get eaten.

[02:01:02] Yeah, it's cool.

[02:01:03] I think the 50th anniversary one, it's got like the whole top section of the

[02:01:07] side art is just white.

[02:01:09] Yeah, I get you.

[02:01:09] If you're looking for something more original, this is the way to go.

[02:01:13] If you're hardcore movie people, you're probably going to want the pro, the LA, or the 50th.

[02:01:18] And I would say that this is one of his longest players.

[02:01:22] I think Keith has figured something out.

[02:01:24] People like long playing games.

[02:01:26] Uh, not all of us.

[02:01:28] No, I agree.

[02:01:28] I much prefer short.

[02:01:30] I like the Steve Richie, Askicker, John Borg, Askicking games.

[02:01:34] I prefer those types of games, but I'm not everybody.

[02:01:38] I think people like to stand up next to a game and play twice as long as you would on a

[02:01:45] Richie and do better.

[02:01:47] And I think when it comes to online reviews on Pinside, the longer the player

[02:01:54] game, the longer the playing game that you can build, the higher up that list you're going to go.

[02:02:00] I think people give Steve Richie a hard time or John Borg a hard time because their games are hard.

[02:02:05] Really?

[02:02:06] Spider-Man's pretty easy.

[02:02:07] 24-place forever.

[02:02:09] But that was that was a kind of a, like that's not, that's like the anomaly.

[02:02:12] T3-place forever, I can go on.

[02:02:17] Shut up, Ryan.

[02:02:18] Every Keith L. when plays long.

[02:02:20] Uh, my Jurassic Park, I could never get long games on that thing.

[02:02:24] It's because it's got one shot too many.

[02:02:26] No.

[02:02:28] How about to James Bond, the $20,000 one that doesn't play long?

[02:02:31] Yeah, but nobody plays that game because it's not around anywhere because it's $20,000.

[02:02:36] Keith makes longer playing games and I think people appreciate that more and they inevitably

[02:02:44] think a game is a better game if it plays longer.

[02:02:49] I don't think that that's right or wrong, but I think that's what it's like different strokes

[02:02:53] for different folks.

[02:02:54] I had Tron, an absolute ass kicker next to the Simpsons, which was a long player, great match.

[02:03:00] But if I have just one that is an ass kicker or one that's a long player, it kind of gets boring.

[02:03:06] Or you can just have, you can just buy a stars and you'll never be bored.

[02:03:10] The official game of Final Round pinball podcast.

[02:03:15] Who?

[02:03:15] I don't know that is.

[02:03:17] But what was I say to us?

[02:03:19] I like the art.

[02:03:20] I did like the art on this one.

[02:03:21] I mean, some people might say it's too blue.

[02:03:24] It's like you're in the freaking ocean.

[02:03:25] What color is this supposed to be?

[02:03:27] A lot of people said that it's the best theme integrated stern since Jurassic Park.

[02:03:32] The limited editions disappeared.

[02:03:34] Oh yeah.

[02:03:35] Tournament folk loved it for the most part,

[02:03:38] but they didn't love it as much as Jurassic Park and some of the others.

[02:03:41] Like all these Ellen games were mentioning.

[02:03:43] How many are no longer made?

[02:03:45] I think they're, I think they stopped making Iron Maiden.

[02:03:48] I did just recently this year, which is ridiculous.

[02:03:51] How about Avengers?

[02:03:52] Do they stop making that?

[02:03:55] Yes.

[02:03:55] Yeah.

[02:03:56] I think every other one he's done recently, right?

[02:03:58] Like the last six months.

[02:04:00] I think every other one he's done is still technically in production.

[02:04:04] Think about that.

[02:04:06] I don't think they have any other desires.

[02:04:07] I could say that.

[02:04:08] It's pretty, pretty, pretty.

[02:04:10] But that's not all.

[02:04:11] There's one more game.

[02:04:12] This is the 2025 released Monster Adventure theme.

[02:04:17] King Kong myth of Terror Island.

[02:04:20] Art work by Kevin O'Connor.

[02:04:22] Greg Ferris, who I thought retired.

[02:04:24] And Jeremy Packer, zombie Yeti.

[02:04:26] Programming by Rick Nagel.

[02:04:28] Sound by Jerry Thompson.

[02:04:30] Callouts by Brian Q.

[02:04:32] Quinn, who is the fellow that does all of these callouts.

[02:04:36] And Rick Ziff.

[02:04:41] Yeah.

[02:04:41] And Engineering by Harrison Drake.

[02:04:44] This game came out.

[02:04:47] And I have to say, I love King Kong.

[02:04:50] I like King Kong more than I like Godzilla.

[02:04:53] I've always kind of liked King Kong.

[02:04:56] I've always liked the idea of King Kong more.

[02:04:58] I like that kind of 1920s adventure.

[02:05:02] 1930s.

[02:05:05] Right?

[02:05:05] I really like that kind of aesthetic.

[02:05:08] I think it's cooler.

[02:05:10] It's less, it's cheesy, but it's less like cheesy, cheesy than Godzilla.

[02:05:15] I really, really love that movie with Adrian Brody and Jack Black.

[02:05:21] Oh, I hated that movie.

[02:05:23] Really?

[02:05:23] Yes.

[02:05:24] Oh, so there could be some parts that could be cut out to be honest.

[02:05:29] That was by what's this face, right?

[02:05:30] The Lord of the Rings guy, Peter Jackson.

[02:05:32] I was just like, yeah, I saw that in the theater and I'm like,

[02:05:35] when she was like ice skating with them or whatever,

[02:05:39] no, remember they were in the city and he's like on the ice or whatever,

[02:05:43] whatever the hell that was.

[02:05:46] No, I'm not.

[02:05:47] Everything is overdone in that movie.

[02:05:48] Like in the original movie, he fights like one T-Rex and this one,

[02:05:52] he fights like two of them.

[02:05:54] They they they re-institute the whole spiders

[02:05:57] attacking the guy scene.

[02:05:58] That was any original one and removed,

[02:06:00] but it's like so everything is just so over the top.

[02:06:03] It was the era in the 2000s where they're like,

[02:06:06] what can we do with CGI at it just then?

[02:06:09] If if I was going to watch a Peter Jackson movie, it would be brain dead.

[02:06:14] I don't know about that movie.

[02:06:15] But this is not based in any way on any of those films.

[02:06:18] This is based on the book.

[02:06:20] This isn't even based on skull island,

[02:06:23] which was the original island.

[02:06:25] This is based on the book, which that that whole thing is weird because the movie,

[02:06:30] they were making the movie and to try to get

[02:06:34] to drum up some buzz for the movie,

[02:06:36] they had like a book commission that came out a year before the movie,

[02:06:40] which is basically the same plot as the movie.

[02:06:42] But this has nothing to do with most of that.

[02:06:45] Yeah, does he still climbing a building?

[02:06:46] Well, so there you go.

[02:06:47] You got the high points.

[02:06:48] He's on an island somewhere.

[02:06:51] He's got a lady that he that he that he touches.

[02:06:53] It's not the Empire State Building because they can't because that's an extra license,

[02:06:57] but it's just a building.

[02:06:59] It's the Nagel oil oil building.

[02:07:02] It's got some stuff to it, but it's not the same.

[02:07:06] Because again, we're able to get the IP of

[02:07:09] King Kong.

[02:07:10] We're able to get a gorilla.

[02:07:11] We're able to get kind of the high points.

[02:07:12] But now we've got our own world that we can create.

[02:07:15] So we don't have as many handcuffs when it comes to

[02:07:19] movie clips or licensors and stuff.

[02:07:21] And like James Bond is a great example,

[02:07:23] you are handcuffed to deal with a lot of that stuff.

[02:07:27] This game, the play field was done, the art on the play field was done by Kevin O'Connor

[02:07:34] and it's to make it look like the original King Kong from Data East, which was never released.

[02:07:39] Yeah, that's how I recognize.

[02:07:40] As soon as I saw the play field art,

[02:07:42] because I've seen the prototype.

[02:07:44] And it looks different.

[02:07:45] When you look at it, you're like, this looks different because it's not zombie yeti.

[02:07:50] And you could tell that it's somebody who knows what they're doing because it's slightly different.

[02:07:54] It's got that 1990s look and aesthetic.

[02:07:57] And I kind of like it. It's different.

[02:07:59] It's very cool.

[02:08:00] But it's still got the purples.

[02:08:02] It's still got the greens.

[02:08:03] It's still got the oranges.

[02:08:05] It's really cool.

[02:08:06] Yeah, it was a three person team that did the art on this one.

[02:08:09] It's got a couple of really cool mechs.

[02:08:12] One of them is on the left side.

[02:08:13] There's the spider magnet, which is like a magnet in the field,

[02:08:17] but then the spider like gets magnetized to the ball and bounces up and down on it.

[02:08:22] The premium, there's an actual spider and he looks like he's humping the ball.

[02:08:26] It's cool.

[02:08:26] Yeah.

[02:08:27] Right.

[02:08:27] It's taking something that's kind of blah and boring and making it cool without adding a lot of expense.

[02:08:34] And this game has a couple features again, taken from older games that Owen likes.

[02:08:40] Basically, he's got the drop target bank that you sweep.

[02:08:44] That's from Quicksilver.

[02:08:45] I think he's even said that the classic stern.

[02:08:48] And this game also has.

[02:08:50] I don't know what it's called in King Kong, but in Congo, it was called Skillfire,

[02:08:54] where you try to plunge the outlane as many times as you can.

[02:08:59] It literally has a mode.

[02:09:00] That's that.

[02:09:01] So yet another Congo reference.

[02:09:04] It's got a really kind of neat ball return on the left side.

[02:09:08] Yeah, it has the use the action button to make a thing pop up so the ball will feed the upper

[02:09:13] mini flipper.

[02:09:14] What do they call it?

[02:09:15] Leap of faith?

[02:09:16] All I know is this thing shoots incredible.

[02:09:19] Yeah, so I haven't played this.

[02:09:21] It's got King Kong in the back corner and he punches the glass.

[02:09:25] Yeah, they got in the premium and Ellie.

[02:09:27] King Kong actually moves around.

[02:09:29] He waves his arms.

[02:09:30] You lock balls in the subway car.

[02:09:33] And then when multi-ball starts, he pounds the subway car.

[02:09:36] It lifts up and the balls come out.

[02:09:38] Is this all time?

[02:09:39] I, we got to see where it goes with the software because it's still really early.

[02:09:44] I mean, I love to be able to play it more.

[02:09:48] If you hit, you just hit that side ramp once.

[02:09:50] It's like, oh, I got to hit that again.

[02:09:53] And again, it's, it's so smooth.

[02:09:57] And it goes around the, I love, he loves habit trails.

[02:10:00] And so do I.

[02:10:01] So a little curvy, he lixes and stuff.

[02:10:04] I love that stuff.

[02:10:05] More, give me more.

[02:10:06] Keith says this one's about capturing the scale and chaos of King Kong.

[02:10:11] Kong isn't just a toy.

[02:10:13] He's a threat.

[02:10:14] Just say he's a threat.

[02:10:16] Oh, King Kong's definitely a threat.

[02:10:18] It's just, there's not enough code.

[02:10:20] I haven't played it yet.

[02:10:21] But this has the, like, it shoots.

[02:10:24] I've seen some people playing this online and it shoots just unbelievable.

[02:10:28] Oh, yeah.

[02:10:28] Just watching that ball move around.

[02:10:30] Here's the thing.

[02:10:31] I think he has the right amount of shots.

[02:10:33] He has the right amount of shots.

[02:10:35] They're nice and wide.

[02:10:36] And he has to center post.

[02:10:38] Okay, here's the thing.

[02:10:39] It's got that, a gong on the right side, which is really cool.

[02:10:44] It's got the train car ball lock, which is really cool.

[02:10:48] Like, he's got a lot of really neat little bits and pieces in there.

[02:10:52] And I think they're coming together when it comes to code.

[02:10:55] But it's got that weird kicking back target thing.

[02:10:59] We shoot up.

[02:11:00] Yeah.

[02:11:01] And around, I'm disappointed there because it seems like it's hidden.

[02:11:04] Like, you can't see it.

[02:11:06] Hit the target and jump back.

[02:11:08] You just sort of shoot up the orbit and then it kind of comes back.

[02:11:11] Well, I have heard from many people now that they prefer the pro.

[02:11:15] Okay.

[02:11:16] And that, because the gong, the way the gong works is you hit it.

[02:11:19] And it won't, it doesn't go down right away.

[02:11:21] You got hit it certain number of times and then it goes down on the ground.

[02:11:23] Yeah, it's like, it's like a solid wall.

[02:11:25] Yeah.

[02:11:26] And on the pro, it's just like, it's just open shot.

[02:11:30] There's, I think there's a plastic there, a picture of a gong.

[02:11:32] Is that because tournament players are winers and it's too dangerous to shoot the ball?

[02:11:37] All 100% they're winers and they don't like dangerous shots yet.

[02:11:40] Yeah.

[02:11:40] Okay.

[02:11:41] So then that's why.

[02:11:42] But it, it, it might shoot better overall.

[02:11:44] If you don't like just hitting a dead wall and having it come back.

[02:11:48] A lovely, lovely pinball machine can't wait to play it.

[02:11:52] It's got this really cool art deco aesthetic.

[02:11:54] It's got the island section.

[02:11:57] It's got the river section.

[02:11:59] It's got the, the New York looking section.

[02:12:02] It's pretty packed.

[02:12:03] It's cool.

[02:12:04] I think, I think Elwin said the only thing they had to cut like he wanted originally the

[02:12:09] King Kong's mouth to move.

[02:12:10] Oh, so when he like roared, it would actually move.

[02:12:13] But that would, that was like one, one thing too many that would have put him over whatever

[02:12:17] the limit is that the board can support.

[02:12:19] So that got cut.

[02:12:20] And then that escalated into a whole bunch more cost.

[02:12:22] Can't wait to play it.

[02:12:24] Not say in the end, that's really above almost all the designers.

[02:12:29] Keith Elwin will be the one most people are waiting for

[02:12:32] to see what he comes up with.

[02:12:34] I mean, I know people that literally this they're, they're on team Elwin like every game he makes.

[02:12:40] They're going to buy Keith Elwin continues to evolve as both a designer

[02:12:44] and a storyteller.

[02:12:45] He's blending these precise layouts with innovative mechanics.

[02:12:50] He's got these wonderfully layered rule sets.

[02:12:53] I think his background as a top tier player gives him this uncommon understanding of flow,

[02:13:00] mechanics and depth.

[02:13:01] I think it's the reason why Keith keeps topping the charts.

[02:13:06] Do you think Keith Elwin is making all the other designers at Stern look bad?

[02:13:12] No, but do I think he's at a level above everyone else?

[02:13:16] Yes.

[02:13:16] I also think it's the fact that he's new enough that he's not repeating himself like,

[02:13:23] you know, look at his game.

[02:13:24] All this is just like this or this is just like this.

[02:13:27] They're all different enough.

[02:13:29] The question is can he keep that up?

[02:13:31] Because after a certain point there's only so many things you can do and that, you know,

[02:13:35] small space.

[02:13:36] But it's going to take a while I think to exhaust all the good ideas.

[02:13:39] So let's keep watching that arc from Archer to King Kong and see where it continues to go.

[02:13:44] Keith, keep showing us what you got.

[02:13:47] And don't make any more Avengers.

[02:13:58] Eh, uh,

[02:14:00] Eh, uh, put that stuff up on the screen.

[02:16:04] Titular.

[02:16:05] I hate saying that we're up.

[02:16:06] Prius, don't forget to tell you monster.

[02:16:11] Edits.
