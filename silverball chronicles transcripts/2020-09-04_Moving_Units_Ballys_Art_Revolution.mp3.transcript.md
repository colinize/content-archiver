[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:10] Hello everyone.

[00:18] I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:21] My Bob Ross voice.

[00:23] We're going to paint a wonderful back glass.

[00:26] Yeah, we're going to put some reds on here and those are going to crack.

[00:29] Because it's too hot.

[00:31] We're going to put boobs on this because boobs sell.

[00:59] Hello everyone.

[01:08] I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me this month.

[01:12] My co-host, Mr. Muscles.

[01:14] Ron, howling.

[01:15] What's up, fella?

[01:16] Well, I do have muscles.

[01:17] I don't know if I missed her muscles.

[01:19] Yeah, what did you think of her new intro music here?

[01:22] We're metal now.

[01:23] Yes, we're a little bit harder because we wanted to drive home the fact that history

[01:29] can be rock and roll.

[01:31] So are the rock stars of history?

[01:33] Oh, that's even better.

[01:35] Very good.

[01:36] So, well, we've taken over the pinball network again this month and we asked Josh Jacobs

[01:43] from Silver Ball Stories, who's a bit of an audio file, to help us out with new music.

[01:48] So we've added that and I think it turned out fairly well.

[01:52] It's a bit different than our other one, but this one is licensed free.

[01:55] So when we sell out, we don't have to worry about anybody coming after us.

[02:01] Sounds good to me.

[02:02] Yeah, exactly.

[02:03] So what have you been doing the last little while?

[02:06] Social distancing and more social distancing.

[02:08] Streaming.

[02:09] It was some streaming.

[02:10] Yeah, you've had a lot of really good streams with Stu.

[02:12] You had to throw him out of your house there on the last one.

[02:15] He was not helping you out.

[02:16] No, we tried a me and Zach from Slamtill.

[02:20] We tried to get to reactor 9 and co-op.

[02:25] We got 9 started on the keypad.

[02:27] Well, actually got it lit and it drained immediately.

[02:31] Well, that is the masterpiece that is Scott DeCene's total nuclear annihilation.

[02:37] I mean, it's got Dinesi?

[02:38] Yeah, the same guy.

[02:40] No, it's not.

[02:41] A Italians got to stick together with the name.

[02:44] Speaking of streaming, I did my first ever stream with Orbital Albert from the pinball nerd's

[02:51] podcast.

[02:52] Go ahead and check him out.

[02:53] We streamed one of the greatest games of all time, Tron, as well as the Simpson Spinball

[02:58] Party.

[02:59] You were one for two.

[03:00] It was a lot of fun streaming those.

[03:03] I can understand.

[03:04] We like to engage with the chat.

[03:06] A couple of great clips of me making massive saves.

[03:09] But it's really fun.

[03:11] I can really see why you do it.

[03:13] We didn't have the advanced streaming rig that you have, but we had something fairly adequate.

[03:20] I would say.

[03:21] It turned out well.

[03:22] We were pretty happy.

[03:23] You know, if you were to combine the rule-based depth of Simpson's pinball party with the actual

[03:30] good playing game that is Tron, that would be a great game.

[03:34] Oh, would it ever?

[03:36] Yeah, the problem with Simpson's is it so clunky.

[03:39] Yep.

[03:40] Brutal.

[03:41] Yep.

[03:42] Let me leave it to Joe Ballsler to make an orbit clunky.

[03:45] But these are opinions.

[03:47] These are not history.

[03:49] He says that the Simpson's pinball party had like seven or eight runs and was one of the

[03:54] Stern's most successful games.

[03:55] So what do I know?

[03:57] That means I'm wrong.

[03:59] Nice little social media update here.

[04:00] If you want to join us over on Facebook.com slash Silver Ball Chronicles, we'd love to

[04:04] chit chat with you.

[04:06] One thing that we always enjoy is the banter we get back and forth with a few people.

[04:10] So you're wondering kind of what's up and when we're posting our next episode or what

[04:14] we're working on, we will from time to time post up some information up on there.

[04:19] Silver Ball Chronicles now has its own dedicated podcast channel.

[04:23] So if you want us to pop up in your podcast feed with none of the other TPN content, I'm

[04:28] not sure why you'd want to do that.

[04:30] No, no, no, not at all.

[04:31] I would never want to do that.

[04:33] TPN stuff is very, very good.

[04:34] But if you would like a dedicated Silver Ball Chronicles channel and we pop up when we're

[04:39] done, you can swing over to your podcast app and search for Silver Ball Chronicles.

[04:44] Before if you jump into our Facebook page, we've added a link to the direct RSS feed and

[04:50] I've attached that to the top of the page with a pin.

[04:53] And as that was one of the main complaints when TPN first started, I'll be happy now.

[04:58] Every show on TPN has their own channel now.

[05:00] If you just go searching on the pin side thread for it, but we wanted to make it a little

[05:04] bit easier for you.

[05:06] Also I guess while you're over there looking that up, please leave us a five star review

[05:09] so you can help others find us because we tend to float up in the algorithm there.

[05:14] Oh, speaking of selling out earlier Ron, we have sold out a little bit.

[05:18] This week in pinball has a Patreon, 25% of their Patreon profits go to podcasters, twitch

[05:24] streamers and YouTubers.

[05:26] And if you'd like to continue to support the hobby, just swing over to patreon.com slash

[05:30] twip and subscribe.

[05:33] Now on the twip pinball database, you can leave a review of our show to help others find

[05:38] us.

[05:39] And we've got a couple of those here.

[05:40] Yeah, Grant Kay says an extremely enjoyable and informative podcast, which clearly has

[05:45] many hours of research prior to each episode.

[05:47] And that's all on Dave, by the way.

[05:49] He's the man.

[05:50] This is one of only a few podcasts that I really look forward to and can honestly say I've

[05:54] listened to each episode twice to get a full understanding of how pinball evolved over

[05:58] the years.

[05:59] Love it all, including Stewie's comments.

[06:01] Oh, thank you.

[06:02] Thank you very much.

[06:03] Everyone loves me.

[06:04] I'm very popular.

[06:05] A pin cider, M-T-N, who I believe is from Norway, left us a great comment.

[06:10] It just said, keep it coming guys.

[06:13] You know, this is a great opportunity to sort of plug the t-shirts that we have over

[06:17] at silverballswag.com.

[06:19] We have a couple of different design choices and some hoodies and mugs and stickers.

[06:22] So if you'd like to support this show, please swing on over to silverballswag.com and

[06:26] pick those up.

[06:27] Recently, we actually have sold a few shirts, which is great because after all of the research

[06:33] that and show notes that I've put together here for today's episode, I really needed

[06:40] a quick pick-be-up and Edward Partridge from Down Under.

[06:44] Thank you so much for purchasing some shirts.

[06:46] If anybody else has purchased some shirts, please let us know on our Facebook page.

[06:49] We'd love to give you a shout out here on silverballcronacles to say thank you for that.

[06:53] So last month, you can remember Ron that we had a secret contest that we usually have.

[07:00] Yes, of course, the secret contest.

[07:03] And that secret contest was we couldn't remember which was Steve Richie's first wide body

[07:09] at Williams.

[07:10] And I think you said something like if you can remember what that is, you can send us

[07:13] an email at silverballcronaclesgmail.com for your chance to win a prize.

[07:18] And only one person emailed us.

[07:21] And I think they emailed us just to mock us or to call our bluff or to just be an all-around

[07:28] douche.

[07:29] And the person who called it in is a person who has been on record on how much they hate

[07:34] wide bodies.

[07:35] Ooh, exciting.

[07:37] So Dennis Creasel, you win a silverballcronacles t-shirt, a premium one, not one of those crappy

[07:44] ones like your GP shirts.

[07:46] Just let us know your mailing address and I'll send you that over and maybe a sticker

[07:50] from Silverball Swag.

[07:51] So what you get for calling her bluff.

[07:53] So he literally was the only person.

[07:55] He really was and I'll actually post up on our Facebook page the image of the email

[08:00] that he sent.

[08:01] Just to prove that this is legit and he called out our bluff.

[08:05] Any corrections or comments from our previous episode that you've heard?

[08:07] Uh, I haven't heard anything.

[08:09] No, we still haven't got that letter from Bruce on the last episode.

[08:12] Yeah, yeah.

[08:13] So for those out there who is very possible, we may have some mistakes.

[08:19] There's a lot of history out there and believe you're not, we're not always right.

[08:23] So if you would like a correction or like to make a correction, just please email us.

[08:28] It's silverballcronacles at e-mail.com.

[08:31] Don't tell me in private messages how inaccurate we were and then you never send anything in

[08:36] on what we were wrong with.

[08:37] That's right.

[08:38] So if you want to get your typewriter out and clickety-clack us a message over, you can

[08:41] do that.

[08:42] Anything else you want to add there?

[08:44] Uh, yes.

[08:45] I have been scolded by my podcast mate, Bruce, that I do not plug our own show often enough

[08:51] on this show.

[08:52] That's right.

[08:53] Yeah, he did so.

[08:54] I'm on another podcast.

[08:56] It's called the Slantill podcast.

[08:59] It's somewhat um, juvenile.

[09:00] Yeah, I would say compared to this one and it's not nearly as classy, but if that's what

[09:05] you go for, it's the podcast for you.

[09:07] Again, Slantill podcast.

[09:09] You can check it out at justslantillpodcast.com.

[09:13] Everything's there.

[09:14] When I started in the hobby, I was looking up podcasts.

[09:17] Slantill kind of came to the top, I listened to the first episode that sort of filled into

[09:22] my feed.

[09:23] I think it was probably a week after I had subscribed.

[09:25] I thought it was so bad.

[09:26] I deleted it and didn't listen to it.

[09:29] And then a couple of months later, I went back and I listened to the next episode and from

[09:33] then on, I've been a religious listener.

[09:36] So when Dennis had suggested, hey, why don't you ask Ron from Slantill to join him?

[09:40] Like, have Ron's not going to want to do a podcast with like a guy he's never met from

[09:44] Canada.

[09:45] And um, here we are now.

[09:46] So yeah.

[09:47] And I um, basically was just two conditions.

[09:50] Like, okay, I don't have to edit.

[09:52] And like, who's this David Dennis guy?

[09:53] So I listened to you on, why do I have been the twit podcast back when they were doing

[09:57] guest hosting?

[09:58] And it's like, this seems like a goofy Canadian guy.

[10:01] I could deal with that.

[10:02] I could deal with this.

[10:03] And then that was it.

[10:04] That literally was the only two conditions.

[10:06] And it's like, I'm on.

[10:07] I'll do it.

[10:08] Yeah.

[10:09] So check out Slantill podcast.

[10:11] It's well worth your time if you want to have a couple of laps.

[10:13] I was thinking about this.

[10:14] You know one thing we have in common.

[10:16] Neither of our podcasts have pinball in the title.

[10:18] Oh, good point.

[10:19] Yeah.

[10:20] There's not too many of those.

[10:21] Usually it's always the so and so pinball podcast or so and so pinball podcast.

[10:26] Yeah.

[10:27] Good point.

[10:28] Good point.

[10:29] We like to be different and classy.

[10:30] Yeah.

[10:31] I think.

[10:32] Well, we don't, but we do or they, me and Bruce don't, but me and you do.

[10:35] Yes.

[10:36] Yeah.

[10:37] Well, I mean, you know, Bruce is, you know, Bruce.

[10:39] This feels like one of those twitch streams where the intro goes on for like 40 minutes

[10:42] before the content starts.

[10:45] That's right.

[10:46] That's right.

[10:47] I'm going to tell I'm sure that somebody like Carrie Hardy has already flipped through

[10:50] most of this.

[10:51] So let's dive into the actual content today.

[10:54] Shall we?

[10:55] Run as you know, art sells pinball machines.

[10:59] Art has always sold pinball machines.

[11:03] Art will always sell pinball machines.

[11:07] The masters of pinball art today like Christopher, Franchise, zombie, Eddie, John, Yosey and

[11:12] Kevin O'Connor add as much to a pinball machine as the designer themselves.

[11:16] In fact, many would say the Christopher, Franchise was the reason Stern sold as many

[11:21] monsters as it did.

[11:23] Don't forget Dirty Donny.

[11:24] Exactly.

[11:25] I would argue that he kind of started the new trend of actual good artwork on the Stern

[11:30] games, but with Metallica.

[11:32] There was no better team in pinball than the art team at Valley.

[11:36] From 1975 until Valley was sold to Midway in 1983, the eclectic creative and dedicated

[11:43] team of artists made some of the best art on pinball that we have ever seen.

[11:48] Paul Ferris, a central figure in today's podcast, was tasked with creating an art department

[11:54] in-house at Valley to differentiate their machines visually from those of God-Leban

[11:59] Williams.

[12:00] They achieve that task in spades and as a testament to their work, today some of these

[12:05] artistic masterpieces, the pinball machines themselves, sell for more than brand new

[12:11] Stern premium machines.

[12:14] This month we're going to talk about one of my favorite topics, moving units, Valley's

[12:21] art revolution.

[12:23] All right.

[12:24] Ron, this is an audio medium.

[12:25] People are listening to us at work.

[12:27] They're in a car.

[12:29] They're ignoring their family and the kitchen making supper.

[12:32] It's going to be a bit tough to take this audio medium and talk about a visual art.

[12:38] This type of episode is probably best where you can kind of reference some of the things

[12:42] that we're talking about.

[12:43] Please use the show notes where I have links to some of the art that we're talking about

[12:48] and some of that information.

[12:50] That's how you're going to get the most out of the podcast.

[12:52] I got a link for you if you want to.

[12:55] No one ever links this one.

[12:56] They was good at IPDB.

[12:58] When it comes to pinball flyers, there's actually a much better site that has like every

[13:04] flyer and they're all like high depth.

[13:06] You can zoom in to ridiculous levels on them.

[13:10] Very cool.

[13:11] It's a weird name for the site.

[13:14] That's why no one ever.

[13:15] I mean, the site's old.

[13:17] Was it built on GeoCities?

[13:19] This is a great resource.

[13:20] I have included that in our show notes, everybody.

[13:23] So Ron, what's your favorite artist of this era?

[13:26] That's a tough one.

[13:27] They're all good.

[13:28] I mean, there's no...

[13:31] They really are.

[13:32] Kevin O'Connor has, you know, it's KISS, it's great.

[13:36] Paul Ferris, just Paragon.

[13:41] That's just keep thinking Paragon.

[13:42] That always is a first thing pops in my head.

[13:45] Great Ferris, Fathom, possibly the greatest artwork ever on a game.

[13:50] Yeah, I said it.

[13:52] When you think about the resale value that a lot of these machines in this era are significantly

[13:57] higher price than almost anything else, even all the way up to the Valley Williams era

[14:01] in the 1990s with DMDs and code and crazy toys.

[14:06] Do you ever feel bad that you bought all those crappy stirons instead of the Valley Class

[14:10] of 81?

[14:11] I feel the artwork on a lot of the stirons is good.

[14:15] It's really out there.

[14:17] So Sean Ledgerwood would say my first pinball machine was a Valley Strikes and Spares with

[14:24] artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[14:26] It seemed to be the perfect fit of nostalgia, bowling alleys, pretty girls, and the backlast

[14:32] art summed up the time period.

[14:34] And we'll get into that, Sean.

[14:35] It's the first thing you see.

[14:37] I mean, it's what you look at.

[14:40] It's like it draws you in, right?

[14:42] Like, you see cool art, you want to go play it.

[14:44] I'll tell you a story.

[14:45] You want to see how it draws me in.

[14:47] So when I went to my first pinball event show, which was Alentown, pinball when it was

[14:55] called the pinball Wizards Convention in 2004.

[14:59] It was like in a strip mall, but it was still the most games I had ever seen in one place.

[15:05] And I remember specifically seeing Paragon for the first time and seeing that backlasts

[15:11] and just thinking myself, oh my god, that's just like way too good to be on a pinball machine.

[15:17] That looks like it should be in a museum or something that kind of artwork.

[15:21] It was something special.

[15:23] And one of the legends that we'll be talking about in this podcast, Greg Ferraris says,

[15:29] as a pinball artist, your job is to make a first impression is to get someone to walk across

[15:34] the bar and put money in that machine.

[15:37] You're creating that first impression.

[15:39] The first impression that I had with a pinball machine quite recently was, in fact, the

[15:47] black and white monsters.

[15:48] And when I saw one of those, I was on vacation, it was almost two years ago now, at modern

[15:54] pinball in New York.

[15:56] When I saw that, I was just like, wow, that is something else because it stood out and

[16:03] it was interesting.

[16:04] And I played a bunch of it now.

[16:06] A lot of people aren't fans of the monsters, but I'll tell you, it was a fun player and

[16:11] the art was strong, strong art package and totally different.

[16:17] So it drew me in.

[16:18] It might not keep you there.

[16:20] It might be the gameplay that keeps you there.

[16:22] But one of the other bits was this older, these older machines in the 1960s.

[16:27] So before we get into kind of our topic of the, you know, the Bally 80s time, time slots,

[16:34] it's this 60s era of pinball was really weird.

[16:39] Some of the art, especially the Williams art, was really weird in the 60s.

[16:44] Oh, the pointy art.

[16:45] Yeah.

[16:46] It was very like simplistic and primary colors and weird geometry and these interesting

[16:53] characters and loads of the games being made at that time.

[16:58] There were so many machines that they were just cranking out art left and right.

[17:01] And you could tell that they were just, they were just throwing out almost the same characters

[17:05] in different positions.

[17:08] Very strange.

[17:09] Do you have any like machines that you can remember in that 60s era?

[17:13] I'm not very good with 60s.

[17:15] I have to say, but I mean, a lot of them have the pointy art, very simplistic pointy

[17:22] art.

[17:24] I remember, well, there's the beat time, which is the Beatles game, but it's not called

[17:28] the Beatles.

[17:29] What do they call the bootles or something like that?

[17:31] The bootles, yeah.

[17:32] But it's obviously the Beatles.

[17:34] Odd design and the geometry of point.

[17:37] And I guess that was sort of kind of the cool style of like the early 60s, maybe late

[17:43] 50s was this odd cartoony thing.

[17:46] One thing that I thought was interesting is that I was kind of going through some of those

[17:49] old artists.

[17:50] A lot of the work, if you look at IPDB, a lot of this artist work is often uncredited.

[17:57] And it was scored like just a job, right?

[17:59] So it was actually in another podcast of David Christensen, where he would actually mention

[18:06] the name of some of these individuals that would work on these projects, guys like Jerry

[18:11] Kelly Roy Parker.

[18:14] And if you go to their games in IPDB, often they're uncredited as the art, but you can

[18:19] tell that that pointy modern art style was kind of was Jerry Keely.

[18:25] And his art is often uncredited, but you can tell it's him because they all look the

[18:29] same weirdness.

[18:31] And well, actually, the pointy artwork is mostly known as what's his name.

[18:37] Christian Marsh, also known primarily for his pointy artwork.

[18:42] Roy Parker is known for mostly all the got-leab work he did.

[18:46] Yeah, his was very more cartoony.

[18:47] Yeah, and a lot of the older art, it is good.

[18:51] And if you look at those back glasses, a lot of them will tell some kind of story, some

[18:56] kind of moment in time.

[18:57] And if you look at it, there will be all this little stuff going on that you didn't notice

[19:01] the first time.

[19:02] Even though it is cartoony, it does usually have, and it's usually like a humorous

[19:06] story going on.

[19:07] People are having fun.

[19:09] They're enjoying themselves, right?

[19:10] It was all about like, oh, look at those people on the back glass having fun.

[19:13] I bet you I would have fun as well if I played that machine, right?

[19:16] It's creating that first impression.

[19:18] So at ad posters did most of the art at that time.

[19:24] So ad posters was like a third party company, and all of the major companies would use them

[19:29] to do their art.

[19:31] So their art wasn't actually in-house, right?

[19:34] And they didn't just have artists on staff that maybe worked at a different location.

[19:38] They had ad posters, and that's where Marsh, Parker, Keely, that's where they all kind

[19:44] of worked, was ad posters.

[19:46] And if you remember our Stern episode, that's where their artwork was done primarily.

[19:52] Yeah, they let, now Stern let them just go nuts.

[19:55] And I guess probably by that time they also had a turnover in the sort of older artists

[20:00] kind of phasing their way out.

[20:02] Penball companies were often manufacturer companies first, and they weren't art houses.

[20:07] So what they did is they just got a guy to do their art for them.

[20:11] And it was probably better that way because you don't want a bunch of engineers making

[20:14] your art.

[20:15] So Dave Christensen, who we'll be talking about him a lot, would say about ad posters.

[20:20] They didn't want anything to do with me.

[20:22] I'd go to ad posters to see how the work was going on, some silk screening or something.

[20:27] I'd have to sit in a lobby and the guy would come and talk to me like I was his worst

[20:31] enemy, like I was taking work away from him.

[20:33] And I basically was.

[20:35] Yeah, that's, that's the candor of Dave Christensen.

[20:38] We'll get into him in a few moments.

[20:40] When Bali started having their own, you know, art people, you could see that there's some

[20:45] tension building there.

[20:46] And Dave Christensen is the first person that Bali brought in house to do their art.

[20:53] Often ad posters would sort of do a project.

[20:57] And the executives would then take a look at it and they'd get Dave Christensen to polish

[21:01] it or to redo the back glass.

[21:03] Great example of that is a pinball machine called Bon Viage, called Bon Viage, where the

[21:10] executives didn't really like the way the back glass was.

[21:13] It wasn't kind of trendy or cool enough.

[21:16] So then they gave Dave Christensen to do that.

[21:19] So we've mentioned Dave Christensen a few times now.

[21:21] So let's go into like who he was, Ron.

[21:24] Well, Dave Christensen or as he was known, Dave Maddog Christensen, he got the nickname

[21:29] when he was in the army, mostly as he described it as drawing exploits.

[21:34] One would assume he was drawing some shenanigans and maybe got that nickname.

[21:39] He also rolled a Mercedes down a hill in Germany in 1953, where as he described it a mountain,

[21:46] you know, well, Dave Christensen is an interesting character.

[21:51] And the end of his career is even more interesting maybe than sort of the beginning.

[21:56] But he's an odd fellow.

[21:59] After World War II, he did freelance technical drawings with Rockwell Industries.

[22:03] Remember them from our Gottlieb system one?

[22:05] No, yeah, they're the guys that did the really crappy job on the MPU board.

[22:10] Oh, yeah, but he did artwork for their manuals for the tanks.

[22:15] So somewhere there's a manuals, a tank manual with art by Dave Christensen.

[22:19] In 1960, 60 did freelance for Bali and a cubicle they gave him in the factory doing service

[22:24] manuals for the slot machines.

[22:26] He kind of moves into Bali doing slot machines.

[22:29] One thing and the timelines here are a bit fuzzy.

[22:35] So I'm going to sort of as best I can piece it together because there's a lot of things

[22:41] happening at the same time, but I'm going to try to put it in an order that's sort of

[22:44] easier to understand.

[22:45] But around the time in the early 70s, Bali entered more or less into the casino business

[22:51] when New Jersey legalized gambling in Atlantic City.

[22:55] During this time of turmoil kind of in that early mid 70s, the head of the company, William

[23:01] T. O'Donnell was forced to resign because he apparently had links to organized crime.

[23:07] Yes.

[23:08] And if you listen to some other podcasts, the ones that Roger Sharp did for his book, Pinball,

[23:15] where when he was talking to like the head of Williams, the head of Gottlieb, you definitely

[23:20] got this sense that they were not like in Bali for this reason because they were trying

[23:25] to get away from the whole or gambling and all that.

[23:28] And then you have have Bali that not only is associated with casinos, but the mob, not

[23:35] stuff they really wanted.

[23:38] Pinball to be associated with.

[23:39] Yeah.

[23:40] So in fact, during an investigation into organized crime in Australia, and it was basically

[23:46] on US Australia criminal activity, O'Donnell had admitted that a mafia boss, Geno VC.

[23:53] No, no, it's the Genovese.

[23:55] It's a crime family.

[23:57] The Genovese mafia boss.

[23:59] Yeah.

[24:00] Gerard Gerardo, Katina once owned shares in Bali and O'Donnell when was confronted with

[24:06] this basically said, oh, I bought him out.

[24:08] So at one time, this mafia family had an ownership stake in Bali.

[24:15] William T. O'Donnell also declined knowing a man named Joseph Dantesta who was a Chicago

[24:20] mobster who had apparently traveled to Australia as a representative of Bali.

[24:27] So there's some sketchiness going on there at the upper levels of Bali in this time.

[24:34] So why do you think the mob like pinball so much?

[24:37] Oh, it's a bit of a gambling.

[24:40] Cash, right?

[24:41] It's easy to hide it.

[24:42] Oh, what did they put in the pinball machines?

[24:44] Yeah, that's right.

[24:45] Yeah.

[24:46] It's like, oh, look at this.

[24:47] I can't believe this Bali pinball machine brought in $100,000 last week.

[24:52] I'll just launder that through the rest of my business.

[24:55] Right.

[24:56] It's a bit weird.

[24:58] And William O'Donnell himself was a bit of a character.

[25:01] Well, T.E.K.

[25:02] Christianson would say it had Bali at great parties.

[25:05] He excused for a party.

[25:06] Will O'Donnell would put a couple hundred on the bar and say, drinks for everyone, my

[25:10] hero.

[25:11] This Christmas parties, all you can drink, unbelievable food, when they went public, things changed.

[25:17] So it sounds like they've Christianson preferred the mob years.

[25:19] Yeah, Christianson really enjoyed, I would say, the shenanigans.

[25:23] So you can listen to his top cast interview, which I've included in the show notes.

[25:27] And that's where he sort of gets into the time when, you know, Will O'Donnell would throw

[25:32] parties with like oysters and things would be crazy.

[25:35] They'd have drinks all the time in it.

[25:37] Really this casual world, which sort of doesn't exist nowadays, right?

[25:44] Where now people get so upset when you spend $100 at the bar and you got to fill out your

[25:48] TPS reports, expense reports.

[25:50] Well, during this time, money was flowing at Bali and they were just trying to have as

[25:55] much fun as they could while they could.

[25:57] So Dave Christianson was really the first piece in that puzzle to bring the art department

[26:01] into Bali.

[26:03] And his first machine was Monte Carlo or the other version of that is odds and evils.

[26:10] And ad posters, as mentioned before, did the play field art, but Dave Christianson did

[26:14] the back glass.

[26:16] Monte Carlo is where you can really see that Dave Christianson created his signature art

[26:22] style.

[26:23] It was all hand drawn.

[26:25] He draw everything then separate the color individually himself to screen.

[26:29] Twelve screens were the rule of thumb of colors.

[26:32] He introduced mirroring.

[26:34] You start with a mirror and wash off the air with acid where the color would go.

[26:37] He was really big on lines and line colors and we'll go into sort of the technologies

[26:44] of colors, etc. in a little while.

[26:48] But one thing that really stands out about Dave Christianson, especially in his earlier

[26:54] art is his use of women and often the women were hanging off of a very powerful man.

[27:02] It was like a man gambling or a gangster or a fighter or an entertainer and they were

[27:08] like the object.

[27:09] They were the powerful man and it was always the woman that was like hanging off.

[27:14] They were often objectified.

[27:15] They had those weird 60s, 70s style cone boobs and bell buckles.

[27:20] Don't forget those.

[27:21] That was another one of his thing.

[27:23] He loved bell buckles.

[27:24] Bell buckles.

[27:25] He was a big fan of the bell.

[27:26] Paul Ferris would say that Dave Christianson was the most amazing ink artist ever.

[27:31] He always had a whimsical wave dry.

[27:34] Interesting way of saying it.

[27:35] Yes, whimsical indeed.

[27:37] So his first massive project, Dave Christianson's first massive project at Valley was Wizard.

[27:45] And we'll go into Wizard in great, great detail some other time when we talk about licensing.

[27:50] Today we're going to focus mostly on the art, but that's a rock theme from May 1975.

[27:55] It was an electro mechanical.

[27:57] So this is before Valley had switched over to the solid state system.

[28:00] Called 10,000 five units designed by Greg Kemic who did xenon power play and his last

[28:06] game, Capcom's Greg Kemic.

[28:09] Kemic.

[28:10] That's what you said.

[28:11] Greg Kemic who did xenon power play Capcom's break shot and of course art work by Dave

[28:16] Christianson.

[28:18] And Wizard is based on the 1975 film Tommy, which is based on the whose rock opera Tommy.

[28:26] The weird thing about the movie is in the movie Roger Dulltree plays Tommy and Ann Margaret

[28:33] is his mom in the movie.

[28:35] Oh, oh, now these are the two characters that are on the back glass of Wizard.

[28:40] You have Roger Dulltree as Tommy and Ann Margaret who definitely is not holding him in

[28:45] a way you would think mom would hold him.

[28:48] That's a whole thing.

[28:50] He was probably closer.

[28:51] They were probably closer to age.

[28:53] Like she was probably, I don't know, five, maybe 10 years older than him if that.

[28:58] So in the movie, it was kind of weird that he was she was supposed to be his mom when

[29:03] she was like close to his age.

[29:05] Yeah.

[29:06] And she was sitting on his lap, well, pop up her cap, but basically his lap, I guess.

[29:13] She's got the legs.

[29:14] She's got her leg chained to a Tommy pinball looking thing.

[29:18] And then you have the two other women both with the belt buckles.

[29:21] Both with the belt buckles.

[29:22] Yeah, it's funny.

[29:23] It's not I didn't really notice that when I was going through all this stuff, but you

[29:27] know, Tommy was a psychosomatically deaf, mute and blind boy who became a pinball champion.

[29:34] So don't worry, Ron, they're still hope for you.

[29:37] I don't know if I have a supple arrest as Tommy had this this rock opera gave us all the

[29:44] song we friggin hate.

[29:45] And we hear it all the time.

[29:48] And it coined the phrase pinball wizard, which I'm sure we all just love.

[29:52] I do.

[29:53] I don't have any problem with that.

[29:54] I picture Jew is more of like a pinball hobbit.

[29:58] Uh, no, no.

[30:00] There could be a lot worse songs associated with pinball than pinball wizard.

[30:05] That was actually a huge hit song, a huge groundbreaking rock opera album.

[30:10] 100% on board.

[30:11] Do they play it too much?

[30:13] Yes.

[30:14] 100%.

[30:15] It's just, it just, it just drives me mad.

[30:17] The funny thing is that that's a ballet game based on the movie.

[30:22] They use all got lead machines for the pinball scenes.

[30:24] Really?

[30:25] So when he says I am the ballet table king, I know he's actually playing a, a godly, oh

[30:30] my goodness.

[30:31] Uh, one thing that, um, that I really enjoy is the context of the time, right?

[30:37] The, the, what's going on at the time in this film was a huge pop culture phenomenon.

[30:45] It was a $3 million budget, which grossed $34.3 million at the box office.

[30:51] Now if you extrapolate that into today's dollars, that's $163.4 million today.

[30:58] And you know, that's a, that's a big deal for a musical about pinball.

[31:03] This was also the first licensed pinball machine to be involved, to have the involvement

[31:08] of stars.

[31:09] Yeah.

[31:10] Paul Ferris says Tom Neiman was very instrumental developing the whole idea of a licensed

[31:14] theme in the pinball.

[31:15] The first one we did was wizard, which is based on the movie Tommy, Dave Christianson

[31:19] used Ann Margaret and Roger Daltry.

[31:21] Yeah.

[31:22] So we'll get into a whole, we'll get into Tom Neiman in the future.

[31:24] We'll get into licensing in the future because he did a whole top cast podcast back in

[31:28] the day on licensing in general.

[31:30] And we'll get into that.

[31:31] We'll also bring in maybe some Roger sharp and we'll talk a little bit about that stuff.

[31:34] Valley were definitely the leaders there.

[31:36] They were, they, they, they took the lead on that.

[31:39] Did they ever, holy and well, and you'll see as we go through today, all of the, all

[31:43] of the names.

[31:44] Well, for the art, Dave Christianson said that Ann Margaret had some comments on the first

[31:48] draft.

[31:49] She didn't like her hair up, which is how Dave originally drew it.

[31:53] So she wasn't into that.

[31:55] So she requested it to be changed.

[31:56] Yeah.

[31:57] He was very traditionalist with that hair up kind of 1960s, B hive style, which had very

[32:04] much become not cool.

[32:06] She requested that change.

[32:08] And Dave Christianson was, was, was really Greg Ferraris's inspiration.

[32:14] Greg Ferraris today being the art director at Stern.

[32:19] And Greg Ferraris says that wizard was the real impression of what pinball was all about.

[32:24] The feeling, the excitement and the pop culture of the who.

[32:27] Yeah.

[32:28] Without someone like Dave Christianson, there might not have been a Greg Ferraris, which

[32:30] is really weird.

[32:33] So in 1975, Paul Ferraris joins Valley.

[32:37] And I'm not sure in the exact timing of like beginning of the year, end of the year,

[32:41] et cetera, because who really keeps track of that stuff.

[32:45] But when they're talking, they kind of meld all of this together across a couple of podcasts.

[32:48] So I'm going to put it in here because I feel like this is an appropriate place to put

[32:52] it.

[32:53] Who was Paul Ferraris?

[32:54] Well, Paul was an art major in college and became a high school art teacher in suburban

[32:58] Chicago high school for seven years.

[33:00] And the summer's Paul would sell art as a summer job.

[33:02] Yeah.

[33:03] Paul's brother was illegal in Illinois.

[33:05] And of course, he didn't play very much.

[33:07] But Paul's brother, he knew Bill from Valley.

[33:12] And they spoke about the art that Paul had done.

[33:16] And of course, at the time, Bill was interested in creating his own in house art department.

[33:21] Oh, this is the bill we don't know the last name of.

[33:23] Yeah.

[33:24] So I'm just going to call him Bill.

[33:26] If you know Bill's last name, please send us an email at silverbolicronicals at gmail.com.

[33:30] Yeah.

[33:31] Paul said, Billy had this vision of bringing the art department in house.

[33:33] This would give value unique style versus the same artist pool is all the other companies.

[33:38] We're using ad posters.

[33:39] Billy knew the artist could be free spirits and was looking for someone to add structure

[33:43] and stability to create an art department.

[33:44] A teacher?

[33:45] What would a perfect person to be able to corral a bunch of children and strong personalities?

[33:51] Right?

[33:52] So Paul was a teacher.

[33:53] He loved wrestling and he loved coaching and he was a leader.

[33:56] And of course, the carrot to get him to leave teaching, which he was very reluctant to

[34:01] do was to become the art director for Valley.

[34:04] And he was the wrestling coach and he was a bigger guy.

[34:06] He's actually the inspiration for a lot of his own art when you see the big, the big

[34:11] dude with the beard and all that on his art.

[34:13] That's him.

[34:14] He's all shoulders.

[34:15] Mm-hmm.

[34:16] All shoulders, Paul Ferris.

[34:17] That's what we'll call him.

[34:19] So at this time, where do you kind of research art for pinball?

[34:23] Right?

[34:24] I guess you look at old pinball machines, but you don't have an IPDB or you don't have books

[34:28] or encyclopedias or whatever.

[34:29] So he really started sort of studying trendy arts like vinyl record art and heavy metal

[34:35] magazine and all these all really cool.

[34:37] We're all the crazy artists hang out.

[34:40] That's kind of where he started looking for some inspiration.

[34:43] So where do you kind of start?

[34:45] Right?

[34:46] You come out of teaching, you come out of kind of fine art school.

[34:50] What like, how do you even start in pinball?

[34:52] It seems like such a crazy time.

[34:54] Well, Paul started by working on his first machine quarterback.

[34:57] It wasn't released for some time after it was completed.

[35:00] So Paul says, I was a fine painter.

[35:02] With pinball, you had to do work with ink and then you had to cut the separations for

[35:05] the screen stencils.

[35:07] Cut every color.

[35:08] It was a hand-done process.

[35:10] You didn't do it as a painting.

[35:11] You did it as ink.

[35:12] And you'd have to do what they call a ruby lift with each color.

[35:15] That was new to me.

[35:16] Yeah.

[35:17] Paul was held in quite high regard amongst the ballet team at the time.

[35:21] Mostly, and we'll talk about, of course, a little bit more of that in a minute, but Margaret

[35:25] Hudson would say that Paul was great.

[35:28] He took me under his wing and made sure all of us got everything we needed to do our best.

[35:33] The best tools, techniques, going on seminars to learn things.

[35:37] Paul was wonderful.

[35:40] So Paul comes aboard around the same time.

[35:43] Dave Christensen is moving into a game called Old Chicago, which is a gangster theme from

[35:48] 1976.

[35:49] We're still in the Electro Mechanical time.

[35:52] 7,155 units.

[35:54] A Greg is, of course, on that design again.

[35:57] Greg Kamehk.

[35:58] Greg Kamehk.

[35:59] Of course, that's twice if you're following along.

[36:02] Of course, this was a gangster theme.

[36:04] This was kind of really before those gambling controversies, gangsterism kind of got really

[36:12] deep into ballet, but it's around the same time.

[36:16] This one is really unique because this game is the one with a pop bumper down on the

[36:20] bottom and the flippers up a little bit higher.

[36:22] Very cool, very cool game, totally different.

[36:25] It's a great game.

[36:26] Little do people know that John Yaucy did the original art for this machine because he

[36:30] was doing freelance at the time and he was working at a place called Album Graphics Inc.

[36:35] After the executives had sort of reviewed it, they got Dave to redo a bunch of the art.

[36:41] And of course, you'll remember John Yaucy from our Python Angelo episode where he was

[36:45] working at Williams in the mid to late 80s.

[36:49] And of course, now he's working with J.J.P. and Pat Waller on a lot of their games, his

[36:54] latest one being Willie Wonka.

[36:56] I would say he worked at Williams from the mid 80s to the mid 90s, actually, because he

[37:02] did white water.

[37:03] He did like, he was there to probably close to the end.

[37:09] I saved us a correction there.

[37:10] There you go.

[37:11] There you go.

[37:12] He would say, I think Dave spent most of his time on the two main figures.

[37:16] The male figure was a generic gangster, but Dave had John Dillinger in mind when he

[37:21] redid the art, which added a lot of character.

[37:25] He also reworked the female figures, of course, right?

[37:28] Because that's Dave Christians' thing as female characters.

[37:31] My background design elements remained intact, but re-inked, which meant color changes,

[37:37] including the jazz band at the bottom, the city, the spotlights, the airships, and borders.

[37:43] So John Dillinger, he was actually a real life gangster.

[37:47] He was gunned down by federal agents in front of Chicago's Biograph Theater in 1934.

[37:53] He was betrayed by a brothel madam and a sage, real named Anna Companis.

[38:00] Sure.

[38:01] That's it.

[38:02] The legendary woman in red.

[38:03] You can see on the back glass, the female characters there.

[38:08] So sage is actually depicted in that back glass as the woman in red.

[38:13] So when you're looking at the back glass, it's, again, it's this powerful male character,

[38:21] these female characters in a very cold Chicago from the 1930s.

[38:30] Very, very cool, if you ask me, but both in temperature and in style.

[38:38] So sage is depicted in the back glass, wearing the red dress looking youthful.

[38:43] Although at the time, apparently she was in her mid-40s.

[38:47] And during the shooting, she was wearing a bright orange skirt and a white blouse.

[38:54] So she wasn't in red.

[38:55] She was not in red, but she was known as the woman in red.

[38:58] And Dillinger was, of course, the fellow in the middle, the gangster.

[39:02] And on the right side, his girlfriend, Polly Hamilton, who exited the theater into the

[39:07] FBI ambush.

[39:09] Dave Christensen actually said at pinball expo 2004 that he intended the woman in red to

[39:14] be sage and nobody else.

[39:17] A reference to the SMC cartridge company garage at 2122 North Clark Street where the St.

[39:22] Valentine's Day massacre occurred in 1929.

[39:26] When the garage was torn down in 1967, Christian Sin took some bricks from the site to display

[39:30] him as fireplace metal.

[39:32] Christian Sin likes a lot of illegal stuff.

[39:36] He's very risqué, both in his art, his life choices.

[39:44] And he said, he said, he, he, what's the way to put this?

[39:51] He puts a lot of negative folk almost up on a pedestal.

[39:56] He's an odd fellow.

[39:58] One thing that I found super cool is that John Yosey actually did the art for some

[40:06] album, album covers, including the early Almond Brothers album and Almond Joy from 1973,

[40:15] which I thought was super cool.

[40:18] And a lot of those art deco images from those album covers are on this play field, which

[40:25] is super, super cool.

[40:28] I guess we could jump into the next one, which is also somewhat controversial, which is

[40:34] Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy from 1976.

[40:39] How many people know that that's the full title of the machine?

[40:42] Everyone just calls it Captain Fantastic.

[40:44] They almost never call the full name the Brown Dirt Cowboy.

[40:49] It's a rock star theme.

[40:50] This one also, Electro Mechanical, 6155 units.

[40:55] Dave Christensen and Greg Kemic again, team it up.

[40:58] And the celebrity's time is Elton John.

[41:00] Is it Elton John is front and center based again on the musical Tommy, where Elton John

[41:08] played the main character who was on the back last playing that.

[41:12] Yeah, in the movie Tommy Elton John's character, he's actually the pinball wizard that Tommy

[41:16] defeats.

[41:17] Oh, yes, that's right.

[41:19] Of course, of course, of course.

[41:20] He's the one singing the song pinball wizard.

[41:23] How do you think he does this?

[41:24] Yes, I don't know what makes him so good.

[41:26] Now, Christopher Franch, he would say that this is the biggest dumpster fire of anger and

[41:32] hate you could possibly have for pinball.

[41:34] He hates this machine.

[41:35] He owns this machine.

[41:36] He loves playing this machine, but he hates this machine.

[41:39] There is a flyer for this game.

[41:42] The flyer is very much, of course, one of those promotional flyers that we were talking

[41:47] about.

[41:48] And you can see this flyer in high res in the extra link that Ron has provided for us

[41:52] here.

[41:53] It's also on IPDB.

[41:55] It is kind of weird.

[41:56] Yeah, Elton John is standing next to the machine, but he's wearing like a hockey jersey for

[42:02] no time.

[42:03] He's wearing a 1974 team Canada hockey jersey just hanging out in a hotel.

[42:09] Now, this was shot in a hotel in Toronto.

[42:14] I believe it is the Royal York from downtown Toronto.

[42:19] Here's a little bit of trivia for you.

[42:21] I had my bachelor party in that very hotel, and I don't remember the end of the night.

[42:26] So you could have been in the same room where that picture was taken?

[42:29] I probably was a few floors down, but it was a nice hotel room.

[42:35] The cool bit is that the reason he's wearing that hockey jersey is because he's just hanging

[42:40] out the hotel doing a show and they brought in this machine to do the photos.

[42:44] And that was what he was wearing.

[42:45] He didn't change anything.

[42:46] It's just, there he is.

[42:48] Done.

[42:49] Man, rock stars.

[42:52] Live in the dream.

[42:53] Now, the back glass included in the song lyrics of the words from the end of the world

[42:57] to your town, which appear at the very top center of the back glass.

[43:01] Oh, and Dave Christensen, he put some interesting things in that back glass.

[43:07] Yeah, there's some shenanigans going on here.

[43:09] Dave Christensen would say a few people went out for drinks at lunch.

[43:13] It was a joke.

[43:14] Elton John in the movie was playing in a crowd and I wanted to make it interesting.

[43:17] So some of the art on this back glass was caught by management and thought to be a bit

[43:26] risque.

[43:28] They would then take some of the original art that they had done.

[43:33] A few back glasses were already there.

[43:35] Yeah, what they did is they had the first run and they got out there with all these

[43:40] shenanigans in place.

[43:42] And on the back glass, there are these little stars that are all throughout the back glass.

[43:48] So they just, when they re-did the back glass and strategically moved the stars to cover

[43:54] up some of the offending areas, should I say.

[43:58] Yeah, very, very well said.

[43:59] Yes, in the museum of pinball, I think that's what they call themselves in banning California.

[44:06] They have a captain fantastic there that has the uncensored back glass.

[44:12] So you get to see things like a woman grabbing a guy's, well, his man bits.

[44:19] Yes, a woman giving you the finger.

[44:21] I'm not sure the star really covers that up.

[44:24] No, a woman holding her boobs is in there.

[44:30] It's very cold in that crowd, which is interesting.

[44:34] It's very cold in Dave Christensen's world, pretty much always.

[44:37] Some things for sure, if you needed to cut glass, Dave Christensen was your guy.

[44:43] And you know, all those things we mentioned might not even be the most offensive thing

[44:46] in there.

[44:47] That brings us to our next bit of controversy around Mr. Christensen.

[44:55] And that's that some people say that he is a closeted Nazi sympathizer.

[45:01] Some of his work often has Nazi or German iconography.

[45:06] Yeah, if you look at the captain fantastic back glass, I think it's all the way to the right.

[45:10] You see he's kind of hanging out in the background is Hitler.

[45:13] Just hanging out.

[45:14] Just chilling.

[45:15] Just chilling, listen to the, yeah.

[45:17] You can mostly see kind of his hat and his eyes and of course the mustache that he's

[45:22] ruined for all of us forever.

[45:25] Now on top cast, which is linked in the show notes, they said, you know, flat out they're

[45:29] just like, so why Hitler on the back glass?

[45:32] It took him like a little bit of stumbling to actually kind of answer the question.

[45:35] So go back and listen to this yourself if you want to hear it.

[45:38] It's not, I don't know if it's because he's older.

[45:40] He's trying to remember or if he's trying to come up with like he didn't expect the question

[45:43] which I find weird.

[45:45] So he said, yeah, well, you can't come up with a logical answer for this.

[45:49] It's, it's just goofy stuff.

[45:52] And then what I find really weird is that then the hosts move on and they were on the next

[45:57] topic.

[45:58] I think they were talking about another pinball machine.

[46:00] And then Dave goes back.

[46:01] It's only been like a couple of minutes.

[46:03] Dave then revisits his answer because he must have come up with a better excuse.

[46:08] And then he says, maybe it was the movie took place during the blitz in London.

[46:14] And there was no real logical reason.

[46:16] And it wasn't meant to offend anybody.

[46:19] I'm sure he's been asked that question a lot over the years.

[46:23] Why is Hitler in the back glass?

[46:25] You think he'd kind of have a better answer ready to go for that, wouldn't you?

[46:28] Well, to be fair, Hitler was originally supposed to be in the Sergeant Pepper album cover.

[46:33] So yes, of course.

[46:35] And of course, Hitler has been on countless episodes of family guy.

[46:39] It's a pattern of strangeness with Dave Christensen that sort of brings up that sort of commentary

[46:45] that he's a bit of a sympathizer or maybe is a bit too nonchalant with that use.

[46:51] So for example, we, and we skipped over these games, but there's rogo and air aces that

[46:56] were done by Christensen.

[46:58] He did the back glasses.

[46:59] There are sideways looking eagles, which is sort of not see ish back in the day.

[47:05] And that again, we've got more controversy and that will come up here in the next little

[47:10] while.

[47:11] Now we're on the orbit spinners.

[47:13] Yeah.

[47:14] That's a game.

[47:15] Oh, Knight Rider with David Hasselhoff.

[47:18] That's right.

[47:19] It's trucker CB radio thing.

[47:20] Oh, okay.

[47:21] That didn't write her.

[47:22] So not David Hasselhoff.

[47:23] Yeah, not the good Knight Rider.

[47:26] 1976 from November, it sold both EM and solid state.

[47:30] So it was a transition over the two.

[47:32] It was the first production machine with the Valley 17 MPU 11155 units.

[47:39] If you add the EM and solid state numbers together, design again by Craig, Greg, Kimek

[47:44] and Paul Ferris doing the artwork this time.

[47:47] So this is kind of like his first real big deep dive into doing his own art package.

[47:52] Now that he's kind of learned how to do it.

[47:54] And did you know Paul's assistant wrestling coach from teaching was a truck driver.

[47:59] So the waitress on the back glass was a former student and he put some of his friends on

[48:02] the play field.

[48:03] The people in the artwork are actually people that they knew they used for inspiration.

[48:10] And the truck driver on the back glass kind of over there by the ball and play window.

[48:15] That was the assistant wrestling coach.

[48:18] And one of Paul's former students on the was the waitress with the coffee.

[48:23] How cool can you make a Peter built truck and whatever.

[48:27] But I think they did a fairly darn good job of making it kind of cool.

[48:31] So the Valley Express truck being chased by the police.

[48:35] Yeah, it's kind of based on smoking in the band.

[48:38] And of course smoking the band it was 1977.

[48:41] So fairly close here in timeline.

[48:43] And smoking the band it was awesome.

[48:44] It was a great movie.

[48:47] Where's my smoking in the band at machine there Stern?

[48:49] Come on.

[48:50] I don't think that's happening.

[48:52] Yeah, CB radios.

[48:54] They were a big thing at the time.

[48:56] Paul Ferris would put it.

[48:57] This was a minor license for CB radios.

[48:59] There was a CB radio company out there and we use their particular CB radio as part of

[49:04] the art package.

[49:05] So it was a minor license project.

[49:08] The game might get you 3000 in sales, but a theme and a license might get you the next

[49:13] 6,000 from there.

[49:15] The next big project was done by a guy named Jim Patla who is now the COO over at

[49:22] Jersey Jack Pinball.

[49:23] You'll know him from Santari and Elvira the party monster and Viking.

[49:27] It's Mata Hari.

[49:29] It's a historical figure theme April 1978.

[49:33] Solid state machine standard body.

[49:35] It's 16,260 units and Dave Christensen on art.

[49:41] Dave Christensen says this is one of his favorite back glasses.

[49:44] And in fact, also Paul Ferris says this is the favorite.

[49:48] This is his favorite work done by Christensen.

[49:51] My friend Dylan has one of these Mata Hari's.

[49:53] I play it at least once a week.

[49:55] It's a great game, great package all around.

[50:00] Who was Mata Hari?

[50:01] Clumian here because I'm not 70 years old.

[50:04] So Mata Hari, this was actually Marguerite McLeod.

[50:10] She was a Dutch exotic dancer and escort slash prostitute and was convicted of being

[50:16] a spy for the German Army during World War I.

[50:20] The French Army caught her.

[50:22] She was interrogated and executed by firing squad.

[50:27] Some people actually say that she threw interrogation, actually admitted taking money from Germany

[50:34] to be a spy, although she was in fact innocent.

[50:38] Dave Christensen would say a bunch of historical work went into the game.

[50:42] The map that she has, that she's showing to the German double agent was actually for

[50:45] the Battle of Tim Paro, where the German Army broke through the Italian lines in World

[50:51] War II.

[50:52] Even though he did a bunch of, he says he did a bunch of historical work.

[50:55] Yeah, wait a minute.

[50:56] That's World War II.

[50:57] If she's World War I, I'm confused.

[50:59] Right.

[51:00] So I don't know if he's trying to say that he did a bunch of research when he didn't,

[51:05] or maybe he did some research and he couldn't, he just put something, he just was like,

[51:08] oh, that's like a good map or a war or what?

[51:11] I don't know why he'd say he did a bunch of research and then immediately prove himself

[51:16] being wrong.

[51:17] Do you'll forget the dagger?

[51:18] Yes.

[51:19] The dagger controversy.

[51:20] We had mentioned a couple of minutes ago about how there's more controversies that kind

[51:25] of come up around German iconography and Mr. Christensen.

[51:30] Well, on the back glass, you've got Mata Hari.

[51:33] You've got this lady and she's laying down kind of on a, I don't know, like a, like

[51:41] a chase with a tiger, which is really cool.

[51:44] She's, she's very beautiful.

[51:46] She's passing this map to a German double agent.

[51:49] Now she's holding a dagger in her, like right hand and it's kind of going by like the

[51:55] player three window.

[51:57] Originally, that dagger had an inscription on it and that's where the controversy begins.

[52:05] Yeah, the inscription was in German and it says, my honor is my loyalty.

[52:10] Yeah.

[52:11] So written in German.

[52:12] So it wasn't in English, a translation.

[52:14] It was written in the German language.

[52:17] That's a thing since the engraving on the dress daggers that the German SS officers would

[52:22] wear during World War II was the same thing.

[52:26] Like the worst of the worst soldiers in the German army at that time, the SS had these

[52:31] knives with my honor is my loyalty.

[52:34] And Dave Christensen thought it was a great idea to put that on the back glass.

[52:39] Well, the German distributors did not like it.

[52:41] Yeah, obviously nobody in North America kind of would notice, right?

[52:45] Because we speak English in North America.

[52:47] Well, the German distros did notice.

[52:50] And again, it's really weird because he's using a second World War theme or saying in

[52:55] a first World War character.

[52:57] And a lot more of those got out than the captain fantastic.

[53:01] There's a lot that I'd say almost half of the ones I see.

[53:04] My heart is half the inscription.

[53:06] I'm like, why the hell would he add that?

[53:08] Like really?

[53:09] That's a legitimate question.

[53:10] Like, why would he add that?

[53:11] You'd have to ask him.

[53:12] What does that add to the back glass?

[53:16] He doesn't say, I guess he doesn't, he wasn't asked in any of the things that I've seen.

[53:21] So if you can find out his explanation as to why he thought that was a great idea, please

[53:25] email that to us at Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[53:28] But you know, nowadays if you wanted to look up like all that iconography, you just sort

[53:35] of throw it into Google and it'll come up in Wikipedia or historical websites or whatever.

[53:39] You know, back in the day, you would either like have to know that just kind of just knowing

[53:44] it, right?

[53:45] Or you'd have to go to like a library and do the specific research and all of that stuff.

[53:50] So I don't understand how that would accidentally sort of pop up if you were doing research,

[53:55] you know, first world war character.

[53:57] Anyway, was he actually a closeted fascist or Nazi sympathizer?

[54:05] Maybe not probably not.

[54:07] But he certainly made a lot of very poor choices around that kind of stuff through his art

[54:14] tenure at ballet.

[54:16] The thing is though, I guarantee you, if you had either Montagrari or Captain Fantastic

[54:23] and you had the earlier run art, you would be using that to try to get more money for

[54:27] it, guaranteed.

[54:28] Yeah, absolutely.

[54:29] Most people would be like, this is the original bat, the uncensored, that's why they'd

[54:33] say it uncensored back glass or they'd say, you know, Montagrari, the original uncensored

[54:38] back glass.

[54:39] So do you like Montagrari?

[54:40] Have you played a lot of Montagrari?

[54:41] I have played a lot of Montagrari.

[54:43] It's a tournament game.

[54:45] It's in a lot of tournaments, I know.

[54:47] Yeah, but it's the original flow monster.

[54:51] Flow?

[54:52] You basically go for the whole and then you go for the, and then you go for the right orbit

[54:55] thing and that's it.

[54:56] Giver.

[54:57] So not a huge fan.

[54:59] But again, it sold how many units?

[55:01] So my opinion means nothing.

[55:03] My opinion was not shared.

[55:05] 16,000.

[55:06] So my opinion was not shared by too many people.

[55:08] That one machine in like two months sold more than the entire industry in 2020.

[55:13] This is where we get into sort of a little less, a little less serious and a lot more

[55:18] fun, I think.

[55:19] You think?

[55:20] Evil can evil.

[55:21] So I'm going to call him like a historical figure, theme, like Daredevil maybe?

[55:29] Celebrity.

[55:30] Celebrity, yes, celebrity.

[55:32] Junus 77, standard body solid state, 14,000 units designed by Gary Gaten and artwork by

[55:40] Paul Ferris.

[55:42] So Paul did the sketches and he did the final glass while evil can evil, the famous stunt

[55:49] fellow was in Chicago to do a stunt.

[55:51] So kind of like who was like evil can evil, right?

[55:53] Yeah, he would jump over things and, and fail a lot.

[55:56] That's kind of what he was know for, but I mean he was definitely he was mocked on the

[56:01] Simpsons, right?

[56:02] He was like the guy that would jump over the tank of sharks over a flaming bus and then

[56:07] land on the other side.

[56:09] That was his thing.

[56:10] He would he would jump things on motorcycles and things were on fire and he was like Mr.

[56:15] America, right?

[56:16] Like he was like that crazy thing back in the day and he had a jump suit and a hole like

[56:20] it is on his own brand.

[56:22] Yeah, I don't know if I'd really trust 1970s medical science, you know, like if I were

[56:28] jumping things on motorcycles, but this guy he was pretty fearless.

[56:32] Well, he also got popular because he was on the, I think is why the world of sports would

[56:36] have a model all the time when he would do his jumps.

[56:38] So you get national audience there.

[56:40] So everyone knew who he was.

[56:41] So Paul was commissioned to do all the artwork for this machine and he did the sketches

[56:45] in the final back glass.

[56:47] Now, evil can evil wasn't Chicago around this time to do a stunt and he came in to do

[56:52] a review of the of the machine and of the art in a nutshell.

[56:56] Evil was happy with the machine, but he had one thing that he didn't particularly like.

[57:01] He was jumping a motorcycle on the back glass.

[57:04] That was kind of the idea.

[57:05] He liked the art.

[57:06] He liked the colors, but his critique was on the physics.

[57:10] The rear wheel was not high enough in his opinion.

[57:15] And the perspective wasn't quite correct.

[57:17] He was concerned about the realism of the picture that if he were to actually jump in the way

[57:23] that was on the back glass, he would crash because his tire was too low and he told Paul

[57:28] to change the perspective.

[57:30] So the final perspective on the back glass was the one that evil had requested.

[57:35] Now, what's interesting about that, Ron?

[57:36] Well, the following day, evil can evil is practicing the jump for the Chicago show and

[57:41] he crashed and ended up in the hospital.

[57:43] Here you go.

[57:44] So, so, one thing to explain about that on that back glass, it's not like a static.

[57:51] It's a series of I think four or five pictures of him in mid-air that the lights go through

[57:57] on the back glass.

[57:59] So it's like him in motion.

[58:00] So he was saying that some of the pictures just the angle was wrong.

[58:04] And if he was actually jumping like that, he would crash.

[58:07] You know, you got to come in and you got to critique something, right?

[58:10] Like, you know, my muscles aren't big enough for...

[58:13] Who get to that when we get to kiss?

[58:15] Around this time, really, after all of that whole gangster controversy and stuff,

[58:21] Bally, you might not know it when you look at their art, but they were really trying

[58:25] to avoid controversy.

[58:26] They were really trying to avoid anything offensive, nothing bad.

[58:31] They just kind of wanted to cruise.

[58:33] And around the time of the release of the evil can evil pin, evil was healing from the

[58:38] stunt that had gone bad in Chicago when he had a highly publicized fight with a man named

[58:44] Shelley Saltsman, who was a major sports promoter.

[58:48] Saltsman was quoted in a book that was written about evil that apparently he had a drug

[58:55] problem and that he abused his wife and kids.

[58:58] Yeah, Saltsman wrote this book about him.

[59:00] So evil, Ken Evil flies out to California and since he had both of his arms in a cast,

[59:06] he brought his buddy with him.

[59:07] They found Saltsman and basically his buddy held him down while evil can evil whacked

[59:12] him with a baseball bat.

[59:14] Yeah.

[59:15] So, buddies like a VP of 20th Century Fox in California, Ken Evil is actually given a bunch

[59:21] of assault churches.

[59:22] Bally was, again, super conscious about having a positive image in pinball after all of

[59:27] this whole gambling, you know, mobster thing that was going on, the change in CEOs.

[59:35] They didn't want this to be a part of their image and they were not happy at all.

[59:39] So much, in fact, they stopped production of the machine, which is why it ends on a very

[59:45] perfect 14,000 units.

[59:47] Yeah, the interesting thing is the guy he hit with the baseball bat, Shelley, he had

[59:53] actually sent a copy of his book and to be approved by evil, Ken Evil's people and they

[59:58] approved it before this happened.

[01:00:00] Yeah, you should have hit like his proofreader with it.

[01:00:02] So obviously evil, Ken Evil didn't approve it personally, but someone in his crew did.

[01:00:08] And around this time on this machine, they hired Margaret Hudson as an art support person.

[01:00:14] She learned how to ink and cut screen on evil, Ken Evil.

[01:00:17] So she's kind of doing the same thing that Paul had done previously.

[01:00:20] She's kind of learned in the ropes.

[01:00:22] She had to be taught the process and she had no experience.

[01:00:25] She did all the key line and all the color separations.

[01:00:28] So we've mentioned this a couple of times, like, inking, color separation, all of that

[01:00:34] stuff.

[01:00:35] So how does that kind of work, Ron?

[01:00:36] You lay down a Mylar material, a Mylar like material, a layer for each color and the

[01:00:41] tight penciling would be colored in, then the layers peeled off and the next color is

[01:00:45] done.

[01:00:46] It was a film that you would cut with an exacto blade and peel off what you didn't want

[01:00:50] to print and leave what you did want to print.

[01:00:52] Then it would be converted into a film positive and it would be burned into a silk screen

[01:00:56] to be printed.

[01:00:57] It's like a real, real labor labor intensive thing.

[01:01:02] You'd actually have to slave over a light table.

[01:01:05] So like a light table is like something the size of like, I don't know, like a ping pong

[01:01:08] table, maybe two buffet tables.

[01:01:11] It's a really, really big table and under it is light and you've got all these layers

[01:01:16] of Mylar and you're putting in the ink and you're cutting it with an exacto knife and

[01:01:20] you're peeling off what you want and what you don't want.

[01:01:22] Like this isn't like today with LEDs where it's all kind of like cool to touch.

[01:01:26] Like these things were like archaic, these light tables.

[01:01:29] They literally had hot light lamps underneath them.

[01:01:33] So this table is super hot.

[01:01:35] I mean, in the 1970s, they were like what, 20 years out of just burning wood for fire

[01:01:39] and light, you know, and they're moved on to light bulbs.

[01:01:44] This guy, you know, it's rough.

[01:01:46] It's not easy work.

[01:01:48] So let's move on to probably one of the most fun bits here at the time and that's

[01:01:54] eight ball.

[01:01:56] It's a pool theme or billiards theme, April of 1978, standard body solace date machine,

[01:02:04] 20,230 units designed by George Christian, artwork by Paul Ferris.

[01:02:13] Now this was up until the Adams family, the highest selling pin of all time.

[01:02:22] And that's a long time till the 1990s.

[01:02:26] Have you ever heard of Happy Days?

[01:02:28] Yeah, I've heard of this.

[01:02:30] Yeah, the back glass here on eight ball.

[01:02:34] You mean the fans?

[01:02:37] Yeah, well, it kind of looks like the fans.

[01:02:39] Yeah, it definitely looks like the fans.

[01:02:41] I mean, it kind of looks like them, right?

[01:02:44] By kind of, you mean exactly like him, yes.

[01:02:47] Is Margaret Hudson would say the fans back glass?

[01:02:51] Oh, oh, we're not supposed to say that because it wasn't fancy.

[01:02:55] It kind of looked like that with the days before licensing and all that.

[01:02:59] Well, actually they were licensing at the time.

[01:03:01] They just obviously didn't want to pay Henry Winkler for his likeness.

[01:03:04] Yeah.

[01:03:05] Paul Ferris said they decided on a pool theme, pool theme sold well.

[01:03:09] And we wanted a Happy Days kind of theme with a cool leather jacket guy.

[01:03:14] It wasn't supposed to be the fans, but look like him, like Travolta, a caricature of a 50s

[01:03:19] guy.

[01:03:20] I wanted it to look like him.

[01:03:21] I would have made it look exactly like him.

[01:03:24] I would argue to Paul that it does look exactly like him.

[01:03:27] That looks pretty darn close.

[01:03:28] Yeah, it looks pretty darn close to Henry Winkler as the fans.

[01:03:31] Yeah, it's pretty good.

[01:03:33] Pretty, pretty good.

[01:03:35] So marketing and executives always have to review art, always have to review the art and

[01:03:40] all that stuff, right?

[01:03:41] So obviously they didn't see him looking pretty darn close to the fans.

[01:03:47] You know, certainly wasn't an issue for them.

[01:03:50] Well, according to Paul Ferris, once Henry Winkler was at a party with a ballet executives

[01:03:55] and he said, you know, you've really arrived when you see yourself on a pinball machine.

[01:03:59] So he thought it was him.

[01:04:01] Yeah, so the guy who it was allegedly thought it was him.

[01:04:05] So I mean, a celebrity on pinball was fairly new at the time, right?

[01:04:10] We're a couple of years in since, wizard, since that kind of thing.

[01:04:15] Not every machine is a license at the time, but it's much more commonplace than it was.

[01:04:20] And I mean, celebrities wanted to be on pinball machines.

[01:04:23] So since it was the infancy of licensing, I mean, probably not a big deal if you sort

[01:04:28] of snag somebody's face, there was no legal action taken for the machine.

[01:04:33] So it's not like Winkler or any of the funds, you know, IP holders or, you know, happy

[01:04:43] days, folk had any issues whatsoever with the art, but that kind of looks like the

[01:04:50] funds.

[01:04:51] Yes, listeners were looking at it and I'll tell you, it's the funds.

[01:04:54] I don't know.

[01:04:55] If he wanted it, if he wanted it to look like the funds, he would have made it look like

[01:04:59] the funds.

[01:05:00] Well, according to Williams, Indiana Jones, the pinball adventures, the backlash, that's

[01:05:05] that's not Harrison Ford.

[01:05:07] That's Indiana Jones.

[01:05:09] Of course.

[01:05:11] They just Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford look similar, but they're not the same person.

[01:05:14] Yeah, yeah.

[01:05:15] Okay.

[01:05:16] At the time, right, Paul was told, hey, we, you know, we got to have a soda shop.

[01:05:20] It can't be a bar.

[01:05:22] Can't be anything sleazy because pinball was being legalized in a lot of these places

[01:05:26] and they wanted it to appeal to families.

[01:05:29] But there's some serious boobs in this backlash.

[01:05:32] I would say not appeal to families, but appeal to teenage boys.

[01:05:37] Yeah.

[01:05:38] That's what they're really going for.

[01:05:40] So this is where a lot of Dave Christiansen, Paul Ferris horn locking sort of begins, which

[01:05:48] I found fairly interesting.

[01:05:50] Yeah.

[01:05:51] Paul says Dave's issue was time.

[01:05:52] It took him a long time to do the art.

[01:05:55] There were issues between Dave and I.

[01:05:57] Dave just wasn't a nine to five guy.

[01:05:59] Dave saw Paul as an adversary at the time when he came into Valley.

[01:06:04] And according to Paul, they got along after a while, but there was a certain level of conflict

[01:06:11] between the two.

[01:06:12] You've got Paul Ferris coming in, the new sort of young guy, bunch of new ideas.

[01:06:18] Licensing is coming in with a lot of the Valley guys.

[01:06:21] Things are sort of changing.

[01:06:22] And I mean, nobody likes a new kid coming in and telling you how to change your job and

[01:06:26] what to do and when to do it by, of course, Paul was probably much more political at his

[01:06:33] time at Valley and often would tread lightly when talking about Dave during his podcast

[01:06:41] interviews.

[01:06:42] He was very nice.

[01:06:44] He never said anything bad about Dave.

[01:06:46] He just said he was, you know, he was difficult or they would eventually work it out.

[01:06:50] Dave though in his top cast interviews, wouldn't really didn't actually ever say Paul's name.

[01:06:57] Dave Christiansen says when April came out, the person that did that machine, notice

[01:07:01] he didn't use his name was in the cubicle right next to me.

[01:07:04] There was a lot of unhappy situations, political situations.

[01:07:08] It was really a bummer.

[01:07:09] Everything went to hell.

[01:07:10] I just wanted to go back to the slot machine department.

[01:07:12] There was a lot of jealousy in the art department.

[01:07:15] Paul brought structure to the art team, which is what he was supposed to do.

[01:07:19] He brought new ideas.

[01:07:20] He brought new processes.

[01:07:22] He started to level up the art at Valley and Dave was a lone wolf.

[01:07:26] He was old school.

[01:07:27] The Dave said once they brought in the new art director, again, he didn't use his name,

[01:07:31] that was it for me.

[01:07:32] He didn't like me and I didn't like him.

[01:07:34] He brought in corporate.

[01:07:35] It was all corporate from then on.

[01:07:38] It was like all of a sudden the ability to come up with your own ideas was gone.

[01:07:41] I didn't last there much longer.

[01:07:42] So when we go back to this eight ball back glass and you look at all of the fun that

[01:07:48] everybody's having there playing pool with a guy that sort of looks like the fonds and

[01:07:54] playing pinball in the background.

[01:07:56] There's a woman with a bracelet in the back.

[01:08:00] She has Margaret Hudson's initials on it, which is super, super nice.

[01:08:07] So often the designers and the people would throw in these silly little homages to somebody

[01:08:14] who helped.

[01:08:15] And Margaret Hudson, of course, did a lot of the key line and the color separations for

[01:08:21] the production of this game.

[01:08:23] After that, Dave Christians said we do Bobby or I don't want to jump into Bobby or today

[01:08:28] in this podcast because this is a whole this pinball machine is a whole thing up here.

[01:08:33] So we're going to go into that in some other podcast.

[01:08:35] Do you like Bobby or I never saw him play you better say yes.

[01:08:40] I never saw him play.

[01:08:41] I don't know.

[01:08:42] He played for the Bruins, right?

[01:08:47] Jason Sparrows was a bowling theme June of 1978.

[01:08:52] It sold 12,820 units in Gary Gaiton again.

[01:08:56] This time artwork by a Mr. Kevin O'Connor.

[01:09:00] Ron, why don't you tell us a little bit about the Kevin O'Connor.

[01:09:05] Well, he started his art career as a point of purchase designer, like beer signs, countertop

[01:09:09] displays, that kind of stuff.

[01:09:12] And the answer and add in the paper is father pointed it out and they assumed it was going

[01:09:15] to be a coin vending machine like Coke machines.

[01:09:18] So he met with Paul Ferris for an interview.

[01:09:20] What called Paul's eye was a painting of a dragon and fire that he did.

[01:09:25] Paul was working on Lost World at the time and he liked that style.

[01:09:28] Yeah, so Kevin, he would say I was told to I basically had the job.

[01:09:33] I didn't know I would have such a career.

[01:09:35] I met rock stars, celebrities.

[01:09:38] I went to rock concerts and even the Playboy mansion.

[01:09:41] So he worked very much on a technique with magic markers.

[01:09:46] It would make his paintings with magic markers have these sweeping lines and these thick tones.

[01:09:52] It was very, very different that style of art compared to again, the standard at ad

[01:09:58] posters, which was that kind of old symmetrical lines and cartoony characters compared to the

[01:10:06] very straight, classical version of Dave Christianson.

[01:10:10] This is a whole other thing.

[01:10:11] Great for air says magic markers were made out of a glass tube.

[01:10:16] We learned from Paul Ferris if you get mad enough at your work and throw the magic marker

[01:10:20] against the wall, it would break and leave a large color mark on the wall.

[01:10:23] So we came into the office one morning and asked Paul did you have a bad night last night

[01:10:27] and he said yeah.

[01:10:29] Awesome.

[01:10:30] Sounds like art is passion.

[01:10:32] It's all about passion.

[01:10:33] Kevin on his first pin was given a bowling theme and he drew it with silk screen with

[01:10:39] 10 layers, those peeling off layers, had no half tones.

[01:10:43] So when he does, he blended the colors together.

[01:10:45] So rather than the straight lines of Christianson, he would dimple the colors to blend them in

[01:10:51] together.

[01:10:52] So if you look at strikes and spares, specifically that back glass, you can see that it is different

[01:11:00] than kind of all of those other games at the time.

[01:11:04] And a lot of that has to do with that sort of blending.

[01:11:08] Kevin would actually say that I had very little input.

[01:11:11] I drew what I was told.

[01:11:14] This pin is really where Kevin developed his first style, really what he was all about.

[01:11:20] He's very, especially at this time, women, sexuality, teen boys were really the market

[01:11:26] when it came to pinball.

[01:11:28] I'm going to say that it was sexually empowering.

[01:11:31] Let's call it that.

[01:11:32] The woman was the focal point.

[01:11:35] Often in his art, the woman is empowered.

[01:11:38] She's not a slave girl, which we'll get into in a little while.

[01:11:41] He uses a lot of yellows, a lot of oranges.

[01:11:44] It's fairly cartoony and light-hearted, which I think probably comes from that magic

[01:11:48] marker background that it's a lot harder to draw very serious, I think, in that style.

[01:11:53] The main character, the woman on the back glass specifically in Strikes and Spares, was

[01:11:59] not an individual.

[01:12:00] It wasn't a person, it wasn't a person at Valley.

[01:12:02] It was just a fantasy girl that Kevin had created.

[01:12:05] Now, have you played Strikes and Spares?

[01:12:09] Oh, yeah.

[01:12:10] I haven't played Strikes and Spares.

[01:12:11] I hear it's kind of good.

[01:12:12] That's all right.

[01:12:13] Designed by Gary Gaiton, right?

[01:12:15] So kind of his standard style of kind of orbit spinners and whatever.

[01:12:19] Just like how the guy's wearing a ballet t-shirt.

[01:12:22] Yeah.

[01:12:23] There's a fellow that's looking at the main character with his bowling ball in a bag.

[01:12:30] And his girlfriend or wife is dragging him off because he's staring at the beautiful

[01:12:35] woman, the character in the middle.

[01:12:38] There's another fellow on the back glass.

[01:12:40] He's trying to pour a drink, and he's staring at the lady and he's pouring the drink on

[01:12:44] the table, which is then being poured on his girlfriend.

[01:12:48] Also, by the way, these girlfriends or wives in the photos, not bad luck.

[01:12:53] They're looking themselves.

[01:12:54] So, not really sure what their attention is diverted for.

[01:12:58] Again, really, really cold at ballet.

[01:13:01] Really cold.

[01:13:02] Really cold.

[01:13:03] This brings us to kind of a watershed moment at ballet with the Lost World, which was a

[01:13:12] medieval fantasy theme.

[01:13:14] February 1978.

[01:13:17] Solid state standard body machine with 10,330 units.

[01:13:21] February gate and again, artwork by Paul Ferris.

[01:13:25] So that watershed moment, Ron, was ballies with the called four layer screen process.

[01:13:31] Yeah.

[01:13:32] With artists like Kevin Experiment with different techniques and methods of making art,

[01:13:35] they needed a new way of printing the art.

[01:13:38] So if you look at ballies Lost World and after, you just go, I mean, look at Peragon.

[01:13:46] Like, wow, it's like incredible.

[01:13:48] And this was when they started using the four color printing process.

[01:13:52] And Paul Ferris had a lot riding on the four color process.

[01:13:55] But enabled them to do airbrush and oil painting, basically beyond the basic line work, massive

[01:14:01] time and cost savings on the artist, transfer that painted artwork to the glass.

[01:14:06] So now you can just paint something and put it on the glass.

[01:14:09] Yeah.

[01:14:10] So, as we had mentioned before, right, you're doing all the key line and separations, right,

[01:14:15] you're cutting things with your peeling things off and you're on this light table and all

[01:14:19] that stuff.

[01:14:20] It's self a very cool process.

[01:14:22] And when you've got somebody like a Dave Christiansen, he's the master of that.

[01:14:27] Well, when you've got new fellows coming in and they've got these new styles, this Kevin

[01:14:32] O'Connor actually talks in some of his, if you go to YouTube, a lot of his seminars,

[01:14:37] he talks about how he did like lacquer on the airbrush and he's like, oh, it's bad for

[01:14:41] you.

[01:14:42] You can do that for very long, but you can see that they're experimenting with new ways

[01:14:47] of doing things.

[01:14:49] And they had to come up with a new way to make a painting and then put that painting

[01:14:54] and reproduce that painting.

[01:14:56] Very, very, very cool.

[01:14:57] So originally you had like 14 colors and those 14 colors would have 14 sort of separate

[01:15:03] colors on a template for the printers.

[01:15:05] Well, with a four layer process, you stack the four colors on like negatives, like

[01:15:12] back in the day, when you would do pictures, you would have negatives as opposed to a digital

[01:15:16] picture nowadays, but you would layer those colors and then you print those four colors.

[01:15:21] And then some of the colors would overlap and create another color, right?

[01:15:25] There are four color play fields.

[01:15:27] I mean, ad posters was still doing the regular screening of the play fields at the time.

[01:15:32] Valley was worried that if they changed both the back glass and the play field, there

[01:15:36] was too much that could go wrong in messing up the process.

[01:15:40] Do you know what the first four color play field was wrong?

[01:15:43] I do not.

[01:15:44] This is actually really, really cool.

[01:15:47] It was Sega's golden eye.

[01:15:50] Really?

[01:15:51] They didn't do a four color play field all the way until golden eye.

[01:15:54] Do you know who did the art on golden eye?

[01:15:56] Who did the art on golden eye?

[01:15:58] Paul Ferris.

[01:15:59] Wow.

[01:16:00] It was such a good presentation.

[01:16:03] But I mean, if you've ever seen any of these ballet back glasses, people noticed the

[01:16:07] difference.

[01:16:08] Paul Ferris once said he overheard two people talking to each other at a pinball industry

[01:16:13] event.

[01:16:14] And they said, no wonder ballies first.

[01:16:17] Look at their art.

[01:16:18] And you can.

[01:16:19] If you like, people know it, right?

[01:16:20] When they go to it, they're like, oh, wow, these are not like, they know there's something

[01:16:24] different, but they don't know what it is.

[01:16:27] And it's that switch from that sort of old school methodology into four color.

[01:16:31] I bet you a bunch of people sitting in their cars right now or on their can at work avoiding

[01:16:36] doing actually anything.

[01:16:38] They're going, oh, yeah, wow.

[01:16:40] I have noticed that.

[01:16:41] And that's why because this four color process, I would argue that's why lost world sold so

[01:16:45] well because the game's not good.

[01:16:47] Yeah, but they sold 10,000 units.

[01:16:49] So again, what do I know?

[01:16:50] Paul Ferris would say they likely didn't know anything was different in the printing process

[01:16:56] of that machine, but they knew the art was a much higher standard than any of the other

[01:17:02] manufacturers.

[01:17:04] They were doing exactly what Valley wanted to do.

[01:17:07] They wanted to be different than every other manufacturer.

[01:17:11] And this is a prime example of being different.

[01:17:15] This machine has a slave girl, which was one of Paul Ferris's sort of go-to's when it

[01:17:23] came to art styles.

[01:17:26] So on the back glass, it's very medieval fantasy theme.

[01:17:33] There's like a winged man who is crazy ripped, kind of like Ron.

[01:17:40] And then there's this beautiful, best description is slave Leia from Star Wars.

[01:17:48] She's like chained to a dragon.

[01:17:51] There's like water in the front, in the background.

[01:17:56] There's like these moons and stars.

[01:17:59] This got this awesome art around the edges like this medieval, broke style, very cool,

[01:18:09] very cool.

[01:18:10] It's something else.

[01:18:12] Even the play field art is very cool.

[01:18:14] It's still being done in the standard methodology.

[01:18:16] It's not for color, but it's super cool too.

[01:18:19] It's got the dude, he's punching a dragon.

[01:18:23] And it's basically Paul Ferris and his wife.

[01:18:26] Yes.

[01:18:27] So the art here, of course, being a male focused industry, Paul said the figures were based

[01:18:33] on himself and his wife.

[01:18:35] Good for you, Paul Ferris.

[01:18:37] This game would get a sequel.

[01:18:38] Ooh, we'll get into that in a minute.

[01:18:40] One of my favorites.

[01:18:41] So it's time to bring Dave Christensen back, right?

[01:18:44] Six million dollar man.

[01:18:47] Licensed like heroes, he like a superhero.

[01:18:51] You've never seen six million dollar man, he's the bionic man.

[01:18:53] Yeah, he's a bionic man.

[01:18:54] But he's not just robot, dude.

[01:18:58] Would you say that's a superhero?

[01:19:00] I mean, he is...

[01:19:02] I guess cyborg is a superhero.

[01:19:04] I try to remember, he's an astronaut, he gets in an accident, so I think it's both his

[01:19:08] legs, his right arm, and one of his eyes are bionic.

[01:19:12] And late 70s bionic, by the way.

[01:19:14] And the cost of everything was six million dollars to do that, so.

[01:19:17] You ever see the family guy where they're like, we could rebuild him.

[01:19:20] Yes, we can.

[01:19:21] On a budget.

[01:19:22] Yeah.

[01:19:23] That's where that line comes from.

[01:19:24] The garbage can.

[01:19:25] Oh my God.

[01:19:26] We can rebuild him.

[01:19:27] He'll be faster, stronger, all that.

[01:19:29] That's where the line comes from, the show.

[01:19:31] Yeah.

[01:19:32] October 1978, they sells 10,230 units.

[01:19:36] Greg Kemic, artwork day, Christianson.

[01:19:39] Greg Kemic told IPDB, I did use the name city slicker on the 1978 whitewood.

[01:19:45] I was rolling out hit games back then.

[01:19:48] Tom Neiman obtained the license for six million dollar man.

[01:19:51] And city slickers, the whitewood, played so well that they chose it for the next license

[01:19:57] game and assigned Dave Christianson.

[01:20:01] I mean, I have played six million dollar man.

[01:20:05] It's shoot it up the orbit into the saucer at the top, just like Montahari and every

[01:20:10] other game back then.

[01:20:12] Every other ballet game, yes.

[01:20:14] I don't know why Greg would say that he was rolling out hit games back then.

[01:20:21] I mean, I guess they sold, but they were all way too similar.

[01:20:26] That's your opinion.

[01:20:28] But yeah, you're probably right.

[01:20:30] But most of it, they had that saucer in the middle and usually a spinner orbit way

[01:20:36] to get up there.

[01:20:37] Drop targets at the bottom.

[01:20:38] And they re, and drop targets that they reuse that a lot.

[01:20:42] Early play fields, they did with this.

[01:20:44] They were actually more green than blue, which is interesting.

[01:20:47] Can you imagine that printing errors on a pinball play field?

[01:20:52] That is unheard of.

[01:20:53] They never made errors back then, right?

[01:20:54] Unheard of.

[01:20:55] Remember, you ooze, you loose.

[01:20:57] If you know what that reference is, send us an email, silverballcroniclesaggmail.com.

[01:21:03] This is a good one.

[01:21:04] Okay.

[01:21:05] I'm ready for the next game.

[01:21:07] Are you ready for the next game?

[01:21:08] I'm ready for the next game.

[01:21:10] Are you sitting down?

[01:21:12] I'm sitting down.

[01:21:13] Do you have pants on?

[01:21:14] Yes.

[01:21:16] The next game, Playboy.

[01:21:18] It's a pop culture, adult magazine theme.

[01:21:23] December of 1978.

[01:21:25] So sells 18,250 units.

[01:21:30] Jim Patla does the play field design and the artwork by Paul Ferris.

[01:21:35] So I've included some information that we're going to talk about in the show notes.

[01:21:39] If you'd like to follow along.

[01:21:41] Playboy was an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine founded by Hugh

[01:21:46] Heffner.

[01:21:47] His first issue was done in Chicago in 1953 and the brand was first financed by a thousand

[01:21:54] dollar loan from Hugh Heffner's mother.

[01:21:57] Playboy was known for its nude or semi-nude centerfolds, playmates, or their models, playboy

[01:22:03] bunnies, and published many short stories from novelists, such as Ian Fleming, who's

[01:22:08] known for James Bond, Margaret Atwood, who is a famous Canadian writer who you may know

[01:22:13] from the hands-made tale and role doll who did Charlie and the chocolate factory.

[01:22:19] So Playboy actually played a very important role in Western sexual revolution and let's

[01:22:25] say the upbringing of many and lessened boys through that time.

[01:22:29] You only read it for the article, though.

[01:22:30] I don't know how to read.

[01:22:33] Okay.

[01:22:34] So this pinball machine, I haven't seen one.

[01:22:41] When I look at the art and I did the research and we did all this stuff, it's a cool machine.

[01:22:47] Now it's got the four color process but it was made to look like it was the old line style

[01:22:52] which is kind of neat.

[01:22:53] This was one of the first four or five pinball machines I ever saw.

[01:22:57] The guidance given by Playboy and Hugh Heffner to Balli was that they wanted it to have

[01:23:03] a positive image of Playboy.

[01:23:05] The lifestyle, parties, resorts, having fun, they didn't want it to be sleazy.

[01:23:14] And you know what, I agree.

[01:23:15] This machine looks super classy and super cool.

[01:23:20] I mean, it's not.

[01:23:22] It's back in the, it's a Porto magazine but that was not what they wanted it to be.

[01:23:27] They wanted it to be this sort of classy lifestyle magazine, right?

[01:23:32] What do you think?

[01:23:33] Does it accomplish that?

[01:23:35] I don't know, that side art is pretty interesting.

[01:23:38] I mean, she's pulling a plunger rod.

[01:23:41] Oh, I see what you do.

[01:23:42] Basically, it's the Playboy trademark woman there that's their trademark.

[01:23:49] I don't know if she has a name or not.

[01:23:52] And basically it's Hugh Heffner on the back glass with Paddy McGuire and Sandra Theodore

[01:23:58] who were two playmates.

[01:24:00] Paddy McGuire will later go on to, she married Jimmy Connors.

[01:24:04] The famous tennis player, more unnecessary trivia there.

[01:24:07] Heff was very excited and he was, he was, he was mostly involved with designing the idea

[01:24:15] of the pin and the feeling of the pin.

[01:24:18] Now at the same time, they were building a big hotel in Atlantic City and he spent more

[01:24:22] time trying to be involved in the pinball machine that he was in the actual building of

[01:24:28] the hotel in Atlantic City.

[01:24:29] He again wanted it to be more of the lifestyle.

[01:24:32] He wanted to be in the middle of the pinball machine.

[01:24:34] He wanted to be the Playboy icon, which inevitably he was.

[01:24:39] Paddy McGuire was like the playmate of the year.

[01:24:42] Sandra Theodore was a playmate but she was the current girlfriend of, of you.

[01:24:47] That's how she got in there.

[01:24:49] And also if you, if you look at the back, actually, if you look at the play field, and I don't

[01:24:53] know if you could see this in IPDB, in the pop-up or area where the two women are, like

[01:24:58] right in the center above like the bottom pop-up or where this playboy mansion is.

[01:25:04] That's a window.

[01:25:05] If you look in there, you can see you have near with his, with the, oh my god, I can't

[01:25:10] see it.

[01:25:11] I never noticed this until CPR did their repros.

[01:25:15] That you look at that, like, oh my god, how the, oh it's there.

[01:25:17] You ever get a chance?

[01:25:19] Check that out.

[01:25:20] It's just like, wow, how that ever get in there.

[01:25:22] But they put it where the pop-upers are so you can't really notice it.

[01:25:24] I mean, you'll never see it unless the playfield's unpopulated.

[01:25:28] Yeah, so if you look, you can see it's very clear too.

[01:25:31] And you look at it.

[01:25:31] He's got the jacket on and the woman's like, dude, standing in front of him.

[01:25:34] Oh my.

[01:25:35] Now there's another thing on this machine is that there is, on the back glass, there's

[01:25:41] this old lady in the pool just quote unquote, hanging out.

[01:25:47] She's in the grotto.

[01:25:48] Granny in the grotto.

[01:25:49] Yes.

[01:25:50] So this character was created by Robert Buck Brown.

[01:25:56] And the character is called Naughty Granny, as she relentlessly attempts to seduce men.

[01:26:02] She was designed by Brown to upend social norms in the Playboy magazine comics.

[01:26:09] It was his take on the dirty old man's stereotype.

[01:26:12] His goal was to flip it on his head and satirize it.

[01:26:16] Brown is one of Playboy's African American contributors at the time.

[01:26:21] He took that opportunity to be a real trailblazer who often would take off limits

[01:26:25] targets like race, sex and civil rights and make them funny.

[01:26:30] Playboy's audience at the time mind you was predominantly white and male.

[01:26:36] Very interesting.

[01:26:37] So Paul Ferris, he took a trip out to California, the Playboy Mansion.

[01:26:42] James Conn was there.

[01:26:43] If anyone's familiar who James Conn is, yeah, that's cool.

[01:26:46] They've ever seen the Godfather or that terrible Arnold Schwarzenegger movie he was in.

[01:26:51] A racer.

[01:26:52] Oh, that's a bad movie.

[01:26:53] That's a bad movie.

[01:26:54] I thought you'd hear about a racer during a ballet art thing, did you?

[01:26:58] No.

[01:26:59] Paul Ferris as the original oil painting signed by a UFNR himself.

[01:27:03] Remember, they take the painting at this point and then use the four color process to

[01:27:08] slap it on the back less.

[01:27:10] And Paul actually tells this whole story on top cast.

[01:27:12] So you should listen to that.

[01:27:14] After the initial approval, they went out a second time to unveil the Playboy machine

[01:27:19] at the Playboy Towers in a, of course, extravagant Playboy style party.

[01:27:23] It was a last minute project because they had to get the back glass printed locally.

[01:27:29] And with 15 minutes left before the reveal, Paul runs up in the backstage area, throws

[01:27:35] the glass into the machine and they raise the curtains.

[01:27:38] The women on the back glass were extremely focused on their bodies and they were very pleased

[01:27:44] with how it turned out.

[01:27:46] Of course, half himself wanted to look youthful and refined.

[01:27:50] Valley, of course, at the time we've mentioned this a few times, was very worried about

[01:27:54] its wholesome image.

[01:27:56] 18,000 units is 18,000 units, right?

[01:27:59] Yeah, and that's not very wholesome.

[01:28:02] And Tom Neiman, the VP of Marketing for Balli, pinball, he told IPDB his name or initials

[01:28:06] appeared on most back glasses of this time period for which he obtained the license.

[01:28:11] On this game, his name is on the Champagne bottle.

[01:28:13] Yeah, so if you look on the Champagne bottle by the pool air, that's his name.

[01:28:18] The start-up tune, the grotto tune, and bonus score countdown tune resemble portions of

[01:28:22] Cyclome and Playboy theme.

[01:28:24] For the 1969 TV show Playboy After Dark, yes, the folks, there was a Playboy show.

[01:28:29] And that's that music, and then the bonus countdown that just goes forever.

[01:28:36] Yeah, forever.

[01:28:37] Yeah, forever.

[01:28:38] It's like Mata Hari, it's like, okay, I'm just going to go have a beer while we wait here.

[01:28:42] The next game that was, you know, of note was supersonic.

[01:28:46] Don't want to go into a whole lot of detail here.

[01:28:48] So supersonic was done by Greg Kameck.

[01:28:51] Kevin O'Connor was given a blank white wooden set giver.

[01:28:53] At the time, Concord jets were a big deal, so they decided to make supersonic as the theme.

[01:28:59] Now this is a notable machine because it used an experimental lacquer paint, which was

[01:29:05] used to do the painting on the back glass.

[01:29:09] That method, of course, very bad for your health.

[01:29:11] And Kevin O'Connor has a YouTube video where he sort of touches on that a little bit

[01:29:14] on how they were experimenting with all these different methods.

[01:29:17] And lacquer paint in an airbrush was something that did not last because of health reasons.

[01:29:23] And if you have a supersonic, you can just remove the right flipper because you never

[01:29:26] use it.

[01:29:27] Star Trek.

[01:29:28] Here we go.

[01:29:29] Now we're getting into the real stuff here.

[01:29:31] Syphys Space Theme April 1976 sells 16,842 units Gary Gaten artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[01:29:43] Make it to zero number one.

[01:29:44] Kevin O'Connor, correct.

[01:29:46] Star Trek began as an American science fiction TV series, which ran from 1966 to 1969.

[01:29:53] It was canceled due to low ratings.

[01:29:55] But in syndication, the series' episodes were enjoyed countless times by people and created

[01:30:02] almost a cult following.

[01:30:04] After the success of Star Wars, production companies race to find what sci-fi properties

[01:30:09] that they had the rights to which led to 1979 Star Trek, the first of six movies using

[01:30:17] the same actors from the original TV show.

[01:30:20] Star Trek The Motion Picture, the worst Star Trek movie.

[01:30:24] Five is pretty bad.

[01:30:25] I don't know.

[01:30:26] Five's got some fun to it.

[01:30:27] What about what was that?

[01:30:29] Nemesis?

[01:30:30] That was bad.

[01:30:31] You're talking about that's next gen.

[01:30:32] Yeah, but still that's it.

[01:30:33] I'm not including that.

[01:30:34] I'm putting the original.

[01:30:36] So the original cast?

[01:30:37] No.

[01:30:38] No, motion picture is horrible.

[01:30:40] In my opinion, it doesn't start until Star Trek 2, The Rath of Con.

[01:30:43] Well, that's true.

[01:30:44] Just started with Star Trek 2, The Rath of Con.

[01:30:46] Interesting thing about the art for this game is when they started working on the art,

[01:30:50] they went about it like it was the TV show.

[01:30:52] So the original backlash had your typical blue, yellow, and the red that you don't want

[01:30:58] to be wearing uniforms.

[01:31:00] And then the movie, it almost like they didn't have a copy of the script or know what the

[01:31:05] movie was going to be about or anything because they made last minute art changes in

[01:31:08] the art to accommodate the movie.

[01:31:12] Kevin O'Connor said it was quite a chore at the time to make that change.

[01:31:15] It was a big effort in whiteing out the colors and changing the colors and fabric flows.

[01:31:19] Oh, could you imagine that they're like, oh no, no, they're supposed to have these horrible

[01:31:23] gray, crappy uniforms instead of these iconic colored ones.

[01:31:28] Yeah.

[01:31:29] What they end up doing is on the back, last, there's a guy shooting like an orb.

[01:31:35] Originally, it was actually going to be an actual character, but they changed it to orb

[01:31:41] to get it through licensing because the Star Trek people said, no, can't be shooting

[01:31:44] like a creature.

[01:31:46] It's Star Trek.

[01:31:47] We don't do that.

[01:31:48] Star Trek, in general around sort of the motion picture was really strange, right?

[01:31:55] Like it, that whole movie, if you watch the whole movie, it's like nothing happens.

[01:32:01] The whole movie, nothing.

[01:32:02] Well, they changed.

[01:32:04] So they had to change all the uniforms on the back glass.

[01:32:06] And I think they made a couple changes on the play field with plastics.

[01:32:08] They added.

[01:32:09] They changed one of the...

[01:32:11] They added the bald girl.

[01:32:14] Persist Cumbata was her name.

[01:32:16] Yes, the other one from the movie.

[01:32:17] They added, yeah, they changed it out to be her.

[01:32:21] So they had to make some artwork changes.

[01:32:23] I would have preferred to be like the original show.

[01:32:25] That would have been...

[01:32:26] Yeah.

[01:32:27] So in the TPR, you could pick up an original series back glass and plastics.

[01:32:32] So that's the way to go, in my opinion, if you're rebuilding one or you need one that

[01:32:36] needs plastics or your back glass is shot by the motion picture one, let us never speak

[01:32:40] of the motion picture ever again.

[01:32:42] Not by the motion picture one.

[01:32:44] By the TV one.

[01:32:45] Yeah.

[01:32:46] Eh.

[01:32:47] Wasn't that bad.

[01:32:48] It had good special effects because they had the whole industrial light magic from

[01:32:51] Star Wars coming and do the special effects for it.

[01:32:53] It's like three hours and nothing.

[01:32:55] We could see klingons.

[01:32:56] Like the sound of music guy wrote, did that movie, I think.

[01:32:59] It was kind of boring.

[01:33:00] I guess.

[01:33:01] See, I was going to do a whole thing and here is the director and stuff like we've done

[01:33:05] for like T2 and all that stuff.

[01:33:07] But this movie is so bad, I don't even want to waste the...

[01:33:10] Wow.

[01:33:11] Kiss is a rock star fantasy theme from June of 1979.

[01:33:17] It's a standard body sell 17,000 units.

[01:33:21] Jim Patla with artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[01:33:25] You want the best?

[01:33:26] You got the best.

[01:33:27] The greatest band in the world.

[01:33:28] Kiss.

[01:33:29] This, this, the art on this machine is amazing.

[01:33:33] It is.

[01:33:34] I don't like kiss.

[01:33:35] I've never liked kiss.

[01:33:36] I'll never like kiss.

[01:33:38] I don't like the band.

[01:33:40] But man, it's cool.

[01:33:42] This, the art on this thing is astounding.

[01:33:47] It's, and the only thing better is the new kiss.

[01:33:50] Also done by Kevin O'Connor.

[01:33:52] Well, they sent Kevin to a concert to research the game.

[01:33:56] And he said the first show with, is the first show with Pyrrho he had ever seen.

[01:34:01] He said the fire was hot.

[01:34:02] You could feel the heat.

[01:34:03] And they were so loud at the time my pants were flapping.

[01:34:05] Oh my.

[01:34:08] Yeah, at the time the love gun album.

[01:34:11] Huge.

[01:34:12] Right.

[01:34:12] Kiss was, kiss was massive.

[01:34:15] They were like this, this was before they got into that weird disco-y stuff.

[01:34:20] This is before they were two.

[01:34:22] It was, it really sort of had melded sort of glam rock very well with whatever the heck

[01:34:27] they were doing.

[01:34:29] And the stage presence and excitement that they brought to their shows astounding.

[01:34:35] So like all kiss merchandise, they have had various controversies because they have

[01:34:40] these lightning bolt S's, which accidentally look like the German SS insignia.

[01:34:46] So in Germany, they had to make a different backlash for this machine with different style

[01:34:51] S's.

[01:34:52] One interesting thing about this machine in comparison to most of the machines was that

[01:34:57] it had a prototype with speech.

[01:34:59] Yeah, Alan Reisman, engineering lab supervisor, Bally from 1977 to 1983.

[01:35:04] He says the, the talking, kiss prototype did make it out of the lab at least once.

[01:35:09] He was displayed at the 1979 AMOA show in Chicago.

[01:35:14] He believes it said things like shoot the K and kiss when you completed a kiss row.

[01:35:18] It also grown too much rock and roll when you tilted it.

[01:35:22] It was only done as a one time concept.

[01:35:24] So there's like a whole legend around the magic marker sketch that was the original inspiration

[01:35:29] for that backlash.

[01:35:30] Yeah, but basically Kevin O'Connor did did the backlash and presented it to kiss.

[01:35:37] And remember, this is kiss.

[01:35:38] So they had issues with it.

[01:35:40] Specifically, number one, they did not look ripped enough, which I mean if you've seen

[01:35:44] kiss, they weren't really ripped, but they wanted to be ripped.

[01:35:47] They wanted to be like superheroes.

[01:35:49] And they also wanted bigger packages.

[01:35:53] You know what I mean?

[01:35:54] Oh, I didn't know that.

[01:35:55] Oh, yes.

[01:35:56] Oh, that didn't come up.

[01:35:57] Yeah.

[01:35:58] Okay.

[01:35:59] Well, if you look at the original Kevin O'Connor picture, then you look at the production

[01:36:02] backlash.

[01:36:04] Cast your eyes downward.

[01:36:05] You will see the difference.

[01:36:06] And that's what June Simmons did.

[01:36:09] Plus we are the greatest bound in the world.

[01:36:11] We are kiss poor Paul Stanley.

[01:36:14] Just didn't have the the package to carry that band home.

[01:36:18] I where is that sketch now?

[01:36:20] Okay.

[01:36:21] Kevin O'Connor would say that it was eventually traded to John Papaduke for a guitar.

[01:36:26] And later John Papaduke sold it to a collector, probably to fund a pinball company.

[01:36:32] And then it was sold to another collector.

[01:36:34] And apparently it still resides somewhere in Florida.

[01:36:37] Now you can go on and see this picture in various places.

[01:36:42] They look like normal kiss.

[01:36:44] They look like they would actually look.

[01:36:46] And then when you look at the production backlash, yeah.

[01:36:49] So there's a very cool picture of kiss and Paul Stanley holding the original magic marker

[01:36:57] sketch with some of the ballet folk.

[01:37:00] Very, very, very cool.

[01:37:03] Paragon.

[01:37:05] Fantasy theme June 1979.

[01:37:08] Now this is a wide body.

[01:37:10] Cells 9,120 units.

[01:37:14] Greg Kemek, artwork, Paul Ferris.

[01:37:17] We've mentioned this a few times because we've sort of been floating around in this 70s,

[01:37:22] 80s world of pinball for quite a few of our podcasts.

[01:37:26] Wide bodies were a thing because Atari entered the market and they created wide bodies.

[01:37:32] Everybody else freaked out because they thought, oh my goodness, what if we mess out on the

[01:37:36] newest, best invention ever?

[01:37:40] Well turns out it wasn't.

[01:37:41] It was a stupid invention.

[01:37:42] But at the time, they didn't want to take that risk.

[01:37:45] So they needed to do something different.

[01:37:46] So production was cut short on the lost world because of the timeline required for playboy,

[01:37:52] but Paul had suggested to do a sequel of the lost world because fantasy was quite popular

[01:37:58] at the time.

[01:37:59] Things like Conan with rich, exciting action and scantily clad slave women were a big deal.

[01:38:07] So this, of course, became Paul's favorite original painting to today and his wife once

[01:38:13] again modeled for the female character.

[01:38:16] And again, good job, sir.

[01:38:19] Good job.

[01:38:21] So Paragon's design elements were very similar to a few other games that were being manufactured

[01:38:26] by Valley at the time.

[01:38:27] They were on.

[01:38:28] Yeah, Valley had a lot of things that were kind of their thing, scissors flippers, inline

[01:38:34] drop targets, which I think they had a patent for.

[01:38:37] They loved saucers.

[01:38:38] They could never have enough saucers.

[01:38:40] So Paragon has two saucers.

[01:38:42] Two saucers.

[01:38:43] They love the pop-up or that causes havoc.

[01:38:47] So they put one in the beast layer on the left to kill you.

[01:38:52] And they also have the really cool like Wiggly channel on the right side, which is like

[01:38:56] a waterfall thing.

[01:38:59] Yeah, they really, if you want to pull out another cliche here, they tried to create a

[01:39:04] world under glass.

[01:39:06] Oh, we can't get through an episode without that line.

[01:39:10] Awesome.

[01:39:11] But it is one of the greatest arc packages.

[01:39:12] I mean, the back glass is a literal masterpiece.

[01:39:16] I was at one year at Expo, Paul Ferris brought these said painting in, the original painting,

[01:39:22] which is actually even larger than the back glass.

[01:39:26] It is quite large, the actual painting.

[01:39:28] And he brought that in.

[01:39:29] He had it sitting behind him at the autograph table.

[01:39:31] It's like, damn, that thing is unbelievable.

[01:39:34] So if we think about, if we talk about the back glass, what the inspiration for that is

[01:39:37] somewhat of the lost world, you have a tiger with wing, not a tiger.

[01:39:44] It's a lion with wings.

[01:39:46] This back glass confused me for years because I was trying to think what's happening in

[01:39:51] the picture.

[01:39:52] Because there's a picture as a lion.

[01:39:54] It's a part lion, part bird, part lizard with Paul Ferris riding on top of it with his

[01:40:00] sword up in the air.

[01:40:03] And the lion looks like he's going after the woman, his wife, who's changed, she's

[01:40:07] chained to the ground in a small bikini.

[01:40:10] And I think at this point, I've determined he's saving her because he has wings.

[01:40:15] So why would he need this lion lizard bird creature?

[01:40:20] So I think he's saving her from this thing.

[01:40:22] He's pulling his hair and he's going to stab it or something, signed by him down on

[01:40:27] the bottom right corner, he's got skulls in the left.

[01:40:29] It's very cool.

[01:40:30] It's very cool back glass.

[01:40:31] But what I think is cooler than the back glass, it being awesome, is the play field itself.

[01:40:36] Oh, the play field is no slouch either.

[01:40:37] And the plastic.

[01:40:38] I think the play field is awesome.

[01:40:41] It's got golden cliffs on the left side.

[01:40:44] So it's got cliffs that build a bonus and a saucer.

[01:40:47] Then on the right side, it's got a massive tower.

[01:40:52] And then below that, it has a fountain going down from the gods up above in the hills,

[01:40:59] down into the common folk at the bottom.

[01:41:02] And the water runs down that wiggly thing.

[01:41:04] We were talking about a moment similar to knockout from Valley down into the out lanes.

[01:41:09] And then you've got the two characters, the female in the male, kind of on the top

[01:41:15] in the middle, in line drop targets on the left into another saucer, where you get

[01:41:20] into like the treasure area.

[01:41:24] It's awesome.

[01:41:26] You have got to look this up.

[01:41:27] Just look at our show notes, take a look at it and flip around because it is something else.

[01:41:31] It's pretty nerdy.

[01:41:32] We're doing a pinball podcast.

[01:41:34] That's pretty nerdy.

[01:41:35] Yeah, that's true.

[01:41:36] So the golden cliffs tune, when you throw it into the into the into the golden cliffs,

[01:41:40] each time you put it in, it adds a new note.

[01:41:42] And that note eventually will, they'll all add up and it will play the Ohio players

[01:41:48] song once it's completed.

[01:41:50] I have no idea what that is.

[01:41:51] Really?

[01:41:52] Okay.

[01:41:53] Not a clue.

[01:41:54] Not a clue.

[01:41:55] I've heard of Ohio players, but Ohio players were actual pop band.

[01:42:00] Oh.

[01:42:01] Huh.

[01:42:03] So one thing that's also really cool about this is they had some issues in Europe around

[01:42:08] that that flipper arrangement at the bottom.

[01:42:11] And this is where the term Italian bottom is coined.

[01:42:14] So great.

[01:42:15] Comek says, if my memory serves me correctly, I seem to recall that the Italian French

[01:42:19] in German markets were quite strong for ballet during this period.

[01:42:23] And ballet was often visited by various foreign distributors.

[01:42:26] I recall that they relayed the fact that their players like to hold the pinball by the

[01:42:30] flippers.

[01:42:31] Their players like to hold the pinball on the flipper, take a drink of beer and brag

[01:42:34] to other players about the skillshot they were about to shoot.

[01:42:37] That couldn't be done with the original Paragon design.

[01:42:39] I tried something different with Paragon since it was ballet's first wide body game.

[01:42:43] Foreign players preferred one return lane on each side at the bottom of the game that

[01:42:47] returned the pinball to the flippers for a play field skillshot.

[01:42:51] This type of design became known within the industry as the Italian bottom.

[01:42:54] It was used extensively then throughout the industry and is still in use today.

[01:42:58] So nowadays, that is the standard.

[01:43:01] You're in lane, out lane, returned to the flipper.

[01:43:04] Right?

[01:43:05] That is all through.

[01:43:06] And that came from the fact that the Europeans didn't like on the fly play.

[01:43:13] And they actually had the European version of Paragon with one of the flippers removed.

[01:43:17] See, you could not scissor yourself.

[01:43:20] You know, I think that would probably be a better game in my opinion.

[01:43:23] No, no, no, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

[01:43:26] They also had issues with the inline drop targets on the left.

[01:43:30] When you got them all down and you would hit it into the saucer, they would reject a

[01:43:34] lot.

[01:43:35] I think they actually had a bulletin about removing a plastic piece that was there that

[01:43:39] was supposed to direct it.

[01:43:40] Because if you look at the play field, we're actually looking at right now, the saucer

[01:43:45] that is on the left side was supposed to be in a different location.

[01:43:49] And the art still, if I remember, reflects where it was supposed to be.

[01:43:52] So they had a plastic piece there to help it on its way.

[01:43:55] But then they moved the saucer, but they kept the plastic piece.

[01:43:59] Mm-hmm.

[01:44:00] And the hole is actually supposed to be in a different location.

[01:44:02] Well, once you print the play field.

[01:44:03] Yeah, more useless facts.

[01:44:05] So they moved, they moved the hole, but they kept the plastic piece.

[01:44:09] But I think they had a bulletin to ask people to remove it or do something with it.

[01:44:14] Because you would get rejects.

[01:44:15] And I have play Paragons that do that.

[01:44:17] Yeah, what you want to do is you're, is, is most of the games at, uh, on the IPDB are

[01:44:25] a lot less, um, they have a lot less photos.

[01:44:29] There are a lot of photos for this Paragon machine.

[01:44:33] And I think a lot of that has to do with, because it's such an artistic masterpiece, that,

[01:44:38] the pictures of the detail, the level of detail are, are so, so plentiful on IPDB.

[01:44:45] You know, pause the pod, take a look at it.

[01:44:46] It's, it's worth it.

[01:44:47] The funny thing about Paragon, the artistic masterpiece it is, it's two shots.

[01:44:52] Yeah.

[01:44:53] Maybe three that you'll ever shoot.

[01:44:55] You're going to shoot the inline targets.

[01:44:56] You're going to shoot a backup top on the right.

[01:44:58] Maybe the spinner.

[01:45:00] I guess we'll move on.

[01:45:01] Do you want anything else on that one?

[01:45:02] I think I paragoned it to death.

[01:45:04] Harlem Globe trotters onto our basketball theme, September 1979, standard body.

[01:45:11] So this one did not go wide body.

[01:45:13] 14,550 units.

[01:45:16] Greg Kemic, artwork Greg Ferris.

[01:45:18] Oh, Greg Ferris, my goodness.

[01:45:20] Who is, who is Greg Ferris?

[01:45:23] Greg Ferris is a pinball artist, of course, who had his first impressions of pinball from

[01:45:28] a pitch and bat machine while on vacation in Wisconsin because pinball was illegal in

[01:45:34] Illinois.

[01:45:36] Greg loved to entertain play drums, loved the three stuages, and of course, mad magazine.

[01:45:41] All of those influenced him in art style as well as Greg's mother, who was also an artist.

[01:45:48] He studied biology in college, just like Zach Manning, and eventually dropped biology

[01:45:53] after a bullseam an incident and moved to a major in fine art.

[01:45:58] His first job was point of purchase advertising, doing things like beer signs.

[01:46:04] This is where he met Kevin O'Connor.

[01:46:07] Kevin O'Connor left to go to Bali six months later.

[01:46:11] Kevin gives Greg a call and says they're hiring.

[01:46:14] Get your portfolio together.

[01:46:17] He interviewed with Paul Ferris.

[01:46:19] Paul gave him a small test unlike Kevin O'Connor, who he hired right on the spot.

[01:46:24] He wanted to run him through a test.

[01:46:28] And Greg would say, I had one week to come up with something that was like a pinball back

[01:46:33] glass.

[01:46:34] And if you go on YouTube and you type in Greg Ferris pinball, you can bring up some of his

[01:46:40] seminars from Chicago Expo, and he will show you the summertime back glass, which would

[01:46:48] eventually inspire skate ball, which would be Greg's first back glass.

[01:46:53] He basically lifted the van and the woman's chest from summertime for skate ball.

[01:46:59] So in 1978, he started working for Bali.

[01:47:02] And of course, he, like everybody else, had to learn the process.

[01:47:06] On Harlem Globetrotters, the name Hudson appears on the play

[01:47:10] field below the right flipper, or as Greg would say,

[01:47:13] I did the art Margaret Hudson may have cut some screens for me in the production effort,

[01:47:16] and I may have given her credit.

[01:47:18] There you go.

[01:47:19] So you've had a Harlem.

[01:47:20] I have a Harlem.

[01:47:21] Currently have a Harlem.

[01:47:22] I would say Greg Ferris is probably one of the, what's the term?

[01:47:25] Like he can do the most different types of art.

[01:47:28] He's the most flexible in style.

[01:47:29] Flexible.

[01:47:30] He's done stuff like fathom, but then he's done stuff like Dr. Dude to completely different

[01:47:34] styles and they're both been awesome.

[01:47:36] Think about Harlem Globetrotters.

[01:47:38] If you actually look at the back glass, it's very realistic.

[01:47:42] Like all the players actually have, like actually have hair on their shoulders and stuff.

[01:47:46] It's very, very detailed.

[01:47:48] The only real bummer with this is the most famous Globetrotter of all time was Metal

[01:47:52] Arc Lemon.

[01:47:53] And he had just left the Globetrotters, like right before this game was made.

[01:47:57] So he is not on it.

[01:47:58] He is not, everyone thinks he's the one in the center.

[01:48:00] He is not.

[01:48:02] The guy in the center was his replacement.

[01:48:04] Now is this game awesome because it has three spinners?

[01:48:07] That's one of the reasons and it has more shots than Paragon.

[01:48:10] Because it has, let's see, one, two, three, four shots you would actually actively shoot

[01:48:14] for as opposed to two.

[01:48:16] Yeah, it's got the scissor flipper on the left side.

[01:48:21] No traditional Italian bottom.

[01:48:23] It is not as brutal as Paragon, but it is somewhat brutal.

[01:48:26] Inline drop targets leading to a scoop.

[01:48:28] Yep, which also sometimes rejects.

[01:48:30] I've never played Harlem.

[01:48:32] There was one at Cabin Fever in Toronto when I was there one time.

[01:48:36] I played Congo instead of it.

[01:48:38] I feel like I should have split my time maybe.

[01:48:40] Yes, you should have played both.

[01:48:41] Yeah, you failed.

[01:48:42] Oh.

[01:48:43] So that's when we move on to another license theme.

[01:48:47] So you can see here, we've got rock stars, we've got movies, we've got series, we've

[01:48:52] got branding, we've got lifestyle brands.

[01:48:56] Basketball brands.

[01:48:58] Now we're moving on back again to music.

[01:49:01] November of 1979, we're talking about Dolly Parton.

[01:49:05] 7,350 units.

[01:49:07] George Christian was the designer and artwork by Dave Christensen.

[01:49:12] He's still there.

[01:49:13] He's still there, but you can see that he is slow.

[01:49:16] He is not doing a lot of machines.

[01:49:17] Like Kevin O'Connor just did like three machines in a row.

[01:49:21] Dolly Parton is an American singer songwriter, multi instrumentalist, recording producer,

[01:49:27] actress, author and business woman.

[01:49:30] I've left a link for Dolly Parton in the show notes.

[01:49:33] If you care, an early cabinet of this machine had her in a bouffant hairstyle while playing

[01:49:39] guitar, the rest of the production that was changed because Dolly wanted it changed.

[01:49:45] Paul Ferris would say, we did change the backlash artwork from a country theme to a more crossover

[01:49:49] mainstream.

[01:49:50] Since the play field was completed, she agreed to let it stay country in her denim outfit.

[01:49:55] Yes, so there was a lot of back and forth on the art direction of the machine between

[01:50:00] Bali, Dave Christensen, Dolly Parton's team.

[01:50:04] There was a lot of like, I'm not a big Dolly Parton fan.

[01:50:07] It's not my style of music, but at this time she was trying to broaden her reach.

[01:50:13] She wanted to move out of the country, wholesome thing and move into a more acting.

[01:50:18] She had a nine to five.

[01:50:20] She was in.

[01:50:21] It was a hit movie.

[01:50:22] So yeah, she's trying to go a little more mainstream.

[01:50:24] She wanted to spread that net.

[01:50:26] You can read, yeah, Christians is quote, if you want.

[01:50:28] Dave Christensen said Dolly Parton's team.

[01:50:30] She wanted to have her less country style.

[01:50:32] She wanted to look less Western and more cosmopolitan.

[01:50:35] She didn't want blue jeans so they went with her dress.

[01:50:38] The manager was tough to work with, but he made her rich so you can't say he was wrong.

[01:50:42] They steered her in the right direction.

[01:50:43] Yeah, so I mean, it was, you could tell that this one had a rougher developmental cycle

[01:50:49] than maybe more of the licenses.

[01:50:51] And I think this is where you can start to see the realization that not all licenses and

[01:50:58] licensures are easy to deal with.

[01:51:01] Right.

[01:51:02] They're not all hands on and easy going like the playboy folk.

[01:51:07] Sometimes they can be a little more difficult.

[01:51:09] And here's a prime example, but I think it probably turned out for the better.

[01:51:13] What do you think?

[01:51:14] The game's all right.

[01:51:15] It's all right.

[01:51:16] You've played Dolly.

[01:51:17] A lot of play lots of Dolly.

[01:51:19] It's another more in line drop target fun.

[01:51:22] And a spinner or a bit spinner.

[01:51:25] Yeah.

[01:51:26] I mean, it doesn't play any Dolly part in songs.

[01:51:28] I just put like islands in the stream and my headphones when I play it makes me play better.

[01:51:33] So we're going back to the wide bodies here.

[01:51:35] We're going to future spa.

[01:51:37] This one, much like Paragon gets a lot of really high reviews among folk.

[01:51:43] It's a future health club theme because why not?

[01:51:47] December 1979.

[01:51:49] It is 6,400 units.

[01:51:51] My goodness, that's not a lot of units.

[01:51:53] Which Christiansen doing the playfield, Dave Christiansen and Paul Ferris doing the

[01:51:58] artwork together.

[01:51:59] Two fellows that don't work well together have split a project.

[01:52:04] And why is that?

[01:52:05] Bali needed a second wide body.

[01:52:08] The first wide body, of course, was Paragon.

[01:52:11] They needed to then again stick in another one along the way.

[01:52:15] And this is what came about.

[01:52:18] Interesting fact, this is Bali's first machine with continuous background sound.

[01:52:22] Of course, flash at Williams being the first machine ever.

[01:52:26] And this machine was the first to patent in line drop targets filed in June 4th of 1979.

[01:52:33] But it was actually granted in 1981 to Bali engineers, Irwin J. Gaborl and Glenn R. Anderson.

[01:52:42] First to pass.

[01:52:43] So they did the in line drop targets and all those other games before they decided to patent

[01:52:47] it.

[01:52:48] That's what it sounds like on IPDB.

[01:52:50] So either that or IPDB is wrong.

[01:52:53] The interesting thing is it does have continuous background sound, but I've almost never played

[01:52:57] one that has that setting on.

[01:52:59] It's that good, is it?

[01:53:00] Well, I'm thinking when they did it, they might have had the...

[01:53:04] I'd be curious if anyone knows if they can email us at SilverBallCronicles at gmail.com.

[01:53:10] Like what were the default settings on these games?

[01:53:12] New and box.

[01:53:13] Like if you got a future spa brand new, took it out of the box, where were the dip switches

[01:53:18] on it?

[01:53:19] And it was just like, I think, the background sound on by default or off by default.

[01:53:23] Because it is a setting, but I've almost I've never played one with it on.

[01:53:27] Weird.

[01:53:28] It's like jacks to open.

[01:53:29] It was so good.

[01:53:31] Everybody turned it off.

[01:53:32] The art.

[01:53:34] So this is cool.

[01:53:38] In an interview, Paul Ferris, more or less talks about kind of what you want to do for

[01:53:42] themes at the time.

[01:53:43] He says that you take a look at pop culture and what's hot and what's current and what

[01:53:47] the public is doing, then you make a theme around that.

[01:53:50] Now that's double-edged sword because sometimes if you pick something that's too hot, maybe

[01:53:55] something like a roller disco, it might flame out really quickly.

[01:54:00] And the machine will be dated too fast.

[01:54:01] At the time in Chicago, there was a big health club craze.

[01:54:07] And it was a big deal to go to a health club and Chicago health clubs were the predominant

[01:54:12] brand on television in the Chicago area.

[01:54:15] So then it leads to the question, what would the spa of the future be like?

[01:54:21] And that's how you get future spa.

[01:54:24] And with the deadline approaching for the game release, Dave Christensen, as stated earlier,

[01:54:29] was blown the slow side working.

[01:54:31] He was not going to be able to finish the play field in time to work on the back glass

[01:54:35] because it was a wide body.

[01:54:36] It took so much longer.

[01:54:38] But Dave Christensen said, I made up a back glass and he didn't like it.

[01:54:41] And by he, I assume he means Paulic Hen.

[01:54:43] As the new art director, he had his own ideas.

[01:54:46] He was in a space exploration outer space asteroids like flash cord and stuff.

[01:54:50] We had a different view of the art.

[01:54:52] He still doesn't use Paul's name.

[01:54:54] Now he's he and the new art director.

[01:54:57] He wasn't a new art director.

[01:54:58] He'd been there for like four years.

[01:55:00] Right?

[01:55:01] He's just the art director now.

[01:55:03] Wow.

[01:55:04] So when Dave spoke to Topcast in his interview, again, in the show notes, you can tell when

[01:55:12] he starts talking about this era, he really changes in tone.

[01:55:18] And I guess it is what it is.

[01:55:24] Paul's brother, contrary to what people believe, the fellow in the back glass is not Ron

[01:55:30] Jeremy.

[01:55:31] It's Paul's brother.

[01:55:33] His sister is the woman and Paul's secretary is doing weights at the bottom.

[01:55:39] So again, they tie in people they know, which is kind of fun.

[01:55:43] My favorite part is the, it says something like only one repetition or no more than two

[01:55:49] repetitions or something like that on the machine, where the guys do and bicep curls.

[01:55:54] For whatever reason, I was found that hilarious.

[01:55:57] What yeah, and it's also like, you can tell that it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a mess.

[01:56:02] Different style.

[01:56:03] Because if you look at the play field itself, it's, it's very traditional Dave Christiansen,

[01:56:09] right, fairly line, already very beautiful women, not futuristic at all, right?

[01:56:15] It's just a spa.

[01:56:16] But then when you look at the back glass, they're wearing these weird like outfits and there's

[01:56:22] like space stuff in the background and there's like a guy in a weird machine working out.

[01:56:30] Like it's, it's, it's a very big clash of styles.

[01:56:33] You can see that there was probably a lot of conflict when it came to sort of the design

[01:56:40] of this machine and sort of the original guidance on IPDB.

[01:56:45] It has the original Dave Christiansen colored pencil draft and it is very, very, very different.

[01:56:55] And I could see why Paul Ferris was not a fan.

[01:56:58] But the guy still has a mustache in it.

[01:57:00] Yeah.

[01:57:01] Oh, were they ever?

[01:57:03] Yeah, it's no Paragon.

[01:57:05] That's got more shots than Paragon.

[01:57:07] Nitro ground shaker.

[01:57:09] So this is a car, car race, drag racing theme, January, 1980, standard body, 7,950 units,

[01:57:19] George Christian doing the design and Dave Christiansen doing the art.

[01:57:25] This is Dave Christiansen's only four color process pinball machine.

[01:57:31] And that's surprisingly Dave would say I like the old way.

[01:57:34] You have to paint the whole damn thing.

[01:57:37] The names on the cars.

[01:57:40] So if you look at the back glass, it's like this, this woman with like a, what's that

[01:57:46] kind of hair?

[01:57:47] Perm.

[01:57:48] A perm, yeah, perm and like a dude watching.

[01:57:51] And she's got the bell buckle.

[01:57:53] Yeah.

[01:57:54] The belt got to have the belt buckle and they're having like this crazy drag race.

[01:57:58] And there's like a skeleton up on top of one of the cars pointing at the guy.

[01:58:06] Dr. Doom written on the bumper.

[01:58:10] It's it's cool.

[01:58:12] This is probably when a Dave's best, I think now written on the cars are various names.

[01:58:19] If you look at the plastics, if you look at the back glass, all of those names are

[01:58:23] people from the Valley art department.

[01:58:26] So it's him paying homage to those fellows.

[01:58:30] The name and the driver of the car on the back glass as Christiansen would say is a better

[01:58:37] looking self portrait.

[01:58:39] Yeah, it's as mad dog Christiansen.

[01:58:42] People in the crowd are some of the people from Valley as well.

[01:58:46] What's interesting here is that it is four color process, but it's very much designed

[01:58:52] to be exactly the same as the old version, the old line item style.

[01:58:57] It's like a revolt.

[01:58:58] So this was actually Dave Christiansen's last machine.

[01:59:02] Paul Ferris says he had personal issues at the time.

[01:59:05] His house was robbed.

[01:59:06] He was mugged.

[01:59:08] His family had issues.

[01:59:09] He was a contancorous guy on a good day.

[01:59:12] They called him mad dog for a reason.

[01:59:14] His art was never an issue.

[01:59:15] Dave's personal life was in challenging times.

[01:59:18] All these young artists coming in, he didn't know Star Wars from Adam.

[01:59:22] He had a European look, a classic feel.

[01:59:25] Things were always changing.

[01:59:27] Yeah, Margaret Hudson would say that Dave was quite a character.

[01:59:31] He was pretty silent, very dedicated.

[01:59:35] He wasn't used to having all these people around.

[01:59:38] He wasn't used to having all the new young people coming aboard, introducing new processes

[01:59:43] and new ways of doing things.

[01:59:45] He had his way of doing things.

[01:59:47] Christiansen, Ron, he would leave Bally's pinball division and he would go back to doing

[01:59:53] slots, sort of as he alluded to earlier.

[01:59:57] He would go on years later to do independent freelancing for things like Harley-Davidson

[02:00:04] in the 1990s.

[02:00:06] He also did a very strange re-theme of a pinball machine for a buddy, which he called Big

[02:00:11] Dick.

[02:00:13] You can look that one up on IPDB, but don't have the kids around.

[02:00:18] What did you think of Christiansen leaving, Ron?

[02:00:21] It was going to happen sooner than later, especially when it came to call his boss by name.

[02:00:26] You could tell that there was some animosity building there and things were just ready

[02:00:30] for a change.

[02:00:31] The old guard is moving out.

[02:00:33] The new guard is moving in and we are moving into the 1980s and some of the most amazing

[02:00:40] and iconic pinball machines to come from Bally.

[02:00:45] Is that why that music is playing?

[02:00:47] Are you playing us out?

[02:00:48] Oh my goodness, the music is going to be...

[02:00:50] Well, no, we were going to do a whole episode here, Ron.

[02:00:53] Really?

[02:00:54] Oh my goodness, this is awkward.

[02:00:56] So we were seeing if this is going to be a two-parer?

[02:00:59] But we will make sure the next episode is much quicker and you won't have to wait as long.

[02:01:04] So keep an eye out on your pod catcher.

[02:01:07] So Dave, are we doing the outro then?

[02:01:09] I guess we're going to have to do this just like we always do with top notch production.
