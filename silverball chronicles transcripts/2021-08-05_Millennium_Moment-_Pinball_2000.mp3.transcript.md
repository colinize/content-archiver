[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:11] I can hear your fan too.

[00:15] You don't hear any fan here.

[00:17] I have the air conditioning off as it's 80 something degrees.

[00:20] I'm sacrificing myself to get the best possible sound.

[00:30] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:56] With me this month is my co-host Ron Waxed and Vaxed Hallet.

[01:04] You are ready for a hot boy summer, my friend.

[01:08] How has everything been with you?

[01:10] Hot and rainy.

[01:12] Everybody loves to learn about the weather in our locations.

[01:15] They just love it.

[01:16] They love hearing it.

[01:17] You can just do a podcast on that.

[01:19] Podcasts on weather.

[01:20] I'm sure that exists.

[01:21] Sure it is.

[01:23] Congratulations on five years of podcasting with that fellow Bruce Nightingale over there

[01:30] on SlamTill podcast.

[01:32] Why thank you.

[01:34] Five years is a big deal.

[01:40] Yes we can.

[01:41] It's very exciting.

[01:42] So exciting.

[01:43] Halloween and Ultraman was just announced by spooky pinball that you're a big Halloween

[01:48] fan.

[01:49] Yeah.

[01:50] I'm going to say my collection.

[01:51] I haven't seen it.

[01:52] So my wife and I sat down actually after I know all about it.

[01:55] You haven't seen Halloween.

[01:57] No I've heard all about it.

[01:58] I know all of the jokes and the memes and the such.

[02:03] And then we actually watched it.

[02:04] I'm like wow this is actually very, very good.

[02:06] And it's not like crazy and bloody and gory and whatever.

[02:09] It's just no that's the second one.

[02:30] As well as you can leave us a review at this week in pinball.com and the twip pinball promoters

[02:36] database.

[03:23] I do.

[03:24] I'm over at twitch.tv slash silver ball chronicles.

[03:27] Now I'm not as regular as you with the streaming.

[03:30] You've got the fancy portable rig and tens of thousands of dollars of pinball machines.

[03:35] I've got tron and the simpsons and I just sort of do it in my living room.

[03:40] Usually I will do it around the time that the podcast comes out.

[03:45] That way they can come in and chat about that month topic.

[03:49] So we're you know I'm really excited to do a lot of that stuff with people.

[03:53] We have some feedback this month.

[03:54] Yes we do.

[03:56] Scott E says long time listener first time emailer.

[04:00] Love the show in the way that two of you present the history of this great hobby.

[04:03] Thanks for the amazing content.

[04:06] Scott also had a lot of really really good titles for some episodes which we probably

[04:13] won't use but I did enjoy them.

[04:15] They were very good so thank you Scott E and Tom C also left us some feedback.

[04:21] Absolutely.

[04:22] Loved listening and learning the history of the game and the hobby I enjoy so much.

[04:26] The content is spot on and always super enjoyable.

[04:29] Please keep up the good work.

[04:31] Thank you so much Tom.

[04:32] So we love to read out your comments and stuff when you when you send them over to us guys.

[04:53] You can swing on over to silverballswag.com where you can check out hoodies and stickers

[04:58] and some other stuff over there.

[05:00] So please swing on over.

[05:02] Now this brings us to my favorite preamble of the episode here which is the corrections

[05:09] and comments.

[05:10] Ah when we're wrong yes.

[05:13] This was this was a big catch by Ben C. He says hi Dave and Ron during episode 15 Ron

[05:21] mentioned that space station may have been the first game with a secondary GI color

[05:28] string.

[05:29] He also misspelled color here.

[05:31] It's spelled right.

[05:32] Good job.

[05:33] No it's got to have you in the end.

[05:35] No there's no you in color.

[05:37] Carry on.

[05:38] He says got leab slash premier tag team had the feature a couple of years earlier where

[05:44] the red GI string was activated during multi ball.

[05:48] Bulbs were covered in a red plastic tube and on many of the games the red has just faded

[05:53] so it's barely noticeable.

[05:56] Thanks for another great episode.

[05:58] Why was this such a big catch Ron?

[06:01] Well I wasn't wrong.

[06:02] I said I said may have been the things.

[06:04] Yeah but see you're hedging.

[06:05] You're hedging.

[06:06] Yeah.

[06:07] Well I always preface it because it's when you say something's the first almost certainly

[06:12] like this is the first game to use this toy.

[06:14] There'll be some EM from the 30s that used it first.

[06:17] I mean almost always or they're like a foreign European game that used it.

[06:21] So I'll say they may have been the first game or as far as I know.

[06:26] Yeah good qualifier.

[06:28] Good good good.

[06:29] Yeah.

[06:30] So fans hitch in and you know hurt your ass in there.

[06:32] CYA CYA.

[06:34] Premier tag team was my first pinball machine.

[06:37] I actually don't mind tag team.

[06:39] This is a very it's it's very underrated.

[06:42] It's very good.

[06:43] I really enjoyed that game.

[06:44] Is it the one it's got the guy the rest of us with masks?

[06:47] Yes.

[06:48] Okay.

[06:49] Very good.

[06:50] Larry Day's ours.

[06:51] Super awesome.

[06:52] System ADB.

[06:53] Very great game.

[06:54] Now it does.

[06:55] It's got a it's got a it's got a relay and it will switch from one from the GI to the

[06:59] red GI during the multi ball as well as during the attract mode.

[07:03] And it did have those plastic tubes.

[07:05] Here's a tip pull them out flip them over and put them back down because there's part

[07:09] of the tube that's inside the play field and it has never seen the light of day.

[07:13] So it's still brand new on the other side.

[07:16] So you're saying you never corrected me even though you owned this game.

[07:19] Exactly.

[07:20] Very embarrassing.

[07:22] Super embarrassing.

[07:24] I guess we'll jump into today's topic so I can move on.

[07:26] Yeah.

[07:27] What are we talking about?

[07:28] Well, Ron was of course suffering in the late 1990s.

[07:34] Home video game consoles like the Nintendo 64 were dominating households in the decades

[07:41] that preceded the 90s.

[07:44] People ate at home and went out for entertainment.

[07:49] Society was changing where now they went out to eat and they consumed their entertainment

[07:54] at home.

[07:56] Coming out and having a good time with your friends in the arcade was no longer the

[08:02] thing.

[08:03] Ron, what was this time like?

[08:06] Was it sad?

[08:07] I wasn't in the pinball then.

[08:08] You weren't into the arcade scene in the 90s?

[08:12] Not in the late 90s.

[08:14] I was kind of out of it by then.

[08:16] I remember we had an arcade in my hometown in the Frederick tin mall which is now turned

[08:22] into just your standard everyday strip mall.

[08:25] It's no longer like an indoor mall.

[08:27] There was an arcade there and I went from time to time when I was in town.

[08:33] I remember going, man, this is kind of neat.

[08:36] But it was not that busy.

[08:39] Then I see photos now that I've been in the hobby forever of pictures in that early 90s

[08:44] or late 80s period or in the 70s and those places were packed.

[08:48] That was like the social gathering place for kids in high school.

[08:54] Part of that is sad when you think about in the late 90s, it was all dying.

[08:59] So Williams needed to jumpstart its sales.

[09:02] There's something needed to be done.

[09:03] The excitement needed to be pumped back in.

[09:06] Premier Gottlieb was already gone.

[09:09] Data East was kind of doing their own thing but now they were Sega.

[09:13] Capcom was gone.

[09:14] Pinball 2000 was the answer to that call.

[09:17] They needed something interesting.

[09:19] You know what?

[09:20] If you're sitting at home playing video games, first thing that you want to do is to

[09:23] come to an arcade and play kind of a video game, but kind of pinball.

[09:29] That's what we're going to talk about this month.

[09:31] Pinball 2000.

[09:33] So what was going on at Williams in the late mid to late 90s?

[09:38] Well, they were becoming a very successful slot machine company.

[09:41] Okay.

[09:42] So slot machines, very close cousin to pinball.

[09:46] It's a gambling type device.

[09:48] It's designed to rid you of your coins, isn't that correct?

[09:51] So I've got a great quote here from George Gomez.

[09:54] Now we've drawn a lot of this episode from George Gomez and a couple of others who were

[09:59] very much involved in the pinball 2000 adventure, if you'll call it that.

[10:05] And we've got some great quotes here.

[10:07] This one from George Gomez.

[10:08] The pinball company was kind of an albatross around the neck of the slot machine company.

[10:13] The slot machine company was the shiny new thing that showed enormous potential and was

[10:18] way sexier than the old junkie pinball company.

[10:22] There's probably a lot of truth to that.

[10:24] Yeah, by this point, they, I think they'd already renamed the company as WMS Industries.

[10:29] Yeah, they had gone away from sort of Bally Williams midway, right?

[10:34] That was sort of the gaming kind of thing.

[10:37] Now they were trying to be more fancy.

[10:39] Premier Gottlieb, they got into a lot of trouble with SMS, which was their sort of gambling,

[10:45] you know, machine, VLT system stuff.

[10:49] That's what really kind of drew the end in Premier Gottlieb.

[10:53] You can check that out in our Gottlieb system three episode and I think way back like episode

[10:57] three.

[10:58] But there was rumblings of a new platform, right?

[11:00] They needed to do something to sort of reinvigorate the pinball and the way it's done, you know,

[11:06] like a DMD, right?

[11:07] Like they needed to reinvigorate pinball.

[11:10] They had to, you know, they invented Alphanumerics.

[11:12] They invented DMDs.

[11:13] And now they, what was the next thing?

[11:16] You know, there was rumblings of a new platform.

[11:18] And while George Gomez was working on Monster Bash, his last sort of DMD at Williams, he

[11:24] heard that John Papaduke was working on a Williams pinball platform that was different

[11:32] than the DMD program.

[11:33] So who's John Papaduke?

[11:35] That's a loaded question.

[11:37] Who, who at the time?

[11:39] Who was John Papaduke at the time?

[11:41] Both the last say six years.

[11:44] He was a Canadian designer.

[11:47] You should feel like a kinship.

[11:48] He's like a fellow Canadian.

[11:49] He started at Williams.

[11:50] His first game was World Cup Soccer.

[11:53] That's a great game.

[11:54] And then he did a lot of, his games had very long, flowy plastic ramps and they did a

[12:01] very similar feel.

[12:03] Like, I would really describe him as like whimsical.

[12:05] His designs are whimsical.

[12:07] Yes.

[12:08] Very whimsical.

[12:09] Yeah, I'll go with that.

[12:11] What was the other one?

[12:11] Tails of the Arabian Knights, Circus Voltaire.

[12:14] Yeah, very artistic design games, right?

[12:17] There had lots of like amazing art and interesting, you know, ramps that would go in different

[12:23] directions and stuff.

[12:24] It was, he was all in about doing things very, very differently.

[12:29] And because of his, I guess, uniqueness.

[12:33] He's a younger designer as well.

[12:35] He's sort of an up and comeer.

[12:36] He was given the task to come up with the new thing like, hey, what, you know, John,

[12:43] you're a young guy, you're hip and with it.

[12:45] I used to be with it, but then they changed what it is.

[12:48] Now, it scares me, but I'm going to let you get with it and design the new platform because

[12:54] he's cool.

[12:55] So there was a lot of pressure.

[12:57] So George Gomez would sort of describe this time.

[13:01] He would say the pressure was really on.

[13:04] And I did not believe in John Papaduke to his credit.

[13:08] He did a lot to try to get me enthused about this new version of pinball, but it wasn't

[13:13] for me.

[13:14] So his experimental project, and this has been said, you know, quite a few times in a few

[13:19] places, was basically a big 27 inch monitor in the back glass.

[13:26] It's hard to believe, Ron, but LCD flat screen monitors have not been around for very

[13:32] long.

[13:33] Originally, they were big ass monitors, right?

[13:37] Well, originally you had big CRT monitors, then you had plasma screens, and you had LCDs.

[13:43] Exactly.

[13:44] They're like, these things are like, he just took the back glass and stuck a computer

[13:48] monitor in it, right?

[13:49] And it's a big friggin' thing.

[13:51] This brings up memories of a thing that I've seen a few times and never played, thank

[13:57] God.

[13:58] Maybe Pac-Man, or there was another similar game called Granny and the Gators.

[14:03] Don't forget Caveman.

[14:05] And Caveman, which I'm doing a system 80 episode, and Caveman is a system 80, so I got a little

[14:12] bit in there and further episode down the road.

[14:15] That is a flaming pile of garbage.

[14:17] Wow.

[14:18] Such a pinging aint it.

[14:19] Yep.

[14:20] Yep.

[14:21] Send that hate mail over to silverbolicronicalsagemail.com.

[14:24] But those games were epic flops.

[14:28] They did not, you know, they sold some units, but I think people bought them just because

[14:33] they didn't know what was going on, and maybe they had to quote or something.

[14:37] But they did not go over well, and especially amongst designers around this time that could

[14:43] remember those games, you know, having just the screen in the back glass and a pinball

[14:50] machine in front of it was concerning to a lot of them.

[14:54] So George Gomez said, in terms of how it was being used, you needed to play it on the

[14:58] monitor and you played on the play field.

[15:01] That's the thing that bothered me.

[15:03] I was around it midway when Valley was doing the baby Pac-Man stuff.

[15:06] I played all that stuff.

[15:07] I just didn't think much of it.

[15:09] Yeah.

[15:10] Scary stuff.

[15:11] Pat Lawler would say that pinball distributors have long memories.

[15:15] Oh, I'm sorry.

[15:16] Pinball distributors.

[15:17] Very good.

[15:18] Very good.

[15:19] If we took a video monitor and put it in a pinball machine, they would immediately say,

[15:25] baby Pac-Man, we knew we couldn't do that.

[15:30] You've got the sort of the new kind of up and comeer, the artistic guy.

[15:34] He's got this vision.

[15:35] We're putting a monitor in the back glass and we're going to, you know, graphics and screens.

[15:39] That'll be the new DMD.

[15:40] And to give a background, you'd already experimented some with Circus Valterre.

[15:45] You'd take in the DMD and they moved it down to the play field.

[15:49] So it was actually in the back of the play field.

[15:50] Yes, under the glass.

[15:52] Yeah, it was very, very different.

[15:55] And this whole Gomez Lawler pinball 2000, they knew that J-Pop's vision was going to be

[16:04] very, very expensive.

[16:05] You're going to have to buy these monitors.

[16:07] You're going to have to put them on there.

[16:09] You know, this just was not going to work.

[16:12] George would say in his top-cass interview that the cost was astronomical.

[16:16] I could not be convinced that his version was going to succeed.

[16:21] I thought to myself, this is going to cause a blow up for sure.

[16:25] There's all this turmoil at Williams and these sort of more senior, middle senior designers.

[16:32] They know things aren't good.

[16:34] The last thing they need is something that's going to explode because that is going to

[16:39] be the end of the company.

[16:41] I find that particularly interesting, right?

[16:43] It's like they want, they, things had to work out here, didn't they?

[16:46] The infamous management meeting.

[16:49] That's the title you have for the section.

[16:51] Yes.

[16:52] What was the infamous, what was the infamous management meeting?

[16:56] One day in 1998, Neil Nacastro called a staff meeting.

[17:00] Okay, so let's start out with who is, who is Neil Nacastro?

[17:04] He is the president of Williams.

[17:06] He's the boss.

[17:07] He's the big guy.

[17:08] He's the big boss.

[17:09] The head she's.

[17:10] He's the guy that's making all the decisions.

[17:13] He's the guy that's saying, hey, slots are the future.

[17:16] Pinball is great, but let's figure it out, right?

[17:18] So George Gomez, he states, Neil Nacastro, I used to call him the on motivational speaker

[17:23] because of his method of a motivation was basically very depressing.

[17:27] He said, boys, these days, these are the economics of business.

[17:31] You have to recognize you're spending too much money and you're not making enough money

[17:34] out there on the street.

[17:35] This company's a business and business needs to succeed.

[17:38] You know, he was like subtle, like the sharpened edge of a guillotine.

[17:42] Ooh, there's some symbolism.

[17:45] Very good, George Gomez.

[17:47] You're like a word master.

[17:50] So the meeting wasn't specifically about John Poppidook or J-Pop, they call him his

[17:57] project, but pinball in general.

[18:02] And the meeting just sort of came up that, hey, we need to save Williams pinball.

[18:08] So there's rumblings that J-Pop is working on this sort of platform.

[18:13] Leadership is basically saying, hey guys, you need to get your shit together because this

[18:16] is not going well.

[18:18] And this makes quite a few of the people in the meeting uncomfortable because they know

[18:23] that they don't really believe in the vision which J-Pop is doing.

[18:28] The writing was on the wall for Williams pinball.

[18:31] Pat Lawler was very concerned.

[18:33] And he said that the John Poppidook project may never actually come to fruition the way

[18:39] that they would use it to save the company.

[18:42] So the whole pinball 2000 project and the idea to go in a different direction was created

[18:49] shortly after this meeting between Pat Lawler and George Gomez as they sort of walked

[18:55] out of the room together.

[18:57] Pat was very concerned that J-Pop's project wasn't going to see the light of day.

[19:02] Soon it would be exposed he said to the Emperor's new clothes and that management would pull

[19:08] the plug on the pinball division.

[19:12] The problem was that there was dissension in the ranks at Williams.

[19:17] All the engineering team was not firmly in the J-Pop project camp.

[19:22] And Ron, if you are on a boat, you all got to be rowing in the same direction and your

[19:28] engineers and design teams need to buy in.

[19:31] And if you've got dissension amongst your teams and there's no buy-in, it's destined

[19:35] to fail right out of the gate, regardless of if it's a good idea or not.

[19:39] And the Castro noticed after the meeting and basically said to Pat Lawler and George

[19:46] Gomez and maybe a couple of others that they need to get with the program and they need

[19:51] to come up with a better idea or get the hell out.

[19:54] So what did they do?

[19:55] Well George Gomez said, okay, I'm going to show you a better idea.

[19:59] So Pat and George basically said that if they can make something that was successful and

[20:04] made a bunch of monies, Williams wouldn't be able to shut down pinball.

[20:08] They would have to stick with pinball.

[20:10] If you made a good product, if they made something unique and interesting and fancy, there's

[20:14] nothing that they could do that you could prove it to the leadership team.

[20:18] Here's a bunch of money we're going to put it on the table and if you don't want that

[20:21] money then that you're crazy.

[20:23] They needed to come up with something to sell pinball machines.

[20:26] So what did they need to do?

[20:28] What were the things that they had to do with pinball 2000?

[20:30] They got to get new people to play pinball.

[20:32] Yeah, the new people, they were all getting a console and hanging out at home.

[20:37] So they spoke about mirrors in the 1980s and how they could get animated targets on the

[20:42] play field.

[20:43] Pat Lawler would talk about that from time to time in a couple of his episodes.

[20:47] And so George was working on Monster Bash and Pat was working on his next game and they

[20:51] just couldn't devote all this time during working hours to build their new Williams platform.

[20:57] So Pat Lawler tells George Gomez we're never going to do this at Williams.

[21:02] The politics are going to prevent us from doing it here.

[21:04] I've got a full shot in my house and we should just go there and don't tell people what

[21:08] we're doing this.

[21:09] We can do it and then bring it in.

[21:11] That's the old Larry Demar strategy, right, with Reckonball.

[21:15] From our Pat Lawler episode.

[21:16] Yes, check that out if you want to.

[21:18] If you don't know what that reference is.

[21:20] George would drive to Pat's place every day for a month and a half and Patricia Pat's

[21:24] wife would make them dinner.

[21:26] They go into the shop and make stuff.

[21:28] George had a bunch of amigas and a 19 inch monitor.

[21:31] So they went to the store and bought some cartent.

[21:34] Cartent?

[21:35] What's cartent?

[21:36] Cartent.

[21:37] It's the stuff you put on your windows to make a Carla cooler.

[21:39] Ah, right.

[21:40] It's like the film 3M film or whatever.

[21:43] So what the hell's an amiga?

[21:44] So what?

[21:45] You would know what an amiga is.

[21:47] I don't know what an amiga is.

[21:49] It's a really old, I think it's like an old PC.

[21:56] Ah, okay.

[21:58] Yeah, amiga was a PC, we're introduced by Commodore.

[22:01] Yeah, I totally didn't have to look that up.

[22:06] So Pat had a bunch of old cabinets because one has a bunch of old cabinets just laying

[22:11] about.

[22:12] And he built a top box for the monitor and then they sort of had an idea.

[22:18] At Lollerwoods, a George came up with one of the ways to get it to work.

[22:22] It was marvelous.

[22:23] I love that quote.

[22:25] I had to put that in for some reason.

[22:27] So they basically used foam core and they began to experiment with some 35mm slides.

[22:33] And that was the ones that the film guys gave George when he was working on Johnny

[22:37] Numonic.

[22:38] And George took some comic books and made some back glass art.

[22:43] Oh, that reminds me of what's 35mm slides.

[22:47] I don't know, I know 35mm film.

[22:50] I thought you were old.

[22:51] I thought you were an old person.

[22:53] I was setting you up for an old person thing.

[22:56] Ah, okay.

[22:57] I think they still use 35mm film when they're not using digital.

[23:01] So the 35mm, I keep belief I know this and you don't.

[23:04] Okay.

[23:05] I should have gone with Bruce.

[23:07] Cloumie, Cloumie in.

[23:09] So anyway, it's basically 35mm film.

[23:11] But it's cut out in like little squares and it's putting like a little plastic thing.

[23:17] And it used to go in those old projector things that you would put down to show family

[23:21] pictures in, no I mean.

[23:23] I like your description of all these things.

[23:25] Very descriptive.

[23:26] You shine light through it and then it projects an image.

[23:29] And the image would usually, people would use them for their family vacations and stuff

[23:33] and they would get their photos put on to a 35mm film with a little plastic cover and

[23:39] the plastic cover goes in the machine.

[23:41] You click the little button and it shoots the light and then on your wall it's your parents

[23:45] in Hawaii or something.

[23:47] So George Gomez said, I made this little mock up and I took the slide and put it in the

[23:51] place of the monitor and I took a flashlight and shine it from above and sort of proved

[23:56] that if you mess with this angle you get this resultant angle on the image and that was

[24:01] the mock up.

[24:02] Marvelous.

[24:03] I love that word.

[24:04] I've used that word enough.

[24:05] And George Gomez would say that the artist Kevin O'Connor during the pinball 2000 project

[24:11] showed me a way way back that I essentially had some identical ideas pinball 2000.

[24:17] He brought it to me and said, you remember this?

[24:19] And I actually hadn't but if you just put things in your mind and store them away for later

[24:24] you never know when you're going to use them.

[24:26] 90s monitors were really really heavy and George would say that we struggled.

[24:31] We called it monitor weightlifting.

[24:33] We would pick this thing up and then you know we'd experiment with the angle of the monitor

[24:39] while one guy is holding it up and the other guy is making markings with pencil.

[24:43] They're really innovating here but the funny thing about pinball is that you would often

[24:50] innovate by just messing with things, right?

[24:53] Like picking things up and moving it, changing the angle and doing those things.

[24:57] It's very experimental and I think George Gomez probably got a lot of that from his time

[25:01] working at Marvin Glass but you would always cannibalize other things, right?

[25:05] You wouldn't like build your own monitor or you wouldn't build your own computer to do

[25:10] this.

[25:11] You would cannibalize something else for your proof of concept.

[25:14] So you remember those amigas we were just talking about, right?

[25:16] Yes I do.

[25:17] Well one died and they lost a bunch of their work so they had to spend some time recovering

[25:23] it and of course George hadn't done computer work for 10 plus years and if you're thinking

[25:28] about the difference between a 1998 computer and a 1988 computer things are totally different.

[25:36] So of course George had to relearn a bunch of stuff and he finally got one of those amigas

[25:41] back up and running with their information.

[25:43] Could you imagine the amount of stress that that would be?

[25:46] Yes I can.

[25:47] During the day they are working, doing games and building games and then at night they're

[25:54] lifting these heavy monitors and putting things together and trying to get the angle of

[25:58] these slides correct so it projects on the play field and it's like all that craziness

[26:04] and then this amiga craps the bed and all the work that you have and all the animations

[26:08] that you've been working on is a proof of concept or I'll just gone.

[26:11] So George Gomez says the pressure was mounting and it was a hell of a time for me because

[26:16] I was working on Monster Bash and Lyman Sheets just wouldn't hear of anything but 100%

[26:20] effort on the game so I had to give 100% to Monster Bash and then fit this in on top

[26:25] of it.

[26:26] It wasn't pretty for me.

[26:27] It was making me crazy.

[26:28] I relaxed on my drive out to the sticks.

[26:30] Oh yeah that's the one thing.

[26:32] I believe Pat Waller drives, he's like way out in the country somewhere.

[26:35] It's not like a short drive from Williams to Pat Waller's house I believe but George

[26:40] says I'd relax on my drive out to the sticks.

[26:42] The drive was my decompression time.

[26:45] George was working on Monster Bash which I think is a really super fun game and he had

[26:50] a scheduled around the time that the engineer was there and his name was Chris Shipman.

[26:55] Chris would have to come in and work around Lyman Sheets hours because they had to optimize

[27:01] Lyman Sheets time on the machine to do his coding.

[27:05] So if the machine was down get this because they were moving a mech or a switch or changing

[27:10] something physical on the play field Lyman basically couldn't do anything.

[27:15] George and Chris Shipman would get to Williams at around 5am in the morning and they would

[27:21] work on the play field until 10am and then Lyman would roll into the office and he would

[27:26] start doing his work with George until 6pm.

[27:31] Then George would drive to Pat Waller's shop which is in the God knows where and he

[27:36] would just listen to music and drive too fast and then he would work to 11 o'clock and

[27:41] then drive home.

[27:43] Oh my god that seems like hell.

[27:47] Doesn't it?

[27:48] Doesn't seem fun to me.

[27:49] Yeah so the funny thing here also is it seems like Lyman is a slave driver when it comes

[27:55] to his games eh?

[27:56] No comments.

[27:57] It's probably a good thing.

[27:58] I mean I'm not sliding the guy by any means I think it's probably a good thing that he's

[28:02] putting that much effort in but you can see man it seems like Lyman is a serious dude

[28:07] when it comes to his programming.

[28:08] So it was along until Larry DeMar figured out what George and Pat were doing.

[28:12] Things were really going to accelerate at Williams so they needed to get it ready to present.

[28:16] They were started pressing Pat and George and called them one day and said I don't know

[28:20] where you are but you need to get this thing in here now.

[28:23] Yeah so it's you know the pressure is mounting at Williams right?

[28:26] The writing is on the wall that you know sales are not good.

[28:30] Neil Neal Necasero has given some amazing you know unmotivational speeches.

[28:35] So using mirrors to project images is not really a new thing right?

[28:39] So this is called in some circles the Pepper's Ghost Illusion and it's been around for decades.

[28:46] So are you familiar with this term?

[28:48] I am not familiar with Pepper's Ghosts.

[28:50] Pepper's Ghosts so Pepper's Ghost and I'll include a link to the Wikipedia page here in

[28:55] the show notes.

[28:56] This is named after John Henry Pepper who began popularizing the effects in theaters in

[29:03] 1862.

[29:05] This launched a large scale Ghost Stories Theater craze.

[29:10] It's named after John Henry Pepper but he didn't actually invent the effect.

[29:14] Some say that it goes back all the way to somewhere around 16th century, around 1584.

[29:20] Now it's best known for its use at Disney World in the haunted mansion.

[29:28] Have you been to Disney World Ron?

[29:29] I have not.

[29:30] Of course you haven't.

[29:31] Hey I've been to Disney Land.

[29:34] I've been to Disney World.

[29:35] Yeah that's the one.

[29:36] Oh crap never mind yes I've been to Disney World.

[29:40] I haven't been to Disney Land.

[29:41] Yeah so have you been on haunted mansion when you sit on the chair and it goes through

[29:45] and you see the ghosts?

[29:46] No.

[29:47] That still exists when I went.

[29:48] Is that still around?

[29:49] Oh god.

[29:50] Anyway it's one of my favorite Disney World rides ever.

[29:53] There's a bunch of scenes in there where there's ghosts and what they do is they use the

[29:57] Pepper's Ghost effect.

[29:59] Oh were you on Tower of Terror at MGM Studios?

[30:03] Yes I was.

[30:04] Okay so you know you're on the car right?

[30:08] You're on the car and then you look out into the hallway and then all of a sudden the

[30:12] hallway fades away and the lights change and there's a floating eye.

[30:17] Anyway.

[30:18] That's a Pepper's Ghost effect.

[30:20] So back in the day of Marvin Glass they sold Bali a bunch of mirror technology when they

[30:27] used space invaders for their planet effects.

[30:30] Are you aware of that?

[30:32] Yes.

[30:33] Yes so that's a Pepper's Ghost style thing.

[30:37] This is kind of what I'm trying to do is where did this idea come from to do a projection

[30:43] on the play field and this is where we're getting to here.

[30:47] I think there's somebody out there who actually thinks that he came up with it.

[30:51] Yes Python Angelo we know about Python.

[30:55] So Python said pinball 2000 Capcom's flipper football was supposed to be like that.

[31:00] When Capcom folded the idea period at Williams you couldn't tell the difference between the

[31:04] physical ball and the animated ball.

[31:06] Larry Demar said it couldn't be done.

[31:08] He was a manipulator.

[31:10] Yes.

[31:11] And then there's then there was a bunch of trash talk.

[31:13] That sounds very Python.

[31:15] Apparently Python Angelo invented the idea for pinball 2000.

[31:19] Well basically what they figured out with their experimenting Ron is that you could have

[31:25] a pinball machine with a tinted piece of glass and a monitor above it.

[31:32] And you could put things on the screen that would then reflect on the glass.

[31:38] So you could shoot an animated character or an animated character could touch you or

[31:46] lights could flash that weren't actually physically on the play field.

[31:50] It's a kind of a neat concept.

[31:53] So we could all thank Python Angelo for inventing this and sending it over to Williams somehow.

[31:58] And flipper football is like 96.

[32:00] It was like two or three years before.

[32:05] God bless them.

[32:08] This is when they had to unveil pinball 2000 to the leadership team.

[32:13] So senior management and the executive team came into the presentation room and they had

[32:17] a big red cover on the pinball machine.

[32:19] Yeah, very fancy.

[32:20] Yeah, well, I mean George and Pat as you can remember from our George Gomez Pat Lawler

[32:27] episode had seen Dave nutting from Dave nutting and associates do his presentations at midway

[32:33] back in the day.

[32:34] It was all flash.

[32:35] It was all presentation.

[32:36] It was fancy.

[32:38] It was all all sizzle and George knew that he needed to do that.

[32:44] We learned presentations from some of the masters like Dave nutting playing the theme from 2001

[32:49] bringing you into a dark room and sitting you down on a thousand dollar recaro seat out

[32:53] of his Ferrari and telling you a story before you begin to play the game.

[32:57] Pat and I both learn from Dave.

[32:59] We did a big presentation.

[33:00] You know, big, really big.

[33:03] Larry DeMar, Neil Nakastro, Ken Fidesna and a few others were in this small group and

[33:09] I'll tell you they went all in on this presentation.

[33:13] George Gomez would say that he saw a sparkle in people's eyes.

[33:17] He finally saw Nakastro get excited about something.

[33:20] People started picking up the phone and calling people people started trickling into the room

[33:26] and it by the end of the day Pat and George had repeated that presentation 50 times.

[33:32] George Gomez would say it was something.

[33:35] This brings in another fellow who I've bumped into in one of these top cast episodes that

[33:40] I've been listening to and that's Adam Ryan and who was Adam Ryan?

[33:43] He was a dot matrix guy.

[33:44] Yeah.

[33:45] So he did a lot of the dots sort of in that late 90s Williams era and he would say someone

[33:51] came into my office at Adam.

[33:53] You have got to come over here.

[33:55] So we went over to the midway building.

[33:58] That's where they had hidden their first prototype.

[34:01] I walked into the room and they said Adam take a look at this.

[34:05] What do you think?

[34:06] And I was nuked by it.

[34:08] That's an interesting thing when I got the quote here.

[34:10] I couldn't believe I was seeing that it actually worked.

[34:14] You could put a hologram on a play field and interact with it.

[34:19] There you go.

[34:20] Mines have been blown, right?

[34:22] I noticed like in Williams everyone seemed to have their own office.

[34:25] How awesome is that?

[34:26] That was like the days before cubes or something.

[34:29] Yeah.

[34:30] We didn't have a cubicle.

[34:31] Yeah.

[34:32] We're all part of the cubicle firms, the millennial cubicle firms.

[34:34] So what did John Papa do think about all this?

[34:36] Ooh, there's the thing.

[34:38] Okay.

[34:39] So Jay Pop has been working on this sort of project.

[34:42] He's kind of doing his own thing and he's doing it on company time and then at a nowhere

[34:47] Gomez and Pat Lawler show up with it with it with it's totally off the wall hair brain

[34:52] totally different thing.

[34:53] Boy, that's got to feel bad.

[34:55] Well back to Adam Ryan.

[34:57] Adam says we all want to lunch and it was very depressing lunch actually because John

[35:02] had put his heart and soul into the project.

[35:04] He went around the table asking us, who do you think of this new thing that George and Pat

[35:07] brought in?

[35:08] We all very reluctantly admitted that this hologram thing is just so cool.

[35:12] We had to go with this version.

[35:14] John's product was magnificent as well.

[35:15] That's, you know, that's got to hurt man.

[35:18] That's got to hurt.

[35:19] Now George Gomez, of course, how, you know, what did he say?

[35:22] You know, he's the guy that sort of just just just peed in John's cornflakes here.

[35:26] And he would say, I felt bad for John because I kind of pulled the rug out from underneath

[35:31] him, but I had to do what I believe in and pinball 2000 is what I believed in.

[35:37] I know he was disappointed.

[35:38] He worked really hard on what he was doing.

[35:41] He really poured himself into it.

[35:44] His idea didn't get picked.

[35:46] There was a little bit of bad blood there for a little bit.

[35:50] John's a professional and I think that he handled it very well.

[35:53] I don't think he was really pleased with it.

[35:55] The guy came up to me shortly after that and said, you're right.

[36:00] This is way cooler.

[36:01] We've got to change the future of pinball.

[36:04] So that's, you know, that's got to hurt.

[36:07] That's tough.

[36:08] That's pretty bad.

[36:09] Now the executives, of course, they're picking up the phone.

[36:12] They're calling the marketing team.

[36:13] You know, the project starts rolling and the division was split into two.

[36:19] So they had some of the individuals working on the last DMD games off the line and then

[36:25] they still and then they had the other group that was working on pinball 2000.

[36:30] Now of course, we'll get into some of those other old, the, the, the DMD games, the last

[36:34] DMD games to come out, but they started working on a super secret project.

[36:40] So they had to, they had to quarantine them.

[36:42] Isn't that right?

[36:43] That is right.

[36:44] The security and secrecy of this project was the thing of legend.

[36:47] None of the other designers were allowed in the room.

[36:49] Lairdomar was working on slots at the moment.

[36:51] Lairdom, of course, designed system 11 and WPC, but they convinced them to work on the

[36:55] new system.

[36:56] Lairdom ended up working 80 to 100 hours a week on slots and pinball 2000.

[37:01] Holy moly.

[37:03] So this is where we bump into somebody named Keith Johnson.

[37:06] Now he had joined Williams a couple of years prior to this and he was roped into working

[37:14] on the pinball 2000 project.

[37:16] Keith Johnson would say, I was in a subsection of engineering.

[37:21] He was a large secret.

[37:22] Only a dozen people were allowed in the room.

[37:25] In fact, Neil Nacastro, the CEO, wasn't even allowed in the room.

[37:30] He was quite frustrated one day that he wasn't allowed in.

[37:33] Like they've seen the prototype.

[37:34] They kind of know what's going on, right?

[37:37] But when it actually comes to developing what will be manufactured and sent out into the

[37:43] world, that's kind of now it's a super secret project because they don't want other companies

[37:48] to figure out what they're doing, right?

[37:49] They don't want Sega to learn that they're doing the super secret project.

[37:54] So they're keeping it locked down pretty tight.

[37:56] So then they needed to staff up.

[37:58] Actually, before you get into that, Sega somehow figured it out anyway.

[38:02] Really?

[38:03] One of their games, I don't know if it's South Park, it was one of them.

[38:06] They did something on the DMD so you could only read it like on the glass of the game.

[38:12] The way it reflects off the top glass, something like we know or something like that.

[38:18] So Eki, if you know any details about that, send that into Silver Ball Chronicles or Gmail.

[38:22] Well, that detail is in the tilt, the movie tilt, the battle to save pinball.

[38:27] Oh, very good.

[38:28] I have not seen tilt and I feel like I probably should have before I did this.

[38:32] You probably should have seen that, yeah.

[38:35] I'm just going to make it up as I go along.

[38:38] So they needed to staff up.

[38:40] So they brought in somebody named Graham West and he did a lot of the graphics for the

[38:43] system, a lot of effects and lamp effects and things like that.

[38:48] They brought in Cameron Silver who did game logic and a number of things around that.

[38:54] And Duncan Brown who did a lot of the drivers and PCI stuff.

[38:58] What the hell is PCI stuff?

[39:00] The interface I would assume, like a PCI card which 1990, yeah, I guess it probably

[39:06] still would have been that.

[39:07] Yeah.

[39:08] Unified team and one unified goal and George Gomez would say what pinball 2000 did is

[39:16] it unified what George Gomez says is that pinball 2000 unified the engineering department.

[39:23] So instead of seven, 10 man brain trusts, you now had a 70 man brain trust because everybody

[39:31] was thinking in the same direction.

[39:33] So they decided how did they want to run this platform?

[39:36] What did they need to generate sort of the, you know, before they just had a CPU and

[39:41] a driver board and whatever.

[39:42] But now they got a monitor and everything, right?

[39:44] Like they got to do something different here.

[39:45] They decided to save time and cost to just use a off the off the shelf PC, PC motherboard

[39:53] picked it up and he's went down to radio shack and picked up a PC.

[39:56] Yeah, I basically it's just a PC motherboard.

[39:59] If I remember just for memory, it's a PC motherboard.

[40:01] There is a driver board and there is a the prism, the prism card.

[40:07] Sounds fancy.

[40:08] Yeah.

[40:09] Yeah.

[40:10] So of course, at this time, it's really hard, I think for young people to understand how

[40:17] rapidly computer technology was advancing in the late 90s and early 2000s.

[40:23] You know, now every year you get a new iPhone or a new Pixel phone or whatever and you

[40:28] know, you buy a laptop every couple of years and things are getting better and changing.

[40:33] But the pace, it doesn't seem quite as stark and fast as it was in the late 90s.

[40:40] One of the concerns among the engineering team was that because the hardware was evolving

[40:45] so fast, if Williams decided to, you know, do all the R&D in-house, they would have to

[40:51] absorb all of the cost in doing that.

[40:55] And if they just outsourced it to technology companies like Intel and Microsoft and all

[41:00] that other stuff, they could do the arms race and Williams could just sort of keep just

[41:05] updating the technology.

[41:07] Tom Uban, hopefully I'm saying that right, operating a software co-designer on pinball

[41:11] 2000, he says, the whole idea was the new system had to be low cost.

[41:15] And you knew what was going to have a CRT in it?

[41:18] We needed more horsepower to drive it.

[41:20] Whatever the current cheapest motherboard was at the time that fit our bill and had enough

[41:24] power.

[41:25] The whole motherboard thing costs 100 bucks this month.

[41:27] It'll be some number of gigahertz in the next month.

[41:29] It'll be slightly faster, but there'll still be 100 bucks.

[41:32] We knew it would always cost the same.

[41:34] It would get faster and it'd be pretty much compatible.

[41:37] We just had to write the software so it would drop on to each one.

[41:39] Yeah, it's actually a pretty smart strategy and I also find it funny though now that pinball

[41:44] companies are still more or less designing their own boards and stuff.

[41:51] Well, it depends.

[41:54] They're designing their own boards to a point, but I mean a lot of Jersey Jack, they're just

[41:58] using, it's just like a motherboard with running Linux.

[42:02] So they're doing the same thing.

[42:04] A lot of the companies that are doing the same thing that Williams did, things like updating

[42:09] your game via like a thumb drive, the functionality like that, pinball 2000 did that like 15, 20 years

[42:17] before, stern did it.

[42:18] I just find it interesting though that they're not just buying, I know this is simplistic

[42:23] or whatever, but just buying a Raspberry Pi or a motherboard from somebody and just thrown

[42:28] it in, right?

[42:29] They've gone and redesigned Spike, they've gone and Spooky's now made their own stuff with

[42:34] Ben Heck.

[42:35] You know, you got P3 Rock with multi-morphic.

[42:37] They kind of, it's interesting that they just didn't go into this PC.

[42:42] From a PC world.

[42:43] It depends what it's for.

[42:45] I mean, Pinball 2000 still had a driver board that Williams made to actually fire all the

[42:50] coils and all that.

[42:51] Okay.

[42:52] The brains was a off the shelf motherboard, but they still had to have some custom boards.

[42:58] One of the, I guess, let's go beyond boards.

[43:00] Let's go beyond the board set now.

[43:02] Now they have to go from dots to doing actual 3D animation.

[43:06] Dot matrix is pretty simple for the most part, right?

[43:09] You've got, you know, you've got squares, you got to fill in the squares with various levels

[43:14] of brightness and shading, and then that creates images.

[43:18] Now it's not so easy to do that, but it's an easy concept.

[43:23] 3D animation, you know, we're getting into like Photoshop and all that other crazy stuff,

[43:27] right?

[43:28] Guys like Adam Rine had to sort of pivot and adjust.

[43:30] Yeah, Adam says, I was the animation coordinator for the whole department.

[43:33] As soon as the department was announced and approved and we got the go ahead, I was asked

[43:37] if I could lead the team and do all the 3D video graphics.

[43:40] And I accepted it.

[43:41] I accepted it at a time when I had no idea how to do 3D design.

[43:45] Talk about an extreme learning curve.

[43:47] The dot learning curve was nothing compared to this.

[43:50] Yeah.

[43:51] So Adam Rine, fake it till you make it.

[43:53] That's basically what he said right there.

[43:55] Yeah.

[43:56] So of course you've got to develop the animation platform from the ground up, right?

[44:02] They are literally designing from the first thing.

[44:04] So they started using something that was called 3D studio max.

[44:07] I don't know what that is.

[44:09] But learning this whole new sort of out of the box materials, that's what they started

[44:16] with and that ended up in many long nights of trying to train yourself and a lot of the

[44:20] animation team, more or less wondered if it was really worth it to do all of this work

[44:25] and learning.

[44:26] So then they decided to pick up a few new folks to help them out.

[44:29] And this included somebody called Jack Layden who was a dot guy from Daddy East from

[44:34] away back and he was currently working at Williams Gaming on the slot side and he had

[44:39] some animation experience.

[44:41] There was also somebody named David Miller and Scott Sanders who were both fresh out of

[44:46] school and they had been trained on 3D animation.

[44:51] So we're seeing a changing of the guard or a bringing in of a new group of animators

[44:55] which is probably going to really help that.

[44:57] And those new guys suggested using something called Light Wave which was easier to learn.

[45:02] Yeah, Adam called that a godsend basically.

[45:04] I don't know what that is.

[45:06] I'm sure it's great.

[45:08] You probably don't even use it anymore.

[45:10] But the fact that they brought in, they're like, hey, why aren't you guys just using this

[45:13] new technology instead of this old one and they did.

[45:16] Now actually interestingly enough, somebody else who pops up in here is Greg Ferrez who

[45:21] did some of the storyboards for the first pinball machine, some of the key moments and animations

[45:26] and stuff like that for the first pinball 2000 machine.

[45:30] Yes.

[45:31] First pinball machine ever.

[45:32] Yeah.

[45:33] Thank you.

[45:34] Thank you, Ron.

[45:35] Thank you for clearing that up.

[45:36] No problem.

[45:37] Tom Uban says we started working on the pinball 2000 platform.

[45:40] We got a system out the door and effectively in 18 months a year and a half which is pretty

[45:45] out of control.

[45:46] Really, I mean, think about how long that is.

[45:48] That's pretty nuts.

[45:50] If you told me that they developed the entire pinball 2000 platform in 18 months, that

[45:56] is some serious time crunch and everybody on those teams should be commended because

[46:02] what they did in such a short amount of time is shockingly impressive.

[46:07] So I guess we should get into what happened here, right?

[46:10] So yeah, what did they make?

[46:11] So their first super secret top secret game was Revenge from Mars.

[46:17] Which wouldn't even be the most secret game.

[46:19] That would be the next one.

[46:20] So Revenge from Mars was manufactured in January of 1999.

[46:25] It sold 6,878 units.

[46:29] It is a alien Martian fantasy theme.

[46:32] It was designed by George Gomez and it had art by Greg Ferrer as a John Yosey.

[46:37] It had dots and animation by that team I had mentioned Adam Rine, Scott Shlominy.

[46:43] Slominy.

[46:44] Slominy.

[46:45] Slominy.

[46:46] Slash, sliminy.

[46:47] There's no age.

[46:48] How many?

[46:49] I see no age there.

[46:52] Scott Slominy, Jack Linden, Scott Sanders and Dave Muller or Mueller, mechanics by Chris

[47:00] Shipman, music, sound by Dan Forden, and software by Lyman Sheets Jr.

[47:05] Dwight Sullivan, Keith P. Johnson and Graham West.

[47:10] That is an all star lineup of designers and programmers, is it not?

[47:16] And that is a lot of units.

[47:17] The most of any game they sold in quite some time.

[47:21] That is seriously impressive.

[47:25] So Pat Lawler would say it was awesome.

[47:28] It was a testament to a group of people trying to make something groundbreaking and they succeeded.

[47:35] To build an all new technology and game in 12 months.

[47:40] So let's describe what we're seeing here.

[47:44] So we've got a regular sort of more or less looking sort of pinball cabinet on the bottom

[47:52] that has like a like a replaceable graphic on the side that you can move and take off

[47:59] and replace.

[48:00] And then we've got this really tall, chubby back box that's triple the size of a regular

[48:07] back box.

[48:08] You say it's triple the size?

[48:10] It's pretty big, eh?

[48:11] It's big.

[48:12] When they would when they would ship the game, they would come in two boxes.

[48:16] The the back glass is more or less a standard looking back glass as you normally would see

[48:22] it with hand with amazing hand drawn art.

[48:25] I think from the revenge from Mars, ours is on point with with attack from Mars.

[48:32] Super cool.

[48:33] It's it's got this.

[48:35] So the monitor is not facing the player, Ron.

[48:38] It's pointing down and it's behind the back glass and it's pointing down onto the glass.

[48:43] So then it reflects on this very special tinted illuminated glass.

[48:49] The other thing with this platform was that you would be able to replace the glass, the

[48:53] play field and the side art.

[48:55] And it would be more or less modular sort of like a multi morphic system is today.

[49:01] And actually after the second game, they were going to change that.

[49:04] So it's just going to be generic pinball 2000 art.

[49:07] Yeah.

[49:08] So then they would even have to do it just to make it even cheaper, which you know, I

[49:11] guess not necessarily a bad thing.

[49:14] What was the catchphrase for pinball 2000, Ron?

[49:17] Pinball 2000, the new image in pinball.

[49:21] Woo.

[49:22] Very good.

[49:23] And of course revenge from Mars, the invasion has begun.

[49:27] Yes it has.

[49:28] It's it it's pretty cool.

[49:31] Now it the the flyer on this pretty neat because they couldn't just show you the play field

[49:37] right?

[49:38] They had to also show you the animation, but they couldn't just show you one animation

[49:41] because you don't really get they got to show you how it's changing on the play field,

[49:45] right?

[49:46] There's the aliens at the bar.

[49:47] There's the aliens in front of the Eiffel Tower.

[49:49] There's you know a ship kind of flying around.

[49:53] It's got some really cool sort of text about pinball 2000 itself.

[49:58] Do you see anything in here that you think is?

[50:00] Oh, to make fun of.

[50:01] No.

[50:02] Here we go.

[50:04] The most engaging, interactive, and entertaining pinball machine of all time.

[50:10] Woo.

[50:11] Of all time.

[50:12] We're going right out with the first one.

[50:14] They're right at the tip of the thing here.

[50:17] The innovation of CPU controlled gameplay makes for a deeper, more realistic storyline.

[50:24] Wow.

[50:25] I'm not going to disagree with that one.

[50:28] Now the flyer is also like seven pages long.

[50:31] Pinball will never be the same.

[50:33] They went all in on this strategy.

[50:36] And of course a lot of that is the need to reinvigorate pinball to really make something

[50:43] new and different and exciting.

[50:45] I think they did something pretty, pretty slick here with this machine.

[50:50] Now of course we're an audio medium.

[50:52] It's very difficult to describe what revenge from Mars really looks like.

[50:57] And it's even harder to describe it unless you actually play it.

[51:01] Because of course it is a bit of an experience because it's different than most pinball because

[51:06] of this animation.

[51:08] But let me tell you some of the cool features of this new game that we've put in just for

[51:12] the operator.

[51:13] Oh, please.

[51:14] Features such as like on this one the circuit board is actually in the body because obviously

[51:20] you can't fit it in the head with that big monitor in there.

[51:22] Yeah, it's like a JJP kind of thing right where they got it in the bottom and people

[51:26] are like, oh, that's a stupid plate to put in.

[51:27] We have LEDs for the fuses so you can see if they're blown.

[51:31] We have on screen diagnostics years before any LCD game will come out where you could see

[51:39] a picture of the play field and you can see where the switches are as you're actuating

[51:43] them.

[51:44] Yeah, my favorite one is how that now we still have LCD screens at Stern and it still

[51:49] looks like a friggin DMD in the menu.

[51:52] That is true.

[51:53] And we also had the play field, of course, is completely removable with just three or

[51:58] four connectors and it has side rails that go all the way up and down.

[52:02] You can just slide the entire play field out of the game.

[52:06] Plus we have other exciting features such as two keys.

[52:11] You can have an operator key and a location key.

[52:14] So if you have the location key, it allows you to take the glass off and you know, fix

[52:21] stuck balls and stuff, but you can't lift up the play field.

[52:24] And then the operator key lets you actually get into the coin box, you know, the coin door,

[52:28] which was a cool little feature.

[52:30] You put a lot of stuff in there for the operators in mind.

[52:33] One of the biggest things and we talked about this in our got-leab episodes previous

[52:37] was that they always bang the drum of being like really reliable and simple and not

[52:42] having like a lot of complicated stuff.

[52:45] Hey, pinheads, I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not making cheesy jokes to

[52:50] make Ron laugh, I'm David, the financial advice guy.

[52:54] At Dennis Financial, our advisors strive to provide a return on life for our clients,

[52:59] not just a return on investment.

[53:01] The value of advice is something that we take seriously.

[53:04] A valuable financial advisor doesn't just provide investment and insurance advice.

[53:09] That's because an advisor takes the time to gather intimate knowledge about their primary

[53:13] client, understand their personal preferences, recognize their fears and hopes and gain

[53:18] knowledge about their client's errors before providing financial advice.

[53:23] If you're looking for a more human dimension to your financial advice, Dennis Financial

[53:27] Inc has you covered with advisors licensed most Canadian provinces.

[53:31] We're also doing secure online meetings to engage with clients who need advice, but don't

[53:36] necessarily want to wear pants or leave their house.

[53:46] of advice ebook or check out DennisFinancial.ca.

[53:50] Insurance solutions provided by Dennis Financial Inc. Canadian residents only.

[53:55] They knew I would say right into the gate as soon as you brought something that looked

[53:58] like this, operators would be like, oh my god, this thing is going to be impossible to

[54:01] fix.

[54:02] The more you talk about the ease of service and saving you time and saving you money and

[54:08] the advanced technology is actually easier and more efficient than the old technology.

[54:13] That's a good thing.

[54:14] You can have an extra play field in the shop.

[54:17] Just in case.

[54:18] You could update the code first time.

[54:21] You could just update the code with a laptop with a, I think it was a parallel port or

[54:25] a serial port.

[54:26] One of the other thing connected to it to update the code.

[54:29] Isn't that awesome?

[54:31] No, I'm sure operators back then probably didn't update the code either.

[54:35] Just like they don't know, but this was a big deal.

[54:39] I mean, they went all out to try to make it serviceable, to try to get the operators

[54:44] in.

[54:45] They made a whole video to show all the cool features of the new platform.

[54:51] The only thing about it is it does take longer to set up.

[54:55] Because if you got one of these, if you got one of these new, you got two boxes and you

[54:59] had to take everything out.

[55:01] You had to get like a second person to get the top on because it's heavy.

[55:06] It's some monitor.

[55:08] It's a CRT monitor.

[55:10] So you got to get the thing on top and get the bolts through it to get it in place.

[55:13] Now I had also heard that once you had sort of headed, it was out of the box and you set

[55:19] it up.

[55:20] It was really difficult to like move around.

[55:23] You couldn't just sort of fold it and put it on a dolly and single person it out of

[55:27] a bar and do another bar.

[55:28] It's heavy.

[55:29] So you're putting, you know, now you've made it.

[55:33] So the operator is going to need two people to move their machine around instead of just

[55:38] one.

[55:39] So now you've increased their cost.

[55:41] But I guess the other side of that coin is, well, you just leave the machine there and

[55:44] you just swap the play field in the art.

[55:46] One person can do that.

[55:48] But I don't know if people really took advantage of that.

[55:52] The key to all of this was the illusion, this pepper's ghost illusion.

[55:58] You had to avoid the edges of the monitor.

[56:02] So it was the first piece of software that they did and it was a lot of trial and error

[56:07] because this is the first, you know, revenge from Mars machine was the first machine that

[56:11] they had.

[56:12] And most of the stuff ended up kind of in the middle of the play field.

[56:16] So they had to kind of work around that.

[56:19] Of course they needed more time for experimentation of what they could do with this effect.

[56:25] And George figured some of the other designers like Pat Lawler who had a game in the works

[56:30] and John Papa Duke and others would spend that time that they had developed in development

[56:35] on their projects to experiment more with this effect.

[56:40] Lime and Sheets of course would ask Larry Demar if he could move Keith Johnson into the

[56:44] revenge from Mars project and they needed more programmers to get it done on the tight

[56:49] timeline.

[56:50] So there wasn't really much time for experimentation.

[56:54] This was also the last machine under the ballet name.

[56:58] So have you seen the midways symposium 1999 YouTube video where they had the launch of

[57:07] pinball 2000?

[57:08] I don't know if I saw the video.

[57:10] No, actually I don't think I've seen it.

[57:12] It was George and Larry Demar giving a speech.

[57:14] I did not see that.

[57:15] I will, I will throw that in the show notes Ron and I know that you check all of my links

[57:20] and you make sure I put everything in my show notes and you will enjoy this.

[57:24] So you can see the excitement on George Gomez's face and Pat Lawler's face when they're

[57:29] talking about this new platform and the potential of the excitement that they have because

[57:35] they have taken this thing from an amiga in a garage to actually a fun game and they sold

[57:42] 6,878 units in 1999.

[57:46] Which was the most games they had sold since World Cup soccer in 1994, which sold 8,734

[57:56] units.

[57:57] 1994 was the last time they sold anything remotely close to 6,000 and the next game that

[58:02] would ever sell as many units as revenge from Mars is 2003's Lord of the Rings with

[58:10] about probably 5,000 units.

[58:12] Probably you have confirmation on this?

[58:13] I don't know.

[58:14] I think that was in somebody's podcast where like I think it was like 5,000.

[58:18] You see the Lord of the Rings could have been one of the six or seven runs of Simpson's

[58:22] pinball party or one of the five runs or so of ACDC.

[58:27] The last 10,000 units seller I think was Star Trek right?

[58:30] That is correct.

[58:31] Next Jan.

[58:32] So we popped a number here right?

[58:35] Something was exciting about this and people were excited and they bought in because it's

[58:39] got the modular cabinet.

[58:41] You can swap out the things out.

[58:43] It's this cool effect and you have played revenge from Mars.

[58:48] Yes I have.

[58:49] I would say it was probably more of the cool effect than the modular that made it sell that

[58:53] many.

[58:54] I figured they would probably buy into the first unit because then they know they could

[58:58] just swap things out.

[58:59] So it's less risk.

[59:01] What did you think of revenge from Mars?

[59:03] I liked it better than the second one which we'll get into.

[59:07] But it's fun.

[59:08] It's fun game.

[59:09] I mean most of it is hitting the middle.

[59:12] A lot of hitting the middle.

[59:13] Was is attack from Mars sort of hit the middle as well?

[59:17] Not.

[59:18] I mean the ship is in the middle.

[59:21] I'm not a very good player.

[59:22] I just I end up shooting for that.

[59:23] It's probably something I shouldn't do right?

[59:25] It depends.

[59:26] But as far as revenge from Mars according to George Gomez when he originally came up with

[59:32] the first whitewood for it.

[59:34] He said it was one of the flowiest fastest games he had ever designed.

[59:39] But when they actually integrated it like made it into the pinball 2000 platform and they

[59:45] made the center.

[59:46] So it has like a brand thing that comes up.

[59:47] So the ball goes in airborne over so they can show all the animations.

[59:52] It slowed it down a lot.

[59:53] So it never it never float as much as it did before the screen was had it.

[59:58] Okay.

[01:00:00] And if and think about pinball 2000 when you look at it.

[01:00:03] You assume the play field is smaller just because of the way it looks the cabinet.

[01:00:07] It is it is very weird that way.

[01:00:09] Yeah.

[01:00:10] It's a bit of an optical illusion where it seems really shallow and it is not the play

[01:00:14] field and there is the same size as the other Williams play fields.

[01:00:18] So Joe.

[01:00:19] So here's here's some interesting little Easter eggs.

[01:00:21] Now Joe Dylan.

[01:00:22] He was a legendary Williams salesperson and he passed away around this time and is a tribute

[01:00:29] to Joe.

[01:00:30] They added him to the game.

[01:00:33] So when George came into the business the ultimate compliment was to call somebody a

[01:00:38] coin man.

[01:00:39] If you were a coin man, you were an important person and that was a huge compliment.

[01:00:45] And George according to George Joe was most definitely a coin man.

[01:00:52] So then they started working on the double super secret project.

[01:00:58] And what was the double super secret project?

[01:01:01] The wonderful Star Wars prequel movies, specifically the first one, the Fanta Menace.

[01:01:09] Now I know that that is not a very good Star Wars movie.

[01:01:18] It is very obvious it's probably the worst.

[01:01:20] However, it's Star Wars.

[01:01:22] It doesn't matter.

[01:01:23] It's Star Wars.

[01:01:25] Not only Ron was it Star Wars.

[01:01:28] It was the like the prequel movie.

[01:01:32] It was oh my god.

[01:01:34] We are going to learn about Anakin Skywalker and we are going to learn about the Jedi and

[01:01:41] the Clone Wars and all that stuff they talked about in the other movies that happened before.

[01:01:45] And Imaginations ran wild.

[01:01:47] This is also the era where they got to read the script for the movie was out.

[01:01:53] Oh, that's crazy.

[01:01:54] That is crazy.

[01:01:55] That's crazy.

[01:01:56] Wow.

[01:01:57] But yes.

[01:01:58] The hype around Star Wars coming back into theaters that wasn't just the original trilogy

[01:02:05] was massive.

[01:02:06] I remember one of the very first star, one of the very first websites I ever visited like

[01:02:12] on an actual web browser with the internet that you can see pictures and stuff on a dial

[01:02:19] up modem was Star Wars dot com and they had some photos from the set and I almost died.

[01:02:27] It looked amazing.

[01:02:28] This was a big deal.

[01:02:29] So they were like, oh my god, we have the Star Wars license to make a pinball machine.

[01:02:35] This is the biggest get we've ever had ever and everybody was trying to hitch their wagon

[01:02:40] to the Star Wars license.

[01:02:42] Not only that with pinball 2000, you can use the video assets.

[01:02:47] Oh my goodness.

[01:02:49] So Larry DeMar section off part of the pinball engineering department and created a bunch

[01:02:55] of locked doors.

[01:02:56] There were only 19 people that had signed non disclosure agreements with Lucasfilm that

[01:03:03] were allowed in those rooms.

[01:03:05] In fact, there was a chemical waste cabinet with a lock in it within this area.

[01:03:13] This was a super crazy huge cabinet.

[01:03:16] It was made of metal and it had all of Lucasfilm's secrets, the documents, the style guides,

[01:03:24] the CD ROMs and there were only 19 people that had access to that area.

[01:03:32] That's crazy talk.

[01:03:33] This is like government secrets kind of stuff going on here.

[01:03:38] It's Star Wars.

[01:03:40] It's Star Wars.

[01:03:41] So they sent a Lucasfilm.

[01:03:43] So they sent a Lucasfilm rep and she reviewed the game very critically.

[01:03:46] She saved most of her comments though for the back glass, Kevin O'Connor's back glass.

[01:03:51] She said he had not made the pod race large enough on the back glass.

[01:03:55] She wanted it bigger but it was pretty much too late at that point.

[01:03:58] So they basically kind of talked her out of it and she eventually signed off on it.

[01:04:03] Star Wars is like a whole Zeke ice thing now.

[01:04:06] It's a big deal, right?

[01:04:07] Like two years ago, I went to Galaxy's Edge at Disney World and I built a lightsaber with

[01:04:13] my oldest daughter and I got a baby Yoda looking at me right now.

[01:04:17] I've got Star Wars Lego and like Star Wars is huge now and it was big at the time but

[01:04:26] it was still sort of like, oh my God.

[01:04:28] Well at the time it hadn't been destroyed by Disney yet.

[01:04:32] Well yeah, George Lucas was about to destroy it.

[01:04:34] Yeah but at least it was George Lucas.

[01:04:38] So who designed that game?

[01:04:40] Who designed this new Star Wars game which was technically it was called Star Wars Episode

[01:04:46] One?

[01:04:47] Yeah.

[01:04:48] So Star Wars Episode One was designed concept and designed by John Papaduke.

[01:04:53] It was manufactured in June of 1999.

[01:04:57] It sells 3,525 units, art by Kevin O'Connor, Paul Barker and Dave Muller, Dots and Animation

[01:05:07] by Alan Cruz and Jack Linden.

[01:05:10] Linden.

[01:05:11] Linden.

[01:05:12] Mechanics by Bob Brown and Jack Scallon.

[01:05:16] Scallon.

[01:05:17] Scallon.

[01:05:18] Scallon?

[01:05:19] Scallon?

[01:05:20] Man they're Jack Scallon.

[01:05:21] The name's got harder as the years went on.

[01:05:23] Maybe that's why they went out of business.

[01:05:25] Their names were too complicated.

[01:05:29] Neil DeCastro is like, what happened to all the Italians?

[01:05:31] Who are all these people now?

[01:05:32] What's the world these crazy names?

[01:05:33] I need easier to pronounce names.

[01:05:35] I'm shutting down the pen.

[01:05:36] Who let the Ukrainians in here?

[01:05:38] Oh, bye.

[01:05:39] Eric Pribz...Pribzie.

[01:05:42] Pribby.

[01:05:43] Prib...Prizb.

[01:05:44] Prisbee.

[01:05:45] Prisbee.

[01:05:46] Prisbee.

[01:05:47] It's probably Prisbee.

[01:05:49] Software by Cameron Silver and Duncan Brown.

[01:05:53] By the way, if you swing over to SilverBallswegg.com, check out the SilverBall Chronicles area.

[01:06:00] You can get a shirt that says SilverBall Chronicles with David and Ron.

[01:06:05] This pronouncing names since 2020.

[01:06:08] That's true.

[01:06:09] It's our topseller shirt.

[01:06:10] Did I tell you Duncan Brown's the guy I bought my stargaser from?

[01:06:14] No.

[01:06:15] Yes, I did.

[01:06:16] That's cool.

[01:06:19] So the guy who designed Star Wars, episode one, is the same guy who six months before

[01:06:28] that basically had his project hijacked by George Gomez and Patelaw.

[01:06:33] And John Papadouc, of course, had a vision to show you the movie on the back box just

[01:06:42] like pinball2000.

[01:06:46] So John Papadouc had this vision that it would show you a movie in the back box.

[01:06:51] There would be video playing in his original back box.

[01:06:54] Well, pinball2000 sort of took that concept and flipped it.

[01:06:59] And now it's projecting on the play field.

[01:07:01] But John did not take the extra time that he had to experiment with this pepper's ghost

[01:07:09] effect.

[01:07:10] So remember, you have to keep the animations off the edge of the screen and you can move

[01:07:16] things around top to bottom of the monitor left to right and angles.

[01:07:20] Well, John didn't take the extra time to experiment like George had hoped.

[01:07:26] George would say, I guess you could politely say, hey, John, try to avoid the edges of

[01:07:30] the monitor or do you really need to keep going into this movie over and over and over?

[01:07:36] But J-Pop was the designer.

[01:07:37] Yeah.

[01:07:38] So you can see that George already sees a bit of concern here.

[01:07:42] J-Pop's original image, his original vision, is sort of skewing what he's designing.

[01:07:51] And it may not go well.

[01:07:53] We'll get into that in a minute.

[01:07:55] Adam Ryan, we got a lot of quotes from Adam.

[01:07:57] He says, Lucasfilm both helped and hindered the project.

[01:08:00] So this was a hysterical that we actually received some CD-ROMs from ILM.

[01:08:05] Industrial Light Magic, who was the animation studio that did movie?

[01:08:08] Yeah.

[01:08:09] And we were just like little kids, real excited.

[01:08:10] Wow, ILM graphics.

[01:08:11] Well, guess what?

[01:08:12] They purposefully ruined the models, the 3D models.

[01:08:16] They gave us damaged and corrupted models so that we would not reverse engineer what they

[01:08:20] did and help their competitors.

[01:08:23] Wow.

[01:08:24] So you get all of this fancy animation from literally the industry leader in computer

[01:08:31] animation.

[01:08:32] And because they it's proprietary, they don't want you to just take that CD-ROM and sell

[01:08:37] it to somebody.

[01:08:38] So here are the graphics, but you're going to have to figure it out on your own.

[01:08:42] So the animation team spent weeks repairing the models to use in pinball 2000.

[01:08:48] And it was said that Williams spent the most money ever on a license for Star Wars

[01:08:54] episode one.

[01:08:55] And after giving them all that money, they were given locked assets.

[01:09:01] And they had to spend more money in research and development in their animation teams to

[01:09:05] fix those corrupted assets.

[01:09:08] So they had six guys at Williams fixing the assets of a $2 billion company industrial

[01:09:17] light magic.

[01:09:19] Work that Williams had paid for.

[01:09:21] Brutal.

[01:09:22] Did Jar Jar Binks kill Williams pinball?

[01:09:26] So what's Jar Jar Binks?

[01:09:27] What's he all about?

[01:09:28] Maybe we should explain that.

[01:09:30] Boy, you sound angry.

[01:09:31] Sure, I will.

[01:09:33] It was a character that Lucas really wanted to plug in the movie as like the main character

[01:09:38] or the main comic relief, but he was terrible and no one liked him.

[01:09:41] Oh, it was bad.

[01:09:42] So bad.

[01:09:43] Like, it's so bad.

[01:09:45] But unfortunately, because the movie's not even out yet, Williams doesn't even know

[01:09:48] this.

[01:09:49] And they see like this, this is the one of the main characters of this new Star Wars movie,

[01:09:54] this Jar Jar Binks.

[01:09:55] So they made sure they put plenty of them on the game.

[01:09:58] So the, so the, so the team, the, the Williams team sees the style guide from Lucasfilm and

[01:10:03] there's charts and demographic breakdowns and characters.

[01:10:07] And each character was supposed to skew towards a certain market segment.

[01:10:12] And this right here is exactly why Star Wars went off the rails on episode one because

[01:10:20] the, the entire thing was designed around merchandise and demographics and people.

[01:10:28] So for example, the battle, according to, according to the style guide, the battle droids

[01:10:34] were designed to appeal to young males.

[01:10:39] Princess Amidala was to appeal to young females and old females.

[01:10:45] And Jar Jar Binks was supposed to based on their research to appeal to everyone.

[01:10:52] Males and females and young and old and he was like, everybody is going to love this guy.

[01:10:58] Lisa, stupid.

[01:11:00] Oh, God.

[01:11:02] It's so, he's so bad.

[01:11:04] He's so bad.

[01:11:06] In the movie, he actually farts their fart jokes and it's just like, this is Star Wars.

[01:11:11] Why, what?

[01:11:12] It's so bad.

[01:11:13] And he had this horrible accent and he was always just in the way.

[01:11:18] He was supposed to be funny, supposed to be funny.

[01:11:21] Honestly, the movie would be better if he was not in it.

[01:11:24] Adam Rine would tell the rest of the group at Williams that Lucasfilm was either exactly

[01:11:29] right or exactly wrong.

[01:11:32] And which one was he, Ron?

[01:11:34] Lucasfilm was dead, Ron.

[01:11:36] Yeah.

[01:11:37] And they course corrected in the next movie, but we'll not talk about that.

[01:11:40] It was still, oh, God.

[01:11:42] So there's this hype built around Star Wars and it's coming back into theaters and this

[01:11:46] is like, this is when I was in early high school, right?

[01:11:50] Like Star Wars is coming into the theater and Star Wars is a big part of my life when

[01:11:55] I was a kid and not maybe as much as you, but certainly your generation.

[01:11:59] It was a big deal and oh my God, this is my Star Wars.

[01:12:02] And I saw it and I almost died.

[01:12:06] And I think that, I think Jar Jar Banks basically killed Williams' pinball.

[01:12:10] I don't think so.

[01:12:11] But okay.

[01:12:12] He is right on the side, our George Gomez was quite upset at what happened with Star Wars,

[01:12:18] the pinball machine.

[01:12:19] And he called it a step back in terms of interactivity with the pinball 2000 platform.

[01:12:27] George says, I was horrified every time I saw the edges of the monitor.

[01:12:31] In Revenge from Mars, I fought to preserve the illusion by parking a Martian on a lane

[01:12:35] and hitting them with a ball and exploding them.

[01:12:38] You don't preserve the illusion by going edge to edge with a pink color and playing a

[01:12:41] movie in front of it.

[01:12:43] With all due respect to the guys that worked on the game, it was like, I shoot the ball

[01:12:46] around and then you play me a movie.

[01:12:48] The gameplay is predicated on interactivity.

[01:12:51] Watching movies is a passive event.

[01:12:53] Star Wars to me was lacking in interactivity.

[01:12:57] What is he talking about here when he's talking about you're shooting around and then

[01:13:00] you watch a movie and then you're shooting around and you watch a movie?

[01:13:03] Well I'm guessing he didn't like the second Indiana Jones pinball machine because that's

[01:13:08] pretty much what you did.

[01:13:09] You hit a shot and watched the movie.

[01:13:12] The problem here was that originally J-pop had this image of you would watch something

[01:13:19] on the back box, right, like the DMD.

[01:13:21] And then you would go back to the play field.

[01:13:23] Well he's kind of done that, but now it's playing on the play field glass instead of

[01:13:28] on the monitor on the back box.

[01:13:30] So one day George was in the room doing some play testing on Star Wars and Neil Nacastro

[01:13:36] entered the room and walked up behind George and was watching him play.

[01:13:40] Neil began praising the game and talking about how excited it was and how this was the

[01:13:46] next game that was coming out and they were going to hit it out of the park and it was

[01:13:51] all this exciting raw, raw, raw stuff.

[01:13:55] So imagine.

[01:13:57] George Gomez has been working on this big project that he's so proud of and that now you're

[01:14:03] looking at something that is just horrible.

[01:14:06] You know the boss does not want this to see this succeed, right?

[01:14:10] Like brutal.

[01:14:12] That's, no, you're making a situation there.

[01:14:16] So George said that they pulled a rabbit out of their hat and he was sure that Neil

[01:14:22] Nacastro was disappointed that they did such a good job and all of the praise during

[01:14:28] this time was fake.

[01:14:30] Gomez thought Star Wars was horrible and this guy wanted it to fail by praising it.

[01:14:36] I'm the official George Gomez voiceover guy.

[01:14:38] You are George Gomez this month.

[01:14:40] George says he was cushing enthusiasm for the Star Wars game.

[01:14:43] I was thinking how can he say this?

[01:14:45] I was distraught.

[01:14:46] I walked out of the room and didn't say where to it and he thought I disrespected him.

[01:14:51] Six months later Neil said, there was that one time you just had me in there and you walked

[01:14:55] out without saying a word.

[01:14:57] I told him I couldn't believe what you were telling me.

[01:14:59] You're telling me that you thought this is the greatest things to slice bread and I'm sitting

[01:15:03] here just disgusted with the thing I'm playing.

[01:15:05] Wow.

[01:15:06] I take it.

[01:15:07] George was not a fan of this game.

[01:15:09] It did.

[01:15:10] He is not.

[01:15:12] He's not holding his punches.

[01:15:14] He's not pulling his punches.

[01:15:16] He's George is not pulling any punches.

[01:15:19] So what do you think of Star Wars?

[01:15:20] We seem to be bashing it quite a bit.

[01:15:24] They expected to sell 15,000 Star Wars episode once and they sold 3,525 units.

[01:15:33] So I think that tells you right there.

[01:15:36] I played quite a bit of episode one because it was in my league and then we stopped putting

[01:15:43] it in a league.

[01:15:46] They're just like, can we just not ever play this?

[01:15:48] And it was decided very quickly that we will never play Star Wars episode one in our league

[01:15:52] anymore.

[01:15:53] Well, they've got Star Wars and had some cool things.

[01:15:55] It has a light saber which the Stern Star Wars didn't have.

[01:16:00] Has a cool light saber which you would think Star Wars would have.

[01:16:03] I did like it has spinners.

[01:16:05] They're actually video spinners.

[01:16:07] They're not physically there.

[01:16:09] They're reflected on the screen.

[01:16:11] I thought that was a pretty cool little effect.

[01:16:14] Yes.

[01:16:15] Wow.

[01:16:17] Poor Star Wars.

[01:16:18] The other issue is they wanted the games to be interchangeable yet with Revenge from

[01:16:24] Mars.

[01:16:25] You had the launch was just a button.

[01:16:28] Like it didn't have a plunger.

[01:16:29] You just hit the button.

[01:16:31] But then when Star Wars pop it you always have to use the shooter.

[01:16:36] The same shooter with the knob.

[01:16:38] He used his all his games.

[01:16:40] So he had to use that.

[01:16:41] So even if you wanted to do a swap it would take longer because you had to take out the

[01:16:47] button and put the shooter in.

[01:16:49] God.

[01:16:50] What a train wreck.

[01:16:52] Adam Ryan.

[01:16:55] The opinion of Star Wars is reflected by David Dennis.

[01:16:59] Not entirely of Ron Hallett.

[01:17:02] Ron I am a huge Star Wars fan.

[01:17:05] I am a huge Star Trek fan.

[01:17:07] I loved my my side of sci-fi, especially those old school sci-fies.

[01:17:12] And I wouldn't I wouldn't own this game.

[01:17:13] I own every other Star Wars game.

[01:17:15] Wow.

[01:17:16] So Adam Ryan says when Star Wars did not make its numbers it did not sell well in non-English

[01:17:21] speaking countries like Germany, France, which is where we used to sell most of our pinball

[01:17:26] games.

[01:17:27] We kind of knew the axe was falling.

[01:17:28] So Williams had increased the price of episode one by $500 which resulted in a bunch

[01:17:33] of canceled orders.

[01:17:35] Wow.

[01:17:36] $500.

[01:17:37] They do that all the time now.

[01:17:39] Yeah.

[01:17:40] Yeah, they call that a Keith L. Win game.

[01:17:41] Oh.

[01:17:42] All right.

[01:17:43] So we're looking at the flyer now.

[01:17:45] So not the totally dump on the poor game.

[01:17:48] Every journey has a beginning.

[01:17:51] Shoot and destroy the attacking battle droids from the cockpit of a Naboo fighter during

[01:17:56] hangar escape.

[01:17:57] That didn't like how like everything was droids all the sudden.

[01:18:01] It's like we couldn't kill actual humans in the movie.

[01:18:04] So everyone was a droid.

[01:18:05] Right.

[01:18:06] But that was the thing you couldn't kill people.

[01:18:09] This flyer is not bad.

[01:18:12] It's Star Wars.

[01:18:13] There's not much to make fun of on this thing.

[01:18:16] Like it was obviously designed and controlled by Lucasfilm because there's nothing in here

[01:18:20] that's embarrassing.

[01:18:21] Challenging, adventurous, and visually captivating.

[01:18:25] Star Wars episode one pinball is more than a struggle between good and evil.

[01:18:29] It's an epic in the making.

[01:18:32] That just that seems like a copywriter from Star Wars actually wrote that.

[01:18:37] They did have Darth Maul.

[01:18:39] Darth Maul was awesome.

[01:18:40] Wasn't he awesome?

[01:18:41] Darth Maul and a young Obi-Wan was the best part of the movie.

[01:18:46] Darth Maul was so awesome.

[01:18:49] Still, he's still awesome.

[01:18:50] Double-ended lightsaber man.

[01:18:52] When they're doing that duel of fates, the three of them are fighting.

[01:18:56] You know, he gets killed and then I was told he's not dead.

[01:18:59] I was like, how is he not dead?

[01:19:01] No, he's not.

[01:19:02] I didn't, so I don't know.

[01:19:03] I guess they just glue your legs back on.

[01:19:05] I mean, they literally had to read, like when he gets cut in half,

[01:19:08] the original cut didn't show in half.

[01:19:11] And they redid this special effect because it's like, oh, it's not obvious enough he's dead.

[01:19:15] So they wanted, they redid it to make sure you knew he was dead, but now he's back.

[01:19:19] Yeah, all those, all those other, so the people that are, the kids that are younger than me,

[01:19:23] they all watched the Clone Wars animated show.

[01:19:28] And it's supposed to be pretty good.

[01:19:29] I haven't watched a lot of that.

[01:19:31] And I guess he comes back in that thing, spoiler alert, but come on man, it's been 10 years.

[01:19:36] So I guess he comes back in that there's a whole story there.

[01:19:39] We're getting away off here on the Star Wars.

[01:19:41] I apologize for the stars.

[01:19:43] In my world, there's only three Star Wars movies, so I'm all set.

[01:19:47] Pat Lawler is working on a game at this time and it's called Wizard Blocks.

[01:19:51] Now it was never produced.

[01:19:52] It was on the Pinball 2000 platform.

[01:19:55] It has basically the whole same team except a Rob Berry does music and sound.

[01:19:59] And it was a magical theme.

[01:20:02] So Adam Ryan would say that the very minute we finished Star Wars episode one,

[01:20:06] the whole team jumped on Wizard Blocks and we were working hard on it.

[01:20:11] I think we all saw the writing on the wall at that point.

[01:20:15] So this is where they're scrambling to get Wizard Blocks done.

[01:20:18] And George, he thought Wizard Blocks was actually very, very good.

[01:20:23] Pat was beginning to use the system like they had envisioned with a minimum amount

[01:20:29] of edge to edge images.

[01:20:31] And he was really trying to take advantage of the Pepper's Ghost-style illusion.

[01:20:36] You must look beyond the trick of the mirror, really build it into the game.

[01:20:39] Once you get the player to forget about the mirror, the trick,

[01:20:42] and think about the gameplay and code you are made.

[01:20:46] Once the player loves the game, the shots, the humor of the characters,

[01:20:50] they will forget about the hologram and love the game for what it is, entertainment.

[01:20:53] Yeah, they want you to be immersed in it, right?

[01:20:56] They don't want you to be thinking about, oh, look, it's on the screen.

[01:20:59] They want you to look beyond that.

[01:21:02] And apparently, Wizard Blocks was achieving that.

[01:21:08] Now, how far did they get on that project?

[01:21:11] Uh, well, have you ever played Wizard Blocks?

[01:21:15] No, does it exist?

[01:21:16] I played it. Yes, it definitely exists.

[01:21:19] Really?

[01:21:20] Do you want to expand on that?

[01:21:22] You can see where they were going with it and it would have been very cool.

[01:21:25] Oh, man, that makes me mad.

[01:21:27] I'm sorry.

[01:21:28] Yeah, they had like, you know, there's, there's blocks,

[01:21:30] but there's a lot of small little graphics that are all throughout that you can interact with.

[01:21:36] I think it's more along the lines of what they, it's not just hitting it up the middle over and over again.

[01:21:41] It's not just shoot something and watch a star wars clip.

[01:21:43] It's not just shoot up the middle.

[01:21:45] It's not watch a clip.

[01:21:46] It's more, you could tell it's more along the lines of where they were going to go.

[01:21:50] More interaction, if you will.

[01:21:52] Yeah, so Pat Lawler, of course, is very meticulous when he designs his games.

[01:21:56] And he was thinking about, you know, all the different modes and what you could be doing in those modes.

[01:22:02] And he definitely doesn't show,

[01:22:07] Pat doesn't show his hand until he's ready.

[01:22:10] So you can put all this stuff together with all brand new dots in two or three days if he changes his mind.

[01:22:16] But in 3D, this became a problem because you had to design like human models or creatures.

[01:22:23] And he would throw a whole mode out and he would change his mind.

[01:22:27] And then you'd have to start from scratch again.

[01:22:29] So there was a little bit of back and forth because as you experiment and you learn these things,

[01:22:35] that's what Pat and that's what George had envisioned was experimentation.

[01:22:40] Although that experimentation was difficult to do.

[01:22:43] So there was apparently there was a, you would challenge wizards to fights.

[01:22:48] And there was a young boy wizard in the Egyptian goddess.

[01:22:51] And there was a character called the Underground Terror,

[01:22:55] which was sort of like a green gremlin frog thing.

[01:22:58] Apparently they were also working on a game called Playboy.

[01:23:02] Yes, they were based on the magazine.

[01:23:05] Now they got as far as doing a couple of ramps and throwing in, you know, some whitewood stuff.

[01:23:13] You can see some of that on IPDB.

[01:23:16] I can include a link in the show notes with some of that.

[01:23:20] And you've got like animated Playboy targets and stuff.

[01:23:24] So if you're thinking, you know, stranger things,

[01:23:27] the way that it, that, that sort of projector under the apron lights up the spinner

[01:23:33] and lights up the drop targets on the premium model.

[01:23:37] This platform of pinball 2000 was basically doing that in, you know, early 2000's technology.

[01:23:44] So George would say someone wanted to do Playboy really bad.

[01:23:47] And we had a vision for how the game would be driven.

[01:23:51] And it was a whole photo shoot concept.

[01:23:53] You know, you had the shutter sound from the camera in the game.

[01:23:56] And I think it would be enormous for pinball 2000.

[01:24:00] And it would have been a monster seller.

[01:24:02] But of course, George himself would later do a stern Playboy game.

[01:24:06] I mean, I guess the sky's the limit when it comes to video and the theme of Playboy.

[01:24:12] So this brings us to the infamous X-Po Seminar.

[01:24:19] You have seen this. I have seen this.

[01:24:21] I have seen this. It's very depressing.

[01:24:24] I have included it in the show notes.

[01:24:26] You can, you can watch along on the YouTube.

[01:24:29] And George gives a passion, George gives a passionate and emotional speech at X-Po in 1999,

[01:24:38] where he's promoting Star Wars a game he doesn't believe in and revenge for Mars in this new platform.

[01:24:47] But you can tell that something's up, right?

[01:24:50] Oh, you can definitely tell something's up.

[01:24:52] The weird thing is watching it now.

[01:24:53] This is from the 1999 Chicago pinball expo.

[01:24:58] And one of the seminar rooms and being in this hobby as long as I have,

[01:25:02] I recognized a lot of the people in the room.

[01:25:05] Like people who are still in the pinball today.

[01:25:08] It's like, wow, they were actually there.

[01:25:10] But yeah, you can tell he starts to lose it at several points and he knows what's coming.

[01:25:15] Yeah, it's very weird.

[01:25:17] I mean, I mean, in retrospect, you can understand.

[01:25:21] And Pat Waller's in there too.

[01:25:23] He's in the, he's in the audience watching it.

[01:25:25] He's there all. So George would say,

[01:25:28] yeah, I knew.

[01:25:29] A little bird in the executive suite basically said to me, you guys are done.

[01:25:34] I couldn't tell anyone.

[01:25:36] I just thought, I can't.

[01:25:39] It's kind of like my heart's broken.

[01:25:42] I can't break their hearts too.

[01:25:45] It was hard.

[01:25:46] I purposely stayed away for the next day, kind of rolled in really late.

[01:25:52] All the way there, I'm driving and thinking,

[01:25:55] what am I going to find when I get there?

[01:25:58] It was a very depressing time.

[01:26:00] It was really disheartening.

[01:26:03] So he knew the hammer was coming.

[01:26:05] A lot of people crap on Neil and the Castro.

[01:26:08] Oh, a lot of people, yes.

[01:26:10] They don't really hide it.

[01:26:12] Did, did Neil,

[01:26:13] the Castro want pinball to die?

[01:26:16] Well, George Gomez says,

[01:26:18] Neil is either Darth Vader or the nicest guy.

[01:26:22] Neil wasn't out to get us or anything like that.

[01:26:24] I think that his methods were not particularly supportive,

[01:26:28] but he did give us a shot and we did take a shot.

[01:26:31] So perhaps he did support us.

[01:26:33] Yeah, it's really hard to sort of figure out what his, what his angle was.

[01:26:37] I don't think he set them up to fit.

[01:26:40] He just wouldn't have given them a chance.

[01:26:42] He just would have, why would you spend the time and money and effort in 1990,

[01:26:46] like late 98, 99 on this entire platform if you're just going to kill it anyway?

[01:26:51] Right? Like you just, from the get go,

[01:26:54] you just would have said, nope, get out the door, right?

[01:26:56] Or keep on trucking.

[01:26:57] Here's another question that I'm going to ask you, Ron.

[01:27:00] And you are a pinball connoisseur.

[01:27:03] You, you know, you like your early solid states.

[01:27:05] You, you know, you like your system 11s.

[01:27:07] You've, you've seen the, you know,

[01:27:09] and played a lot of pinball machines.

[01:27:11] You've seen a lot of the growth since, you know, 2004.

[01:27:16] It's been a lot of things going on.

[01:27:18] Is pinball 2000 pinball?

[01:27:20] It's pinball enough.

[01:27:22] I think it's pinball.

[01:27:24] I mean, I kind of like the idea of this, this animation effect.

[01:27:28] I think that they were getting there.

[01:27:30] I don't think they were there.

[01:27:31] I would have liked to see what they would have done with the next few games.

[01:27:35] So Pat Loller would say,

[01:27:36] I'm sure when someone put flippers on a machine like Humpty Dumpty,

[01:27:40] someone said, that's not a pinball machine.

[01:27:43] And when they went from electro mechanical to solid state,

[01:27:45] people said, oh, that's not pinball.

[01:27:48] And then when they went to a dot matrix in a machine,

[01:27:51] I know someone said, that isn't pinball.

[01:27:53] It has a video in it.

[01:27:55] Wow, that's really well said, Pat Loller.

[01:27:57] So tip of the hat to you, sir.

[01:27:59] You know, when people say, oh, well, now there's an LCD screen

[01:28:02] and the thing, all the magic has gone from the play field.

[01:28:04] It's now in the, it's now in the back box.

[01:28:06] That's not pinball, right?

[01:28:08] Like, it's the same thing now.

[01:28:09] Should they have gone all in on pinball 2000 like they had?

[01:28:13] When they did pinball 2000,

[01:28:15] they just stopped making DMD games 100% right into the gate.

[01:28:19] Do you think that was a mistake?

[01:28:20] Well, I've heard stories that the, eventually the plan was to have two lines,

[01:28:25] but I've never, I've heard that,

[01:28:27] but I've never seen any proof of that, obviously.

[01:28:30] Yeah, so like in our, in our got leab system three episode,

[01:28:34] we talked about got leab street level games,

[01:28:38] where their street level experiment was smaller games,

[01:28:41] no ramps, less stuff on the play field.

[01:28:44] You know, smaller size.

[01:28:47] And they didn't just have that line plus their regular,

[01:28:51] you know, pin size pinball machines.

[01:28:53] They went all in on that strategy.

[01:28:54] And it's almost like Williams did the same thing.

[01:28:56] They basically shut down the DMD stuff after Cactus Canyon.

[01:29:01] And they just went all in on pinball 2000.

[01:29:04] And they probably should have kept, you know, a WPC

[01:29:07] and a pinball 2000 like two lines.

[01:29:09] They basically made the exact same mistake as got leab.

[01:29:12] And I mean, come on, Williams was not caught leab.

[01:29:14] George Gomez says, I feel like it's that, you know, that thing,

[01:29:17] like the cow says, and you pull the string and it says something,

[01:29:21] they still have that.

[01:29:22] Shazoo!

[01:29:24] That's a European cow.

[01:29:25] George says, my vision was that this was another product line.

[01:29:29] Maybe you have one that misses, but that's not the way management saw it.

[01:29:33] I mean, why wouldn't you have two differently priced product lines?

[01:29:37] We were very afraid of pinball 2000.

[01:29:39] We thought we have to go in this direction to make the economics work.

[01:29:42] The notion that we were ignorant to this is just plain wrong.

[01:29:45] We weren't ignorant to it.

[01:29:46] That's the part that nobody talks about.

[01:29:48] You know it's insulting.

[01:29:49] Yeah.

[01:29:50] So George is basically saying like, hey guys,

[01:29:52] this was not street level.

[01:29:55] Like, this was not, we got rid of DMD.

[01:29:57] We canceled it all and we went all in to pinball 2000.

[01:30:01] Like, we're not ignorant to it.

[01:30:02] That's don't insult me.

[01:30:04] Which is a good way to put it.

[01:30:05] He's basically saying the only way that we could make this work money wise

[01:30:10] is we had to plow the money into it.

[01:30:12] And then eventually we would go back into a two method strategy.

[01:30:16] That's basically what I see there.

[01:30:18] Imagine what could have been though.

[01:30:19] Right?

[01:30:20] Like, you know, they had done so many more things

[01:30:23] if they had been given a chance and they had gotten,

[01:30:25] they were getting better.

[01:30:26] You know, this wizard block stuff apparently was getting there.

[01:30:29] It's just nobody was really talking about the designing process of pinball

[01:30:34] that platforms evolve, right?

[01:30:37] Like, as games evolved, the use of the DMD,

[01:30:41] the understanding of the DMD got better.

[01:30:43] It didn't just start being amazing and was always amazing.

[01:30:47] And the systems would have got better.

[01:30:48] And the systems would have evolved.

[01:30:50] The competition, the shark tank of Williams,

[01:30:53] all of that would have pushed the platform and made it better.

[01:30:59] Well, Williams would shut down and that never happened.

[01:31:04] The day of reckoning.

[01:31:07] And we've talked about this quite a few times and we'll continue to talk about sort of the end of days at Williams.

[01:31:12] You know, we keep bumping into it in various ways.

[01:31:16] Yep, October, October 25th, which we would have been right after Expo.

[01:31:23] So basically that speech that George Gomez did at seminars,

[01:31:29] that Monday, whenever we went back to work, they found out.

[01:31:33] Adam Ryan says,

[01:31:35] by the time I showed up at work that day, the internet had been shut down and the network had been unplugged.

[01:31:40] There was supposed to be a meeting in new that day company-wide.

[01:31:43] We all knew what was about to happen.

[01:31:45] They brought us into the cafeteria and they told us what we all knew.

[01:31:48] Pinball had been losing money like an open wound and they can no longer justify to their shareholders

[01:31:53] why we even exist.

[01:31:54] That's bumping, mass firing, that's a bad one.

[01:31:56] If you didn't even get the separate thing, so they were all going to get some severance.

[01:32:00] You know, they all had, you know, some sort of understanding of where they would go based on their tenure.

[01:32:08] A lot of the artists, a lot of the programmers were going to be interviewed at Midway Games.

[01:32:13] They had to be interviewed for the company they already worked for.

[01:32:16] Yes, which is super insulting.

[01:32:18] Yep.

[01:32:19] Then the question is, do you go for the interview and Adam Ryan interviewed with Midway

[01:32:24] and he would eventually hook up in their sports department and he started working on

[01:32:30] Red Card Soccer.

[01:32:31] That's exciting.

[01:32:32] George Gomez says,

[01:32:33] professionally, he was one of the most rewarding times in my career because I lived a creative on that

[01:32:37] and the amount of energy and talent that was brought to bear.

[01:32:40] It's exciting, right?

[01:32:41] It was an exciting project and Adam Ryan would say that he was happy that they at least got the shot to do it.

[01:32:47] They gave them the money to recreate something with George Gomez and Pat Lawler

[01:32:51] with their amazing idea and it was inspired by John Papaduke's designs.

[01:32:56] It was something else, one level further.

[01:32:58] I believe this was right after Expo and Expo that year I believe Williams was the factory tour.

[01:33:04] So everyone got to go through and see the factory on its, yeah, right before.

[01:33:10] They even did a thing where Steve Cordek, who had worked there since 1960, so he was going to retire

[01:33:17] obviously at this point and they took a picture of him with a Star Wars episode one

[01:33:21] as like with the caption like the last one off the line, like the final game.

[01:33:26] That's depressing.

[01:33:27] That's depressing.

[01:33:28] Now you said there was a pinball 2000 documentary which unfortunately I couldn't find a copy of it

[01:33:33] so I couldn't watch it, which probably would have helped a lot during this during this episode.

[01:33:38] But um...

[01:33:38] Yes, it's called tilt, the battle to save pinball.

[01:33:41] Was that accurate?

[01:33:43] What do you think? You've seen tilt, you've now heard this podcast.

[01:33:46] Did I do a better job?

[01:33:47] It's uh uh uh well clearly I mean because you're you and yes.

[01:33:52] Thank you.

[01:33:53] I mean that means a lot, Ron.

[01:33:55] It's basically the same, same.

[01:33:57] Honestly the the DVD, the movie's good.

[01:34:00] What I found more interesting because I'm geeky.

[01:34:03] We're all the extra features.

[01:34:05] The extra features, it has the speech from Expo.

[01:34:08] It has the video that they sent to all like the operators about this new exciting pinball 2000

[01:34:14] system and how you set the game up and how cool it is.

[01:34:17] That's where I got all the information about the operator key and all this other you know

[01:34:23] all the cool functions of this wonderful new system.

[01:34:26] I geeky out.

[01:34:26] I like the tech video and they had a um bunch of extra extras with George Gomez where he shows how

[01:34:32] he came up with revenge from Mars and all that stuff.

[01:34:35] Did they have an alternative audio commentary with Pat Lawler talking about the documentary?

[01:34:40] Uh I don't think so.

[01:34:42] That would be amazing.

[01:34:43] So George Gomez would say just a couple of things I take issue with on the documentary.

[01:34:49] Pretty much you end up interviewing 20 people about an event and you're going to get 20 different

[01:34:54] opinions.

[01:34:55] I think for the most part it was on the money.

[01:34:57] So that's pretty good.

[01:34:58] So if you've seen that he says it's pretty close and uh and you say that this is better than

[01:35:04] that documentary.

[01:35:05] So then George Gomez would say that this podcast is better than that documentary and thus

[01:35:13] this is much more complete than that.

[01:35:17] The interesting thing to me about pinball 2000 is that Williams did to the rights.

[01:35:23] They basically made sure no one else could buy them so it would die which I always thought was just

[01:35:29] hmm that was kind of weird.

[01:35:32] Would pinball 2000 work today if somebody wanted to do it?

[01:35:35] Seems like a good idea right like I mean it's you saw it head potential.

[01:35:40] It's called multi-morphic.

[01:35:42] Yeah well there's a shift to home sales now right like pinball 2000 isn't really

[01:35:47] a home game thing.

[01:35:50] It's not quite the same.

[01:35:51] You know you're getting into now people are swapping out monitors for LCD monitors to make them lighter

[01:35:56] and you know there's a PC in it with parts from 1999 and like stuff is totally different.

[01:36:03] And you need the special glass you can't just put regular.

[01:36:05] And it's heavy and it's annoying and it you know like it's I don't know if that would work.

[01:36:10] Well uh Tom Uben would say that the patent rights for pinball 2000 are spread across multiple

[01:36:16] different people in corporations and if someone wanted to do pinball 2000 today I think it would

[01:36:24] be nearly impossible.

[01:36:26] Yeah I think there was even I don't remember it was Roger Sharp or there were other groups they

[01:36:31] they wanted to try to continue on the pinball 2000 idea but Williams would not sell the rights

[01:36:37] they would not allow it.

[01:36:39] It's like they was just wanted it to die.

[01:36:41] That's so it's you know that's really really interesting.

[01:36:45] That that they would you know you know is that like a kneel that the Castro thing now no

[01:36:50] there may be in the movie I'm trying to remember that the old memory of mine but I'm pretty sure

[01:36:57] that they tried so much try to get the rights to the technology and they were like no

[01:37:02] it's like really it's like you're not going to use it you're not making pinball machines anymore

[01:37:07] but you know that's crazy talk that's crazy talk so where do you think the original prototypes are

[01:37:14] I know that George Gomez doesn't know yes that's it's all I know as well I'm sure they're in

[01:37:19] somebody's private collection somewhere somebody had sent us an email not too long ago that they

[01:37:23] had the original wrecking ball a friend of theirs headed in their collection so likely there's

[01:37:27] one of those machines sitting around somewhere in the original prototype phase.

[01:37:31] Very possible.

[01:37:32] So do you have any final thoughts on pinball 2000 Ron?

[01:37:35] It was a cool idea I would like to see it I would have liked to have seen it a few more games

[01:37:41] and once they got the kanks worked out it was really cool you know it's as crappy as Star Wars

[01:37:46] Episode One is um again David Dennis opinion it it it was still very cool it's still very cool

[01:37:55] as long as you just don't know what's going on and you just sort of shoot around it's it's pretty

[01:37:59] cool I haven't played revenge from Mario and that's the better one it's much funnier yeah it's

[01:38:05] quite funny and it has like you fight every I think you say fight Abraham Lincoln or something

[01:38:10] and they do the Lincoln they do the mortal combat finish him.

[01:38:14] Finish him.

[01:38:17] Uh well I guess this is kind of a pinball 2000 story have you ever seen the play field for

[01:38:22] wizard blocks what's it take a look at the play field for wizard blocks bring it up right now

[01:38:27] and look at the center of the play field and you tell me where you've seen that before

[01:38:33] on a most re much more recent game these dots looking at like shooting dots look something like

[01:38:41] um something like dialed in yep that's exactly what they are so when I we when I played the original

[01:38:49] dialed in prototype when it was unveiled by Jersey Jocket Expo and they took the blanket off the

[01:38:53] thing and you see it and it's like first thing it popped in my head was wizard blocks he reused it

[01:39:00] he reused his dots from wizard blocks so I always think a dialed in is almost like it's kind of

[01:39:06] carry on wizard blocks in some weird way well Ron that's it for this month we've covered pinball

[01:39:12] 2000 thank you everybody for listening to us this is 16 episodes 16 months in the making wow
