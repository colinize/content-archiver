[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:16] I got my drum part ready.

[00:19] Your drum part?

[00:20] Yeah, I noticed you've been putting the drum brakes in.

[00:24] So I'll see if anyone recognizes what I play today.

[00:29] I bet you know I'd recognize it.

[00:59] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles of pinball history

[01:05] podcast with me this month is Ron.

[01:09] I'm the only one that didn't get Corona.

[01:12] How you doing?

[01:13] All right.

[01:14] Yeah.

[01:15] With you this month, is there other people with you other months?

[01:19] There is.

[01:20] Yes, but I don't hide those episodes.

[01:23] Okay, because you know I don't listen to the episodes.

[01:25] Actually, I'll listen to the end.

[01:27] That's right.

[01:28] Bluppers.

[01:29] Yeah, that's all I listen to.

[01:30] When Nordman appears.

[01:32] No, yeah, that was a long, long promo there.

[01:35] Yeah, we asked Nordman if he would provide us with two minutes and sure enough he went

[01:43] a full two minutes.

[01:44] I didn't, I was, I was a symbolic two minutes, 30 seconds.

[01:46] So you didn't even script that.

[01:47] You forced them to have to come up with two minutes of material.

[01:49] Yeah, yeah, it was great.

[01:51] That's pretty rude.

[01:52] It was good.

[01:53] He also helped out in my commercial if you had listened to that one, which most people

[01:56] didn't.

[01:57] Oh, yeah, you, you got some kind of like financial thing, but I'm not in Canada, so I can't

[02:01] use your services.

[02:02] Trying to feed my kids here.

[02:03] Come on.

[02:04] I'm here to feed people pinball knowledge.

[02:07] People like Jason R from the Twipped Hermotors database.

[02:10] Yes, he says educational and entertaining.

[02:14] He capitalized and.

[02:15] You and the episodes are pure pleasure, a comforting tale by the fireside laying out the facts

[02:21] of the pinball industry history, just what you want from a podcast.

[02:25] That's wonderful, but also playful and honest with the subject matter too.

[02:29] Ooh, for playful and honest honest.

[02:32] This is going to be an honest one this month, Ron.

[02:34] Oh, yes.

[02:36] We also have some inquiries about the last episode inquiries or corrections.

[02:40] Did we screw something up?

[02:41] Well, we had a, it's some of its like discussion, some of its corrections, but Dan Costa emailed

[02:47] into silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[02:50] And he said, Hey, fellas, love the latest podcast about Dennis Norman.

[02:54] Have a couple of questions regarding demo man that I don't believe were answered on the

[02:59] podcast.

[03:00] His first question, Ron, I believe you mentioned that the sound team flew to Hollywood to get

[03:05] custom callouts from Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes.

[03:09] Any idea why they got 10 callouts totaled from them?

[03:12] The game seems like it has very few callouts and I'm curious why they'd fly all the way

[03:16] out to get the callouts.

[03:19] I have the same question.

[03:21] I'm very curious too.

[03:24] That's totally, totally makes sense.

[03:26] Back in that day though, that like flying back and forth and doing that things was, was

[03:29] pretty common.

[03:30] You would figure though they would have got more, more quotes because there aren't actual

[03:34] custom quotes in there that you can tell.

[03:36] Like Jackpot, Jackpot callouts and stuff.

[03:39] Maybe that's all they did is like, well, just do pinball specific stuff and we'll use

[03:42] movie clips for the rest.

[03:44] Maybe they only gave them like five minutes.

[03:45] Yeah, maybe, maybe that's all the time they got with those to do the callouts.

[03:50] Yeah, this is so long.

[03:51] Can you do your, okay.

[03:53] All right, we got it.

[03:54] Okay.

[03:55] Let's get it here.

[03:56] Let's get out.

[03:57] See Jackpot.

[03:58] I'm planning to Holly wouldn't get any here.

[03:59] Yeah.

[04:00] The second question from Dan.

[04:01] Oh, yeah.

[04:02] In Baron Bowen Karen's tutorial at 2715 on YouTube, he gets to demolition time and mentions

[04:11] there are three tasks you need to perform.

[04:13] The three seashell bonuses hidden around the game.

[04:17] Bowen never fully explains the two steps to get the bonus, get to the bonus round.

[04:22] Any idea how to get to that bonus round?

[04:25] Okay.

[04:26] How do I explain this?

[04:28] Bowen would occasionally throw in little tidbits like that that are completely untrue.

[04:36] Like if you watch, I think on his Dracula, Bram Stoker's Dracula one, he says, if you

[04:43] do a certain thing, you, Dracula washes your car.

[04:49] He also would post every year on April 1st.

[04:53] He would post on wreck games pinball about the Beavis and Butthead prototype pinball machine

[04:59] he played and then crush your soul.

[05:02] I mean, he would never say it didn't exist, but obviously he's just kidding.

[05:06] So yes, I have a feeling that's one of those things that does not exist.

[05:09] He made it up.

[05:10] Oh, very fun.

[05:12] Very fun.

[05:13] Ben Madison also has some feedback on an episode from a couple of episodes ago.

[05:19] In our System ADB episode, I mispronounced Tay-Tay-Keyda.

[05:27] I saw Terracotta.

[05:30] Remember the music?

[05:31] Duh, duh, duh, duh.

[05:32] Okay.

[05:33] And it's pronounced Tay-Keyda.

[05:37] Backwards D upside down E. There's an Oom Lout.

[05:41] He literally still can't do it.

[05:43] I know, yeah.

[05:44] You gave him the actual way to do it.

[05:45] How do you say that, Ron?

[05:46] Oh, I have no idea.

[05:48] Thanks so much to Ben for that.

[05:50] Ben and I have messaged back and forth a couple of times.

[05:53] Oh, man, I'm getting a lot of fire here at the Gmail account for my comments about EMS.

[06:02] I have not made any friends amongst the EMS folk here.

[06:06] You said how great they are?

[06:07] I was just teasing about the episode.

[06:10] Now I love EMS a lot.

[06:12] I really enjoy them.

[06:14] I play a lot of them actually in our league.

[06:17] And we will be doing an EMS specific episode.

[06:20] There have been a few people that have actually sent us in some really, really good sources

[06:27] with some of the EMS masters of their day.

[06:32] So the episode will shape up pretty well.

[06:33] I have not started on that because, quite frankly, I wanted to get to this topic because

[06:38] it's a bit different than most of our other topics.

[06:43] Any other words, Ron?

[06:45] Uh, nope, let's get into it.

[06:48] John Poppiduke, also known as J-Pop, created some of the most interesting and whimsical

[06:55] play field designs of the 1990s.

[06:58] He went from God tier, Bally Williams designer to start up Pinball Company owner.

[07:05] And finally, a Pinball pariah.

[07:09] Ron once described his journey as a long tale of woe in some cases, but also tales of glory

[07:17] in others.

[07:18] His name was once included with other Pinball legends, but in 2022, J-Pop has been reduced

[07:25] to a Pinball leper.

[07:27] People would often say, what could J-Pop have done with Bally Williams if they had never

[07:32] closed?

[07:33] Now, now the question most likely heard is, where did it go all wrong with J-Pop?

[07:40] And why isn't J-Pop in jail?

[07:43] Does John Poppiduke deserve all of this criticism and abuse, which has sullied his awesome 1990s

[07:49] Bally Williams legacy?

[07:52] This month, we go down the rabbit hole with John Poppiduke.

[07:56] Ron, you're a huge John Poppiduke fan.

[07:58] I'm a huge World Cup soccer fan, yes.

[08:01] You've got all of J-Pop's games in your super high value collection.

[08:06] No, I just have World Cup soccer.

[08:09] I like that down the rabbit hole.

[08:10] That was good.

[08:11] That was very good.

[08:12] That was very good.

[08:13] Took me a while to come up with that.

[08:15] How would you describe J-Pop's design philosophy?

[08:20] Long flowing plastic ramps and a love of magnets and a hatred of symmetry, which he would

[08:26] say himself.

[08:28] Just look at a game like Circus Falterre, look at the slingshots.

[08:33] Notice they're not even.

[08:34] One is a little higher than the other.

[08:37] He did not like symmetry.

[08:38] So let's rewind here.

[08:40] Let's go all the way back to John Poppiduke's early life.

[08:43] I have so many really great sources this month.

[08:48] They are all included in the show notes.

[08:52] Often those show notes are in your pod catcher or they're on the Facebook page post.

[08:57] Now, if it's a podcast, I haven't been able to link directly to it because that screws

[09:01] up our feeds, which is some of the problems we have sometimes in various pod catchers.

[09:06] So I'm trying to keep those sources in there as intact as possible.

[09:11] If you're having any trouble or anything, just give me an email at silverballcronicles.gmail.com

[09:16] and I'll shoot them over to you if there's some issues.

[09:18] But there's some good ones this month, Ron.

[09:21] As the teenager John Poppiduke grew up in Toronto, Canada.

[09:25] As we call it up here, Toronto, it was here that he worked at a pinball operator repairing

[09:32] machines.

[09:33] At 19, he wrote Norm Clark, who was a ballet designer, and Norm would eventually invite

[09:39] him down to the factory in Chicago for a tour.

[09:43] Ron, you remember letters, right?

[09:45] Yeah, I remember letters.

[09:46] That was still in my era.

[09:48] What was it like writing letters?

[09:49] I'd hand write them unless you had a typewriter and then you'd have to mail them.

[09:54] Then you got to wait weeks.

[09:55] You got to wait.

[09:56] Yep, till they get them.

[09:58] Then they got to get around right and back.

[10:00] Then they got to right back.

[10:01] So there's a lot of waiting.

[10:03] Yeah.

[10:04] So Chicago is actually a sister city to Toronto.

[10:06] And the reason for that is they were both sort of built around the same time.

[10:10] I've been to Chicago a couple of times when I lived in Toronto and I love Chicago.

[10:15] Chicago is an awesome city.

[10:17] It's very much like a really big Toronto.

[10:20] The architecture, the people, we both get lake effect to snow up that way.

[10:26] So there's a shared camaraderie for the hatred of blowing snow.

[10:30] It doesn't have a sky dome, though.

[10:32] No, it does not.

[10:34] It does not.

[10:35] Oh wait a minute.

[10:36] It's not called that anymore, is it?

[10:37] No, everybody still calls it the sky dome.

[10:38] Okay, good.

[10:39] Yeah.

[10:40] It has a Roger's corporate name, but nobody actually calls it that.

[10:43] It's just like in Chicago.

[10:44] It's still called the Sears Tower, even though it has a different name.

[10:47] Exactly.

[10:48] People will not change the name, which is pretty awesome because there is that Disney

[10:53] Plus movie turning red and they call it the sky dome in that show.

[10:58] Everybody in Canada is like freaking righty, dudes.

[11:02] So to pop over from Toronto to Chicago is fairly simple.

[11:05] It's a bit of a drive.

[11:07] You got to go around the lake.

[11:08] You got to go into America.

[11:10] You probably got to stop in a white castle, but it's tons of fun to get down to Chicago,

[11:14] even better if you can afford to fly.

[11:17] After giving the tour, Norm Clark would take John back to the airport.

[11:21] And after a conversation and some constant sort of back and forth, Norm is said to have

[11:28] offered John a job at Balli.

[11:32] Norm Clark was a big deal in the industry around this time, especially at Balli, right?

[11:36] That would be correct.

[11:37] Well, he was a very long time designer.

[11:40] I actually think I met him at an expo.

[11:42] Yeah, I got an autograph from him.

[11:45] Did he have the same poll as Buddy at Williams?

[11:49] Steve Corda.

[11:50] Yeah.

[11:51] They were always like at the autograph sessions.

[11:53] They were always like next to each other, buddy, buddy.

[11:57] The job that John was given at Balli was basically on the tech side where he would work in

[12:05] the whitewood lab, which is where the designers would sort of say, you know, put drop targets

[12:09] here and put a target there.

[12:11] And then he's got to move him around and wire it and tweak it.

[12:15] He'd finalize everything in the lab.

[12:17] And then the theme would be chosen and it would be passed off to the artist team.

[12:21] Then of course, it would go to manufacturing.

[12:24] J-pop was given a great education by some of the pinball grates around this time.

[12:30] That would include Norm Clark and in the orbit at this time, at the sort of Balli midway

[12:38] era of Balli.

[12:40] You know, he's got the Dennis Nordman's of the world from our last episode, some of the

[12:44] greatest artists at the time with Greg Ferrez.

[12:49] You know, there's a lot of really talented people and working with those talented people,

[12:52] you can only soak that up.

[12:55] On his spare time, John would create his own prototype.

[13:00] This was from an acquired F-14 Tomcat, oddly enough, of Williams.

[13:06] And he built his own play field.

[13:08] This thing had long wavy ramps, an interesting art package, and some unique looking mechanical

[13:15] features.

[13:17] This is the coolest thing.

[13:19] I have never seen this before.

[13:20] I only found this when I was doing my search.

[13:23] He has a prototype for Alice in Wonderland.

[13:27] This is in the late 80s.

[13:29] I've included a link to a YouTube video from Mike Dimes, who's a Canadian pinballer and

[13:35] YouTuber, who documents his adventures buying, selling, restoring, and hunting for pinball

[13:41] machines.

[13:42] It is known as pinball shenanigans over on YouTube.

[13:47] So go ahead and give him a like and subscribe.

[13:50] I'll include the link in the show notes so you can take a look at this.

[13:54] But he stumbles upon Alice in Wonderland, the prototype, still in Toronto that John

[14:01] Poppiduke made.

[14:03] There's also a pinball profile with Jeff Tielis, where he talks to the owners about this

[14:08] pin, also included in the show notes.

[14:11] So when you look at this run, I've got a picture up in front of us.

[14:15] This is John Poppiduke.

[14:18] This is quintessentially John Poppiduke.

[14:20] Just look at this first image.

[14:21] Yeah, if you show me this play field.

[14:22] So what designer did this?

[14:23] I'd be like, looks like John Poppiduke to me.

[14:26] Immediately he has this flare and pizzazz and difference right out of the gate.

[14:34] So we're looking at the play field here.

[14:36] In the middle there's like a crooked, crazy kind of clock that's under the play field.

[14:42] Kind of like black hole, how it's got a hole in the play field and then there's something

[14:47] underneath it.

[14:48] It looks like a clock under there.

[14:49] I can't really see two.

[14:51] It looks like spectrum side, not spectrum.

[14:55] Yeah, a lecture size of it.

[14:58] There's an interesting sort of like what do we call these pints up here?

[15:02] What do you call those?

[15:03] I don't know what that is.

[15:04] That's supposed to be a bottle.

[15:06] Yeah, it looks like liquor bottle actually.

[15:08] But it's like a spinning bottle.

[15:10] That's part of Alice in Wonderland is this spinning bottle.

[15:13] It has tea cups on the pop bumpers, which is really, really cool.

[15:19] The art is directly taken from the Disney Alice in Wonderland, which is probably

[15:25] a no-no when it comes to licensing, but of course it's just a prototype.

[15:28] So it's not a big deal.

[15:29] We go to this image.

[15:30] This is a different image.

[15:32] There's a magnet that's right in front of like there's a famous scene in that movie

[15:37] where there's like a...

[15:40] What is that thing that screams?

[15:42] Like a horn or a whatever drinks the tea and a burns his mouth or something.

[15:46] So there's like a vertical up kicker in there.

[15:49] Sort of like the Totten Genie magnet as well, right?

[15:52] Where it goes below the play field.

[15:54] The Chester Cat ramps, so there's the Chester Cat and then there's the ramp as like his

[15:59] tail kind of looping down around it.

[16:02] It's playing cards on the ramps.

[16:05] But then we get to the lower play field.

[16:07] There's something really weird in there.

[16:09] Yeah, there's a mini flipper below where you would drain so you can use it to save the

[16:15] ball.

[16:16] It's like it's not even a full apron.

[16:18] It's like half an apron so you can see the flipper.

[16:20] It's like on the outlaying it comes down around to like a mini flipper that's fully

[16:24] embedded in the apron that kicks it up.

[16:27] So I guess you'd have to flip your flipper up on the top and it would kind of go back

[16:32] out into the middle of the play field.

[16:34] Yeah, and a funny story is on my podcast, Slantill podcast.

[16:39] I'm just giving my plug there.

[16:41] Geez.

[16:42] We didn't even make it in like 10 minutes here.

[16:45] One of our Rochester locals, he built his own home brew and he has this in the home

[16:51] brew.

[16:52] The same thing and almost the same place.

[16:55] So we sent him this picture.

[16:57] It's like, uh-huh, Papa Dupetia with this idea.

[17:00] In the video as well as on sort of the conversation with Jeff T. Olis, there's no sort of mention

[17:07] of this machine actually flipping, right?

[17:09] No, I've never even seen it turn on.

[17:12] So it's one step below magic girl, which we'll get into later in that, at least magic

[17:17] girl I've seen actually in a track mode.

[17:19] This I've never seen even powered up.

[17:22] So I have no idea whether it actually works.

[17:24] It's kind of really, really neat.

[17:27] Immediately the fingerprints of the designer are all over it.

[17:31] All over it.

[17:32] This takes us to the Williams takeover of Bali.

[17:34] In 1988, Bali Midway was purchased by Williams to become Williams, Bali Midway or as most

[17:41] people call it as Bali Williams.

[17:44] John was working on a game called Ice Castle in May of 1989, which never made it into

[17:51] production.

[17:52] Then J. Pop was abruptly let go.

[17:56] Well, he was let go.

[17:57] This came up in the, I believe the pinball profile interview that he didn't have a green

[18:03] card.

[18:04] So the whole time he was working at Bali.

[18:05] He's just kind of working under the table.

[18:07] I guess something like that to that effect.

[18:10] So when Williams took over, they looked into all that stuff and like, yeah, we can't have

[18:16] that.

[18:17] Yeah.

[18:18] So for a Canadian to work in the United States, the United States needs to give you the

[18:23] thumbs up.

[18:24] Yeah.

[18:25] Because they don't want dirty Canadians kind of coming down there and taking American jobs.

[18:30] Well, is it like, is a green card to live here, but isn't there like a separate, like

[18:33] a working paper stuff?

[18:34] Yeah, work visa.

[18:36] Work visa, yeah.

[18:37] Yeah.

[18:38] So they're on a green card.

[18:39] He doesn't have a work visa.

[18:40] Yeah.

[18:41] Listen to the podcast, the pinball profile.

[18:44] It explains it.

[18:45] But yeah, basically he didn't have the paperwork needed to be working where he was working.

[18:49] And Williams was like, no, we can't have that.

[18:52] So right out of the gate, we got some questionable ethics by John Papaduke.

[18:57] Or maybe he just didn't realize he was supposed to get one.

[19:00] That's totally a possibility with him.

[19:02] I had a good friend who had, he basically had his documentation.

[19:07] He would travel down, he worked for Blackberry.

[19:10] And he would travel down to the US and have meetings and do things like that.

[19:13] Eventually, he was dinged at the border because he didn't have the proper paperwork to actually

[19:18] be quote unquote working in the US.

[19:20] Yeah.

[19:21] There have been vendors, classic play fields who are based out of Canada.

[19:26] They were going to a pinball expo and they got stopped at the border and had issues because

[19:32] it was considered work because if you're displaying your stuff at the show, yes.

[19:39] They tried to say that it was just a hobby thing.

[19:46] No, they were trying to say, they weren't selling anything.

[19:48] They were just showing what they had.

[19:50] They weren't going to take orders, which probably was not true either.

[19:56] So I don't know if Americans understand.

[20:00] Canadians have this long running love hate relationship with the American border.

[20:05] And most of us are trained at a very young age to wear like five layers of clothing back

[20:11] from the US into Canada across the border so we can get through our daily maximum numbers

[20:16] for duty and taxation.

[20:19] So none of these stories actually surprised me in any way.

[20:24] And fireworks.

[20:25] Getting the fireworks was always a big thing when I was a kid.

[20:28] But John made it back to Williams.

[20:30] He did eventually he got back.

[20:31] I assumed because he got his paperwork in order.

[20:34] Yeah, I so.

[20:35] Yeah.

[20:36] J. Pop says, I really came in on the coattails of Pat Waller, Steve Richie, Larry DeMar,

[20:41] Python, Futs, which is Bill, foot, foot, foot, foot, and rudder.

[20:45] I had great mentors and teachers.

[20:48] These guys made a lot of money for Williams.

[20:50] They allowed some of us to come in and get design positions.

[20:53] We were paid fairly well.

[20:55] We used ideas for these senior designers and off we go.

[20:59] Imagine sitting down and working with those, those greats even today.

[21:03] But these guys were at the top of their game in sort of the late 80s, early 90s.

[21:10] Like everything was a hit.

[21:12] Everything was selling.

[21:13] They got all the licenses they wanted.

[21:14] They had a powerful system at Williams when it came to computer programming and everything.

[21:20] This was, this was, this was it.

[21:22] This is the time that J. Pop is learning from those designers.

[21:27] Now, it wasn't until February of 1994, basically four years, that John Popadook would release

[21:33] his first pinball machine as a lead designer.

[21:38] That machine is World Cup Soccer.

[21:40] It is a licensed sporting event theme.

[21:44] It's basically a soccer game.

[21:46] It's from February of 94.

[21:48] It's a Williams WPC-S.

[21:51] It sells 8,743 units.

[21:55] That is astronomical.

[21:58] The art by Kevin O'Connor.

[22:01] Music and sound by Vince Pantarelli.

[22:03] Dots by Eugene Greer and Scotch Slooney.

[22:07] And software by the great Larry D'Amara and Matt Corrali.

[22:12] Corral.

[22:13] This is a great game.

[22:15] I love this game.

[22:16] Super exciting.

[22:17] I play this game quite regularly.

[22:19] It's the first security game.

[22:21] Do you know what that means?

[22:23] No.

[22:24] So that's the WPC-S.

[22:25] Yeah, WPC-S.

[22:28] They started putting a security chip on the CPU.

[22:31] So you couldn't use the CPU and other games, different titles.

[22:35] Oh, so you couldn't like, if you had a machine went down, you couldn't switch the boards?

[22:40] Like I couldn't just put different software.

[22:42] I couldn't just change out the ROM on the CPU board and have it be another game.

[22:46] You'd have to change out the security chip also.

[22:48] Oh my.

[22:49] Yeah.

[22:50] It was very Nintendo.

[22:51] Nintendo did that with their cartridges.

[22:53] Well, J-Pop says, World Cup soccer took 10 years to get made.

[22:57] By the time I was at Bali, I did lots of prototypes of whitewoods.

[23:01] And then we got bought by Williams.

[23:03] I was at Williams for a while and got let go.

[23:05] And then I got higher back.

[23:06] I didn't know it was going to be World Cup.

[23:08] It was just a Bali game.

[23:10] But I didn't give up.

[23:11] And you know, it just kind of came out.

[23:13] So if I had given up, I wouldn't have had games made.

[23:15] I wouldn't have had anything made.

[23:17] Persistence is key when it comes to sort of breaking in as a designer, right?

[23:22] There's very few jobs.

[23:24] There are sort of an elite closed group of manufacturers, especially more now, with

[23:30] just Bali at Williams as opposed to Bali Midway in Williams.

[23:34] So persistence is key and that pays off even to today.

[23:38] And the story on this is, he was helped out a lot by Larry DeMar in this game.

[23:44] Because I guess the original concept of the game as far as, if you played it, you score

[23:49] goals and you get to the World Cup final and you try to be Germany.

[23:53] None of that was like the original concept as far as the rules went.

[23:57] But Larry DeMar kind of stepped in and helped out with that part.

[24:01] Yeah, he really, really put the sharp point on the pencil with this game and really made

[24:07] it something special and interesting, not just shoot goals to the, to the bash toy.

[24:12] And Tim Kittsrow, the voice of the game.

[24:15] I love that guy.

[24:16] No one is the end of him all the time.

[24:18] We talk about him all the time.

[24:19] He is one of the greatest pinball voiceover artists, definitely.

[24:23] If you've ever played World Cup soccer and his callouts don't get you excited, then you

[24:27] should play something else.

[24:29] You're never going to get excited.

[24:31] I play this in my league weekly.

[24:34] I have a friend of mine picked this up not too long ago and I, when I go over, I play

[24:38] this one a lot because I really like experimenting, figuring out, playing around.

[24:43] And it's the callouts that I find myself repeating a lot with his gravitas, right?

[24:52] It's so much fun to just be immersed in the shenanigans that is World Cup soccer.

[25:00] Because it's way over the top.

[25:01] Oh, I love when the goalie keeps blocking you.

[25:03] This guy is a wall.

[25:04] He just hit him over and over.

[25:06] Oh, you got the flyer up.

[25:09] Here's the funny thing.

[25:10] We're looking at the flyer right now for World Cup soccer.

[25:13] It's the biggest game in the world.

[25:15] World Cup soccer.

[25:17] Because the World Cup was in the US in 1994.

[25:20] And that was the idea.

[25:21] This is actually a licensed theme.

[25:24] The dog is a license.

[25:26] He was the official mascot of the 94 World Cup.

[25:30] Do you know his name?

[25:31] No.

[25:32] It's all over the game.

[25:34] Striker.

[25:35] Oh, yes.

[25:36] Striker, the World Cup pup.

[25:38] I love that.

[25:40] But if you look at the flyer we're looking at, they show soldier field in Chicago, which

[25:45] is where some of the games happen.

[25:47] But the funny thing is, if you look at the fields, you can tell it's during a football

[25:51] game.

[25:52] Oh, yeah, it is a hurry of football game.

[25:53] Whoops.

[25:54] I always thought that was funny.

[25:56] Like, here's World Cup soccer.

[25:58] Let's watch some American football hall.

[26:00] Yes, it's the wrong kind of football, but it's football nonetheless.

[26:04] You could see by the flyer, you see how it's got gold legs.

[26:07] Yes.

[26:08] It had like gold ax and gold legs.

[26:10] The main habit trail and it's all gold.

[26:12] Yeah, because the World Cup like that.

[26:15] Trophy is like this gold thing.

[26:16] The problem is the gold plating on the habit trail just falls off.

[26:19] Like mine isn't even gold anymore.

[26:21] It's just lost all its color.

[26:23] I didn't even notice on the game that I played that it was gold at all.

[26:28] So that's how funny that that is.

[26:30] I don't think I've even noticed.

[26:32] Did you know it kicks like a soccer ball?

[26:34] It's a game with over a billion passionate fans.

[26:38] The game with more thrills, action and upsets than any other.

[26:41] It's World Cup soccer and this summer it's coming to the United States.

[26:46] Wow.

[26:47] Oh, yeah.

[26:48] This, this game is when we, I've heard Zack Mini of the pinball network and

[26:54] Flippano pinball talk about this from time to time.

[26:57] He describes John Papaduke as whimsical as, as wizard like with his ramps and

[27:03] the way things flow and divert and move around.

[27:08] And this game is exactly that.

[27:11] Oh, yeah, we got it.

[27:12] So when you look at like the ball lock on the left side, shoot a ramp.

[27:15] You could shoot either left or the right ramp and based on a diverter.

[27:19] So a coil will engage.

[27:21] It will close a route and open another route.

[27:23] And the ball will zip around into the left habit trailer, the left plastic ramp.

[27:31] And then there's a magnet on like an ultra mini play field that will just turn on and

[27:35] grab the ball and then send it to the left as opposed to down the ramp and it will lock

[27:41] that ball.

[27:42] And the right ramps probably, you want to smooth the shooting ramps ever made.

[27:46] Oh, beautiful.

[27:47] And they're huge that the ramps themselves, if you take them out, my god, they're like

[27:51] big, long pieces and they usually get trashed.

[27:56] Mine are trashed.

[27:57] Especially if they were dirty, right?

[27:58] Like the ball just would scuff them up really, really bad.

[28:02] It has a cool soccer ball, an actual three-dimensional, like a soccer ball that spins, like half a soccer

[28:08] ball in the middle of the play field that spins.

[28:11] And this is an odd thing.

[28:13] So I had seen this soccer ball.

[28:15] It's up by the pop bumpers in the top side and it's almost a full size soccer ball.

[28:19] It's like a kid's side soccer ball.

[28:21] And at times it will just sit there.

[28:24] Other times it will spin and kind of bounce the ball in kind of random directions.

[28:29] At first I didn't think it was a great idea.

[28:31] That's great.

[28:32] But as I've played the game, I'm like, wow, this actually works really well.

[28:36] It spins both ways, both directions, and it has a, I think an opto.

[28:40] It can detect when a pinball hits the ball.

[28:44] Huh.

[28:45] Yep.

[28:46] So if you, most of the time, it spins towards the goal unless you're at the World Cup

[28:51] final, then it spins against you.

[28:53] The soccer ball is something really, really unique and something that has never been

[28:57] done like that before.

[28:59] So at the gate we've got something really interesting and different.

[29:04] And then we have a goalie, which is really just a upside down stand-up target with a, like

[29:09] the picture of the goalie in front, like riveted on.

[29:12] And the goalie, the goalie is actually a friend of John Papaducs.

[29:17] Like the picture, picture of the artist.

[29:20] The picture, yep.

[29:21] It's got a great mullet by the way.

[29:22] He asked his friend for a picture and a game of picture.

[29:25] And then the friend, like, however long it took them to make the game, all of a sudden,

[29:28] like, hey, that's me.

[29:29] I'm the goalie.

[29:30] So the goalie basically sits in literally a, a, a, a, a, a soccer net.

[29:37] And it just sort of flicks kind of back and forth.

[29:40] And it opens up kind of a third of the play field.

[29:43] And then he's kind of in the middle.

[29:44] And then he's on the other third and he sort of zips back and forth.

[29:47] The ball will go into sort of like a trough and then down into a vertical up kicker,

[29:53] which will pop the ball up onto a wire form habit trail or a wire form ramp down to the

[29:59] right flip.

[30:00] Yep.

[30:01] Which is simulating a strike or kicking the ball at you.

[30:04] Yeah, exactly.

[30:05] It's, it's you're kicking it into the net.

[30:08] Then, you know, it's on the side and they're kicking it back into play.

[30:12] And this flyer demonstrates another pop-a-duc trademark that he had.

[30:17] I think I'm pretty much all his games.

[30:19] Can you identify it?

[30:20] Yes, I can.

[30:21] They're saying, I know you're, you're saying, you're unique.

[30:25] It's a unique plunger features a unique new pinball grip.

[30:31] Basically for his, the shooter rod instead of the typical, like end of the shooter rod,

[30:37] his is like a ball.

[30:38] So instead of it being the sort of standard Valley Williams kind of black shooter rod that's

[30:43] flat on one side, this is, this is like a ball.

[30:46] Yep, it's like a ball and he would use this.

[30:48] I think it pretty much all his games have this.

[30:51] It's a, it's a definitely, when I think of John Papa Duke, it's like, once I see that,

[30:55] that shooter knob, it's like, oh, it's a Papa Duke game.

[30:58] I like, I never knew they actually advertise it in the flyer though.

[31:01] It's like a unique new pinball grip.

[31:03] Ooh, it's, it's unique and new.

[31:06] And it's always gray.

[31:07] When it comes to the art style, it's very, very cool as well.

[31:12] It's very purple and it matches the theme perfectly.

[31:15] And it, it really, really does.

[31:17] But one thing that I do not like about this game, the magnet, yes, it is the worst magnet

[31:25] save of all time.

[31:28] Yeah.

[31:29] Because I always forget it's there and I never use it because it's in such a stupid

[31:34] place.

[31:35] So your flippers are basically the opposing team's goal or your goal, right?

[31:41] And you have a goalie sitting in front of there that's got his hand in the air and

[31:46] he's stopping the pinball.

[31:49] But the magnet save is not where it usually or normally is, which is on the outlay and

[31:54] so you have a moment to react.

[31:57] It's almost right above your flippers kind of slightly to the left.

[32:01] Yeah, the left.

[32:02] Why does this not work?

[32:03] Because, but the only time you would use it in, in actually trying to save something

[32:08] from going down the middle, if you shoot the left ramp and it doesn't make it up and

[32:11] starts coming down, but the problem is the magnet is not strong enough.

[32:14] It'll just blow right by the magnet every time.

[32:17] So it only works with a really slow moving ball.

[32:19] So for actually anything coming down the middle fast, it's useless.

[32:23] It's a really cool idea and concept like, hey, instead of the magnet saves on the side,

[32:28] I'm going to put it in kind of the middle.

[32:31] But in practice, it is terrible.

[32:34] Every once in a blue moon, you can save a slow moving ball with it.

[32:38] But you'll probably forget the button is there by that point and you'll drain any

[32:41] way.

[32:42] Right.

[32:43] So for me, it's like, oh, I'm going, the only time it ever really goes down the middle is

[32:46] when there's like no saving it, like it is literally right down the middle.

[32:50] Or I'm going for like a drop catch or I'm going for a dead bounce.

[32:55] So a drop catch is when your flipper is up and then you kind of cradle the ball when

[32:58] it comes down almost catching it.

[33:00] A dead bounce is when you leave your flipper down and the ball comes down and bounces from

[33:04] one flipper and you kind of over to the other and you kind of cradle it there.

[33:10] But when I go to like do a dead bounce and I've misjudged where the ball is coming, I

[33:14] don't have enough time in my brain to think, hit the magnet save because you're, you

[33:18] miss the ball.

[33:19] It just goes in the middle.

[33:21] So it's, it's completely useless.

[33:23] Yeah.

[33:24] And everyone's in a blue moon, you can use it.

[33:26] So it's not completely useless.

[33:28] The other weird thing about this game from a technical standpoint, I was going to throw

[33:31] a weird tech thing in.

[33:33] He uses all the, the wedge style sockets, like throughout the game.

[33:38] I don't know why it's like they tried it on this game.

[33:42] It's not on later games.

[33:43] And by that, I mean like, like say the lights underneath the in lanes are usually always

[33:47] bayonet style.

[33:48] It bay bayonet being like the ones you turn it into.

[33:51] You turn.

[33:52] Yeah, you twist it in.

[33:54] All the sockets were all the wedge style, 555.

[33:57] You just kind of plug them in.

[33:58] You just kind of get it.

[33:59] Yeah, which causes kind of a pain in that the lights don't stay in as well.

[34:04] And sometimes they come out.

[34:05] You can actually, we're looking at a picture.

[34:06] You can actually see them, the sockets in the in lanes.

[34:09] They're not all in.

[34:10] They might pop out.

[34:11] It's just weird that they did it in this game and they didn't do it.

[34:14] I've had games made by Wames after this and they just abandoned it.

[34:17] So most of it's something they were playing around with.

[34:20] How about the skill shot?

[34:23] That's another, I would say J-pop identifier.

[34:27] He loves the skill shot, like some kind of apparatus.

[34:31] And this is the first, obviously, his first game is the first time the coin toss.

[34:35] You hit it, it comes around like a little reverse.

[34:39] Like a 180.

[34:40] 180 and you just got a skillfully plunge.

[34:45] And how hard do you plunge?

[34:46] Well, determine which little space it goes in and there's three spaces.

[34:50] And eventually by all the balls, you want to get all three.

[34:52] You want to get all three because it will light a world cup letter.

[34:57] So let's, okay, now you're getting into code.

[34:58] So this is where the sort of the shine of this game really comes through.

[35:05] And that's with somebody like the legend Larry DeMar.

[35:08] So what are your kind of objectives when it comes to World Cup soccer?

[35:11] It kind of makes it unique, right?

[35:13] Your objective is to win the World Cup.

[35:15] America has to vanquish the world.

[35:17] Well, they, you can pick your own team.

[35:20] I don't know how many people realize that.

[35:21] It's not something that's at the beginning of the game.

[35:24] You can go into the settings and choose any team you want.

[35:27] I think except Germany because they were the World Cup champion.

[35:30] But you can pick other countries.

[35:32] So when you win, it'll say like US wins or Italy wins or whatever.

[35:38] But you're playing against Germany because they were the previous World Cup champion in 1990.

[35:44] So you're trying to beat them and become the new World Cup champion.

[35:47] That's the basic wizard mode, I would say.

[35:53] And if you get to, you have to spell World Cup.

[35:56] If you spell World Cup when you get, it'll say,

[35:59] you hit the hardest shot in all pinball to hit, the final draw scoop, which is so hard to hit.

[36:06] It will start the World Cup final and it'll just start firing balls out at you.

[36:10] Like you, well, actually, it doesn't have an auto launcher.

[36:12] But you will get, I think it's a five ball multi ball and you just have to keep hitting the goal.

[36:17] And they keep scoring against you back and forth and you need to beat Germany.

[36:23] So you can get all the way to the wizard mode and you could still lose.

[36:26] You can lose the Germany if you don't score enough goals.

[36:28] Do United States won the 1994 World Cup?

[36:32] No, no, we've never won a World Cup.

[36:34] That was Brazil, Brazil won.

[36:37] Yes, runners up where Italy, very, very cool.

[36:41] It's Canada's in the World Cup soccer World Cup, the FIFA World Cup this time.

[36:47] So that's a big deal.

[36:48] Us getting in is a big, big, big deal competing against these European and South Americans.

[36:52] It's a big, big deal.

[36:54] Yeah.

[36:54] Yeah.

[36:55] We just cut the ball and maple syrup like we usually do because then it goes a lot quicker.

[36:59] You'd probably do good with the fights too.

[37:01] One of the most interesting things that I stumbled upon when I was doing the research was

[37:08] a way back in one of our first episodes.

[37:12] I listened to a lot of John Norris, who is the patron saint of pinball.

[37:15] And he basically sort of threw a little bit of shade on World Cup with Gottlieb's World Challenge Soccer.

[37:25] Well, John says, John of Gottlieb, fame, he says six months before the 1994 World Cup, we went for a license.

[37:32] We learned Williams was making a World Cup soccer game.

[37:35] We had six weeks of production.

[37:36] We needed to fill with a little production run.

[37:39] We decided to take a design, car hop, switch it over,

[37:43] add a couple wire ramps and steal some thunder from Williams game.

[37:46] We only wanted to make 1200, but we up production because of demand.

[37:50] Gottlieb, premier at the time was able to actually just bang out machine after machine after machine.

[37:58] They were just a manufacturing powerhouse.

[38:00] They didn't have the 12 to 18 month turnover cycle that a lot of these designers had.

[38:06] So they were able to get World Cup out.

[38:08] They were able to get them into bars quicker at a lower price point.

[38:12] And they stole quite a few of the sales that probably would have gone to the Williams game.

[38:19] In John's first game, he sells 8,743 units, which is astronomical.

[38:27] When we look at all those other kind of first timers with Dennis Norben in the last episode,

[38:33] it was like 3,000 was a big deal.

[38:35] We are on the peak of the peak when it comes to these games.

[38:40] And this is where we start rolling down that death of pinball hill.

[38:45] Yeah, it didn't do the 10,000 that a huge one would do at the time.

[38:49] But 8,000 today, 8,000 would be insane.

[38:53] Anyone would love 8,000 games today.

[38:55] Yeah, absolutely.

[38:56] But when you're learning with all of these folks,

[39:00] there's a lot of learning curves that you go through when it comes to design.

[39:04] Don't put a magnet to save it, a dumb place, that kind of stuff.

[39:08] But John also did a lot of really good things when he worked at Williams.

[39:12] Well, he says, if I did anything well at Williams,

[39:15] was just the ability to work with the team and pick themes.

[39:18] We were able to go and kind of find themes that hadn't been done in a long time and bring those up.

[39:23] John's really good at themes that have a wide spectrum of interest, right?

[39:32] So race cars and rock bands and military are all kind of man themes.

[39:39] But when you get into some of the themes that Jay Pop is doing,

[39:42] those have a much wider breadth and reach.

[39:46] Kind of like when you look at George Gomez, right?

[39:48] A lot of his games are, yeah, they're macho-y,

[39:51] but they also kind of have a fun, interesting kind of spin on them as well.

[39:57] Being able to do that means that you're able to sell more units.

[40:01] John's themes are really like sort of magic and circus and fairy tale and really,

[40:09] really, again, let's tie that back whimsical.

[40:11] I'm surprised he didn't end up at Jersey Jack, especially the early days.

[40:14] What had been perfect for his philosophy?

[40:17] Games were designed to make money.

[40:19] They had to be on time.

[40:21] They had to be above average in earnings.

[40:23] And all of your success was easily measured in those numbers.

[40:29] How much money did it make?

[40:31] How many did you sell?

[40:33] What was the profit margin?

[40:34] Those are very, very easy measurables.

[40:39] Well, Jay Pop didn't really fit into that system very well.

[40:43] This system was quick and refined.

[40:46] It was like a well-oiled machine.

[40:48] Jay Pop was much slower, more calculated in his designs,

[40:52] and that of course would cause problems.

[40:56] He said in fact that he had to be broken down by the Williams management and those around

[41:01] him and built back up to withstand the stress and pressure of the Williams philosophy.

[41:09] Bally was much softer where Williams would come right out and tell you, you sucked and

[41:14] you had to try harder.

[41:16] It was designed to get the best out of people.

[41:19] And we've spoke about that Williams pressure cooker and the Shark Tank quite regularly

[41:24] on our podcast.

[41:26] This brings us to I think my favorite Jay Pop game for a few reasons.

[41:34] Okay.

[41:35] Okay, so I'll, next hour we'll be talking about this.

[41:39] Okay.

[41:40] We're talking about the theater of magic.

[41:44] This is a magic theme or theater theme, I guess if you want to or whatever.

[41:52] It's March of 1995.

[41:54] So about a year later, it's another WPCS system.

[41:58] It sells 6,600 units.

[42:00] So a lot less.

[42:02] The art is by Linda Deal, the music and sound by Dave Zabrisky, dots by Adam Ryan, Brian

[42:08] Morris, mechanics by Jack Scallon and Ernie Pizarro, software by Jeff Johnson.

[42:17] So we've got a very new group here.

[42:22] This is, we don't have any staples.

[42:24] We've got kind of all new hitters here when it comes to this game.

[42:29] So we're going to get I think something very different.

[42:33] Theater of magic is awesome.

[42:34] I like it.

[42:36] You like it.

[42:37] It's not awesome.

[42:38] You just like it.

[42:39] It's good.

[42:40] I mean, it's magic.

[42:41] It's so good.

[42:42] I don't care what you say.

[42:44] This game is awesome.

[42:45] And I am blown away that Chicago gaming has not done this as a remake.

[42:51] I don't get it.

[42:53] It is so good.

[42:54] It'll probably be coming.

[42:56] But we have the skill shot, which is a whole separate piece in typical Papa Duke fashion.

[43:03] Yeah.

[43:04] So instead of this weird kind of contraption on the side, it's like you go up into and

[43:08] you go down to the ramp and it goes right down to your right flipper instead of like

[43:12] into an orbit.

[43:13] But it's kind of fancy as well, right?

[43:15] It's super smooth ramps, magnets, cool trunk mechanism.

[43:21] It's got the greatest change state toy I've probably ever made.

[43:24] The Tiger saw that I think was originally supposed to actually move, but that was

[43:29] costed out super flowy.

[43:32] It is super flowy.

[43:34] Super flowy.

[43:35] This you're shooting this ball and it's coming right back to your flippers and you're

[43:38] just like, ah, yeah.

[43:40] Here we go.

[43:41] Woo.

[43:42] And it's got the thing that pops up from the play field.

[43:43] I don't remember if it has a name.

[43:45] It's like a trunk.

[43:46] No, like a cell, it's like the cellar maybe.

[43:49] And it's the trunk.

[43:50] The trunk is a big thing.

[43:51] It's the big toy.

[43:52] The basement, haunted basement.

[43:54] There you go.

[43:55] It's like a trap door into the haunted basement.

[43:59] The, the stand out for this game, I think is really the art design and theme, the direction.

[44:06] And to deal, you know, one of the few females in pinball, really I think does a heck of

[44:13] a job of taking the play field elements, putting them into the back glass and just making

[44:20] it seem like David Copperfield-esque, right?

[44:24] It's a female magician.

[44:26] She's got tigers and cards and lions and explosions and it's cool.

[44:32] It's super cool.

[44:33] But let's, let's kind of start at the first here.

[44:35] Let's take a look at the flyer.

[44:38] It just says, there's more.

[44:40] That's all it says.

[44:42] There's more.

[44:43] It's kind of a crab.

[44:44] And you've got to open the flyer, I guess, or flip it over.

[44:46] There we go.

[44:47] Oh, lots of words.

[44:49] It's got the magic touch theater of magic.

[44:54] Oh, you got to say it like Tom Cruise Kissroom.

[44:57] Oh, the theater of magic.

[45:01] They're exactly.

[45:02] It's got very, you know, Williams is always funny because they always go away over the

[45:07] top with their flyers.

[45:09] But they've got four images of kind of the neat elements.

[45:13] One of them being this, what they call the spirit ring, which on the ramp, the left ramp,

[45:19] you can shoot the ball up and it comes back to your left flipper from the right ramp.

[45:24] But there's this hovering sort of magnetic ring and it will suck the ball up off of the

[45:30] ramp and then drop it onto another habit trail wire form that crosses the playfield goes

[45:37] to the other side to your right flipper.

[45:42] And then above it, it has presto.

[45:44] I'm just trying to figure out what that first word is in their text.

[45:48] I have to zoom in more.

[45:49] I can't stir soups.

[45:51] Is it stupendous?

[45:52] Stupendous, yeah.

[45:53] Oh, yeah.

[45:54] Stupendous, okay.

[45:55] So I guess it wasn't that.

[45:56] Stupendous displays the spellbinding power.

[46:00] Amazing acts of enchantment and incredible achievements in pinball engineering.

[46:06] It's all inside theater of magic, trade park.

[46:11] The game is not something typical and that's what I think is really, really cool.

[46:16] It's not cars and rock bands and, you know, blowing stuff up and high speed action, but

[46:23] it has all of those elements in an interesting and kind of fun theme.

[46:30] But this sort of new crew, the dots team, the art team and the rules and stuff, they all

[46:36] kind of come together really well as a team.

[46:40] And they all bring something that's very, very different when it comes to flavor compared

[46:46] to all of the design teams before them.

[46:49] Now Brian Morris, one of the dots guys there, he was hired around the same time as Adam

[46:55] Ryan and they were brought in after the Williams gaming layoffs when Eugene Jarvis and Scott

[47:03] Slominy were promoted.

[47:04] So they were no longer able to do sort of the basic programming.

[47:08] They were now sort of in a management.

[47:10] So this is Adam Ryan talking about Brian Morris.

[47:12] He is a guy from Chicago.

[47:14] We saw quite a few people.

[47:15] I was there for a lot of the interviews.

[47:17] He's a fantastic.artist.

[47:18] A really great and warm guy.

[47:20] I think he's the only person in my entire life who I saw interview while wearing sandals

[47:24] and still got the job.

[47:26] Impressive.

[47:27] People say John Papadu, because he's kind of weird.

[47:29] He's a bit different, right?

[47:31] Well, the team that he's kind of surrounded with are obviously kind of weird and different

[47:35] people too.

[47:36] And you can tell when you look at the games that were released around this time, how kind

[47:40] of quirky and different theater of magic was, which I think is kind of a disappointment

[47:44] as to how many machines it sold, only about 6,600.

[47:49] The development cycle around this game was quite stressful for John Papadu.

[47:54] He would actually take a little bit of time off to just sort of take a vacation.

[47:58] And as people like Keith L. Winnoe, today's Stern Pinball Inc.

[48:03] Taking time off is not really a thing you get to do.

[48:07] Well, Jay Popp says, you take two days off and when you got back, your manager would

[48:11] say you needed to talk to you.

[48:12] What happened was while you were away, a group of people, other designers, management engineers

[48:16] would look over your game and say, we don't like this on your game.

[48:19] We like you to change it.

[48:20] I was a new designer and I had to deal with that.

[48:22] Yeah, that's a lot of pressure, right?

[48:24] Like, oh, you're not going to want to put that on there.

[48:26] It's going to break.

[48:27] Oh, you can't put that on there.

[48:29] That's not going to earn money, right?

[48:32] Or there's like a level of jealousy in the shark tank, right?

[48:35] That's a good idea.

[48:36] What did I think of that?

[48:37] You know, so there's a lot of politics being played at the time.

[48:40] So the more, if you take two days off, you know, you got to prepare for when you get back,

[48:46] the politics you got to play when you get there.

[48:48] This is the second game that Jay Popp has actually officially released and he's really

[48:53] starting to build on his design philosophy of kind of the whimsical, interesting bits

[48:58] and pieces.

[48:59] Jay Popp says, I often go back decades and look at older games, nostalgia or old great pinball

[49:06] stuff that had been forgotten and just add new things.

[49:11] So he's taking kind of things that have been done and then mixing them with kind of the

[49:15] new.

[49:16] And you can see that in a lot of his design elements.

[49:21] We often describe Williams as a machine, right, Ron?

[49:24] They were just an absolute brute when it came to manufacturing.

[49:28] Mm-hmm.

[49:29] Yeah, they had massive teams, 30 to 40 people as resources per game.

[49:33] For example, Jay Popp says, in the old days, we would take it down to the cable department,

[49:38] say draw this, get this updated and that was it.

[49:41] It was done.

[49:42] You just with this, with this bruise of a manufacturer, the designer kind of goes down

[49:47] to a team of people and just says, hey, I got, you know, I got to do this.

[49:50] And then it just appears.

[49:52] And I think the greatest example of, hey, I got, I got this idea.

[49:56] I need it to be built.

[49:58] I needed to be designed.

[49:59] Here's some images and pictures is the theater of magic trunk.

[50:05] This is a change state toy.

[50:08] And what do I mean by change state?

[50:10] It has multiple states.

[50:12] And it changes.

[50:13] I figured that out all by myself.

[50:15] Good for you.

[50:16] Who says the American education system's not great?

[50:19] Oh.

[50:20] What's cool about the trunk and change state is that it will rotate and move and there's

[50:24] different things at different parts of the trunk.

[50:28] And the way it works is that, you know, everybody knows the old trunk tricks in magic, right?

[50:36] The magician assistant goes into the trunk.

[50:38] He goes to the abracadabra and then the individual inside the trunk is gone or they cut the trunk

[50:44] in half or the trunk is like iconic.

[50:47] This trunk is a bash toy.

[50:49] So you shoot the ball and it hits it, right?

[50:51] That's the thing.

[50:52] You hit it so many times and then it'll turn 90 degrees and show you another side,

[50:57] a hole or a scoop and then you shoot the ball into the scoop and then there's like a

[51:02] little subway system and it kind of pops up and goes out around behind the ramps and

[51:06] kind of comes out again.

[51:08] And then it'll rotate in the other direction and it will have a magnet on the side, which

[51:12] will when you shoot it, it will catch it, hold them ball and rotate in behind, drop the

[51:19] ball into the kind of the secret hole in the back and then rotate back and it's like,

[51:23] it disappeared like that.

[51:24] You don't see it drop.

[51:25] It's just it's gone.

[51:26] Where did it go, Ron?

[51:29] It went into the basement because it's going to come out that basement thingy.

[51:32] Right.

[51:33] The pop up and eject, right?

[51:36] It did the trap.

[51:37] Which makes a certain squeaking noise on every theater magic I've ever played.

[51:42] It's literally the noise it makes.

[51:44] This is the greatest toy of all time.

[51:46] But I don't think this kind of toy is something that John Papadu could develop by himself.

[51:56] He needed a strategic team of engineers and designers to make something that would withhold

[52:03] the ball hitting it all the time, the rotation stuff, the magnet wiring, all that stuff.

[52:11] We found out a couple of episodes ago that Lyman Sheets actually worked on the prototyping

[52:16] programming for testing the mechanics to this crate.

[52:23] So the crate would sit in a test fixture and a ball would get smashed against it like

[52:27] a million times and it was Lyman who worked on that.

[52:30] It's a really awesome game.

[52:32] I'm surprised I don't have one.

[52:34] Actually, I'm not.

[52:35] It's super expensive and it's more expensive now than it's ever been.

[52:39] But it has a lot of kind of flaws in the code, right?

[52:42] Yeah.

[52:43] One of those flaws.

[52:45] You can hit the left orbit and go into the lanes and just get the multiplier and it never

[52:50] ends.

[52:51] Just keep increasing it over and over and over and over.

[52:55] It's not the greatest tournament game.

[52:57] For whole abuse, it's fine.

[53:00] You shoot the left lane and it goes up into a capture hall.

[53:02] It pops out into the lanes.

[53:04] It comes back down to the right flipper and you just repeat, repeat, repeat until you're

[53:09] winning.

[53:10] I love this game.

[53:11] I wish I had one of these.

[53:13] It's not going to be cheap.

[53:16] What's that?

[53:17] The game.

[53:18] Oh yeah, oh God no.

[53:19] That's something a lot of Papa Deux like this title and then one more about to talk

[53:23] about and the one we're going to talk about after the hat.

[53:25] They ain't cheap.

[53:26] They sell for a ton of money now.

[53:29] It's a big, big deal.

[53:31] His next game was Tales of the Arabian Knights, often called Totten.

[53:37] It's a mystic fantasy Middle Eastern theme.

[53:40] It's from May of 1996.

[53:43] This is a WPC 95 machine.

[53:45] It sells 3128 units.

[53:49] You can see we are tumbling down that hill fast, art by Pat McMahon, music and sound

[53:56] by Dave Zabrisky, dots by Adam Ryan and Brian Morris in software by Louis Carzac.

[54:03] This we covered in our MECs that made us episode I believe.

[54:08] But it's based on the Arabian Knights, which is the English version of the Arabic language

[54:15] collection of Middle Eastern folktales known as 1000 and one Knights.

[54:20] It is a very interesting and strange theme when it comes to pinball because at this time

[54:27] we're getting games like no fear and Indy 500.

[54:35] Elvira is coming out here in another year or so.

[54:38] This is a really kind of stand out weird game.

[54:42] Here's a quote from me.

[54:43] I would argue though most people know what a genie is.

[54:48] Yeah, it's an unlicensed theme but it's a theme that's like, oh yeah, totally, everybody

[54:52] gets that.

[54:53] Well, Adam Ryan says, I like that kind of theme.

[54:56] I like the Middle Eastern theme.

[54:57] Little more flair to the visuals.

[54:59] The music was very good in that game.

[55:01] I think it's just a pleasure.

[55:02] Papa Duke was just a great guy to work with.

[55:07] We spoke a little bit about this game in a previous episode.

[55:12] Is there anything that you kind of that sticks out here that you really like?

[55:17] Just like most of his games, they shoot really good.

[55:20] Nice flowy, long flowy plastic ramps.

[55:24] Another cool skill shot.

[55:26] This time it's a sword and you try to charm the right snake so you don't get bit.

[55:33] Yeah, you have three little baskets.

[55:35] You got to shoot it into the right basket.

[55:37] And then you have the genie.

[55:38] It's the actual genie on the play field.

[55:41] Bash toy.

[55:42] You hit it.

[55:43] It's got the magnet stops it and the magnet drops into the play field.

[55:47] They've taken that theater of magic ring that sucks the ball off the ramp.

[55:53] But instead of it being horizontal, now it's vertical.

[55:58] And it's like the genie is throwing a fireball back at you.

[56:03] So it sucks it off the ramp, drops it onto a wire form just like it didn't theater of

[56:07] magic and it goes back down to the right flipper.

[56:10] But it's like the genie is catching the ball and throwing it back at you on fire.

[56:15] God, it's so cool.

[56:18] This is so cool.

[56:20] If you want more of the details, please go back to the other episode.

[56:22] But there's a couple of other pieces I want to pull in to this episode because I found

[56:26] some quotes in a later interview with John Papaduke where he spoke about this game.

[56:32] And it was all about gauging success.

[56:34] When I spoke about this a moment ago, games had to earn money and they had to have above

[56:40] average earnings.

[56:41] They didn't get that.

[56:43] You were not going to keep your job and you were not going to sell games.

[56:48] J-Pop says, I get feedback on that game.

[56:51] This rule is bad or this rule sucks.

[56:54] But at the time it was the best game we could make in that time frame.

[56:57] The game worked very well upwards of $350 to $400 a day.

[57:01] That's crazy.

[57:03] $350 to $400 a day.

[57:06] And this is like in 1996 or 1994?

[57:10] What was this?

[57:11] 1996.

[57:12] Yeah, this is in 1996.

[57:14] So $400 a day.

[57:17] And we'll do what maybe we'll do 330 days a year because there's holidays.

[57:22] That game is making $132,000.

[57:24] I'm thinking after the initial couple of months it's going to die down a bit.

[57:28] But yes, wholly moly.

[57:30] What do you think games earn today?

[57:31] I think most of them are in homes so they don't earn anything.

[57:35] Yeah.

[57:36] Yeah.

[57:37] How true is that?

[57:38] Now, the battles we spoke about that a moment ago, the battles of the warring teams, will

[57:42] this game had a lot of battles and they were around the spinning lamp mech.

[57:48] So there's a spinner in the middle of the play field.

[57:51] And on top of that is the lamp and you hit it and it spins around and it's got leaf

[57:56] switches underneath the kind of move around and count that.

[57:59] And we've talked about before about taking stuff from older games.

[58:03] That is that is from older games.

[58:06] There are lots of old EMs that have like the little spinner toy.

[58:09] Like usually have a couple posts and you just hit them and the thing spins around.

[58:13] That's literally what the lamp is.

[58:15] It just has a plastic piece on top.

[58:17] But this they've kind of taken it up a level, taken an old idea and updated it.

[58:21] Yeah.

[58:22] And it's done really.

[58:23] No matter how cool it is, it was probably on some EM somewhere.

[58:26] Yes.

[58:27] No one will upset the EM folks that listened to the podcast here.

[58:30] Boy, they send me the hate mail.

[58:32] Yeah, to you, not to me.

[58:34] I love EMs.

[58:35] They do.

[58:36] They specifically call me out.

[58:37] Yeah.

[58:38] Yeah.

[58:39] But the thing is I cut out all your hate for EMs.

[58:41] So I just, it's all about being a puppet master.

[58:43] I love EMs.

[58:44] Yeah.

[58:46] This brings us to the game that I think probably gets the highest dollar value of any, well,

[58:52] kind of of any J-pop game.

[58:56] And that is Circus Voltaire.

[58:58] It's a Circus Carnival theme.

[59:00] It's from October of 1997.

[59:02] It's a WPC 95.

[59:05] It sells 2,704 units.

[59:08] This is designed by John Papadouk with Cameron Silver, art by Linda Deal, dots by Adam

[59:14] Ryan and Brian Morris.

[59:15] Again, music and sound by Rob Barry and Dave Zabrisky and software by Cameron Silver,

[59:21] who's kind of a newcomer to the Valley Williams around this time.

[59:26] He's Australian.

[59:27] Yes.

[59:28] I'll bring in some Cameron Silver stuff in a couple of the other episodes that we do.

[59:32] Some of the bits and pieces about Circus Voltaire is that it is kind of a really over

[59:39] the top kind of strange, I don't even know.

[59:44] It's like he can't explain it.

[59:45] He's lost for words, which takes a lot for me to be, I mean, a circus, but it's spelled

[59:50] wrong.

[59:51] Is that like the Canadian spelling of Circus or something?

[59:54] It's like French-ish.

[59:55] It's spelled the S-E-I-R-Q-U-S.

[59:58] Circus Voltaire.

[01:00:01] It has this we talked about in Mechs that made us.

[01:00:04] We did a huge deep dive into all the crazy mechanics and pieces of that.

[01:00:08] We're not going to retread on that as much as I think that this is a really cool game.

[01:00:13] Not one that I would own for a few reasons.

[01:00:15] The outlines kind of suck as well as it's really outrageously expensive.

[01:00:20] And again, I want to pull in some pieces that I discovered from other sources that I

[01:00:25] saw and I was able to bring that in.

[01:00:27] Well, Adam Ryan doesn't seem like he was too crazy about the art package.

[01:00:31] Adam says, I was not crazy about the art package.

[01:00:34] The acid greens and the oranges and the yellows.

[01:00:37] It just got a bit much after a while.

[01:00:40] It does look like a unicorn threw up all over this play field.

[01:00:43] I like it.

[01:00:44] It does stand out.

[01:00:45] I like it.

[01:00:46] Yeah, it stands out.

[01:00:47] And what do you want?

[01:00:49] Stand out.

[01:00:50] Exactly.

[01:00:51] Linda Diel had some really cool design choices like the speakers are in the back box,

[01:00:59] but the art extends all the way from the top all the way to the bottom.

[01:01:04] So the speaker grill is integrated into the back glass or the trans light.

[01:01:10] The DMD is in the play field.

[01:01:13] It's not on the back box.

[01:01:16] These Williams must have had some confidence in J-pop by this time or let him do that.

[01:01:20] He's earning above average.

[01:01:21] He's selling above average when it comes to the pins at the same time.

[01:01:26] Now he's not getting the sales that they did three or four years prior, but he's still

[01:01:32] outperforming the other designers at the time.

[01:01:36] Interesting note from J-pop, he says, on the ringmaster, we chose to use micr-switches

[01:01:40] instead of optos.

[01:01:41] I think that was a fatal error.

[01:01:43] It was costing.

[01:01:44] We will keep the micr-switches and instead of adding $7 more for the optos set, that hurt

[01:01:49] operators.

[01:01:50] This is the era where we're starting to kind of cut and slash a little bit, right?

[01:01:54] We're going through.

[01:01:56] I don't know if we should, we can save $7 there, right?

[01:02:00] But it is obviously a big deal.

[01:02:03] The play field mounted DMD was originally in Capcom's 1996 flipper football.

[01:02:11] It's not like J-pop invented this.

[01:02:14] No one played that.

[01:02:15] Nobody played flipper football.

[01:02:16] That was a bomb.

[01:02:17] Yeah, we'll talk about Capcom in a while.

[01:02:19] Sorry, sorry Python.

[01:02:20] That was a Python game there.

[01:02:23] This was also, it was the first solacea game to have a disappearing pop-up, because once

[01:02:28] again, it was already used on Williams' 1958's Gusher.

[01:02:33] It's taken an old feature and updating it for a new game.

[01:02:37] J-pop was not much of a, he was, I've often described him as a guy who is able to build

[01:02:44] a lot of sizzle, but sometimes the steak is not that great, right?

[01:02:48] It's very flashy.

[01:02:49] It's very wonderful.

[01:02:52] But yet he sometimes he struggles a little bit.

[01:02:55] One of those is that there is a lot of stuck ball problems that appear on circus-voltaire.

[01:03:02] Well, J-pop says, at some point you have to stop working.

[01:03:05] I think circus had the most ball hang-ups of any prototype with the ramps.

[01:03:10] Everything wasn't linear and the ball would get stuck everywhere.

[01:03:13] The theme was also, I mean, the first theme we got is World Cup Soccer.

[01:03:17] That's pretty straightforward.

[01:03:18] The other one we have is like a magic theme.

[01:03:20] Then we've got a Middle Eastern theme.

[01:03:23] Now we have a circus theme, but it's like, it's not just a circus.

[01:03:27] It's like a weird circus.

[01:03:29] It doesn't have like, it's like something out of an acid trip.

[01:03:32] Where's the clowns at?

[01:03:34] Plus they have a major spoiler like right on the back glass.

[01:03:37] Oh, yeah?

[01:03:38] The whole game is, who is the ringmaster?

[01:03:40] It was the identity of the ringmaster.

[01:03:43] They give it away on the art.

[01:03:45] Spoiler alert.

[01:03:46] It's the lady.

[01:03:47] She literally has the mask in her hand.

[01:03:50] The ringmaster mask that she's taking off.

[01:03:52] Around Williams, you had Steve Cordeck who was really a mentor and a master of design

[01:03:59] who rose up from designer into the ranks of leadership at Williams.

[01:04:04] When we look at something like Valley Williams, we had also mentioned like a Norm Clark.

[01:04:10] The modern version of that today is George Gomez.

[01:04:13] George Gomez is a master of manufacturing, managing design, managing egos, and also designing

[01:04:22] games.

[01:04:24] This person, George Gomez knows exactly what he's doing.

[01:04:28] What did he think of Circus Voltaire?

[01:04:30] Oh, George says, hated it.

[01:04:32] Hated it with a passion.

[01:04:33] I don't know why.

[01:04:34] Just hated everything about it.

[01:04:36] I didn't get it.

[01:04:37] Wow.

[01:04:38] That's pretty good.

[01:04:39] It's like, I can't even tell you why I hated it.

[01:04:41] I just hate it.

[01:04:42] It's just so bad.

[01:04:43] I don't hate it.

[01:04:44] It's got one of the better wizard modes.

[01:04:46] It's probably one of the first games I can think of with a multi-stage final wizard mode,

[01:04:52] which is a more common thing in today's pinball.

[01:04:54] Adam Ryan, who was on dots at the time and worked with J-Pop quite regularly, would say

[01:04:59] that John Papadouk, especially in Circus Voltaire, wanted to let his creative flow.

[01:05:04] He wanted to push the boundaries and the edge of what was known as pinball.

[01:05:10] At this point, it was all no fear, an NBA fast-break, a Gomez design.

[01:05:15] It was very hard driving sort of one-dimensional.

[01:05:19] He wanted to have more artistic flair in a whole package.

[01:05:23] And I would say he certainly got that objective.

[01:05:26] This is when everything falls apart.

[01:05:29] The wheels are off at Williams.

[01:05:30] Everybody is generally laid off.

[01:05:33] What we have in the pinball 2000, but that was another episode.

[01:05:36] Yes.

[01:05:37] J-Pop would move into pinball 2000 where he would do Star Wars Episode 1.

[01:05:42] That game is so bad I don't even want to talk about it.

[01:05:45] It's not that bad.

[01:05:46] You can go back to our pinball 2000 episode in the archives.

[01:05:51] Go hang on over to silverbalkronicles.com or look up silverbalkronicles in your pod catcher.

[01:05:57] It's easier to filter through that if you're in the TPN, only dedicated feed.

[01:06:03] It's a little more difficult to go back into the archives.

[01:06:06] But eventually J-Pop would leave Williams.

[01:06:10] And it was an odd time because there were so few jobs in pinball anyway.

[01:06:16] And they were all competing to get those jobs in a market with only a stern pinball.

[01:06:23] Well J-Pop says, all of us pinball people have a similar experience.

[01:06:27] And the industry ebbs and flows.

[01:06:29] We move from project to project company to company.

[01:06:32] And we just try to apply what we know and move forward that way.

[01:06:35] This is certainly an eb.

[01:06:37] When it comes to the pinball industry, there's a handful of pinball rock stars out there, including

[01:06:43] Steve Richie and Pat Lawler and George Gomez and all these designers that are all looking

[01:06:49] for home.

[01:06:50] You've got all the programmers like Dwight Sullivan, Keith Johnson, Lyman Sheetz.

[01:06:55] The market is flooded with talent and only a handful of them will land somewhere.

[01:07:02] And J-Pop would actually say that I never called myself a rock star.

[01:07:05] I've always had an issue with the whole legendary thing.

[01:07:09] So humble.

[01:07:10] So humble.

[01:07:12] And scattered over sort of the next decade in pinball.

[01:07:15] John didn't end up at Stern, but he did teach toy design at Columbia College in Chicago

[01:07:21] for eight years.

[01:07:24] This is where eventually he would resurface in 2005 at a company called Zizzle.

[01:07:31] Ron, you have a few Zizzle pinball machines in your collection.

[01:07:33] I do not, but I have seen them.

[01:07:35] So Zizzle was a company founded in 2005 by Roger Schiffman, who is the co-owner of Tiger

[01:07:42] Electronics, along with a former marketing guru behind Furby.

[01:07:47] Oh, I remember Furby's with Mark Rosenberg.

[01:07:51] Schiffman credits his wife for the name of the company.

[01:07:54] The first toy released by Zizzle was for a company called IZED and it received a lot of

[01:08:01] comparisons to the Furby.

[01:08:03] So I guess we were okay with stealing our own IP.

[01:08:05] Wait a minute.

[01:08:06] It says IZ, but you said IZED.

[01:08:08] Is that a Canadian thing?

[01:08:10] No.

[01:08:11] I just think it's English.

[01:08:14] But it's a Z.

[01:08:15] How is it Z?

[01:08:16] No, it's a Z.

[01:08:17] But don't get that.

[01:08:18] I confuse this me.

[01:08:20] I said, I'm just confusion.

[01:08:22] I don't get it.

[01:08:24] The company received licenses to produce pirates of the Caribbean franchise toys, as well

[01:08:29] as Nickelodeon Spudg Bob Squarepants and the classic in my house, Door the Explorer.

[01:08:36] Those are some big licenses.

[01:08:38] These are big, I mean granted at the time we had to, we had spoke about this in the last

[01:08:42] episode, Pirates of the Caribbean, it was huge.

[01:08:45] Huge, huge, huge.

[01:08:46] And getting that IP was pretty easy because everybody had that IP.

[01:08:51] One of the product lines at Zizzle, miniature like three-quarter or half-size plastic pinball

[01:08:57] machines.

[01:08:59] They were purchased at places like Costco or Sam's Club in the US or, you know, you

[01:09:04] might be able to get them through for Christmas gifts through your Seeros catalog.

[01:09:09] That kind of stuff.

[01:09:10] J-Pop would do 2006's Marvel Superheroes and Villains and Pirates of the Caribbean pinball

[01:09:18] machines.

[01:09:19] In 2007, he would be in Marvel's superheroes.

[01:09:23] He would do Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End.

[01:09:26] And then by 2009's Zizzle was shut down.

[01:09:30] Should we review what these pins look like?

[01:09:33] Sure.

[01:09:34] Let's go with the biggest sort of seller that most people know and that's Pirates of the

[01:09:37] Caribbean Dead Man's Chest.

[01:09:41] Not going into the other ones, that's a waste of time.

[01:09:43] It's a three-quarter inch ball size.

[01:09:45] It's a 24-volt DC kind of frame case.

[01:09:50] It does have one solenoid that operates three-pop-up or simultaneously.

[01:09:53] It's got sling shots that are separate that are done by the same solenoid and it does

[01:10:00] actually have flippers.

[01:10:01] It has a flyer.

[01:10:02] Should we click on the flyer?

[01:10:03] It actually has a flyer.

[01:10:04] I'm curious what a flyer for a Zizzle would look like.

[01:10:07] We are on the internet pinball database, IPDB.org.

[01:10:11] You can take a look at all these.

[01:10:12] I've included a link in the show notes.

[01:10:15] Let's see.

[01:10:16] It says arcade pinball featuring authentic pinball action, music, lights and sound effects.

[01:10:22] Yeah, really it does not have the Williams flare.

[01:10:27] You've done it, matey.

[01:10:29] Multi-level pinball action based on the blockbuster movie over full size, over four and a half feet tall.

[01:10:37] This doesn't seem very tall.

[01:10:39] It's a John Papaduke design.

[01:10:40] How do I know?

[01:10:41] The shooter knob.

[01:10:42] It's the ball shooter knob.

[01:10:43] Shoot.

[01:10:44] You kept it even out there.

[01:10:45] It is.

[01:10:46] Even with this.

[01:10:47] I mean, it's a pinball machine, right?

[01:10:48] It's not a commercial unit.

[01:10:51] It's obviously a home unit, but there's a clear ramp on the left side that if you don't

[01:10:56] make it all the way up, it kind of bales in behind.

[01:11:02] It has a chest, kind of horse-shoe thing in the front where you shoot it in and comes

[01:11:07] right back at you.

[01:11:08] It has a wire form ramp that goes from the right ramp to the left flipper.

[01:11:12] It has Johnny Depp on it.

[01:11:14] It has one of those like whirlpool kind of things behind the chest.

[01:11:19] It's a pinball machine.

[01:11:23] It's obviously for children.

[01:11:26] I think it was priced right.

[01:11:27] Let me look through here.

[01:11:28] What were they priced for?

[01:11:30] $10,000.

[01:11:31] $10,000.

[01:11:32] Yeah, this is a submitted video.

[01:11:37] So it's only for rich children.

[01:11:39] Have you played a Stern the Pin?

[01:11:41] Yes, several.

[01:11:42] Yes.

[01:11:43] I have as well.

[01:11:44] There's one in my league, the Star Wars one, which is the better Star Wars layout.

[01:11:50] It has this weird fiberboard play field that is almost indestructible, actually, which

[01:11:56] is quite interesting.

[01:11:57] But it has one node board that fires multiple things at the same time.

[01:12:02] So the slings go off at the same time, regardless of which sling you hit, as well as the pop

[01:12:06] bumpers all go off, regardless of which pop bumper you hit.

[01:12:09] This follows the same philosophy.

[01:12:10] But there's a really cool image of the play field out of the game itself.

[01:12:15] It's that same kind of fiberboard looking thing with a board mounted underneath and very

[01:12:21] few wires.

[01:12:22] It's interesting how similar this is to a modern day Stern the Pin.

[01:12:28] It's much smaller though.

[01:12:29] It's totally smaller and definitely not as good.

[01:12:32] But you can see that the direction is the same kind of way you want to go.

[01:12:40] Fun stuff.

[01:12:41] Hey, Pinheads.

[01:12:42] When I'm not doing this podcast, I'm Dave the Financial Advice Guy.

[01:12:47] In a recent survey, we found that 70% of those pulled were concerned about their retirement

[01:12:53] strategy.

[01:12:54] Canadians have a number of concerns when looking out over the next 15 years.

[01:12:59] Professional financial advice is key to helping you through a variety of challenges, ranging

[01:13:04] from inflation, market volatility, and determining how to maximize your retirement income in

[01:13:10] the safest, most effective and tax-efficient way.

[01:13:14] Today's economy requires an experienced hand and a personalized plan.

[01:13:19] Don't take my word for it.

[01:13:20] Just listen to Nordman.

[01:13:21] I am the Nordman and I approve of Dennis Financial's investment and insurance advice.

[01:13:28] Their opinions on vacuum-flang ramps are great too.

[01:13:31] If you're looking for a more human dimension to your financial advice, Dennis Financial

[01:13:56] I've included another YouTube video from the Northwest Pinball show where John Papaduke

[01:14:02] pops up and reveals his plans for his own boutique pinball startup company, which he is

[01:14:12] called Zidware.

[01:14:14] This video is a lot of fun.

[01:14:18] Most of it comes from the gold that can be mined in the question and answer and trivia

[01:14:24] throughout the seminar.

[01:14:26] The other cool thing is the host of this is Jerry Thompson, who's most well known for

[01:14:34] doing the sound for most of the modern stirons that you love.

[01:14:38] Yeah, he lives in an northwest, so that's why he's there.

[01:14:40] So this brings us to Zidware in 2011 to 2012-ish time frame.

[01:14:47] What do you know about Zidware?

[01:14:50] Just in a nutshell.

[01:14:52] They were going to make games, really expensive games.

[01:14:56] Did he got zombie Eddie out of it?

[01:14:58] It didn't really go well.

[01:14:59] Not from a business standpoint.

[01:15:01] No, it didn't.

[01:15:02] Yeah, yeah.

[01:15:03] So most of the information within this section around Zidware comes from a podcast recorded

[01:15:10] in 2015 by Nate Schivers on Coast to Coast Pinball.

[01:15:16] Let's put a little context behind this before I start.

[01:15:19] Then it's been three years of kind of stumbling and bumbling and we'll expand on that in

[01:15:27] a moment.

[01:15:28] J-pop has some hindsight and has an incentive to sort of, let's say, come up with a narrative

[01:15:36] which fits within him.

[01:15:38] So this is just taken verbatim in Ron and I all out of our own stuff in there.

[01:15:42] And I also have some quotes that I've found from various places.

[01:15:46] These sources for all of these again in the show notes.

[01:15:49] So let's wind it back.

[01:15:51] What's Coast to Coast Pinball and who is Nate Schivers, Ron?

[01:15:55] Coast to Coast Pinball was a really pinball podcast.

[01:15:59] Short form.

[01:16:00] I'd say like maybe 15 minutes.

[01:16:02] They weren't very long episodes but they were frequent.

[01:16:04] And it became one of the really popular early pinball podcasts.

[01:16:09] Nate Schivers was the host.

[01:16:10] We had Topcast.

[01:16:12] Topcast is a great source for us here in our previous episodes where they saw the

[01:16:16] story and they speak to sort of the manufacturers.

[01:16:17] That was kind of around like 2002, 2003, more like 2007, 2008, somewhere around there.

[01:16:23] And they did like two years and they kind of stopped.

[01:16:25] Yeah, they're interviewing people.

[01:16:28] And then kind of the next big force within that was certainly Nate Schivers.

[01:16:32] As we move into more modern narratives, I'll be bringing in more Coast to Coast Pinball

[01:16:37] episodes that I'll reference and things like that.

[01:16:40] He was and somewhat still is.

[01:16:43] He is the host now of the Stern Insider pinball podcast.

[01:16:47] Just like Stern Insider, yeah.

[01:16:49] Yeah, so it's the free service you sign up and you don't have to pay a fee.

[01:16:52] You can go in behind the Stern sort of website.

[01:16:54] And when they do a launch of a pinball machine, Nate is not a full time pinball person.

[01:16:59] He does it as a hobby.

[01:17:00] My understanding is that he ended up moving to Europe for me.

[01:17:03] Yeah, he works for a guitar company.

[01:17:09] He was going to work for Stern and the guitar company offered him.

[01:17:13] He daily couldn't refuse.

[01:17:15] So he said, sorry, Stern, and then he moved to Europe.

[01:17:18] Yeah.

[01:17:19] So he's, I mean, they're all on good terms.

[01:17:20] I've never met Nate.

[01:17:22] I've listened to quite a few of his episodes.

[01:17:23] He seems like just a stand up dude, just a really nice guy.

[01:17:26] I look forward to shaking his hand sometime because he's done a lot for the pinball hobby.

[01:17:32] He's really kind of created a lot of these primary sources that again, we reference on

[01:17:37] this podcast.

[01:17:38] The most important thing that he probably could have done is what were people thinking

[01:17:42] at the time.

[01:17:43] One thing that sticks out though is episode 197, which is called an evening with John

[01:17:50] Pawbadooke.

[01:17:51] It was recorded on the 26th of September in 2015.

[01:17:55] And was by far his most listened to episode he ever did.

[01:17:59] This was this and and Jay pop just he rambles.

[01:18:03] He goes on on and on and on.

[01:18:05] There was not a lot of editing.

[01:18:07] It's a difficult listen, but I was able to get through most of it.

[01:18:10] I was able to pull the quotes from an AI software that kind of creates transcripts and things.

[01:18:16] It was really, really helpful.

[01:18:18] But this episode was really hard to find because the episode has been removed from the feed,

[01:18:26] as well as when you go to the website and you try to get it or listen to it, it has been erased.

[01:18:33] I find it interesting.

[01:18:34] I haven't asked why.

[01:18:35] That's not what we do here.

[01:18:37] We like to speculate.

[01:18:38] That's that's the excitement about our podcast is we kind of try to figure these things out

[01:18:43] as opposed to asking the sources because that's more interesting.

[01:18:46] But I did have some help with a fellow pinballer who used a thing called the way back machine.

[01:18:52] Do you know what the way back machine is Ron?

[01:18:54] Carcive.org.

[01:18:55] Yes.

[01:18:57] So you can go back on the internet and find things that were removed.

[01:19:01] Please remember folks, whatever you put on the internet will always end forever be

[01:19:06] there no matter how try to try to erase it.

[01:19:10] So the way back machine I went back on the website and I was able to pull the episode.

[01:19:16] I've included a link to the way back machine and the website in the show notes.

[01:19:22] This is a great snapshot about J-pop and Zidware in 2015.

[01:19:28] Nate Schivers would say that John is a very likable guy, but we have a bad situation here.

[01:19:34] John knows that there have been a lot of mistakes made here.

[01:19:39] This is kind of set in the table, right Ron?

[01:19:41] Yes.

[01:19:42] Do you do you now you joined pinball and what was it 2012?

[01:19:47] No, 2004.

[01:19:48] 2004.

[01:19:49] So you can probably remember a lot of this now I joined pinball in 2018.

[01:19:56] So all of this had happened well before I joined and I only get the bits and pieces of

[01:20:02] what happened with Zidware and John Papaduke and why everybody hates John Papaduke now.

[01:20:06] So I hope I'm doing everybody who's recently joined the hobby a little bit of the work

[01:20:11] to figure out what's going on here.

[01:20:13] So this is the summer of 2011.

[01:20:16] You remember the summer of 2011?

[01:20:18] Sure.

[01:20:19] I was alive.

[01:20:20] Yes, Zidware planned on making 13 pinball machines.

[01:20:24] A specific very niche boutique.

[01:20:27] Now eventually it was increased to 19 machines.

[01:20:31] Because I mean how can you make money making 13 machines?

[01:20:34] The price tag for these machines was $16,000 US and the highest LE machines at the time.

[01:20:43] So we're thinking like ACDC, those kind of things were $6,000 from Stern.

[01:20:51] That is a huge price tag.

[01:20:54] Yeah.

[01:20:55] People talking about the super LE's now.

[01:20:56] It's not Zidware pricing.

[01:20:58] So Batman 66, I think that was about 15,000.

[01:21:02] Yeah.

[01:21:03] Right, we're talking about only 500 pirates of the Caribbean's from Jersey Jack or made

[01:21:07] and for some reason people love that game or the people that own it, love the game.

[01:21:11] I don't get it.

[01:21:12] But those are going for like 16,000 US now.

[01:21:17] You know, sometimes you see them for 20.

[01:21:19] It's something crazy.

[01:21:21] But there was a lot of excitement when John Papaduke announced that he was coming out

[01:21:26] and going to create games again.

[01:21:30] So J-Pop says, I didn't expect to sell even four games.

[01:21:34] I couldn't believe the enthusiasm from the community.

[01:21:37] So many people were encouraging me to do this.

[01:21:39] What would J-Pop have designed if Valley Williams has stayed alive?

[01:21:44] He created four games.

[01:21:46] Those four games are just absolute epic machines and then he made Star Wars.

[01:21:52] What are some of the cool features that were around this game that he was promoting?

[01:21:56] What were the big plans?

[01:21:58] The ball is going to shoot up and freeze in mid-air.

[01:22:00] He's going to make a ball hover.

[01:22:02] A ball hover.

[01:22:03] Yes, he's going to make it hover in the air.

[01:22:04] Like a helicopter.

[01:22:06] He's going to have whimsical ramps.

[01:22:08] Right?

[01:22:09] He's going to have great art.

[01:22:11] It's really exciting.

[01:22:12] You can see that in that Midwest video on YouTube if you want to go back and watch that.

[01:22:18] Things didn't quite go as well as they had expected.

[01:22:23] He laid out all these plans and then he figured, okay, we got to get it done.

[01:22:30] Right?

[01:22:31] You got to take risks to start up something so awesome.

[01:22:35] Well, J-Pop says, if we knew everything from the very beginning, does that mean you

[01:22:39] never do anything?

[01:22:40] You don't build any games?

[01:22:42] This is America.

[01:22:43] You risk things.

[01:22:44] You risk everything and you move forward to create something new.

[01:22:47] We call that the American dream.

[01:22:49] A lot of times those people make mistakes.

[01:22:51] Yeah, that's inspirational.

[01:22:53] Yeah.

[01:22:54] The Canadian with the American dream.

[01:22:56] After eight to ten months, John began noticing what the cost of labor was and then he couldn't

[01:23:00] make any money.

[01:23:01] So he came up with the idea to increase production and make the original ones a special

[01:23:05] pioneer addition.

[01:23:06] Yeah.

[01:23:07] So you're getting kind of like if you were first in, you get like the elite, you know,

[01:23:11] the big time of super-le.

[01:23:13] But he's going to have to make more than 13 and 19, right?

[01:23:15] He just can't get the scale that he needs to make the money on those productions.

[01:23:20] He also brought in NDAs or non-disclosure agreements and that anyone who helped out

[01:23:26] Zidware around this time had to sign an NDA so that they weren't allowed to sort of talk

[01:23:31] about and spill the secrets at Zidware.

[01:23:35] In 2012, there are no other startups and there is almost no home-brew pinball machines.

[01:23:44] At this time, we're just getting ready to go back on that rollercoaster of pinball.

[01:23:50] Zidware are pretty much dead, but they're coming back.

[01:23:53] But there's no other boutique people.

[01:23:56] There's basically Zidware and that's it.

[01:23:57] There's a little bit of like rumblings around Jersey Jack.

[01:24:00] There's a little bit of rumblings around to soon be spooky pinball.

[01:24:04] But John is really like blazing trails here when it comes to creating Zidware.

[01:24:11] But he's got to bring people in to help him out.

[01:24:14] One of those people that pop up is an individual named Ben Heck.

[01:24:18] Mr. Heckador.

[01:24:19] Ben says, aside from the anybody who walks through the door NDA, John never had a formal agreement

[01:24:26] or contract with me.

[01:24:27] There was no indication of payments, royalties, usage of likeness, nothing.

[01:24:32] Yeah, you just sort of are signing paperwork to sign paperwork when you're working and helping out.

[01:24:37] I mentioned before that John sort of rambles, keeps talking about pinball secrets.

[01:24:42] The NDAs didn't work, but that's why he had them anyway.

[01:24:45] It was really important.

[01:24:47] But what he's doing is still kind of very secret.

[01:24:50] But it was the spring of 2012, John would go to vendors.

[01:24:55] Vendors are people that make parts.

[01:24:58] And he would ask them to help and build components.

[01:25:01] They were doing work with other companies like Stern, for example,

[01:25:05] and they wouldn't work with Zidware.

[01:25:08] This became a huge problem.

[01:25:10] So if you can't buy cabinets or solenoids or brackets and things like that

[01:25:15] from the manufacturers that are making them, because they're working with somebody like Stern,

[01:25:20] you're going to have to source that yourself or you're going to have to build it in-house.

[01:25:25] And this is where things really start to go bad, right?

[01:25:29] Oh yeah.

[01:25:30] The first game that was announced was Magic Girl, right?

[01:25:34] So he showed some sort of stuff about Magic Girl.

[01:25:37] But then quickly, the next game called Zombie Adventure Land

[01:25:42] or Ben Hex Zombie Adventure Land was announced.

[01:25:47] So why did they take orders on a second game when the first one wasn't even done

[01:25:52] and they were having issues finding parts?

[01:25:55] They brought on another 100 prepaid customers.

[01:25:59] Well, Jaypop says, there is that misjudgment.

[01:26:02] You know, John's bad decisions.

[01:26:04] I started working with Ben kind of in the summer,

[01:26:07] later in that summer when I started Magic Girl.

[01:26:10] So he would help me cut play fields.

[01:26:12] Him and Charlie were always very helpful.

[01:26:14] Yeah, so Charlie is Charlie Emory who would eventually start spooky pinball.

[01:26:19] He was an operator.

[01:26:20] So let's, again, Ty, let's wind this back a little bit.

[01:26:23] Well, who's Ben Hex?

[01:26:24] Well, his name is actually Ben Benjamin Hecadorn.

[01:26:28] He's an engineer and pinball designer in a console game modder.

[01:26:31] He's specialized in creating accessibility controls for video game consoles.

[01:26:35] Yeah, Ben Hex is a big deal amongst people who have accessibility problems

[01:26:40] for playing video games.

[01:26:41] So for example, if you've got a disability and you want to play an Xbox,

[01:26:45] you need a special controller to play an Xbox game with your disability.

[01:26:49] Ben designs and sells those on his website.

[01:26:53] That is a big, big deal for the disabled community.

[01:26:56] So that's where he gets kind of the console modder part.

[01:26:59] He also was a podcast host around this time

[01:27:03] and he focused on authoring modifications for video games.

[01:27:09] You call them hacking, you hack your games, that kind of stuff.

[01:27:12] He's on pin site.

[01:27:13] Oh, yeah, he's on pin site.

[01:27:14] He is quite the active troll in the deep root pinball.

[01:27:17] Yes, he's quite the troll.

[01:27:19] He cracks me up.

[01:27:21] He's also a regular on Canada's pinball podcast

[01:27:24] where he sort of talks about various things.

[01:27:27] Ben Hex is pretty entertaining, but you got to kind of,

[01:27:31] you know, you got to wade through some of the BS, I think, too.

[01:27:33] But he's definitely my kind of guy.

[01:27:35] Remember the quotes that I've found here are more recent quotes.

[01:27:41] Now that all these explosions have happened around Zidware

[01:27:44] and deep root and stuff like that.

[01:27:46] So Ben Hex has the advantage of hindsight with now when he's creating it,

[01:27:53] when now he's writing these things.

[01:27:54] So I've pulled some of these quotes from pin site.

[01:27:56] So let's talk a little bit about Ben Hex's zombie adventure land, Ron.

[01:28:00] Well, Ben says Ben Hex's zombie adventure land was John's idea, not mine.

[01:28:05] This game was born of a has been hack,

[01:28:07] trying to trick someone into performing a bunch of free labor,

[01:28:11] hoping my ego would take the bait.

[01:28:13] My ego doesn't work that way.

[01:28:14] I want to have creative control, not see my face on a backlash.

[01:28:17] This is from 2022.

[01:28:19] Ben Hex's involvement was very short lived at Zidware,

[01:28:23] and according to his post on pin side, again, included in the show notes,

[01:28:27] his involvement with Papaduke was never even committed to in a contract,

[01:28:32] and it mostly consisted of just hanging out in brainstorming.

[01:28:35] The name of the game was eventually changed to retro atomic zombie adventure land

[01:28:40] after Hex's association with the project dissolved.

[01:28:44] This game would eventually get rolled into deep root pinball,

[01:28:47] and that's a whole other podcast.

[01:28:51] Ben became an outspoken critic of J-Pops as time went on.

[01:28:56] This is the time when John Papaduke tried, as he could,

[01:29:01] to bring in as much help from various directions as he could.

[01:29:05] He didn't have enough money to do these things.

[01:29:07] It was costing him a fortune to build things like cabinets and boards and things.

[01:29:11] So that's why he reached out to members of the community.

[01:29:14] For example, Jimmy, aka Compy on pin side,

[01:29:19] was a programmer that J-Pop tried to bring a board.

[01:29:23] And Jimmy says, it was great at first to get a phone call from someone

[01:29:26] who's games you grew up playing.

[01:29:28] I was originally contacted to do the software and operating system for his games.

[01:29:32] Not just Magic Girl, but the system and framework common to all of his games

[01:29:36] that used the same board set.

[01:29:37] John was willing to talk for hours about how they did things in the old days and whatnot.

[01:29:42] When it came to the technical aspects or even the financial aspects of our conversations

[01:29:46] regarding timelines and the technology he would use, he was generally clueless.

[01:29:50] He was very quick to try to appeal to me to come work with the real game designers

[01:29:54] and do something great.

[01:29:55] However, when any discussion of compensation came up, they were quickly shut down

[01:29:59] and I was told it would be an apprenticeship.

[01:30:02] Yeah.

[01:30:03] Oh, and he continues, I'm glad I got out of it on scale,

[01:30:06] but I really, really do hate it for the people that did step up and tried to pull the project together

[01:30:12] because they thought it was good for pinball.

[01:30:14] Yes.

[01:30:16] I mean, I can empathize with J-Pop, right?

[01:30:19] He doesn't have a lot of money.

[01:30:21] He's taken some people's money.

[01:30:23] He's trying to deliver a project.

[01:30:25] He's trying to deliver a product.

[01:30:27] He's trying his best to do what he can, but that's kind of sketchy.

[01:30:31] You know what I mean?

[01:30:32] Like, we're trying to sell a dream here.

[01:30:36] And when it comes to selling a dream, we've seen that quite a bit in pinball and it just

[01:30:41] continues to happen.

[01:30:44] I had mentioned before that Ben Heck, he would leave to work with Charlie Emory at Spooky

[01:30:49] Pinball.

[01:30:50] Spooky Pinball has really grown and flourished in the pinball community.

[01:30:55] They're really just a wonderful startup that did it right, right?

[01:30:59] They just sort of picked away a little bit by little bit, but Spooky Pinball was not really

[01:31:03] around in 2012.

[01:31:06] But within Ben Heck's orbit was Charlie Emory and they began to build what would become

[01:31:12] Spooky in 2013.

[01:31:14] Ben says, J-Pop then starts slandering me, even though I'm helping Spooky become a real

[01:31:18] company while John was finding his next scam victim.

[01:31:21] Really grinds my gears.

[01:31:22] I help create millions in wealth and many jobs.

[01:31:25] John only destroys wealth.

[01:31:27] That's why this game pisses me off.

[01:31:28] It's in a front to me as a person and I'm embarrassed my name was ever attached to it.

[01:31:32] It's a monument to greed and sloth, to create a bankruptcy and deception.

[01:31:36] Let it die.

[01:31:37] It doesn't deserve to live.

[01:31:38] Yeah.

[01:31:39] So Ben Heck is basically saying that he's trying to wash his hands completely of all of this

[01:31:44] zombie, you know, adventure land stuff.

[01:31:48] Again, it should be noted that Ben is speaking with hindsight.

[01:31:54] He's also speaking because he had a falling out with J-Pop.

[01:31:59] It's probably what he's saying is probably right, but whatever.

[01:32:03] As well as he also had a falling out with Charlie Emory and left Spooky because of kind

[01:32:09] of the way Ben Heck is.

[01:32:11] Yeah.

[01:32:12] They weren't making his game and he got pissed.

[01:32:14] And then he blasted Charlie Emory kind of like he just blasted J-Pop online, but Charlie

[01:32:19] did not respond.

[01:32:21] And then they ended up working together again like a year or two later.

[01:32:24] Then Ben has been working with Charlie Emory and Spooky Pinball, but they're designing kind

[01:32:30] of a game with Chicago gaming.

[01:32:32] So we haven't really heard about that in the last little while, but that's kind of exciting.

[01:32:36] He's going to be cool, I think.

[01:32:38] Now manufacturing expectations, right?

[01:32:42] J-Pop in his interview says that they had low number of expectations, but they expected

[01:32:46] to sort of make six games a week.

[01:32:48] And he comments that even Charlie, well, they can make four to five a week at the time.

[01:32:53] So he's got high expectations.

[01:32:56] Now this is the dilemma and it is the Achilles heel to every one of these boutique manufacturers

[01:33:03] that started up kind of after Zidware and even to today.

[01:33:07] And that's trying to build the machine that you have in your basement.

[01:33:12] Well Williams wouldn't allow you to fall behind.

[01:33:14] 500 people be able to work and be to start something on time.

[01:33:17] There was always that pressure and stress.

[01:33:19] J-Pop says, I set up my new company to make beautiful games and they're all well engineered,

[01:33:24] but I didn't set it up to manufacture.

[01:33:26] Like on this date, this game must be production and it must be at this cost, therefore we need

[01:33:30] to hire these people to get there.

[01:33:32] I came about it from a different philosophy.

[01:33:34] Yeah.

[01:33:35] Yeah.

[01:33:37] That philosophy was not a good one.

[01:33:39] Whatever philosophy that was, yeah, throw that out.

[01:33:42] Yeah.

[01:33:42] The Williams philosophy is the right one or at least one of the right ones in his philosophy

[01:33:47] would be one of the wrong ones.

[01:33:49] Now he did give like a release date and production dates and he announced those games, right?

[01:33:55] Do you remember seeing him around shows?

[01:33:57] I don't know.

[01:33:59] No.

[01:34:00] I wasn't really following that because it was $16,000, I was never going to buy it.

[01:34:04] So I really wasn't following it because it's like, no, I'm not getting that.

[01:34:09] Yeah.

[01:34:10] You're like, give me that Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:34:12] No.

[01:34:13] 2012, I was like, give me that ACDC.

[01:34:14] J-Pop said that no one really started a small boutique pinball company before.

[01:34:18] You know, Williams had like standard boards and standard cabinets and these parts and they

[01:34:22] just had parts and parts and parts.

[01:34:25] You know, Gottlieb, we spoke about that in our previous episodes.

[01:34:29] You know, Gottlieb premier.

[01:34:30] They did just in time manufacturing.

[01:34:32] So something would, you know, parts would come in on one side of the building and out the

[01:34:36] other side came pinball machines.

[01:34:37] Well, he didn't have that luxury.

[01:34:39] He was literally starting from scratch.

[01:34:42] Well, you needed things like cabinets.

[01:34:45] You needed trim.

[01:34:46] You needed cabling.

[01:34:47] You needed a driver board.

[01:34:49] You needed lights.

[01:34:50] You needed light sockets and all of this compounded for John Papaduke and the schedules that

[01:34:55] he created constantly changed until eventually it was just subject to change.

[01:35:01] So let's talk about board sets.

[01:35:03] Ron, what are some of the board sets out there today for every manufacturer?

[01:35:09] I mean, it depends on the manufacturer.

[01:35:12] Stern has the spike system.

[01:35:13] A Chicago gaming, I think has their own custom system.

[01:35:17] Yeah, they've paid a designer.

[01:35:20] They've paid manufacturers in Asia or something to make these surface mounted fancy boards

[01:35:25] and send them over.

[01:35:26] American is using the P-Rock multi-morphic boards.

[01:35:32] Spooky was using them, but now they're using, I think they're using a combination, but

[01:35:38] they're using like a pin head.

[01:35:40] Well, that was the original board.

[01:35:41] Pinheck.

[01:35:42] I think the new one is called, oh, called pinnatar.

[01:35:46] So that's what Spooky's using.

[01:35:48] So basically, you got to either use an existing board set or come up with your own.

[01:35:53] At this time, there was nobody out there.

[01:35:55] There was nobody out there to help you with this.

[01:35:57] There was no off the shelf thing.

[01:35:59] There was nothing that you could do.

[01:36:01] Today, we have a great guy named Jerry Stellenberg and his multi-morphic P-Rock and the P-3

[01:36:09] rock board set.

[01:36:10] Now you can kind of go into pinball life.

[01:36:14] You can order these.

[01:36:15] They can get sent to you.

[01:36:16] You can build your own pinball machine.

[01:36:18] If you need to sort of mass produce them, you can buy these machines and run the cables

[01:36:23] yourself.

[01:36:24] He's done a lot to help boutique manufacturers of pinball as well as created a massive home

[01:36:32] brew community.

[01:36:35] The P-Rock and the P-3 rock system was a game changer when it came in.

[01:36:42] But around 2012, that kind of wasn't there yet.

[01:36:47] And then as we get kind of a few years down the road, okay, it starts appearing.

[01:36:51] Ben Heck.

[01:36:52] He was working at spooky and he created his own board system called and you alluded to

[01:36:57] it a moment ago, the pin Heck board system.

[01:36:59] That was eventually used in spooky's America's most haunted.

[01:37:03] I think it was used in the other one.

[01:37:06] What was the next one?

[01:37:07] Rob Zombie.

[01:37:08] Ben says, in hindsight, he probably just wanted our board set.

[01:37:11] Remember, he also asked Jerry to make a custom cheaper P-Rock for $0 engineering fee.

[01:37:17] Then when Jerry shockingly said no, John hired someone else to rip off P-Rock.

[01:37:22] Ben Heck would have been underpowered for a game like John's, but I doubt he knew

[01:37:25] enough to be aware of that.

[01:37:27] So P-Rock had kind of come around and it sounds like John Papaduke tried to reverse engineer

[01:37:36] the P-Rock.

[01:37:37] So he tried to pull a stern.

[01:37:38] He tried to stern it or he tried to data east it to reverse engineer the baly system

[01:37:43] and use that.

[01:37:44] Yeah.

[01:37:45] I mean, come on.

[01:37:46] When it works, it works, right?

[01:37:47] People forget.

[01:37:48] So I mean, you can't blame the guy, really.

[01:37:50] Come on.

[01:37:51] Back to the Jimmy or copy on Pinside again.

[01:37:55] Yeah.

[01:37:56] He said, when I found out that he just wanted to clone the entire P-Rock board system and

[01:37:58] framework, that's the point that I stopped talking to him entirely.

[01:38:01] Whoa.

[01:38:02] So there you go.

[01:38:03] It's confirmed.

[01:38:04] Tried to steal the P-Rock system.

[01:38:06] Didn't go really well.

[01:38:07] Well, now we're into the third game.

[01:38:09] It's 2013.

[01:38:10] Once again, we have hit a brick wall.

[01:38:12] The third game.

[01:38:13] Now, again, he hasn't made any games yet.

[01:38:16] Not a single one.

[01:38:17] So we're announcing a third game.

[01:38:19] And we're talking Allyson Wonderland.

[01:38:21] Finally, we can tie the loop back, getting back into the whimsy, right?

[01:38:26] Back to his first game.

[01:38:28] New game, more money to move things along, right?

[01:38:31] Did he have a plan on paper?

[01:38:33] Not really.

[01:38:34] But Nate Shivers got to give him a pat on the back.

[01:38:38] He asked the right questions.

[01:38:39] He said, well, why three games?

[01:38:41] Jay Pop would say, well, three games, that's when you're able to figure out when you have

[01:38:45] a look and a design feel.

[01:38:48] One, three was the right number of games.

[01:38:51] That's a great reasoning there.

[01:38:54] Yeah, I mean, come on.

[01:38:56] If you don't make three games, you don't have a design style.

[01:38:59] So you can take a look at American pinball.

[01:39:01] There are what, three, four games in now?

[01:39:03] They all, you know, American pinball now because they have three.

[01:39:07] So when you're waiting for parts, well, there's somebody you can still keep busy.

[01:39:11] Artists, you need artwork.

[01:39:12] Ah, you need artwork.

[01:39:14] So Jay Pop says, we're building a pinball platform.

[01:39:17] All the games share a lot of similar components.

[01:39:19] Sometimes you'll be waiting on parts or a vendor.

[01:39:21] So in the case of the artists, I was kind of training them how to think about pinball.

[01:39:25] They're not from pinball.

[01:39:26] And although they're extremely talented, the problem is once they finish a project, they'll

[01:39:30] basically be going to contract themselves out somewhere else.

[01:39:34] So it was really important for Jay Pop to continue to keep his artist busy.

[01:39:41] So Zidware didn't lose them because a lot of these artists that you will find, Stern

[01:39:46] artists included, they spend a lot of time making band posters or t-shirt designs or, you

[01:39:53] know, art for CDs or vinyl records or whatever.

[01:39:57] Like they have, they have other jobs, right?

[01:40:00] They got to keep doing stuff.

[01:40:02] Well, they could disappear.

[01:40:04] And that's a bad thing.

[01:40:06] But while you're waiting for, I don't know, trim cabinets, you're trying to steal board

[01:40:11] sets, you can still keep the artist busy because quite frankly, the pinball play field

[01:40:16] is going to stay similar.

[01:40:17] Who's he talking about?

[01:40:18] He's talking about Jeremy Packer.

[01:40:21] You might know him as his nickname, Zambi Eddie.

[01:40:24] Probably what?

[01:40:25] Top three greatest pinball artists of all time?

[01:40:27] I put, there's so many artists through the years.

[01:40:30] Definitely recently, yes.

[01:40:31] Yeah.

[01:40:32] I mean, we've talked about this before as a recency bias.

[01:40:36] So you're more biased to think the games of today are better because you're further away

[01:40:40] to the games.

[01:40:41] Yeah, but you just need to look at Paragon or Fathom and that'll change your mind.

[01:40:45] That's why I'm saying top three.

[01:40:46] You got Greg Ferres, still killing it.

[01:40:50] You've got Greg Ferris.

[01:40:53] But amazing.

[01:40:55] That's the same guy.

[01:40:56] Greg Ferris.

[01:40:57] I think you're thinking of Paul Ferris as you're thinking of Paul Ferris.

[01:41:01] Oh, God.

[01:41:02] That's bad.

[01:41:03] I'm going to leave that in.

[01:41:04] I'm not going to get that in.

[01:41:06] So let's talk about Jeremy Packer because I love Jeremy Packer.

[01:41:10] In my basement, I was able to get one of those Stern Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles banners.

[01:41:17] That is my childhood.

[01:41:18] He did.

[01:41:19] It's perfect.

[01:41:20] It's absolutely perfect.

[01:41:21] I love Jeremy Packer.

[01:41:23] I love you, Jeremy Packer.

[01:41:26] Jeremy is from Northern Indiana and had no choice but to escape the malaise via a steady

[01:41:32] diet of comic books, cartoons, movies, music, and video games.

[01:41:38] Stern Indiana, most well known for corn.

[01:41:41] The band or just corn.

[01:41:44] Just corn.

[01:41:45] He spent a lot of time drawing and escaping and would hone his craft with a bachelor of

[01:41:52] fine arts and film and animation with a fine arts minor.

[01:41:57] So this guy knows what he's doing when it comes to art.

[01:42:01] He has had the pleasure to work with some top tier companies including Nike, Adidas,

[01:42:07] Hasbro, Reebok, DC Shoes, the video game maker EA.

[01:42:12] He's also produced artwork for some of the greatest musical bands in the world, Foo Fighters,

[01:42:18] Deadmouse, DevTones, Primus, and on and on.

[01:42:22] Most recently, Zombie Eddie has created the most amazing pinball packages including two

[01:42:28] Twippy wins.

[01:42:30] We've got Ghostbusters, Iron Maiden, Deadpool, Primus, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

[01:42:37] Avengers Infinity Quest, and most recently as of this recording, Godzilla from Stern

[01:42:43] Pinball.

[01:42:44] What's Jeremy Packer's best art package?

[01:42:47] Magic Girl.

[01:42:48] It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

[01:42:49] It is good, yes.

[01:42:51] It is very good.

[01:42:52] It is very good.

[01:42:53] I'm going to go TMNT, Ninja Turtles.

[01:42:56] Okay.

[01:42:57] I think it's probably his best art package.

[01:43:00] Yeah.

[01:43:01] Did he have Ghostbusters as well?

[01:43:03] Yeah, two in one year and I actually thought that one was the better one.

[01:43:05] I think it was what?

[01:43:06] That one in Avengers.

[01:43:07] Everyone was saying Avengers.

[01:43:08] I was like, I think that turtles one's a little better.

[01:43:11] Yeah.

[01:43:12] Yeah, he really caught the spirit of Ninja Turtles in my opinion.

[01:43:16] He just nick-a-loaded in.

[01:43:17] They really locked out, I think, with picking up some of this stuff with Zombie Eddie.

[01:43:22] He's done a couple of other things.

[01:43:24] Let's put it this way when it comes to his artwork.

[01:43:27] When they did Avengers, Marvel was like, who is that guy you had to do, Deadpool?

[01:43:32] We want him.

[01:43:33] They wanted him back.

[01:43:34] So there you go.

[01:43:35] As for pinball, Zombie Eddie was discovered, quote unquote, by John Papaduke online and

[01:43:42] he enlisted him to do magic girl.

[01:43:45] And right away, you could tell John Papaduke's artistic sort of vision and eye, he could

[01:43:51] pick that out and be like, this guy's going to kill it and you know what?

[01:43:54] Who?

[01:43:55] He really has.

[01:43:56] Zombie Eddie says, my professional start in pinball was with John Papaduke in 2011.

[01:44:01] He found my portfolio of illustrations online when I still had a day job as creative director

[01:44:06] for a software company.

[01:44:07] I think an enormous portfolio of five character illustrations at the time.

[01:44:11] From there I had worked with John Papaduke on magic girl, Raza, which is retro atomic

[01:44:16] zombie eventually land, Alice in Wonderland and a few other projects.

[01:44:20] For almost four years, then we stopped communicating.

[01:44:22] Oh, that's weird.

[01:44:23] Well, we'll get to that in a minute.

[01:44:25] Right out of the gate, John Papaduke could pick out that Zombie Eddie was something special.

[01:44:30] And I'll tell you, when you look at that magic girl, it is.

[01:44:33] So you can actually buy magic girl, original Zidware magic girl play fields and things like

[01:44:39] that, right?

[01:44:40] So John was selling play fields.

[01:44:41] He was selling things, trying to generate some money at all.

[01:44:44] You know, the t-shirts, they made a bunch of t-shirts, which you can find on eBay, which

[01:44:48] I think is hilarious.

[01:44:49] It, you know, he kept this artist busy because that was the only thing that was generating

[01:44:54] revenue for Zidware.

[01:44:57] We could see now with hindsight, we're in 2022 and it's been 10 years.

[01:45:02] Zombie Eddie has been a force in pinball.

[01:45:06] I have included a couple of really great interviews in the show notes.

[01:45:10] Please go ahead and read some of those interviews with Zombie Eddie and there's like an artist

[01:45:14] profile stuff.

[01:45:15] Super, super good.

[01:45:16] But what was it like working with J-Pop Ed Zidware?

[01:45:20] It must have been difficult being one of these people that he was kind of bringing in and

[01:45:25] kind of paying, kind of not paying, kind of working with.

[01:45:28] Well, so this is from J-Pop about him working for himself, I guess.

[01:45:32] These games last a long time, so why not put our best efforts in redoing something, updating

[01:45:37] code, redraw it, whatever it might be.

[01:45:39] All these things have kind of hurt me or at least hurt the projects I'm trying to finish

[01:45:43] because it means delays.

[01:45:44] It means you're spending more money.

[01:45:46] You're trying for excellence.

[01:45:47] You're trying for perfection and it's difficult.

[01:45:50] Yeah.

[01:45:51] Right there, it says he's trying for excellence and perfection, right?

[01:45:56] And that doesn't work at Valley Williams.

[01:46:00] They told you it sucked and to move on and to get it out of the door where he's, you

[01:46:04] can't get any flipper mechs.

[01:46:06] So what do you do?

[01:46:07] Well, you might as well tweak this and change the ramp there.

[01:46:09] Well, now you change the ramp.

[01:46:10] We got to go to the manufacturer and have them change it again or we're going to change

[01:46:14] the art.

[01:46:15] Like we're spinning our wheels here because quite frankly, we can't manufacture a pinball

[01:46:19] machine.

[01:46:20] It's something else to pass the day.

[01:46:22] Well, Jaypop says, I'm not good at getting a game out and having people trash it.

[01:46:25] I should be smart enough to get a team together and do it right.

[01:46:29] Hmm.

[01:46:30] Let's go back to Ben Hack in 2017 and some people would say that Jaypop was trying to

[01:46:35] sucker people in to help him to continue.

[01:46:38] Well, Ben Hack says, sucker didn't isn't the right term.

[01:46:41] It just seemed cool to get to work with a legend.

[01:46:44] Back then, nobody thought any differently.

[01:46:45] This happens all the time with indie kick starters.

[01:46:48] Nobody wants to work with the insert old school programmer here until they realize it's

[01:46:52] a bunch of bull.

[01:46:53] I also thought that a game about me was stupid, flattering but stupid.

[01:46:57] I'm a lot of things, but egotistical isn't one of them.

[01:47:00] Hmm.

[01:47:01] Hmm.

[01:47:02] So, yes, not a hard decision to go help Charlie instead who said, we'll pay you X per game.

[01:47:07] Wow, simple, right?

[01:47:09] It wasn't just me.

[01:47:10] John went through all this help like shit through a goose.

[01:47:13] So he's again, now he's bringing in the artist, right?

[01:47:16] And he's given the artist more projects to do and it's continuing and continuing and

[01:47:19] continuing.

[01:47:20] So we got programmers and artists and guys to help with playfields and there's just a revolving

[01:47:24] door of people coming in and coming out which in itself continues to create issues.

[01:47:31] Well, I mean, we're through what three years now and we've missed deadline after deadline

[01:47:36] after deadline.

[01:47:37] Now this isn't unusual though, right Ron?

[01:47:39] As far, well, depending on the pinball manufacturer, yeah, of course.

[01:47:43] So I mean, Stern is like clockwork because they're a manufacturer.

[01:47:46] They've always been and always will be.

[01:47:48] But JJP had some serious issues with its first two machines as well.

[01:47:52] Didn't it?

[01:47:53] It took a long time.

[01:47:54] A long time.

[01:47:55] They're still at about a game every two years, year and a half to two years.

[01:47:59] Yeah, they're releasing them, right?

[01:48:00] It's not like you're giving them money and you got to wait, but you know, that first

[01:48:04] Wizard of Oz stuff and we'll do another, we'll do a JJP episode some other time.

[01:48:08] They really struggled with that.

[01:48:09] I think with Guns and Roses, it was the first time they announced a game and released

[01:48:15] it immediately.

[01:48:16] Yeah, the problem with that has been the pandemic and manufacturing.

[01:48:20] I mean, before that, even like Wanka, it wasn't like announced and boom, it's you can order

[01:48:26] these.

[01:48:27] They're available.

[01:48:28] It was still a little delay.

[01:48:29] I would say the delays got progressively less with each new game, but yes.

[01:48:35] But as far as Zidware, Jpop says, so you are kind of moving ahead, but then as you move

[01:48:40] along as the six months increments go by, all of a sudden you're engineering your cabinet,

[01:48:45] you have trim that goes around the cabinet.

[01:48:46] Oh, and you need a driver board and then you need cabling and then you have to have a cable

[01:48:51] guy and then you have lighting and then all these things kind of compounded and it just seemed

[01:48:56] to kind of get worse and worse and worse.

[01:48:58] So Jpop is self aware.

[01:48:59] Self aware that building pinball machines is hard.

[01:49:02] He understands that he's in trouble here.

[01:49:05] Now this is again from the Coast to Coast interview in 2015.

[01:49:07] It's been three or four years.

[01:49:10] He knows stuff is bad, but how do we still not have a fucking cabinet with trim on it?

[01:49:14] What's going on here?

[01:49:15] I think another issue he had is he instead of just ripping off, like he tried to rip off

[01:49:21] the p-rock and stuff that you could rip off probably like just do a Williams cabinet

[01:49:26] design, just just make the mechs the same.

[01:49:29] Or he could have just, I think you could just buy the mechs from pinball life.

[01:49:33] I mean, just get those.

[01:49:34] He didn't do any of that.

[01:49:35] He kept trying to make all new stuff for like everything he wanted to revolutionize pinball.

[01:49:41] Even basic mechs like no, he need a new version.

[01:49:44] Like even Jersey Jack to this day and American pinball they use old Valley Williams mechs,

[01:49:52] not just flipper mechs.

[01:49:54] Like the trap door on dialed in is the same as the trap door on Funhouse.

[01:49:58] You know, they're not inventing the wheel.

[01:50:00] I mean, shouldn't he know that?

[01:50:02] Didn't he work at Williams?

[01:50:03] Doesn't he know that?

[01:50:05] He's a designer.

[01:50:06] He's not a manufacturer.

[01:50:07] Right. And we spoke again, like what an hour ago now.

[01:50:11] We spoke about how he would go down to the Valley Williams engineering team and say,

[01:50:15] here's a drawing and then the cable guy would come back and there's your cable.

[01:50:19] You know what I mean?

[01:50:21] Well, took him a year to build a cabinet.

[01:50:25] Originally they had a Valley Williams cabinet, but that wasn't good enough apparently.

[01:50:30] Then he started a blog, right?

[01:50:31] Because he noticed that he needed to have more communication and then the communication

[01:50:36] would slow down and would become non-existent.

[01:50:40] And then apparently it's said by some of these sources that he actually stopped answering

[01:50:45] the phone.

[01:50:46] Now do you remember when this started to happen?

[01:50:49] I do.

[01:50:50] I was not.

[01:50:51] This is all on Pinside most of it and I probably wasn't paying attention.

[01:50:56] Zombie Eddie, his first post on Pinside.

[01:51:00] He said I'd work with John Papaduke on Magic Girl, Rosa, Alice in Wonderland and a few

[01:51:04] other projects for almost four years when he stopped communicating.

[01:51:07] I found Pinside and learned the fate of Zidware for the first time.

[01:51:12] So he'd literally work for them and he found out what happened to the company by going

[01:51:15] to Pinside.

[01:51:17] Yeah.

[01:51:18] And the reason he found Pinside is because he was trying to get a hold of John because

[01:51:21] he wasn't answering his phone.

[01:51:23] Zombie Eddie continued, I was crushed by the death of Zidware and the lack of John letting

[01:51:26] me in on it until it was too late.

[01:51:29] But even more than that, I was crushed that he hadn't told me he was using other people's

[01:51:31] money to fund these projects.

[01:51:33] All around it was a gut punch for me.

[01:51:36] Poor Jeremy Packer.

[01:51:38] Oh my goodness.

[01:51:41] So John Papaduke's basically digging a hole, right?

[01:51:44] Yeah, he's, yeah.

[01:51:45] I mean you got to dig up stupid.

[01:51:47] Well John says, so with pride and the arrogance I had, we can do this.

[01:51:51] You kind of set yourself up for almost an impossible task.

[01:51:54] It's maybe a good meaning task.

[01:51:56] You're trying to do a good thing, but actually you're not very smart.

[01:51:59] You know, John's really an idiot because he's trying to do these things and now he has

[01:52:03] a lot of unhappy customers and he's late and on and on.

[01:52:07] He's self-aware.

[01:52:08] He understands what's going on.

[01:52:11] Now I'm going to empathize a little bit with J. Pop.

[01:52:14] And this is something that happens all the time amongst people in general is that we

[01:52:21] try to fix something that's broken.

[01:52:23] We try, we don't want to fail.

[01:52:26] We have this fear of failure and we don't want to just quit and we feel bad.

[01:52:30] He feels bad.

[01:52:31] He took these people's money, right?

[01:52:32] He wants to get them a product and he's fighting tooth and nail to get the product to

[01:52:38] them.

[01:52:39] But the problem is that that just keeps compounding, right?

[01:52:42] Compounding, compounding.

[01:52:43] Now he's three games in.

[01:52:44] He's got all this art.

[01:52:46] He's got, he's hardly got a cabinet that works.

[01:52:49] You know, in the interview with, you know, coast to coast, he's like, oh, I got this

[01:52:52] back here.

[01:52:53] I got the cabinet sitting in here behind me and we got the game together and it's coming

[01:52:57] together.

[01:52:58] Like he's trying his best.

[01:53:00] But man, he's blown it here.

[01:53:02] Well this brings us to 2015 May when a statement is released by John Papaduke who is the

[01:53:11] president of Zidware and it is called Action Plan for Purchases of Magic Girl trademark.

[01:53:19] Raza and AIW which is Alice in Wonderland.

[01:53:24] So I've taken a few, this is quite the, this is quite the document here.

[01:53:29] It's included in the show notes.

[01:53:31] It's included in pinball supernova website where he has reposted this statement in the

[01:53:39] one line, the one quote that really cracks me up here and I feel bad for all the people

[01:53:43] involved in Zidware.

[01:53:45] I quote, first and foremost, my apologies for not being a better businessman.

[01:53:49] End quote.

[01:53:50] Yikes.

[01:53:51] In a nutshell, John says that he has had someone review the company to look at the numbers

[01:53:59] to take a look at the money that's been in and what needs to be done and the company

[01:54:04] is well under water.

[01:54:06] Surprised.

[01:54:07] Now they couldn't issue refunds to those people and they couldn't make games because

[01:54:12] the money's been spent and they don't have any games.

[01:54:15] John also in this letter says that he sold the rights and the materials to the games of

[01:54:23] Zidware to Bill Brandis of Pentasia who actually in the press release remains nameless and he

[01:54:30] was going to complete the project with a licensing agreement.

[01:54:33] So he didn't sell him the company, sold him the licensing agreements.

[01:54:39] As a business person myself, I would say that that's probably to avoid some level of

[01:54:43] legal liability for Bill Brandis and his company Pentasia.

[01:54:46] So the licensee sent out an agreement to the purchasers that they would agree to the

[01:54:53] new terms of the purchase of their pinball machines, their deposits, which were paid

[01:54:59] to Zidware would roll over to the new company and they'd pay more than the original agreed

[01:55:07] upon price because of the cost of developing the machines.

[01:55:11] Those people who put in their money would have to pay more in the end.

[01:55:14] So a lot of them have paid their full deposit of $16,000 US five years before this and

[01:55:23] they had to agree to not bring legal action against Zidware during the delivery period or

[01:55:29] within four years of that delivery period.

[01:55:34] Then in the last line, the other only alternative for Zidware for these preorder folks if they

[01:55:41] didn't agree to these terms was the Zidware would file bankruptcy.

[01:55:45] Yikes.

[01:55:46] Do you remember this?

[01:55:48] Yeah, I remember this.

[01:55:50] What was the feeling at the time?

[01:55:52] I'm suing them.

[01:55:53] Suing them.

[01:55:53] Yep.

[01:55:54] Getting my money.

[01:55:56] Right.

[01:55:57] So this person kind of comes in.

[01:55:58] It's an angel investor.

[01:55:59] It's the same thing that happened at JJP, right?

[01:56:02] Somebody swung in and bought the company.

[01:56:04] But this is kind of a little more sketchy than that.

[01:56:07] It was a little less transparent.

[01:56:09] Wow.

[01:56:11] So it's taken basically all this time and they say you can't Su Zidware.

[01:56:15] If you sign the new agreement, you can't sue us.

[01:56:18] People all bailed, right?

[01:56:19] Every single person was like, I'm Eddie here and I'm suing them, right?

[01:56:21] Oh, yeah.

[01:56:22] Yeah.

[01:56:23] And a lot of people still stayed on.

[01:56:27] They held onto the hope.

[01:56:28] They wanted to see that magic girl.

[01:56:29] They wanted to see that floating pinball, you know?

[01:56:32] They got 15 right.

[01:56:33] So if you put like $15,000 US into the stock market in 2011, just let it roll for five years.

[01:56:42] Surely you would have made like 5% return on your money.

[01:56:46] But you basically gave it to Jaypop who couldn't get a machine off the ground and you've lost

[01:56:51] all that money and you've lost the opportunity to grow that money.

[01:56:54] Crazy talk.

[01:56:55] But it finally happened, right?

[01:56:56] Magic Girl debuted.

[01:56:57] I remember that.

[01:56:58] Yeah.

[01:56:59] The Northwest Finball Show.

[01:57:00] The Northwest pinball show.

[01:57:03] Finally, the machine comes to life.

[01:57:06] Bill Brandes pulls it out of the fire.

[01:57:09] Pentasia shocks the world.

[01:57:12] But many of the max promise didn't work and the machine was not quite as expected, but

[01:57:19] it was there, right?

[01:57:20] It didn't work.

[01:57:21] I've seen the actual game.

[01:57:23] It literally was behind ropes since like, you can't play this.

[01:57:26] It doesn't work.

[01:57:28] So this is the magic fantasy theme.

[01:57:31] It's from February of 2017.

[01:57:35] Williams WPC 95.

[01:57:37] Oh no, it's not.

[01:57:38] It's whatever the heck board system this is.

[01:57:40] We don't know how many units were actually made, nor do we know how many work.

[01:57:44] The design was John Papadou, art by zombie Yeti and the software from the guy on Pinside.

[01:57:50] Who eventually which is left?

[01:57:53] Now we're not in 2017, but I figured I'd run out of this machine here because this is

[01:57:58] we're getting this is getting sad.

[01:57:59] It's getting worse here, folks.

[01:58:01] Not only did the shots not work great, the Mylar art was bubbling on this machine.

[01:58:08] There were was no ball search turned on, which is seems like the most basic possible thing

[01:58:14] you could program.

[01:58:16] Many of the features were turned off since they weren't complete or didn't work.

[01:58:20] So basically it was a whitewood with pretty art and flippers.

[01:58:24] Well it can't be whitewood if it has art.

[01:58:26] It was just a box of lights.

[01:58:28] Yeah, Penteja, Penteja bailed soon after that.

[01:58:31] Yeah, no, yeah, there they are.

[01:58:32] Yep, June.

[01:58:33] It lasted a couple months.

[01:58:34] A couple of months.

[01:58:35] And then Bill Brandis is like, oh my god, we were sold a bill of goods.

[01:58:39] This machine is not even remotely close to being finished.

[01:58:42] This has been four years and this machine is not even close to being like finished.

[01:58:49] How long did it take Zach to make his, you know, from your show?

[01:58:56] Slam till podcast.

[01:58:58] How long did it take him to bail his machine like 18 months?

[01:59:00] It's like a year or a half.

[01:59:02] Yeah, at least it works.

[01:59:05] It works, yeah.

[01:59:06] Well, this is where it gets messy again.

[01:59:09] Oh, yeah, I got really messy.

[01:59:10] American pinball.

[01:59:12] So you remember this, apparently.

[01:59:13] Yeah, yeah.

[01:59:14] Start up company.

[01:59:15] So for whatever reason they figure the best way to start the company off is hire J-Pop.

[01:59:20] Oh, you got to, you need a designer.

[01:59:23] You might as well find one who's not building anything.

[01:59:25] So J-Pop started contract work on a game called Houdini from American Pinball.

[01:59:30] His name basically sold pinball machines.

[01:59:33] So he showed up at a pinball show.

[01:59:36] I think it was Expo with a prototype of Houdini.

[01:59:39] It wasn't Expo.

[01:59:40] It wasn't Expo.

[01:59:41] I would have seen it.

[01:59:42] No, it wasn't Expo.

[01:59:43] I'm trying to remember where it was.

[01:59:44] I'd have been like to Houston or something.

[01:59:47] It wasn't Expo because I would have been there.

[01:59:48] It was behind like ropes and it wasn't playable.

[01:59:51] Yeah.

[01:59:52] It's Vegas.

[01:59:53] Is it Vegas?

[01:59:54] Scroll up, I think it said.

[01:59:55] Yeah, it was literally, yeah, not even ropes.

[01:59:57] It was like, you couldn't even get close to it to actually look at it.

[02:00:00] Venetian.

[02:00:01] Yeah, so it would have been a Vegas.

[02:00:02] Yeah.

[02:00:03] So it was, it was that Vegas.

[02:00:04] It was that, in a room like a gate in front of it.

[02:00:07] So you couldn't even get close up to it.

[02:00:08] So the only pictures that exist aren't the greatest.

[02:00:11] Yeah.

[02:00:12] And when you look at this, it's quintessentially J-pop, is it not?

[02:00:16] Yeah, it's got the LCD display now is in the back of the game.

[02:00:20] It's there the back box.

[02:00:21] Yeah.

[02:00:22] It's got the whimsical clear ramps.

[02:00:25] It's got beautiful, beautiful art.

[02:00:28] I've included all of the links to a pinball news article, which has a lot of the images

[02:00:34] here.

[02:00:35] It is.

[02:00:36] It looks great.

[02:00:37] Looks awesome.

[02:00:38] J-pop is back.

[02:00:39] Yeah, but they took so much flack for that.

[02:00:41] Ooh, did they ever.

[02:00:42] So American pinball, so this is a sub company of Ametron, which is a large third party contract

[02:00:49] manufacturer.

[02:00:50] So they know how to make stuff.

[02:00:51] So they're going to be able to make this game.

[02:00:54] Well, they also agreed to try to save Magic Girl.

[02:00:58] Yeah, they really want a pop of dude.

[02:01:00] It's like, we'll make Magic Girl for you.

[02:01:02] So they were going to manufacture.

[02:01:03] So I mean, obviously part of the problem with the other pin company with Mr. Brandis

[02:01:08] Fellow is that they weren't manufacturers, right?

[02:01:11] It was just somebody with money.

[02:01:12] So basically the people that didn't drop their order and sue that just stuck around,

[02:01:16] they got the Magic Girl.

[02:01:18] Yeah, they're like, oh, thank God.

[02:01:20] American pinball built the Magic Girl.

[02:01:22] It didn't work.

[02:01:23] Oh, six years.

[02:01:25] Six years after the first pre-orders, deliveries were finally scheduled.

[02:01:33] And they made all the specs at the American pinball factory provided by John Papaduke.

[02:01:39] The machines were finally being delivered and the features were not working.

[02:01:44] And they would even break.

[02:01:47] There was no floating ball.

[02:01:49] There was a million ball hangups.

[02:01:52] The LCD screen would stop working.

[02:01:54] In fact, people, when they heard that they were finally making this machine, started sort

[02:02:00] of speculating that it would work and they would buy a, they would buy in or they would

[02:02:04] buy one from somebody.

[02:02:05] Some of the reported prices were $23,000 US to purchase a spot or purchase a spot from

[02:02:12] somebody.

[02:02:13] And man, oh man, these people were burned.

[02:02:17] Kind of.

[02:02:18] Kind of.

[02:02:19] If they were going to spend that much, they're already rich so they don't care.

[02:02:20] So many people were speculating and they would, they would hope to flip it, right?

[02:02:23] They'd make five or six grand, sell it for $30,000 because there's only like a dozen

[02:02:27] of them.

[02:02:28] So the top really understands collectability.

[02:02:31] And there are many reports that there are multiple magic girls with the serial number

[02:02:37] number one.

[02:02:38] There's also a few that have a serial number zero or a prototype serial number.

[02:02:45] So those look more collectible unless you actually know what you're looking at.

[02:02:50] There could be like a dozen number ones with a sticker that says number one.

[02:02:54] Mm hmm.

[02:02:55] Now there was a lot of fallout.

[02:02:57] And you had mentioned that American pinball took a lot of flack for this as they should.

[02:03:02] So they had to basically they did the magic girls, they dumped J. Pop's Houdini and they

[02:03:07] built a new Houdini in like a few months.

[02:03:10] So they were, they were felt like they were actually sold a bill of goods by J. Pop,

[02:03:15] which they probably were similar to, to, you know, Bill Brandis.

[02:03:19] The machine was supposed to work and here was the designs and all the, but none of, like,

[02:03:22] they built it to the spec, but the spec didn't work because J. Pop is an artist.

[02:03:27] He's not an engineer.

[02:03:29] And they again canceled Houdini and they got Joe Balser to make it and Houdini, I haven't

[02:03:35] played it.

[02:03:36] They're still making it to this day.

[02:03:38] Yeah, it's a decent game as far as I can tell.

[02:03:41] Zombie Eddie, he eventually started at Stern, starting with Ghostbusters.

[02:03:45] So it worked out for him.

[02:03:46] Boy, oh boy, Ghostbusters.

[02:03:48] Oh, man.

[02:03:49] But the lawsuits, they really, really started to pick up now.

[02:03:53] But eventually another savior would arrive and purchased Zidware.

[02:04:02] Somebody will a lot of money, a company that was exciting and dynamic and once again would

[02:04:09] change the face of pinball.

[02:04:11] That company was Ron Deeproot.

[02:04:14] Yes, a investment manager and pinball enthusiast, Robert Mueller would step up and finally get

[02:04:23] retro, atomic, zombie, adventure land completed.

[02:04:28] And we would get the pin bar, but that's another story.

[02:04:33] Yeah, that's something.

[02:04:34] So you just, where the Google, if you don't want to wait for that episode, folks, some

[02:04:40] people say the path to hell is paved with good intentions.

[02:04:46] And I think this is a prime example of that, Ron, that J-pop really did actually try to

[02:04:55] do the best thing.

[02:04:57] But through the best of intentions, through blunders and mistakes and guilt, he really screwed

[02:05:08] up.

[02:05:09] And he had it making it worse and he has ruined his name in pinball.

[02:05:14] And I feel horrible about everybody involved and I do in fact feel bad for J-pop.

[02:05:21] I really do.

[02:05:22] But man, he blew it.

[02:05:24] Well, J-pop says, when I look back at what Stern does now and what we did at Williams,

[02:05:29] that was a basic philosophy.

[02:05:31] It was capitalism driving everything.

[02:05:33] You need a profit and a very focused team to be in production.

[02:05:37] J-pop is certainly an artist and not much of a capitalist.

[02:05:44] That's for sure.

[02:05:45] There is a reason, Ron, that Stern pinball is as successful at what they do.

[02:05:50] You know when you watch Shark Tank or Dragon's Den here in Canada where they have a company

[02:05:57] and they pitch it to the people of the investors, right?

[02:06:00] I've never watched it, but I know of it.

[02:06:03] You are familiar with it.

[02:06:04] I am familiar.

[02:06:05] They often tell people to cut their losses and get out and move on that their idea is dumb

[02:06:10] and never going to make money.

[02:06:12] This is a prime example that when J-pop first noticed that he was in over his head, he

[02:06:18] should have cut his losses, sucked it up, failed and moved on.

[02:06:22] Let's sit down and have another segment of Life Lessons with Dave.

[02:06:27] Through failure, Ron, we learn.

[02:06:30] But if we're scared of the embarrassment or the shame of failing and we keep on pushing

[02:06:36] we only dig that hole deeper.

[02:06:39] Till we end up hitting a sewage pipe.

[02:06:41] Wow, deep man.

[02:06:44] Through failure we succeed.

[02:06:46] There I said it in one line like that.

[02:06:49] Hey Stewie, we need you to read this again.

[02:06:57] Evily, you can't just pre-record this.

[02:07:00] Whatever, let's see.

[02:07:02] As always, you can send your comments, questions, corrections and concerns to Civivol Chronicle.

[02:07:07] Wait a minute.

[02:07:08] That's spelled wrong.

[02:07:09] You're telling me to say the wrong thing.

[02:07:11] Oh, it is.

[02:07:12] Oh great, great job there Dennis.

[02:07:15] Never trust anyone with two first names, that's what I say.

[02:07:18] Let me try it again.

[02:07:19] As always, you can send your comments, questions, corrections and concerns to Civivol Chronicles

[02:07:23] with an S at gmail.com.

[02:07:25] We look forward to all your messages and we read every one.

[02:07:36] Remember to leave us a five-star review wherever you found us or on this week in Kimpol's

[02:07:40] promoted database.

[02:07:42] That way more people can find us and then maybe we can make more of that flipping out

[02:07:46] money.

[02:07:47] What we did.

[02:07:48] That's a new one.

[02:07:49] That's not usually in there.

[02:07:50] Yes, Stewie, we're all set.

[02:07:52] You can go.

[02:07:53] Yeah, that is new.

[02:07:55] More flipping out money, okay.

[02:07:57] The players are taking the field.

[02:08:20] The entire podcast is literally just World Cup soccer.

[02:08:26] Yeah, I mean, it's a Canadian.

[02:08:33] Yeah, I was reading a notes.

[02:08:39] You forgot an important information.

[02:08:43] So I'm the official J-pop guy.

[02:08:46] But I don't have the accent.

[02:08:49] J-pop says all of the people, whatever I say, that I think I'm like one of those old,

[02:08:54] like you see, the cow says contract manufacturer called, I just had it in my head.

[02:09:02] That's a weird name for a company.

[02:09:03] I just had it in my head.

[02:09:05] What did you think of that?

[02:09:06] Was that a good episode?

[02:09:07] We'll see.

[02:09:08] Okay.

[02:09:09] We didn't go through all the games like we usually do.

[02:09:11] I know, that's more like reading posts on the internet.

[02:09:15] So we'll see how people like that.

[02:09:17] Yeah, yeah, that's a whole thing.

[02:09:20] I didn't get to do my drum part.
