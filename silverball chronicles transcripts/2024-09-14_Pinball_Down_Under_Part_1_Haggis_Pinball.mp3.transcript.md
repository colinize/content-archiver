[00:00] The Pinball Network is online.

[00:07] Launching.

[00:08] Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:14] Remember, no opinions here.

[00:15] This is all about the facts.

[00:17] We don't want to get anyone too mad.

[00:31] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me, this month like every month is Ron.

[00:53] The Uncanny Hallet.

[00:55] How you doing?

[00:56] The Uncanny Hallet.

[00:59] I'm like the X-Men.

[01:01] I'm on Canny.

[01:02] No, it has no tie-in whatsoever to Stern's latest release.

[01:06] I just pulled that out of my head.

[01:07] It's my only date this episode, but yes.

[01:09] A theme which I am super happy about.

[01:14] Love me the Uncanny X-Men.

[01:16] I've got a bunch of old comic books and stuff.

[01:18] Some old Spiderman and Iron Man.

[01:21] Not as much X-Men as I'd like because those comics are pricey.

[01:25] You don't have any comics.

[01:26] You're not a comic book.

[01:27] I have Viva's and Buddy comic.

[01:29] That's cool.

[01:30] That's a Dylush and comic.

[01:32] Did they just give those away?

[01:33] At Expo on the Reveal.

[01:36] Nice.

[01:37] That's the exciting stuff that's happening in the hobby right now.

[01:41] A few new releases.

[01:42] We're moving into the fall release schedule.

[01:45] Apparently, Avatar is on the horizon from J.J.P.

[01:48] We've got some pretty exciting stuff when it comes to current events,

[01:52] but nobody tunes into this show for current events.

[01:55] Except this episode.

[01:57] Except this episode.

[01:59] This episode is a bit topical.

[02:01] This topic came up sort of quickly.

[02:03] It was been a wonderful summer.

[02:05] I hope you've had a wonderful summer.

[02:07] Two Ron.

[02:08] We've had sort of a nice relaxing month and a half off.

[02:12] Well, you can join us over on Patreon where you can hear about all of the musings of Ron and I

[02:17] about the latest episodes.

[02:19] You can pop in for a month or two and leave just to say thank you.

[02:23] That would be pretty awesome.

[02:25] We have free memberships where you can join in.

[02:28] But of course, if you want to get some of the extras,

[02:32] you got to jump on for $3 a month.

[02:35] If you want to become a premium crony at $6 a month, you get a free sticker.

[02:39] After a three month stay, you get access to our private discord chat room.

[02:45] You can always get your comments read on the episodes.

[02:51] We want to welcome Mike, Carl, Dan, and Erica along with Mr. Jake,

[02:57] 22.

[02:58] Didn't leave his real name or their real name.

[03:01] We wanted to say thank you for joining us.

[03:05] Who's your favorite of those people, Ron?

[03:07] Now, Mr. Jake.

[03:09] The rest of them, they don't matter.

[03:12] Too normal, but Mr. Jake, you know.

[03:14] If you don't want to join us on Patreon, you don't want to do any of that stuff.

[03:17] You can also just look us up on Facebook with Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[03:22] And as always, we want to remind you, please leave us a five star review wherever you found us

[03:27] on your podcasting app or any of those places.

[03:30] That way more people can find us.

[03:32] It helps us out with the algorithm.

[03:33] There's four stars as the highest.

[03:35] Just leave us five.

[03:37] Exactly.

[03:38] Exactly.

[03:39] You might have to write in to your pod catcher and be like,

[03:42] I need another star because this podcast is so good.

[03:47] And you can continue to make us the number one monthly rated podcast in.

[03:53] I mean, I can't really prove it.

[03:57] We are.

[03:58] We are corrections and comments from the previous episode.

[04:02] We did a multi-morphic episode last episode.

[04:04] It was kind of fun.

[04:05] It was a bit different, little more modern.

[04:08] So we've had over the last little while.

[04:11] We've had feedback into the mail bag over at silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[04:18] A lot of people were like, oh, I wish you do this niche part of the hobby.

[04:23] Or I wish you would do this one.

[04:24] Or where's the bingo?

[04:25] Or let's do a wedgehead episode or whatever.

[04:27] And that's where I think the latest series that's coming up is going to fit as well.

[04:33] It's a very niche set of episodes coming up here in the next sort of sprint into the winter.

[04:41] I think I'm excited because we get some neat little feedback about these niche episodes as opposed to the ones that everybody loves,

[04:48] the ballet, Williams, the Steve Richies.

[04:50] Let's do something a bit different.

[04:52] And we get a little more engagement with some of these because people are very passionate about their niches within the hobby.

[04:57] Isn't that right?

[04:58] I like the sprint into winter line.

[05:00] That was nice.

[05:01] I like that.

[05:02] That's very Canadian.

[05:03] Oh, yeah.

[05:04] We sprint into winter and right onto the snowmobile.

[05:07] So what about Mike?

[05:08] Mike left us some feedback on the last couple of episodes.

[05:12] He says, loyal listener here of the podcast.

[05:15] I listen to every episode.

[05:16] Does that include bingo?

[05:17] No comment.

[05:18] Oh, for some reason, I simply can't get on board with multi-morphic games.

[05:23] I also played the weird owl when visiting Arcadia and Portland and I hated it.

[05:28] Okay.

[05:29] The play field felt incredibly empty to me because of the screen and I don't really understand the concept of swapping out games or who would really want that unless the previous game was terrible.

[05:39] The mixing of technologies is interesting, but I don't feel like it's been done very well.

[05:43] I feel like the pinball 2000 got a little bit closer and even made me uncomfortable.

[05:48] Oh, even that made me uncomfortable.

[05:50] I say either go fully virtual or stay mechanical.

[05:53] Okay.

[05:54] Thanks a bunch for the feedback there, Mike.

[05:56] I think weird owl is like the one that I generally like the most.

[06:00] I didn't get to play Scott Denise's game.

[06:07] What is that one called again?

[06:08] Final resistance.

[06:09] Final resistance.

[06:10] It's a quite a mystery history.

[06:11] You can get it.

[06:12] Yes, final resistance.

[06:13] That's my favorite.

[06:14] Yeah, so I haven't got to play that one yet, but I really liked weird owl.

[06:17] I thought that one was really cool.

[06:19] Although I understand the critique, I get it.

[06:22] Like, tri-final resistance.

[06:24] It's more pinbally.

[06:25] If you can find one, I don't know if they make very many of them, which I find disappointing.

[06:29] Well, let's get into this month's topic.

[06:31] Are you excited and ready?

[06:32] I'm excited and ready.

[06:33] I see your Canadian spelling of labor in the notes here.

[06:37] Yes.

[06:38] But the extra view for some reason.

[06:41] I don't know why that's there.

[06:42] Labor.

[06:43] Labor.

[06:44] Yeah, exactly.

[06:45] We don't pronounce it that way.

[06:46] It doesn't make any sense.

[06:47] See in America, we remove those extra letters.

[06:50] Not made it.

[06:51] Yeah, we just, we take those letters out and we replace it with a gun.

[06:55] No, we shoot it out with a gun, see.

[06:58] Yeah, oh, I forgot to mention before we get into the topic this month, a pinball bar has opened in my hometown.

[07:06] Oh, my good friend, Dylan, has opened flippens, pinball at arcade.

[07:12] And it is in a awesome location.

[07:17] Downtown in Fredrinen, I was there last night for opening night, which is why I sound a little bit raspy.

[07:22] A few ciders and I enjoyed my time there.

[07:27] It was, it was, it was hopping.

[07:28] What was it called?

[07:29] It's called flippens spell that.

[07:31] F-L-I-P-P-I-N-S.

[07:35] Is it like apostrophe S or just, I think it's just S.

[07:40] Okay.

[07:41] Yeah.

[07:42] No, no, don't like, I don't want to get into the, the spellings and the-

[07:46] Oh no, it's just flippin'.

[07:48] I was just trying to figure out how that was spelled.

[07:50] Is it called flippensay?

[07:52] Flippensay?

[07:53] Yeah, there you go.

[07:54] Yeah, come on in here and sit down and have a good time and have yourself a pint, eh?

[07:58] Yeah.

[07:59] Your Hooser?

[08:00] It's great.

[08:01] So I'm super happy about that.

[08:03] Iron Maiden Star Wars are the latest machines that he's got there.

[08:07] Cool.

[08:08] And in the back he's got a Jurassic Park that he's got a couple tweaks on, but we got some modern.

[08:13] I mean, those are not the latest releases by any means.

[08:17] I have all those games.

[08:18] I like it already.

[08:19] Yeah, he'll eventually gear up, I think, with newer releases.

[08:22] But at the moment, guess what game they have?

[08:25] And I think it's probably one of the only, like, maybe two or three on location, like, in North America.

[08:30] Oh, a punny factory.

[08:31] Oh god.

[08:32] What?

[08:33] I don't even want to talk about that.

[08:36] I'm sorry.

[08:37] I figured I'd use a Canadian company.

[08:39] No.

[08:40] That's terrible.

[08:41] A terrible game.

[08:43] Oh, okay.

[08:44] Hotdoggan.

[08:45] Oh, hotdoggan.

[08:47] Okay.

[08:48] Bally's hotdoggan.

[08:50] I mean, probably the best outback skiing theme.

[08:53] Better the wipeout?

[08:55] Better than wipeout because it's got cowboy hats.

[08:58] And it's got matching 70s style winter coats.

[09:02] Mustaches.

[09:03] Don't forget mustaches.

[09:04] Oh, it's so good.

[09:05] So if you're, if you got a hanker and for that, you got to come to my hometown.

[09:08] I know it's a pain in the butt for anybody to fly into from outside of, you know, basically

[09:13] a two hour radius of driving.

[09:15] But man, this bar is pretty great.

[09:17] I'm not.

[09:18] I'm very jealous that I did not open a bar.

[09:21] I'll tell you that.

[09:25] Manufacturing is hard.

[09:28] Pinball is hard.

[09:30] And when you're starting on the other side of the world from all the suppliers and skilled

[09:34] labor, it's that much harder.

[09:39] COVID-19 did not help.

[09:41] Haggis pinball either.

[09:42] Haggis pinball is the latest cautionary tale of a pinball startup who promised big and

[09:49] initially delivered, but ultimately succumbed to the pressures of the industry and the struggles

[09:57] of management.

[09:58] Ooh, this month we're getting into it, Ron.

[10:02] You said it.

[10:03] The body is not even cold.

[10:05] Yeah.

[10:06] So Haggis pinball is the topic this month.

[10:11] And when Haggis collapsed, I thought, oh, there's a great topic because I had already

[10:15] been working on a series of pinball episodes based on Australia.

[10:24] This is part one of pinball down under Haggis pinball.

[10:29] The research for this episode has been a little bit more difficult than it had been for

[10:35] previous episodes.

[10:36] And that's because a lot of Haggis's online presence has all but disappeared.

[10:42] Yeah, they pulled everything when they went under everything, the YouTube page, the websites,

[10:48] the whole thing, Solgon.

[10:50] So to be able to find a lot of the content, I'm relying on a couple of podcast episodes

[10:57] and YouTube episodes done by Damien, who is the owner, was the owner of Haggis pinball.

[11:07] All of the links are in the show notes or on the website, silverballcronacles.com.

[11:13] We're talking about Carrie Hardy's YouTube series, his interview with Haggis, unboxing

[11:19] the truth, which we'll get into at the, towards the end of the episode, NAPR Cades article

[11:24] and some work from the kineticist pinball news.

[11:28] And as mentioned before, pinball profile.

[11:32] But I want to point out that some of these sources are glorified or trumped up or made

[11:42] to be exciting and entertaining and less to do with the actual sort of background of

[11:49] the company.

[11:50] So we're spending a lot of time, there's a caution for this episode that some of the third

[11:57] party sources that we've used to collect some of this information have done a phenomenal

[12:01] job.

[12:03] Some of them, an okay job and some of them is have some blank spots.

[12:09] Does that make sense?

[12:10] Perfect sense, sir.

[12:12] It does, I didn't ramble too much on that one, I hope.

[12:14] You ramble, but not too much.

[12:16] Oh, that's perfect, perfect.

[12:19] Damien Hartin joined the hobby in 2018 when he bought his first pinball machine, a pin

[12:24] bot.

[12:25] Ron, this is the same year that I joined the hobby.

[12:29] Wow.

[12:30] I joined the hobby in the fall of 2018.

[12:34] I'm one of these.

[12:35] Noobs.

[12:36] You're one of these five years now, right?

[12:39] So I'm over the five year.

[12:40] I'm still a noob to me.

[12:42] Still a noob to you.

[12:43] What about these other folk that have joined like during the pandemic?

[12:46] What about those people?

[12:47] Super noobs.

[12:48] Okay.

[12:49] And you joined in like, was it six, 2006, 2004, 2004?

[12:55] Good Lord.

[12:56] Twenty years.

[12:57] That's wild to be in that.

[12:59] And Bruce Nightingale from your other podcast.

[13:02] That's the slam till podcast.

[13:04] He started in like the 80s when it was still cool.

[13:07] He got his first game.

[13:08] Yeah, when he was a kid, a kiss.

[13:11] That's a pretty good one.

[13:12] I mean, not a great game, but it's a good.

[13:14] I don't mind, kiss.

[13:15] It's all right.

[13:16] It's all right.

[13:17] It's all right.

[13:18] Now, that seems kind of new to the hobby to begin your own company, doesn't it?

[13:28] That is pretty new.

[13:29] That's pretty new.

[13:30] I mean, if you had a long history of, well, actually, yeah, scratch that, Ron.

[13:37] He literally got in in 2018.

[13:39] He didn't come from a manufacturing background.

[13:42] He didn't come from the hobby in the background.

[13:45] He didn't come from gaming, the gaming sort of coin op world.

[13:50] He was an IT professional.

[13:52] And his company, Hart's Co, actually worked in property development and home automation.

[13:58] So he had sort of his own businesses elsewhere.

[14:02] He was a business person.

[14:05] And all that time building these business and working on a few things.

[14:09] And then all of a sudden, one day, he bought a pin-bot, which is a pretty darn good first

[14:14] game to get into, isn't it?

[14:16] They sold a ton of them.

[14:17] It's got to be good.

[14:18] Yeah.

[14:19] I mean, yours was black night.

[14:20] Your first game was black night.

[14:22] Yep.

[14:23] Also, very good first entry game.

[14:25] I mean, also made it out of them.

[14:27] Also made it out of them.

[14:28] My first game was tag team from Gottlieb.

[14:32] Ooh.

[14:33] It didn't make very many of them at all.

[14:35] I like tag team.

[14:36] It's not.

[14:37] Tag team's green.

[14:38] Yeah.

[14:39] Pinbots like an A level entry title.

[14:41] Besides your, you know, your ballet Williams kind of attack remarks style, but like early

[14:45] sort of Alfa Numeric kind of as from Williams, the awesome company of the industry.

[14:52] And it's not Alfa Numeric, it's actually, oh no, it is Alfa Numeric.

[14:55] It's the early Alfa Numeric with the Alfa Numeric displays and then just number displays

[15:02] that they needed to be getting.

[15:04] So he got the bug.

[15:05] He got the bug early and hard.

[15:08] He jumped in quick.

[15:09] Because when most people get into the hobby, they go, I want to, I'm an adult.

[15:12] I've got disposable income.

[15:14] I got to buy a pinball machine and then they look at a pinbot and it's $3,000 and they

[15:18] go, wait, well, no, no, no, that's not going to happen.

[15:20] That's what I would say at this point.

[15:21] But what a Damien say.

[15:23] Damien says, at the stall is simply a Kai, no, I can't do that.

[15:28] No, I can't do that.

[15:30] We can't.

[15:31] We can't do that.

[15:32] Yeah.

[15:33] Damien says, at the start, it was just simply a case of me understanding what the big picture

[15:38] was.

[15:39] We got to build a pinball machine because I was having to learn everything.

[15:43] I was just biting off each chunk as I went.

[15:45] Well, they need to know how to do X.

[15:47] So I sat down and figured out how to do X and then I moved on to Y and then I moved on

[15:52] to Z.

[15:53] It all seemed fairly, oh God, he's Australian.

[15:57] So that's what they would say.

[15:59] Yeah.

[16:00] They say Z.

[16:01] Yeah, like everybody else in the world.

[16:03] I have never heard that ever until I can't can it.

[16:07] I didn't, okay.

[16:09] It all seemed fairly logical in the order that I needed to go in because I couldn't flip

[16:13] a play field until I cut a play field and then I couldn't put code in until I had control

[16:18] systems.

[16:19] So he goes from buying his first machine to I want to build a machine.

[16:23] Yep.

[16:24] It's pretty wild to think that somebody who just joins the hobby immediately goes from

[16:27] buying a couple of machines to I'm going to build a machine.

[16:31] It takes a different kind of person to jump right into home brood, isn't it?

[16:34] Oh yeah.

[16:35] Like it's like that engineering kind of mindset that, you know, IT professional nerd thing.

[16:43] There tends to go right into home.

[16:45] That is true.

[16:46] There are a lot of us IT professional nerds who are home broers.

[16:48] That is true.

[16:49] Yeah.

[16:50] Like me, who's more of the sort of the collector.

[16:55] I love to have people over to entertain and have fun and barbecue and things like that.

[17:00] I'm not I'm not building my own machine for my friends, right?

[17:04] I'm bringing them over and playing.

[17:06] I'm the non IT person.

[17:07] They like to have barbecue and fun and have friends and stuff, you know, unlike those

[17:11] IT people.

[17:12] That's not what I mean.

[17:13] That's totally what you meant.

[17:15] All right.

[17:17] Well, everybody send your hate mail to silverballcroticles.gemail.com.

[17:23] But I hope you know what I mean that there's different people in the hobby that have different

[17:27] personalities that gravitate towards different things.

[17:31] And I'm sure there's plenty of IT professionals that love to have barbecue and friends.

[17:35] You got me on that one.

[17:38] Damien would then start to become plugged into the Australian pinball scene and Australia,

[17:44] I guess probably a little bit like Canada fairly vast, very different climates and spots

[17:49] around the country.

[17:51] And you know, we have an eclectic mix of groups.

[17:54] This sort of the group here in Atlanta, Canada, we all kind of know each other.

[17:58] We're all very friendly with those from the Northeast.

[18:01] There's the Ontario crowd, the Quebec crowd for the tournament scenes.

[18:05] They tend to mix a whole lot.

[18:07] You get into sort of Western or Central Canada into BC.

[18:11] So we all have those areas, but we all generally know each other and have heard our names and

[18:15] things like that.

[18:16] We all get along fairly well.

[18:18] It's the same thing in Australia.

[18:21] There's a lot of traveling between provinces.

[18:23] There's a lot of events between provinces, but some of the more popular names are those

[18:28] of Martin Robbins and Ryan C, formerly of head-to-head pinball podcast, the pinball podcast

[18:34] that got me into this hobby.

[18:37] And Dr. John from the Aussie pinball podcast and former streamer for the pinball network.

[18:44] Damien, while going to some tournaments and events, started to network.

[18:49] And he was trying to get some help to build out this company that he envisioned Hages,

[18:56] because he's gone from thinking of building homebrew to actually manufacturing pinball machines.

[19:01] Because it must be pretty easy.

[19:03] Now this is Damien from February of 2020, one a month before a certain thing happened.

[19:09] Damien says, Martin, being Robbins, has been it invaluable.

[19:13] Ryan C as well.

[19:14] Ryan came over and had a flip of the white wood before it even got to Texas pinball fest.

[19:19] He made a suggestion and we implemented that change.

[19:22] Yeah, so he's getting some feedback.

[19:24] He's bumping into a few people.

[19:26] Now Texas pinball festival 2019 was only a few months away.

[19:31] And Damien was trying to gather together all of these bits and pieces to make a pinball

[19:35] machine and start a company and to get it to Tpf.

[19:41] So when he's being interviewed a year later in 2022, he's talking about helping into

[19:46] I'm sorry, 2020, he's able to then sort of talk about, oh, well, I bumped into these

[19:51] people and asked them for some advice.

[19:53] This is what I call the outsider's perspective.

[19:56] And this is like a disease in every industry for some reason.

[20:00] People kind of come into an industry car manufacturing pinball, financial services, IT, whatever

[20:08] you want to do.

[20:09] And like they think they have like a couple of good ideas.

[20:12] And if they can implement those good ideas, they'll be the next Tesla or they'll be the

[20:17] next Facebook or they'll revolutionize the industry somehow.

[20:21] And it's like these delusions of grandeur.

[20:23] I know that that sounds a bit mean, but that's kind of what happens is in any industry

[20:29] somebody's like, why doesn't the industry just do this?

[20:32] And it would just revolutionize everything.

[20:35] That's called the deeper method.

[20:36] Damien says that he's coming from a position of no real recent history in pinball.

[20:41] I guess I have no preconceptions about what you did or didn't do with a pinball machine.

[20:48] Now a lot of people see that as the outsider's perspective, right?

[20:53] Like I don't have the bias of previous pinball companies, right?

[20:57] Stern does everything the way Stern does because they're stuck in their ways and they're

[21:01] moving large ship and they can't change.

[21:05] Often people coming in with no major history.

[21:08] But then that also has a problem, right?

[21:11] Sometimes you don't know what you don't know.

[21:14] You mentioned deep root.

[21:15] Yeah, they tried to change everything.

[21:17] It turns out that's expensive and probably not a good idea.

[21:21] Well then you probably want to reach out for advice, right?

[21:25] As you'll find out in the pinball down under series that we're just starting today,

[21:30] there are many people in Australia that have, I would say, just a vast amount of advice

[21:38] and knowledge being that you have it in front of me.

[21:40] I would say Wayne.

[21:42] And who's Wayne?

[21:43] See, I never know how to say his last name.

[21:44] It's either Wayne Gilear or Gilear, but I remember him from when I got into the hobby

[21:50] because he purchased, he bought the Williams rights.

[21:53] Didn't that was Williams rights?

[21:55] Were those purchased by Gene Cunningham?

[21:57] Well, that's the thing.

[22:00] I don't think what people realize Williams still owns the stuff.

[22:04] They let you have the rights to do stuff with them, but they still retain ownership.

[22:10] So you can have rights to multiple people.

[22:13] So Gene had rights.

[22:14] He had exclusive rights for five years.

[22:18] And then non-exclusive rights thereafter.

[22:20] And then Wayne came into the picture and he bought in in 2005.

[22:25] And I think to this day, he actually, one of his screen names like Bally, Penball or something

[22:29] like that because he still retains some of the stuff like, for example, I bought a brand

[22:37] new Who Done It Trans like from Fronald Strike because he still sells that stuff.

[22:42] Let's, we'll get into more about Wayne Gilear in our next episode.

[22:46] But he advised Damien that this was a bad idea because Wayne tried to build games.

[22:53] He did.

[22:54] He tried, he had the rights and he was going to make things in Australia and ship them

[22:57] back over and he was going to make medieval manduces and he discovered that was expensive.

[23:03] Wayne says it's cheaper in the long one to order parts from overseas.

[23:08] We're there made in the US.

[23:10] Otherwise you got to tool up for them in Australia and spend money on tooling plus the cost

[23:14] of manufacturing, which is too high here.

[23:17] I'll give you one example.

[23:18] I looked at getting pinball legs made in Australia.

[23:21] You needed a 200 ton press to make the legs out of cold roll steel.

[23:25] The tool is about 40,000 Australian.

[23:28] If you wanted to run the legs, you had to run a minimum of 10,000 of them and they're

[23:32] going to be about $10 each.

[23:35] Then they were going to cost about $10 Australian each to plate them.

[23:38] You're up for a heap of money.

[23:40] I could buy the legs from America from the original manufacturer for $6.50 already played

[23:45] it, meaning $6.50.

[23:47] There he is, he's saying, if you want to manufacture, you have to tool up.

[23:52] Tooling up is a manufacturing thing.

[23:55] I'm not a manufacturer.

[23:56] I don't know anything about manufacturing.

[23:59] What I've learned through this podcast and talking to fellows, some tool makers, one of

[24:06] our cronies, Derek, is that you have to tool up.

[24:11] You have to be able to make the thing.

[24:14] To make the thing, you have to have the tools to make the thing.

[24:17] In this case, it's a 200 ton press.

[24:21] It smashes the steel together, makes a leg.

[24:24] You take the leg, you get it like powder coated or plated, so it doesn't rust and stuff

[24:30] like that, and then you're done.

[24:33] It's going to cost you at least $20 Australian to make 10,000 legs when you could just buy

[24:42] them for $6.50.

[24:45] The economies of scale and cost is through the roof.

[24:48] Why wouldn't you listen to somebody like Wayne Gilear?

[24:52] Well, Wayne is a strong personality, is he not?

[24:55] Oh, yes.

[24:56] Yes, he is.

[24:57] Have you go to Pinside right now and you can see he's still quite the strong person now?

[25:01] Yes, that's right.

[25:02] Any interviews that he's done on podcasts, I'm sure he's a fantastic person, and I would

[25:08] love to chat with him sometime if I ever see him at a convention, which I probably never

[25:12] will.

[25:13] I believe he's still one of the biggest distributors.

[25:16] Yeah, Mr. Pinball is huge.

[25:17] Mr. Pinball Australia.

[25:19] So the idea, but he's like, he'll tell you right where he doesn't powder coat at, or he

[25:23] doesn't sugar coat anything, but he doesn't powder coat anything.

[25:26] That's funny.

[25:27] He doesn't sugar coat anything.

[25:29] He tells you like it is, and he could be right, he could be wrong, but he's very confident

[25:34] in what he says and what he does.

[25:36] Do you remember the clear coat wars of the 2010s, right?

[25:40] Oh, they're still going on.

[25:42] You could have a whole, yeah, you could have a whole tech conversation on that.

[25:46] Which reply bore people.

[25:49] But you know, each manufacturer, like Jersey Jack had a period where they were having clear

[25:53] coat issues and people were upset and Stern had clear coat issues.

[25:58] And I had a run of even spooky had a run of TNAs that had issues, which of course was

[26:04] one of the ones I had.

[26:06] It's like, it's like the shiny coat that goes on top of the wood and art to keep it

[26:10] from getting damaged and let's the ball roll around.

[26:13] And the other issues with that is less and less people are actually silkscreening the

[26:18] playfields anymore.

[26:19] They're just doing direct printing.

[26:21] So you start losing the clear coat and it starts, it's taken the art off with the clear

[26:25] coat in ways that you've never seen before.

[26:28] But I mean, playfield issues have always kind of been a problem in the entire industry

[26:33] forever, right?

[26:34] Like you look at all those old ballet games, those playfields are roached.

[26:38] They are just destroyed a lot of them.

[26:41] Yeah.

[26:42] But the main thing is in the 90s, Williams had the diamond plate and everything seemed

[26:47] to be great.

[26:48] And it fast forward to now and things don't seem to be as good as they were in the 90s.

[26:52] And people are wondering why is that?

[26:54] Yeah.

[26:55] I mean, that probably has something to do with chemical processing and, you know, nowadays

[26:59] you can't just smoke a cigarette and spray a bunch of, you know, this stuff on in the

[27:05] middle of a factory with nobody wearing masks.

[27:08] One of the only places that still does silkscreen for the playfields, I think is in Germany, the

[27:15] ones who do it for, they do it for Piedrelli.

[27:20] So like the pinball brother games are actually silkscreened.

[27:24] I think for Dutch, they also do it for Dutch.

[27:27] Cool.

[27:28] And I think it's really unnecessary info.

[27:30] But it was an endless, endless conversation.

[27:33] Endless.

[27:34] It still people made content and videos and over and over on podcasts.

[27:40] Some podcasters made an entire career about blaming clear code.

[27:44] Well, Damien came up with a brilliant idea came up with an idea.

[27:48] I mean, if you could stop this from happening, have an indestructible playfield.

[27:54] So Damien says, I probably followed the same past as all the manufacturers do with typical

[27:59] playfield construction and we suffered the same problems that everyone's talking about

[28:03] at the moment, which is dimpling and pooling.

[28:05] We're not shipping yet, but shipping usually comes after pooling in a period of time.

[28:09] I wanted to resolve that and I saw that as a big thing.

[28:13] I wanted to come up with a way to have that as a non-issue moving forward.

[28:17] I sat down and looked with some very clever people and we've come up with a new hybrid

[28:22] substrate for our playfields.

[28:24] It's a combined plywood and acrylic top.

[28:27] Wow.

[28:28] Okay.

[28:29] So he comes up with this idea.

[28:30] You got your playfield with all the stuff on it and then you put a thin layer of plastic

[28:35] on it, which has the art adhered to it.

[28:40] But that's going to scratch though, right?

[28:43] You think it's going to get all scratchy and gross?

[28:46] While through the winter of 2019 and 2020, Haggis made a test fixture, which would roll

[28:51] a ball around over and over and over again and they would bring up like some 200,000 passes

[28:57] on a single piece of this acrylic substrate.

[29:03] Without a single mark?

[29:04] Not a single scratch or mark over that.

[29:06] George Gomez has mentioned and I don't have the source for this, but I remember distinctly

[29:10] making a note in my head and being like, oh, George Gomez has mentioned multiple times

[29:16] about hard tops or plastic playfields or some people get those, what are those called?

[29:22] Those playfield protectors.

[29:24] Overlays.

[29:25] Yeah.

[29:26] The overlays playfield protectors that you get from Germany made of this like fancy plastic.

[29:32] Now he says that those are terrible, not because they don't protect the game, but because

[29:38] they change the behavior of the ball.

[29:40] At the ball's characteristics, it's coefficient, the rubbing nests against the wood of the

[29:47] playfield changes and that changes the way the game works.

[29:52] Do you agree with that?

[29:53] It does change the way the ball rolls.

[29:56] It's not a new thing.

[29:57] I mean, companies have done overlays, got leave, did experiments.

[30:01] Remember what's the vitograph, vitograph, whatever it's called, playfields, uh, electra.

[30:06] You ever, yep.

[30:07] You ever play electra?

[30:09] Yes.

[30:10] Like the entire main playfield has a sheet of, it's a sheet over it.

[30:17] I can't remember what it is like plastic, whatever.

[30:19] It's clear.

[30:20] So you notice on any electra, there's never anywhere on that particular playfield.

[30:25] Hmm.

[30:25] But there'll be like where in the upper playfield and the lower playfield and as the ball gets kind

[30:30] of crappier or rusty or whatever, which is what happened a lot in the 90s when everything

[30:34] shut down and everybody just sort of sold off their machines and they ended up in basements

[30:38] and nobody could buy a pinball anymore.

[30:39] They just use the, the terrible scratch to a ball.

[30:42] I think you could buy a pinball.

[30:44] I think they just didn't know.

[30:46] You shouldn't be playing with rusty balls.

[30:48] Yeah.

[30:49] But, but you'd think stern, the industry leader would spend research dollars trying to

[30:56] find a better quality playfield, right?

[30:58] The thing is, it costs money to get, I think the supply just isn't there.

[31:05] You can't get the wood at the derometer, like the hardness of, like Williams did in the

[31:09] 90s seemingly anymore.

[31:11] Or if you can, it must be so absurdly expensive.

[31:13] It's just not worth it.

[31:14] Yeah.

[31:15] So it's a cost-benefit thing.

[31:17] But then there's also like, well, why doesn't Stern just put an acrylic cover on all

[31:22] of their pinball machines?

[31:23] Well, they've done the research.

[31:25] They know.

[31:26] It's not just Gomez or Gary Stern sitting in an office being like, that extra $3 is too

[31:32] expensive per machine.

[31:34] They're going like, no.

[31:35] It changes the characteristics of the game.

[31:36] It's not pinball.

[31:38] Or they've done the research to try to find a better pinball, but it shoots different.

[31:43] They've got a good idea.

[31:44] So he's got to staff up.

[31:45] They do the research.

[31:46] They're bringing in a few people.

[31:48] And one of those persons is a Greg Silby, and he was the Keltz programmer.

[31:53] Keltz?

[31:54] What's Keltz?

[31:55] Keltz would be their first game.

[31:57] But to be able to release their first game, they got to have the staff to do it.

[32:02] Well, Greg said, so we're sitting in a tournament having a bit of a chat and how things

[32:06] were going.

[32:07] And he says it's going to be a tight schedule.

[32:09] And I mistakenly said, is there anything I can do to help?

[32:13] You're hired.

[32:14] That's it.

[32:15] The funny thing about pinball is that we're all very passionate.

[32:18] We all are very caring individuals.

[32:20] Even the people who are mean generally are very caring people.

[32:24] We want to help other people.

[32:26] We want to do things.

[32:27] And you know what?

[32:28] It's kind of fun.

[32:29] So why wouldn't I help out?

[32:30] The thing to bring up about Keltz, Keltz does not have that new play field stuff yet.

[32:35] That's right.

[32:36] Just to not get confused about the order we went over that.

[32:39] Mm-hmm.

[32:40] So Keltz was, and get this, this is written on the internet pinball database.

[32:45] It is a world people's theme.

[32:48] World people's theme.

[32:50] World people's theme.

[32:51] Usually I make up silly themes for some of these games.

[32:53] That one is one that I did not make up.

[32:55] It's designed by Damien Hurtin, mechanics by Damien Hurtin.

[32:59] Hurt by Sam Greenwood, sound by Casey Dene and the software, as mentioned by Greg

[33:05] Silby.

[33:06] So what's a Kelt?

[33:07] I had no idea what that was.

[33:09] Yeah.

[33:10] So a Keltz is an Irish or British person, but technically a Keltz primarily refers to

[33:19] a person speaking a Celtic language rather than an actual ethnic group.

[33:25] Damien says that he is of Scottish heritage and the game is built around a Scottish games

[33:30] theme.

[33:31] However, I don't entirely think that they're actually considered Keltz, right?

[33:37] I have no idea.

[33:38] Anyway, but I get it.

[33:39] That's fun.

[33:40] It's cool theme, I think, right?

[33:42] We didn't even go into what Haggis means.

[33:44] So what is a Haggis?

[33:45] I'm looking out right here.

[33:47] It's a food.

[33:48] Haggis is a savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck, minced with chopped onion,

[33:55] oatmeal, something I can't pronounce, spices and salt mixed with stock and cooked while

[34:01] traditionally encased in animal and the animal stomach.

[34:05] Yes.

[34:06] Whoa.

[34:07] Yeah.

[34:08] So I mean, well, think about it.

[34:09] It's like a really thick, dense kind of sausage kind of thing.

[34:15] And it's a Scottish thing, according to this.

[34:16] So it is.

[34:17] Yeah.

[34:18] So the name of the company and their first game was heavily going towards that Damien's

[34:23] Scottish heritage.

[34:24] It's actually Haggis.

[34:25] You got to say it like that.

[34:27] You can't just say Haggis.

[34:28] You're going to say Haggis.

[34:29] We're going to eat some Haggis.

[34:32] Freedom.

[34:33] Oh, no way.

[34:34] That's freedom to eat things in the stomach of an animal.

[34:39] But there was also another couple of really neat innovations here.

[34:44] One of them was that it didn't have a back glass or a trans light.

[34:49] It actually had an 8-millimeter piece of acrylic that was a fixed to magnets on the

[34:54] back box.

[34:55] And why do you think none of the big manufacturers use a back box with magnets and acrylic?

[35:03] There might be an issue.

[35:05] Well, to be fair, Jersey Jack actually has magnets in their back box.

[35:11] They hold the, they prevent the screen from coming out, not falling out, but like when

[35:17] you want to pull it out on its arm.

[35:19] Okay.

[35:20] It's easier than just making a, because he used to have a clear.

[35:24] I'm getting way too much into that stuff, if.

[35:26] But this is the episode.

[35:27] This is what makes us unique from all of those other episodes.

[35:30] Well, Celts, if we look at a few things here, now Ron, I know you and quite a few listeners

[35:38] who write in quite often will be disappointed.

[35:40] There is no flyer for Haggis.

[35:43] I did, I did play this one.

[35:45] However, there is a advertising card.

[35:50] And the advertising card basically has the art of Celts, let the games begin on one side.

[35:55] And then on the other side has the actual purchasing prices in USD.

[36:02] Yep.

[36:03] And it had some unique things that I see the Ron here.

[36:07] I remember it.

[36:08] Like you could pay extra and get yourself in the game for an extra thousand dollars.

[36:14] You could have your clan's name added to the back glass.

[36:18] So your clan being your last name, Dennis or Hallett or whatever.

[36:23] And then it would also be a custom call out with your name.

[36:27] Yep.

[36:28] And if you happen to be of Scottish heritage, you could add in the game's art and in its

[36:34] custom code, your tartans color.

[36:37] So that's a thing in Scotland and in some ways Ireland where you had a, a, a, a, and it

[36:43] would have a different pattern based on your family.

[36:46] Very, very cool.

[36:48] Now for an extra 500 bucks, you could get side rails and a lockdown bar and some trim

[36:53] that was changed into a different color.

[36:56] And for an extra $250, you could have three extra 3D molded toys.

[37:01] I play the prototype and I play the production.

[37:05] So I remember they brought the prototype to, it was probably T. P. F. I'm guessing.

[37:11] I remember playing it that the flipper buttons were in a weird spot.

[37:16] Meaning if you put your hands into normal position, you would put them in and you reach for

[37:20] the flipper buttons, at least for me, because I got small hands.

[37:23] I had trouble like reaching them.

[37:27] So I brought that up with Damien, Damien, because he was there and he said, oh yeah, you're

[37:31] not the first person to mention that.

[37:33] So then when I played the production one, guess what?

[37:36] The buttons were moved in the normal position.

[37:38] Australians, and we'll get into this in the pinball down under series.

[37:41] They have a difficult time with flipper buttons for some reason.

[37:45] That seems to be an ongoing issue for them.

[37:48] This is a single level pinball machine.

[37:50] It's got two pop bumpers.

[37:52] It's got a series of dropped targets.

[37:55] It's got three flippers.

[37:56] And it has a like iPad looking screen in the middle of the play field.

[38:01] Now why don't, you know, the major manufacturers put a screen in the play field.

[38:07] They're spending most of your time looking down there as opposed to up and down.

[38:10] They've totally done that.

[38:12] Yeah, but they've ended up, it's ended up chipping and stuff around the edges, right?

[38:16] Like it's difficult to level that stuff.

[38:18] It depends how they do it.

[38:20] Okay.

[38:21] Hey, you guys see that when I mentioned electric before, their solution was put the sheet of,

[38:27] I think it was plexi or whatever, over the entire play field because they had the window.

[38:31] So they never had issues with chipping.

[38:33] Okay.

[38:34] Game.

[38:35] It had a lot of comparisons to ballies silver ball.

[38:39] And your room that looks just like silver ball, and what does Damien say about that?

[38:44] Damien says, I've never seen silver ball mania, the two initial design criteria I had when

[38:49] I was trying to come up with the play field, just making it up as I went along was I needed

[38:54] wanted a smooth orbit.

[38:57] And I wanted a horseshoe because I like space invaders.

[39:00] Hey, pinheads, when I'm not doing this podcast, I'm Dave, the financial advice guy.

[39:06] In a recent survey, we found that 70% of those pulled were concerned about their retirement

[39:12] strategy.

[39:13] Canadians have a number of concerns when looking out over the next 15 years.

[39:18] Professional financial advice is key to helping you through a variety of challenges, ranging

[39:23] from inflation, market volatility, and determining how to maximize your retirement income in

[39:29] the safest, most effective and tax efficient way.

[39:33] Today's economy requires an experienced hand and a personalized plan.

[39:38] Don't take my word for it, just listen to Nordman.

[39:40] I am the Nordman, and I approve of Dennis Financial's investment and insurance advice.

[39:47] Their opinions on vacuum-flip ramps are great too.

[40:14] This guy running a pinball company, start up.

[40:18] Ready to go has never played.

[40:19] He had no idea what silver bull may not have.

[40:21] That's not a bad thing though.

[40:23] That's...

[40:24] You think so?

[40:25] Yeah.

[40:26] I wouldn't want to play silver bull man either.

[40:28] It's got great art though.

[40:32] Yeah, it has great art.

[40:33] That's about all it has.

[40:34] Now I think things like the customization was smart.

[40:38] You're going to see, I think, more and more of that in consumer goods in general of customization

[40:44] or being able to customize things.

[40:46] How much was this game?

[40:48] Well, it was a steel.

[40:50] What was the price?

[40:51] It was so great.

[40:53] You could buy that base game.

[40:54] If you don't want any of this custom stuff for $5,250 or three easy payments of $17.50.

[41:02] That's pretty decent.

[41:03] Plus your state tax or whatever.

[41:06] They call GST in Australia or HST here in Canada.

[41:09] But I mean in general.

[41:10] Huh?

[41:11] Now at the time it was made it was probably fairly close to stern pro pricing.

[41:16] I think at that time stern pro pricing was, I want to say, $6,000.

[41:22] Right?

[41:23] Probably somewhere around there.

[41:24] This wasn't much less than a stern pro.

[41:27] It was less, slightly less, but the idea was that it was, you know, you're supporting

[41:32] a start-up and it was pretty great.

[41:35] How much work do you think it actually was to get a game from like nothing entering the

[41:41] hobby 2018 to getting a game ready in production, a ready for, for, for prototype in a year and

[41:50] then actually building that machine.

[41:51] It's got to be a lot of world.

[41:52] Damien says, I think even I might have slightly underestimated exactly how much work there

[41:58] was.

[41:59] It's been almost 18 months solid slog.

[42:02] It's predominantly seven days a week, 10 hours a day.

[42:06] And it's been really hard most of the time.

[42:08] If I get my hands or my hooks into something, it's usually all or nothing.

[42:12] It's sort of go hard or go home type scenario.

[42:15] And this has been no different.

[42:17] I never did this to come second.

[42:20] That's a lot of hype, hurmily.

[42:22] So he's, he's taken down stern.

[42:23] No, he never said that.

[42:25] But you know what this game runs on?

[42:26] He said, I never did, I never did this to come second.

[42:29] Well, I don't, there's no way he was going to get pissed.

[42:34] This just runs on the, on P3, the P rock.

[42:37] That's right, if Ty and from the previous episode.

[42:39] Good job.

[42:40] Right.

[42:41] So that's why when, when people pop in and they're like, I can help out because you know,

[42:45] that multi morphic P3 rock platform was so helpful to lower that barrier of entry to

[42:53] code and get a machine running.

[42:55] It seems pretty wild.

[42:57] Well manufacturing would start at the end of 2019 in the original factory in Cranborn

[43:03] West, which is a suburb of, of a suburb of Melbourne.

[43:10] Ah, in 2020, they actually began plans to move to Keysboro as just slightly after they

[43:18] started production.

[43:20] Damien had realized that as he started to scale up to sell these 250 machines, building

[43:27] one machine was really easy.

[43:29] Building two is pretty good.

[43:31] Building 50 is insane and you need to scale up to do that, which is what most manufacturers

[43:38] struggle to do.

[43:39] But one of the unique things with Damien was his passion and excitement that was infectious.

[43:45] And I have to say I really like Damien and his, I really like the way he was, his excitement,

[43:52] his boyish charm.

[43:54] Well he even started a YouTube channel where he would chronicle sometimes multiple times

[43:59] a week what was going on in the haggest factory.

[44:02] The channel has now gone, all of the videos have disappeared.

[44:06] However you can see some of the B-roll in Carrie Hardy's videos and again we'll mention

[44:11] a little bit of that later.

[44:13] Damien would say that it's just honest and straightforward and people understand what

[44:19] the intent is and how they go about it.

[44:22] It's all about bringing them in.

[44:25] He had mentioned and you had mentioned that something was coming up in the spring of

[44:29] 2020 and that was COVID.

[44:33] It began to rock the world as some areas came out of the winter and into the spring and

[44:40] it shut down most of the world travel and canceled all large scale gatherings including

[44:47] the NBA, baseball games, the NHL and not that it's on the same level as the NHL.

[44:54] The Texas pinball festival or TPS.

[44:57] And Damien says we were all massively geared up to get to TPS in 2020 which would have been

[45:03] sort of a back end of an 18 month to 20 month solid hard push from starting from the

[45:09] point of zero knowledge to get to the point where we were actually had a game that we were

[45:14] ready to sell and when COVID hit it just took the wind out of everything.

[45:19] Basically it just dissolved overnight.

[45:21] I'm joining the hobby and buying a pinbott to I'm building a machine and taking people's

[45:26] money.

[45:28] You got to put it to them.

[45:30] I think they were at a the gate doing pretty good.

[45:33] I think I think they were getting there and then all of a sudden just a huge punch to

[45:37] the gut.

[45:39] And I don't have to tell you know many people but I'm sure people will be listening to

[45:42] this in a hundred years and being like we're learning about pinball from these ancient

[45:47] people, Ron and David.

[45:51] And we're learning about what it was like to live during COVID but I'll tell you what

[45:55] it sucked.

[45:58] And I could only imagine what it was like to be moving into a factory and doing all of

[46:03] those things when that situation unfolded.

[46:08] Damien didn't just pull up stakes, did he?

[46:11] He didn't just say, oh well, we'll just sort of slow down.

[46:15] He continued to barrel forward.

[46:17] But that caused delays in production.

[46:20] And Haggis was greatly delayed in it shipping.

[46:24] Damien was well aware that he had to communicate to all of those people who had put money down

[46:31] for Haggis's Celts.

[46:33] Yes.

[46:34] Damien said, I don't feel like that is particularly fair to people who have supported us, bought

[46:39] a game.

[46:40] Pinball people are just the most amazing, understanding patient people I've ever come across and it's

[46:46] fantastic.

[46:48] And I love it and I'm so grateful for it.

[46:50] I have some pretty high personal standards of my own and part of that is wanting to deliver

[46:55] on these promises.

[46:56] I'll make you a quality game and I'll stand behind it and I will get it to you in a timely

[47:01] manner.

[47:02] I need to grow to do that.

[47:04] Otherwise it will continue to be a slow process and it's just difficult.

[47:09] So he wants to deliver and I commend him for that, right?

[47:13] People have put down their deposits for these games.

[47:16] He wants to get them out.

[47:18] By this time Haggis was scaling up to move into a new larger facility.

[47:23] So again, part of the problem was that they're trying to build these machines and they don't

[47:27] have enough staff or materials and they have to pick away at these things.

[47:33] And then that means they are slow.

[47:36] So they were slow to begin with, which is totally normal.

[47:39] I mean, we haven't done a spooky episode, a spooky pinball episode just yet, but they

[47:44] weren't particularly fast when they started their first games either.

[47:47] Were they?

[47:48] No, they didn't make many of them.

[47:49] Took it small and slow.

[47:50] And a lot of people were making the comparison that Haggis was just like spooky.

[47:56] They were starting to scale up slowly and they were doing all these things and they had

[48:00] all these great ideas.

[48:02] Well, what did Damien when did he sort of realize that stuff had to change within Haggis?

[48:11] Well, Damien said, I need to figure out how I make 50 of these in a month.

[48:17] All of a sudden you need to look into what's probably more the real nuts and bolts of manufacturing,

[48:21] supply chain, cash flow and managing all the various aspects that have all got to come

[48:26] together at the same time.

[48:28] So they can put these thousands and thousands of parts into a pinball machine and put it

[48:32] in a box.

[48:34] So yeah, outstandingly difficult.

[48:36] I've got to cut cabinets.

[48:38] I've got to glue them together.

[48:39] I've got to clamp them up.

[48:41] I got to get them out the door so they can get their paint.

[48:44] I got to start screwing together play fields.

[48:47] Time is really starting to become extremely precious and it's dissolving in front of me.

[48:51] And again, that's part of the need to expand.

[48:54] This is where things are kind of becoming a problem, I think.

[48:57] They went from one factory to another or let's call it factory.

[49:02] It's a place where you're putting stuff together to a larger space where you're putting stuff

[49:07] together.

[49:08] Let's not call it a factory per se.

[49:11] But they increased it the size by 400%.

[49:15] That was approximately 150 square meter facility to a 700 square meter facility.

[49:22] That included new equipment, CNC machines, clamps, all those things, an additional larger

[49:29] workforce and they had to ensure good quality control.

[49:34] I don't know how big that is because it's meters.

[49:37] So shipping and production of Celts kind of really began in April of 2021, which is now

[49:45] 12 months out from the beginning of the pandemic.

[49:49] This is when Damien did another interview with pinball profile and Jeff Tioleus.

[49:56] So most of the comments from now on kind of come from there.

[50:00] I think this is where things start to kind of go wrong for Haggis.

[50:06] They want to do right by the people that they have paid for machines.

[50:12] So they have to get bigger.

[50:14] So then they get bigger and I think that inevitably is the downfall of the company.

[50:21] What are your thoughts?

[50:22] Well, they did get all the Celts out as far as I know.

[50:24] They actually got those titles out.

[50:26] So that's where they delivered.

[50:27] Okay, they're making it.

[50:29] And then the big announcement.

[50:31] The second title was then announced.

[50:33] So they hadn't quite finished Celts.

[50:36] They had sort of more or less began shipping them.

[50:39] They're getting them out the door and they're already announcing the second title.

[50:44] And that is licensing out a class of 1981.

[50:49] An epic title that everybody loves, right Ron?

[50:53] Not a fan.

[50:54] Not a fan.

[50:55] And what was that game?

[50:56] That was the gorgeous fathom.

[51:01] Fathom is probably the best if you just purchase the back glass, put it on your wall or

[51:07] a play field.

[51:08] Yeah.

[51:09] It's a good game.

[51:10] It's not great.

[51:12] Well, they had to get the license.

[51:14] So what did how did they get the license?

[51:16] Well, the current license holder of the Williams Valley stuff is Rick from Planetary Pinball,

[51:22] which used to be, well, used to be Rick at Bay Area Amusements.

[51:27] And then he opened up the Planetary Pinball as like the subsidiary that does all the licensing

[51:33] stuff.

[51:34] And then I think he eventually just morphed them into one.

[51:37] So it's just Planetary Pinball now.

[51:40] And Rick purchased these rights.

[51:41] A long time ago.

[51:42] A long time ago.

[51:43] A lot of license, if you will.

[51:45] And he purchased those from Wayne Gilly Art.

[51:48] Well, Damien says Rick from Planetary Pinball is a license holder for Valley Games.

[51:53] It was really just a process of talking with him and going through the machinations that

[51:58] you need to in order to make it official and get everything that you need to do.

[52:03] These games were made 50 years ago.

[52:06] They were designed on paper.

[52:10] And most of that paper, all those materials were generally just thrown into a dumpster when

[52:15] the machine was off the line.

[52:18] So it's going to be really, really, really hard to actually reengineer that game.

[52:26] Because you just can't buy the CAD files like you would maybe today.

[52:31] Well, Damien says for a game that was released in 1981, there were no 3D or

[52:35] 2D CAD models of files and components or play fields.

[52:39] We literally had to sit down with an existing original play field, measure out where all

[52:43] the bits were, translate that over into Fusion 360.

[52:49] That must be some kind of software.

[52:51] Remodel it, redesign it, then work out where all our mechs were.

[52:54] We had to redesign or recreate all of the mechs for the game.

[52:58] But now the other issue with this was that the play field is thicker than the original

[53:05] valley play fields.

[53:06] Right.

[53:07] Now they have the new, they're going to be making the new play fields with the hard top

[53:11] on them, which they show they use.

[53:14] I remember the videos, they have videos where they're slamming it with a hammer.

[53:19] And it's like flawless.

[53:20] There's no, it was, it was pretty neat.

[53:22] But it's adding complexity, right?

[53:24] Complexity is making the plug cause now the play field is thicker.

[53:28] So your normal off the shelf mechs that you could easily get from pinball life or somewhere.

[53:34] They're not going to fit.

[53:35] Well we have to add more staff too.

[53:37] We've scaled up.

[53:38] We're making a new machine.

[53:40] We have to draw all this stuff.

[53:42] We got to make new rules because quite frankly nobody is playing fathom for the rules.

[53:49] And this is where Martin Robbins, who we had mentioned before, one of the podcasters

[53:55] on Final Round pinball podcast as well as head to head pinball podcast.

[53:59] He would work with Haggis to help out with a few rules and some play field suggestions.

[54:04] And eventually his simple ideas would actually turn into an offer from Damien for a full-time

[54:11] job.

[54:12] Now Martin was originally from a background in marketing.

[54:16] So he could also help Haggis out with its marketing and you know all of that stuff.

[54:22] So we're starting to add some, I would say really great individuals.

[54:27] They would also add a fellow named Lachlan Dowd who would go by the name Lucky and he would

[54:32] work on the mechanical engineering.

[54:36] This brings us to Fathom Revisited.

[54:40] This was a big moment in pinball because finally somebody was going to take one of those

[54:45] prestigious massively loved games and they would make it for a new generation.

[54:55] No more dealing with broken guide wires and stupid like lamp sockets that were flaky or

[55:02] rusted.

[55:04] We're talking awesome stuff here.

[55:06] This is a licensed remake.

[55:08] It's designed by Damien Hartin, Ward Pemberton who is the original designer of Fathom and

[55:13] Martin Robbins, mechanic by Damien Hartin and Lachlan Dowd, art by Greg Ferris and Kevin

[55:20] O'Connor because it's the original art from Fathom.

[55:24] Sound and music by Casey Dean and Martin Robbins and software by Greg Cielby and Martin Robbins

[55:31] who designed the rule set.

[55:34] This was super excited because it had the Fathom 2.0 code.

[55:39] Huh?

[55:40] Which we got to get into this because this goes into some of the stuff they did.

[55:45] Originally this was released with the Mermaid Edition and the Classic Edition.

[55:51] You could purchase two different kinds like an LE and a standard, right?

[55:56] If you got the Mermaid, only the people who got Mermaid editions would get the new 2.0

[56:01] code.

[56:02] They had to spend almost $9,000 US.

[56:06] So the Mermaid was yes, like $9,800 and the Classic was $7360.

[56:14] That's still, you know, it's more than a Stern Pro now.

[56:17] Yeah.

[56:18] And it's about a little bit more than a Stern.

[56:21] It was at this time, it was about the same as a Stern LE.

[56:26] But you got some cool things that you didn't get in a Stern LE.

[56:29] The different rule package you mentioned, you know, more callouts and music because of

[56:33] that enhanced code.

[56:35] The CIR LED lighting, everything, every light was an RGB LED.

[56:42] So it could color change to anything.

[56:44] It had beautiful mirror trim.

[56:46] The seven segment displays on the back.

[56:50] So it had the regular back glass with regular number displays.

[56:55] But it also had two smaller LCD screens in the apron, which I thought was a really brilliant

[57:01] way to manage new technology and old technology.

[57:07] Now you've seen underneath one of these fathoms, have you not?

[57:12] Briefly.

[57:13] Everything under there is super shiny and mega fancy, isn't it?

[57:17] Yes, it looks awesome.

[57:19] And as lighting under, as light under the game, so it looks like you're in water, it's

[57:24] pretty cool.

[57:25] It's so expensive to make your mechs shiny and make your under your play field look stunningly

[57:32] gorgeous.

[57:33] Why would you do that?

[57:35] Well, the other interesting thing is that as part of their deal with Brick at Planetary

[57:40] Pinball, they have to present him with a prototype to get his final approval.

[57:45] You got to sign off on this part of the deal.

[57:48] I believe they started taking money in something like April, but they didn't actually provide

[57:54] the game to Rick until December.

[57:56] Huh.

[57:57] That's interesting.

[57:58] Now, this is if I note my sources, this was from the pinball news.

[58:02] And supposedly this was a former Haggis employee that said this.

[58:07] So when they were showing the game, when they were showing the game at various parts, it

[58:11] was never really playable.

[58:12] Okay.

[58:13] There's a box of lights until December before they got it working.

[58:17] But it's interesting if that is the case that you would be taking money when you don't

[58:22] have a working game yet.

[58:24] And one of the other things about this game is no longer running the P rock board because

[58:30] also part of the licensing deal with Rick.

[58:32] Rick insists on fast boards.

[58:35] So who is fast fast pinball was founded in 2014 by Aaron Davis and Dave Beecher.

[58:43] Okay.

[58:44] So there are these Seattle fellows along with Eli Kurtz on software and Brian Madden on

[58:49] the documentation.

[58:51] This is a new company or a new or company that has sort of grown into pinball and is selling

[58:58] board sets and kits to start up manufacturers.

[59:02] But also they've got two platforms like a modern platform for new machines and startups

[59:08] and homebrews.

[59:10] And then they've also got their retro platform that they're working on system 11 WPC and

[59:15] WPC 95, right?

[59:18] It has a bit of a working relationship with planetary pinball or Rick in one way or another.

[59:26] And to make sure that we're not constantly having new machines with different boards

[59:30] all the time and you'll be able to continue to work on them.

[59:34] A third party company that being fast is designing the boards.

[59:39] And still are to this day.

[59:41] I think the new was it on fun house.

[59:45] Yeah, from Pajradi, the new the new fun house that is running on fast boards.

[59:49] So okay, that's pretty that's a good idea, right?

[59:51] What is Bruce Nightingale, your other co-host on the slam till podcast?

[59:56] What does he think of fast?

[59:57] Uh, I can't remember does he hate them?

[59:59] He hates most things, which basically makes me think they're probably a pretty good company.

[01:00:03] I haven't heard anything about their board sets having issues or no, I'm kind of excited.

[01:00:09] I haven't seen the board sets, but I am excited that it's fairly open source E.

[01:00:15] It's it's very modern in the way it does things.

[01:00:19] I'm very excited to see it very much.

[01:00:21] Interested.

[01:00:22] Now the the the phantom 2.0 core code on these boards.

[01:00:27] It is the daughter of the original diver from the 1981 ballet game who's eaten by those sirens or whatever.

[01:00:33] The the mermaids or the murder, murder ladies.

[01:00:37] Uh, and she goes back to the lagoon to look for her father.

[01:00:41] Why he went missing.

[01:00:42] There's like a whole story.

[01:00:43] There's like a comic.

[01:00:45] It's pretty cool.

[01:00:46] Pretty cool concept.

[01:00:48] All right.

[01:00:48] So you had mentioned people putting money into buy these games.

[01:00:53] So originally if you had purchased a haggis clan membership, which was if you were part of the haggis clan,

[01:01:05] you had purchased the first game, Celts.

[01:01:07] You were got you were given sort of this special membership where you could get ahead of the line to purchase any other subsequent haggis pinball game.

[01:01:18] This is very similar to what spooky pinball did that if you bought, you know, America's most haunted, you could get to the front of the line to buy a Rob Zombie.

[01:01:27] And if you bought a Rob Zombie, you could get ahead of the line to buy.

[01:01:30] Yeah, what the heck was the next one?

[01:01:32] Oh, Alice Cooper's maybe.

[01:01:34] Yeah, they they did away with that eventually, I believe.

[01:01:37] Right. So the problem that spooky had discovered that as people started buying these games, it was more difficult to manage who's at the front of the line.

[01:01:48] Right. And who continues to be and if somebody, you know, can't pay for their game, you know, this month and maybe they got a wait an extra month.

[01:01:55] Are they off the list?

[01:01:56] Are they on the list?

[01:01:57] It became a whole thing.

[01:01:58] So spooky created the bloodsuckers club, which I'm a member.

[01:02:02] You are a member.

[01:02:03] So you are, it's like a fan club thing every year.

[01:02:07] You get some some crap in the mail, right?

[01:02:09] You get first dibs.

[01:02:10] So it's just easier that everybody is now on the same play field, right?

[01:02:14] It doesn't matter who, well, everybody who purchases a bloodsuckers membership or bloodsuckers club.

[01:02:19] Haggis also realized that, ooh, it's going to be difficult to manage these, these Haggis clan members, but they can go first so that they can put down their deposits first.

[01:02:28] But then we're also going to create what is called a, what is it?

[01:02:32] The series people.

[01:02:35] Yeah, they were supposed to do five of these Valley games.

[01:02:39] I think it was five.

[01:02:41] So they had sort of penned a deal to do five of these original Valley remakes, right?

[01:02:48] So some of those games are like a baldelux, sentar, right?

[01:02:54] Yeah, those were everyone figured it's going to be, they're going to do sentar.

[01:02:58] And they pulled the locks.

[01:02:59] But everyone was like, what are the other two going to be?

[01:03:02] I always wondered that if they knew which ones they were going to do, if anyone knows that.

[01:03:06] So you had to commit a deposit for all four or five of these titles up front.

[01:03:15] You had to put a deposit down for all of these titles to then secure your spot as a Valley series member.

[01:03:21] And I know someone who did that and they had one of the first like 10 fathoms.

[01:03:25] He's also doing a lot of these videos still, right?

[01:03:29] But he had taken a break for, oh, you know, like a four or five month period.

[01:03:36] So once they started kind of into full swing production, like Damien just didn't hire a bunch of people.

[01:03:41] Like he was working in the factory.

[01:03:43] Martin Robbins was coming in and he was working in the factory.

[01:03:46] Martin Robbins, who's like doing rules and some marketing.

[01:03:50] Like he was like screwing stuff together, like in manufacturing, which is not really what he was.

[01:03:55] He was hired for, but you're helping, you know, your buddy out and you're passionate about pinball.

[01:03:59] Well, production was scheduled to begin in 2021 and then the in July of 2021.

[01:04:06] And then the next pin in the series was to be rescheduled for release in early 2022.

[01:04:14] What about the videos?

[01:04:15] What does Damien say?

[01:04:16] Well, I'll tell you what Damien said.

[01:04:18] He said, I will be getting back in front of the camera.

[01:04:20] It's sort of dropped off for a while.

[01:04:22] And I haven't been able to make any videos or do any updates.

[01:04:25] I will get back to that.

[01:04:27] It's just been a very crazy period through COVID and off the back end of COVID.

[01:04:31] It's been crazy.

[01:04:32] Ah, okay.

[01:04:33] So he's busy.

[01:04:34] He's a busy guy, right?

[01:04:35] So the transparency that was celebrated, the excitement, his passion when he was building like 50 machines

[01:04:44] is sort of waning because he's just so friggin busy.

[01:04:48] I watch most of those videos.

[01:04:49] I mean, he had videos of the new factory and all the issues they had.

[01:04:54] His CNC machine would break the tip off of the thing.

[01:04:57] Someone, what, someone ran into our gate outside or something.

[01:05:00] It was like every conceivable bad thing that happened seemingly what happened.

[01:05:04] So the deposit model, that is something that happens in pinball a lot.

[01:05:09] Yes, it does.

[01:05:10] And you have to have a lot of money to build stuff in pinball.

[01:05:16] He's not ignorant to the fact that he needs this money to continue to run his business.

[01:05:21] And Boogie does it to this day.

[01:05:23] Boogie still does it.

[01:05:25] Well, Damien says $1,500 Australian deposit.

[01:05:29] It's non-refundable deposit in a similar way that spooky works.

[01:05:33] Oh, he brought up spooky.

[01:05:34] We are still a small company.

[01:05:35] We rely on that deposit money to start making your game for you.

[01:05:39] You need to treat that as a commitment to us.

[01:05:41] The same way we commit to making sure we get you a game that meets all of your expectations.

[01:05:46] If you want to be a series ticket holder, you need to put down 1,500 deposit for each of those subsequent four titles.

[01:05:52] And that money gets put into escrow.

[01:05:54] So for some reason, you know, whatever happens, then you get all that deposit money back.

[01:06:00] That didn't happen.

[01:06:02] He did not, none of that movie, none of that money was put into escrow as it turns out.

[01:06:06] He's putting, you know, $1,500 deposit, you know, you give me $1,500, you know, and buy some back.

[01:06:11] And all some things.

[01:06:12] That's because he says 1,500 Australian.

[01:06:14] And what's that in America?

[01:06:16] It's probably like $1,000 to get a converter here.

[01:06:20] One Australian dollar equals 0.6, yeah, 68 cents.

[01:06:24] I mean, the idea is you give me this, you know, $7,000 and I put it in escrow.

[01:06:30] And escrow is a middle person where you put your money in.

[01:06:34] So if something happens, that money gets returned to you.

[01:06:38] And that happens a lot in like buying classic cars online or buying watches.

[01:06:44] I know Dennis from the Ecclectic Gamers podcast has mentioned, you know, buying watches online.

[01:06:50] And then when the watch arrives, then the money gets released to the person who sold you the watch.

[01:06:55] Those things.

[01:06:56] So you make sure things are legit.

[01:06:58] That's a pretty good strategy that makes you feel pretty darn good, doesn't it?

[01:07:01] That does.

[01:07:02] COVID-19 was quote unquote over in 2020.

[01:07:07] Oh, no, not really.

[01:07:09] Right.

[01:07:10] Most people figured things would eventually relax and go back to normal in 2020.

[01:07:16] Never did.

[01:07:17] It did not.

[01:07:19] That was the thing.

[01:07:21] So 2021, you're still dealing with supply chain issues in 2021.

[01:07:27] We sort of figured a few months 2020.

[01:07:30] We'd be fine.

[01:07:31] Things would go back to normal.

[01:07:32] Well, inflation, the cost of goods, food, materials, manufacturing went up in cost.

[01:07:39] And it started to kind of be what we call transient inflation, which basically meant is eventually it would work its way out of the system.

[01:07:47] And things would be normal.

[01:07:48] Well, in the spring of 2022, when the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine,

[01:07:54] inflation really took off because that sent the cost of oil, the cost of wheat, of soy through the roof.

[01:08:03] And then that meant the cost of food went up, the cost of manufacturing went up, the cost of gasoline, all of that went through the roof.

[01:08:11] And inflation hit a 40 year high.

[01:08:14] And in fact, today in 2024, supply chain issues are still messed up from 2020.

[01:08:24] It's still really difficult to buy cars in North America because lots still tend to be empty.

[01:08:33] Do you want an example of how some of those costs went up wrong?

[01:08:36] Sure.

[01:08:37] Let's do an example.

[01:08:38] So the cost of shipping containers, this was in the financial industry of which I worked,

[01:08:44] was a huge topic through 2021 and 2022.

[01:08:49] Now you have to ship stuff from Australia to North America.

[01:08:55] And there is no bridge.

[01:08:57] Am I correct?

[01:08:57] There's no bridge.

[01:08:58] No, you can fly.

[01:09:00] But that seems kind of expensive for a pinball machine, right?

[01:09:03] So you buy a shipping container, you fill it with a bunch of pins and you ship it to North America.

[01:09:10] Well, the cost of shipping containers went through the roof and it was super difficult to even get those containers moving once they were on a ship.

[01:09:21] In fact, the Chinese electric car manufacturers BYD made their own ships to move their own materials around the world because it was cheaper than actually buying and using shipping containers.

[01:09:36] Well, remember Wayne?

[01:09:37] Wayne, Mr. Pinball Australian?

[01:09:39] Yeah.

[01:09:40] He says, people think you make a fortune at a selling pinballs.

[01:09:44] I just paid my bills for a container of games that came in from the US.

[01:09:48] I used to be paying about 2400 Australian for a 20 foot container.

[01:09:53] Now it's 15,000 Australian.

[01:09:56] When the container gets picked up to go on the train to the dock, there's no train or all the boats are not sailing for another two weeks because it's been delayed.

[01:10:04] Then they charge you a couple hundred dollars Australian a day for 42 days for the container sitting on the dock or a holding yard.

[01:10:12] US customs has been picking containers at random for unpacking inspections on export, which I've never come across before.

[01:10:19] They use third party companies and they charge whatever it is they want to charge.

[01:10:23] Sometimes 5,000 Australian.

[01:10:26] So we're running into some serious problems here trying to get materials around the world.

[01:10:31] And Hages, they're trying to manufacture.

[01:10:35] Well, I remember one time Marty on an episode of the final round pinball podcast, which I can't recall what episode it was.

[01:10:43] He was talking to Jeff and he just sort of offhandedly mentioned that they were having issues even in 2022 about getting cardboard for shipping boxes.

[01:10:55] That they couldn't find cardboard for shipping boxes.

[01:10:59] That's how screwed up supply chains were and in some cases still is.

[01:11:05] But during the COVID period, governments stepped up around the world to support companies.

[01:11:12] And the Australian government provided a great deal of subsidies to business to help keep them running from COVID and the post-COVID era to avoid shutdowns and to keep pushing through the turmoil.

[01:11:27] But what about manufacturing material costs?

[01:11:30] Well, for that we'll go back to Wayne.

[01:11:32] Wayne says pinball legs, for example, used to cost him 60 cents a pound for the raw materials.

[01:11:38] A pinball leg uses 3.2 pounds of material, including the scrap.

[01:11:42] And now it's like a buck 80 a pound.

[01:11:45] So it's three times the price.

[01:11:47] That's just the raw material cost.

[01:11:49] On top of that, the company that plates them has gone up.

[01:11:51] And the trucking companies that take them to the player have gone up.

[01:11:54] The cost of building these games now has gone up about 30%.

[01:11:58] To get people their Celts games, we've scaled up our factory.

[01:12:03] We've added more.

[01:12:05] We've all we've been, you know, we're struggling through COVID.

[01:12:09] Yes, we're getting some government supports which are helping us in the cost of our factories.

[01:12:14] But now the costs of everything have gone up as well because of the inflation through 2022.

[01:12:21] Then we start running into quality control issues for a lot of these fathoms that are finally being shipped.

[01:12:29] Missing parts like leg levelers or power cables, right?

[01:12:35] Mixed match parts like some of the bolts for the head unit or the bolts for the legs or different sizes or metric or not metric.

[01:12:44] And then the terrible play field delamination.

[01:12:49] Which is a more recent thing that that's come up.

[01:12:52] Yes.

[01:12:53] So the play field delam...

[01:12:54] So we created an indestructible, non-scratching, perfect play field.

[01:12:58] So the play fields that have this wood and then they've got the plastic top or the acrylic top that's non-scratchable and easily, you know, manufactured and stuck on,

[01:13:10] the glue is letting go and is separating from the wood.

[01:13:14] Now a lot of that is coming from the fact that these pinball machines sat in a container for months to get to North America.

[01:13:24] And a hundred or key heat.

[01:13:26] In a non-temperature controlled 20 foot shipping container and then it sat on a dock forever and then it made its way into, let's say, somebody's home and then the temperature changed again.

[01:13:43] Well, gee, Wes, maybe George Gomez was on to something.

[01:13:46] Maybe the industry expert around manufacturing pinball machines understand something about manufacturing pinball machines.

[01:13:56] The interesting thing is the person I know that they paid a deposit on all five and they got one of the first fathoms.

[01:14:03] He also had it flown over.

[01:14:06] Ah.

[01:14:07] It's not waiting.

[01:14:08] Yeah, so he had it super early.

[01:14:11] So there you go. So he would probably avoid some sort of situation like that.

[01:14:15] Now there's videos of this online.

[01:14:17] Carrie Hardy touches this on his thing, but I've also seen the postings on.

[01:14:20] He touches this.

[01:14:21] He touches on it.

[01:14:22] He's touching it.

[01:14:23] You might want to free too.

[01:14:25] So we're starting production.

[01:14:27] Things are getting out there.

[01:14:29] But now we're announcing the third title.

[01:14:32] This is a story I've heard before.

[01:14:35] What's trying to get deposit money for the next title when you haven't finished the first title?

[01:14:39] Yeah, you've basically you're on the tail end to fill finishing Celts.

[01:14:44] You're just started and are shipping out your fathoms.

[01:14:49] And you're already on taking deposit money for the third game.

[01:14:54] There's been a lot of these situations in pinball and it's quite frustrating as somebody who's only been around for five years that people keep stepping on these rakes.

[01:15:04] We covered this constantly announcing new titles to get more money back when we talked about John Papaduke and the whole situation that he had, right?

[01:15:14] But they did pick the best title to announce for the third title, right?

[01:15:19] Yes, yes, I agree.

[01:15:22] And that would be Centaur.

[01:15:25] Centaur, the Beast Edition and the Orblivion Edition.

[01:15:31] What thing we didn't talk about the other thing they did with fathom is remember before we said how the classic edition you didn't get the new 2.0 code.

[01:15:43] Okay, yes, well, I think it was in 2022.

[01:15:49] Yes, they were at TPS and so many people liked the 2.0 code, but then they were told well, you can't get them because they were already sold out of the Mermaid editions.

[01:16:00] Yeah, the fancy L.E.

[01:16:02] So they made the decision to sell kits to let you make your classic be able to run the 2.0 code.

[01:16:10] Uh-oh.

[01:16:11] And that pissed some people off.

[01:16:13] You know, who had the Mermaid edition and thought there was this exclusive 2.0 code that I paid extra for and now these classic people got the classic they can get a kit and get the 2.0 code also.

[01:16:24] But isn't this like the same thing where Stern like releases a topper with like totally is totally is totally is.

[01:16:30] And then eventually they just released the code to everybody anyway, totally is, but in this case, they obviously were doing it to try to get more money because they needed money.

[01:16:39] As I mentioned before, I think the problems started when they scaled up and then things just compound quickly and exactly the same story during the pop-a-duke thing, right?

[01:16:49] Is that it just starts escalating and snowballing and you want to do the right thing.

[01:16:55] You want to get people their games and if only you had another $10,000, you could get through another month and then a dozen more people would get their games and you would have more money again to keep going.

[01:17:07] And then it compounds and compounds and compounds.

[01:17:10] Well, how much would these new versions cost of Centaur?

[01:17:15] You remember what the other ones cost it was like seven grand and then nine grand or whatever it was for the the fathoms.

[01:17:24] So the beast edition is now priced at $15,000 Australian and limited to 250 units.

[01:17:31] For a blivian edition, that was listed at, I hope you're sitting down, $25,000 Australian, which is about 20 grand US and that's limited to 50 units.

[01:17:47] This is Gene Simmons from Kiss.

[01:17:49] I would like you to join the Patriarch for Silverball Chronicles becoming a pro-cronies the perfect way to say thanks and it starts at $3 a month.

[01:17:58] Want to get early access to episodes before everyone else? Want to be as cool as Kiss?

[01:18:03] Interested in having your comments and questions take priority on our episodes?

[01:18:07] Jump up to a $6 a month premium crook.

[01:18:10] And then go to Kiss Online. Stop that!

[01:18:13] We're not going to Kiss Online, just finish up the damn list.

[01:18:16] Want all the other perks and a shirt after three months? Join us at $200 a month as an LED to a crook.

[01:18:24] Maybe you just want a shirt, I understand.

[01:18:27] Swing on over to silverballswag.com and pick up a silverball Chronicles t-shirt.

[01:18:32] Then afterwards you could swing on over to KissOnline.com.

[01:18:37] Now from my perspective, that was the big red flag that popped up for me.

[01:18:42] You're like, huh, that's the fact that they were still doing fathoms that they weren't done with.

[01:18:47] Or even a quarter of the way through.

[01:18:49] They announced this and the price is so much more than the first one.

[01:18:55] Now do you think they maybe just priced everything too low because of the cost?

[01:18:59] That is a possibility, but when it's this much higher, like double?

[01:19:06] Yeah, all kinds of things go off like, do you guys know how to price your own stuff?

[01:19:10] Or are you hurting so bad that you need this money?

[01:19:15] And obviously the fact that you've come out with this when you still haven't finished the previous one.

[01:19:20] So this was announced in 2023 and it was supposed to originally be launched in 2022.

[01:19:26] So we're already behind in a by a year and a little bit more.

[01:19:32] And we've escalated the cost.

[01:19:34] Now granted, inflation is a thing, right?

[01:19:37] Stern machines are more expensive now than they were.

[01:19:40] Actually, Stern prices have not changed in two years.

[01:19:43] The crazy thing about the orbligion.

[01:19:45] Oh, yeah, you got more than just the game.

[01:19:47] And it's limited to only 50.

[01:19:48] You got a crazy huge topper with like an acrylic thing and a bunch of lights about what thing you're getting.

[01:19:57] You've got, and I would say probably the most controversial thing about this pinball machine is that the playfield went from being black and white,

[01:20:06] which is the the allure of Centaur to being a colored addition plate, which is if you wanted that if you that was a choice.

[01:20:16] I remember when everyone was so up in arms about that when it was literally a choice, you could pick either one.

[01:20:22] But how about this?

[01:20:23] So you get the $25,000 Centaur revisited.

[01:20:27] The beast is reborn.

[01:20:28] You get custom callouts.

[01:20:31] You get an additional multi-ball, inner cabinet art blades, etched mirror side rails, black pinballs, black or one to three targets.

[01:20:40] Okay, that seems kind of, you know, that seems cool.

[01:20:44] Right? That's not that's pretty standard.

[01:20:46] But get this, Ron.

[01:20:47] You get a physical vinyl of the new soundtrack, which I believe was done by Martin Robbins.

[01:20:54] You get airbrushed motorcycle helmet and leather jacket and assigned a numbered revisited comic poster.

[01:21:04] Airbrushed motorcycle helmet, that's weird.

[01:21:06] Well, he is a motorcycle.

[01:21:08] He's half, he's half man, half motorcycle.

[01:21:11] All right.

[01:21:12] It's not wearing a jacket.

[01:21:14] But okay, that's weird.

[01:21:16] Now, the beast edition, it was still very expensive and it had, you know, the mirrored backlash and all that stuff.

[01:21:23] But man, I'm all into airbrushed motorcycle.

[01:21:26] Did you think anybody got an airbrushed motorcycle helmet?

[01:21:29] I do not think so.

[01:21:30] That would be really cool.

[01:21:31] Wouldn't it if somebody had one of those leather jackets?

[01:21:34] Now, these only have unreleased prototypes, right?

[01:21:36] I don't think anybody's actually got an actual game.

[01:21:41] It was at this year's Texas pinball festival, I think in coin takers booth.

[01:21:48] Yes.

[01:21:49] I think they had one.

[01:21:51] I saw it.

[01:21:52] I didn't actually get to play it.

[01:21:54] Okay.

[01:21:55] Okay.

[01:21:56] And I know that also, I think Carrie Hardy did an unboxing as well, I think, at one point.

[01:22:01] And that might have been at T.P.F. actually.

[01:22:02] Yeah, I think it was that one.

[01:22:04] Yeah.

[01:22:05] There's also another one that's in Canada at Nitro Pinball.

[01:22:09] Nitro Pinball has one of these.

[01:22:12] And it was promotional kind of thing as well.

[01:22:16] And it was ready to go.

[01:22:18] And since the whole thing, and we'll get into that in a minute, apparently he was given one as payment for the fact that he ran into some costs for his clients and customers.

[01:22:29] But we're getting into an issue here through the end of 2023.

[01:22:34] So we make this announcement.

[01:22:35] We take this deposit money.

[01:22:37] And then all of a sudden there's a lot of missing communication with Damien between dealers and clients or customers, if you will.

[01:22:47] There's little to no communication.

[01:22:49] He's not replying emails.

[01:22:51] No more videos.

[01:22:52] No more videos.

[01:22:53] There's issues.

[01:22:54] So some of these people are running into these issues of their play fields.

[01:22:57] Right.

[01:22:58] And they're getting some communication from Damien.

[01:23:00] He's understanding.

[01:23:01] He's mentioning that to be able to send a play field, you just can't send a play field and swap the max out.

[01:23:07] They have to send a populated play field.

[01:23:09] And they have to engineer a box to send it over to North America in.

[01:23:14] Which seems like a bit silly.

[01:23:18] I'm pretty sure I could engineer a box to ship a play field in in a probably 30 or 40 minutes and two or six mulsons.

[01:23:28] You know what I mean?

[01:23:30] Like come on.

[01:23:31] Because you're Canadian.

[01:23:32] I get it.

[01:23:33] You don't hear anything really through the end of 23, the beginning of 24, and then in February we get the infamous recapitalization state.

[01:23:44] Yeah, this was literally the final communication ever sent out by Agus.

[01:23:48] I'll read this. Are you ready?

[01:23:50] This is very lengthy warning.

[01:23:53] I hope this message finds you well.

[01:23:56] I'm reaching out to share some important updates about Agus Pinball and the status of your game order.

[01:24:02] Well, that's pretty good.

[01:24:04] I'm happy to hear that.

[01:24:05] As I'm sure you have heard once or twice before, manufacturing pinball machines is hard.

[01:24:10] Yes.

[01:24:11] It is a multi-disciplined, multifaceted endeavor, incorporating a wide and varied number of components and skills.

[01:24:19] Starting this endeavor from my garage in Australia at the onset of a global pandemic has proved to be extremely difficult.

[01:24:26] Yeah.

[01:24:27] While we've been incredibly proud of the quality of the games we have produced in the innovation and creation of an industry that did not exist in this country,

[01:24:35] our throughput and ability to manufacture games in a timely manner has been our shortcoming.

[01:24:40] Yeah, that I think is an understatement.

[01:24:42] Over the last two and a half years, we have produced three different titles and developed an immense capability,

[01:24:48] sending us up for ongoing future success.

[01:24:51] Our manufacturing methodology is based on just-in-time and lean principles, which I believe is the optimum strategy.

[01:24:59] So what does that mean, Dave?

[01:25:01] So just-in-time means that materials come in the door just-in-time to manufacture the thing and get it out.

[01:25:08] So, if you're looking at a lot of lean principles or like you don't have a lot of stock of stuff, right?

[01:25:12] Okay.

[01:25:13] Damien continues.

[01:25:14] However, this model has been a very tight coupling and dependency on supply chain continuity and efficiencies.

[01:25:22] Any interruptions to the supply chain of which we have faced many have a flow-on effect that decreases our throughput and introduces online delays and backlogs.

[01:25:32] I could have told you that.

[01:25:34] Can you say that in more of a- make that more English? Like, what did that mean?

[01:25:40] We're having a hard time building things because our supply chains are screwed and we're not building enough machines fast enough.

[01:25:46] Okay.

[01:25:47] He continues.

[01:25:48] As we wind down the end of Fathom Revisited production and swing into Centaur Revisited, we have made the decision to adjust our manufacturing methodology to move away from such a tight dependency on the supply chain to support our forecasted throughput better.

[01:26:04] To support this change, we will need to further slow down production activities, recapitalize and refocus our procurement strategies and partner offerings.

[01:26:14] Oh, that doesn't sound-

[01:26:16] What does that mean?

[01:26:17] That's the thing. It sounds like we have to build games slower and we need more money.

[01:26:21] And recapitalize. That sounds like they need money.

[01:26:23] That's the one word that really concerned me when I- when this came out.

[01:26:28] Recapitalize.

[01:26:31] That's not just like we need more money. That's like that sounds like a thing.

[01:26:35] That was the moment this statement and that word was the moment I kind of thought they were screwed.

[01:26:40] So this is when people started frigging jump and ship.

[01:26:44] People started really freaking out that had money in this-

[01:26:47] Well, before you jump ship, let's listen to the rest of my statement.

[01:26:50] In the short term, what this will mean for those of you currently waiting on a game from us is that there will be further delays.

[01:26:57] Of this, I am incredibly sorry.

[01:27:00] Your patience and support in the broader communities, patience and support has been tremendous and incredibly important to me and Haggis Pinball as a whole.

[01:27:09] We would not be able to do what we do without it.

[01:27:12] So it makes it even harder for me to deliver this news of further delays.

[01:27:17] However, I believe that for the ongoing continuous success of the company, it is something we need to address now.

[01:27:24] Rather than repeat the experiences we had over the production lifecycle of Fathom Revisited.

[01:27:29] Now remember, at the time this came out, Fathom's not even done.

[01:27:33] He says winding down-

[01:27:34] Winding down like-

[01:27:35] It's not even done. People are still waiting for Fathom's.

[01:27:38] We don't know how many of all of these games they actually ended up producing.

[01:27:43] I would love to know-

[01:27:44] Well, just to clarify, we are still manufacturing, boxing and shipping games.

[01:27:49] That is not changed.

[01:27:51] So yes, once again, I will ask for your patience and support while we pivot and refocus-

[01:27:58] I hate that word pivot. Everyone uses that.

[01:28:01] That is the most marketing thing too.

[01:28:04] It's the new synergy word.

[01:28:06] Well yes, while we pivot and refocus to improve our ability to build the highest quality games in the world.

[01:28:12] Thank you for being a part of our journey.

[01:28:15] We value your trust and support immensely.

[01:28:19] Kind regards, Damien.

[01:28:21] Yikes.

[01:28:22] And that is the last statement that Haggis would ever make.

[01:28:25] In fact, after this sort of the pinball media or the hobbyist media pinball, which I would probably include ourselves in, basically started like-

[01:28:33] Morning, danger, danger.

[01:28:36] Sharks are circling here, right? Like that is not good.

[01:28:39] We're going full-ailing.

[01:28:41] Game over, man. Game over.

[01:28:43] If they're not going to do just in time and they're going to start to stock materials to build games, they need money to buy stuff.

[01:28:52] So that's what they need- I assume they need to recapitalize for.

[01:28:55] But if your company has been so struggling for all these years, because in my opinion, you probably scaled up too quickly, you know, it's pretty rough.

[01:29:04] Now another parallel that people often talk about besides spooky was Dutch pinball.

[01:29:10] So what kind of happened with Dutch pinball just sum it up?

[01:29:13] They had more stuff going on. Like the company that actually manufactured their games was separate from them.

[01:29:21] And they had issues.

[01:29:24] And then they just dropped that they bowed out of making their games.

[01:29:30] Then they lied a lot.

[01:29:31] But they ended up making everybody whole, right? It's like this weird-

[01:29:34] By doing the whole deal where we'll sell, and for every three or four, whatever it was, new games we sell, will make one for one of the original people who ordered a game.

[01:29:45] And people waited like eight years or ten years.

[01:29:49] It was almost a full decade.

[01:29:52] So because of this one silly fluke of a company Dutch pinball, everybody kind of assumes that everybody will be made whole if you just have hope.

[01:30:02] And I find that kind of sad, especially with deep roots.

[01:30:05] Deep root is in the middle there in between all this and same exact thing happened.

[01:30:11] We'll get a deep root episode. Don't worry folks. We'll get there.

[01:30:14] I keep thinking we already did one.

[01:30:16] Well mid July 2024, the company finally folds and the media, the social media goes offline.

[01:30:23] Everything went offline. Everything is going.

[01:30:25] It is disappeared. It is the Houdini of pinball manufacturing.

[01:30:32] This started a feeding frenzy in the hobbyist media.

[01:30:38] And I would say it is an absolute sh** storm after this.

[01:30:43] Because everybody wants to get out there and make some content to make some of that internet money off of the back of a collapsed company.

[01:30:52] And the people that were inevitably screwed.

[01:30:55] And that includes us.

[01:30:57] Right? Like we're not doing the got leave episodes that I've got ready.

[01:31:02] And I delayed releasing this episode by almost three weeks because I wanted to make an episode about Haggis pinball.

[01:31:10] Yes. For those at home, David Dennis picks what we talk about.

[01:31:13] So he's the one who's doing this on the backs of the poor people lost all the money.

[01:31:17] Exactly.

[01:31:19] Carrie Hardy has released an unboxing the truth YouTube series. Have you seen that?

[01:31:24] I have not seen that.

[01:31:25] It's actually quite entertaining.

[01:31:27] Hats off to Carrie Hardy. He's great for the hobby.

[01:31:30] But I'll tell you, there are some factual errors in that YouTube series.

[01:31:35] Well, we'll get into that in a minute.

[01:31:37] It's good. But he had to get that content out because he needed to get some of that YouTube ad revenue money.

[01:31:44] Some of the other media started posting articles about timelines.

[01:31:49] Right? When the company started, when the trouble started,

[01:31:52] you know, when did it start circling the toilet bowl?

[01:31:56] Like all of that stuff.

[01:31:58] And then going back and looking at it through the lens of, you know, 2020 vision

[01:32:04] and roasting poor Martin Robbins,

[01:32:07] who I think has just taken a terrible, terrible hit to his own mental health.

[01:32:15] I've never talked, I haven't talked about this with Martin.

[01:32:18] He would not give me any comments. He would not talk to me about it.

[01:32:21] So I just want to be very transparent about that.

[01:32:24] But I can tell you that because of the harassment that he's received first,

[01:32:29] clearly just being an employee, which Damien hired, he is like gone from pinball, I would say.

[01:32:36] Which I find pretty sad that somebody who has been so integral to the hobby

[01:32:41] is now been blacklisted simply because he worked for somebody that screwed people.

[01:32:47] I'm a bit upset. The other thing is people who gave their money to a company,

[01:32:53] some have taken responsibility for their own stupid decisions, other people have not.

[01:32:58] And I find that pretty upsetting as well.

[01:33:00] It was your decision to Google a company in Australia and give them $7,000.

[01:33:06] And they've never actually manufactured any games.

[01:33:09] What's wrong with Stern? What's wrong with JJP? You know what I mean?

[01:33:12] Take some personal responsibility. Am I crazy?

[01:33:16] Oh, you're definitely crazy.

[01:33:18] Am I taking sides? Am I being a shell? What's going on here?

[01:33:21] Ah, I would not buy, I'm going to say this, I don't buy from outside the US.

[01:33:29] Like ever? I just, I don't, that's why I love alien.

[01:33:34] I could not buy an alien from pinball brothers, I just can't do it.

[01:33:37] It's because you hate to tell people.

[01:33:39] I am Italian, you fool.

[01:33:42] But like Australia, I just think, I just think from, see, for me, I'm thinking from a tech standpoint.

[01:33:48] This thing breaks, how do I get it fixed?

[01:33:51] You know, where am I getting parts from?

[01:33:53] Or did I have custom parts?

[01:33:55] You know, how is this going to work?

[01:33:57] How hard is it going to get to be to get support?

[01:34:00] If I get it from a, if at least I get a company in the US, I have a little better chance of that occurring.

[01:34:08] You know, if you have a fathom now with that, the special parts, all the custom stuff in that game,

[01:34:14] I mean, the fast boards, probably the most standardized thing in the game.

[01:34:18] Thank goodness.

[01:34:19] But as far as all the other parts, if it starts breaking, playfield starts delaminating,

[01:34:23] oh, it's the land, to land, to land, to land, you're screwed.

[01:34:28] Yeah, and that stuff scares me.

[01:34:30] And you just can't screw in a, you know, a CPR fathom playfield.

[01:34:35] I like to wait to the companies around a little bit and proves they can make something.

[01:34:40] Or you can go to a distributor and just get a machine in a box.

[01:34:44] Right, like there's something to be said.

[01:34:47] Let other people take the hit.

[01:34:50] I'm going to sit back here and wait.

[01:34:52] It's like, okay, Jersey Jack, you made Wizard of Oz, you made okay, okay, you're making games.

[01:34:57] Okay, I'll get, I'll get dialed in.

[01:34:59] I trust that I will actually get this game.

[01:35:02] You know, spooky, you've made, you've made some games now.

[01:35:05] You've actually making games.

[01:35:06] Okay, I'll get, I'll get TNA.

[01:35:08] See, that's kind of my policy.

[01:35:10] I'm not like this brand new company has this new like, ugh.

[01:35:14] Even something like a company that really seems to have it together other than the crazy name.

[01:35:19] Burles of fun.

[01:35:20] I mean, they had stuff in the box.

[01:35:22] So like, you do pay for your money.

[01:35:25] Here's your game.

[01:35:26] Like right now, boom, here it is.

[01:35:28] Like, wow, wow, what a, what a concept.

[01:35:31] But still, I'm going to wait.

[01:35:33] Totally.

[01:35:34] I totally totally trust.

[01:35:35] Unless their first game was Beavison Bothead, in which case, all that goes out the window and I'd have to do it.

[01:35:39] But that's the only exception.

[01:35:42] The only thing was the media sort of accusations and misunderstandings about how businesses work as well.

[01:35:49] I find like all of us are experts in our own sort of field.

[01:35:53] Some of us are manufacturers.

[01:35:55] Some of us are IT professionals.

[01:35:57] Some of us are accountants.

[01:35:58] Some of us are business professionals.

[01:36:00] Some of us are mechanics or hands-on people or construction people.

[01:36:04] Like, pinball is such an awesome mixture of, of, of, like, this mosaic of all of these different people from different world.

[01:36:11] Different people from different walks of life.

[01:36:13] But if you're trying to get content out there really quickly, sometimes that means that you, you have some gaps in knowledge of which you may not have.

[01:36:23] One of the problems is there's a company called Hart's Code.

[01:36:27] We had touched on that a moment ago when the, when the episode began.

[01:36:31] And Hart's Code is a company that is owned by Damien.

[01:36:34] Word on the street is that a bunch of trucks showed up or a truck showed up.

[01:36:41] That was part of Hart's Code or has, you know, was, was in a roundabout way is a Hart's Code truck or was rented by Hart's Code or is Damien's pickup truck out of our pictures.

[01:36:51] But anyway, pictures.

[01:36:52] So they, they unloaded a bunch of the stuff, the out of the factory just before the liquidation or what you call the North America bankruptcy of the company.

[01:37:04] Because he was leasing the building.

[01:37:06] He doesn't, did not own the building.

[01:37:09] Right. As well. So here's the thing.

[01:37:12] People are up in arms assuming that Damien and his company have stolen stuff out of this building and hidden it somewhere.

[01:37:23] Which I find a bit ridiculous.

[01:37:26] That's a possibility.

[01:37:28] But here's the thing.

[01:37:29] Businesses are structured in a way to take advantage of tax code and accounting practices.

[01:37:37] So some of the commentaries that people have had, Wayne included, have, I think, have a misunderstanding of how businesses work.

[01:37:45] So in, in Canada, I don't know how it works in Australia or in, in, in the, in the US.

[01:37:51] But we have things called operating companies, which are like Dave's pinball company and a holding company, which might be Dave's Co.

[01:38:00] And that's to avoid things like legal liability, company manufacturing, take advantages of tax codes.

[01:38:08] There's nothing wrong.

[01:38:10] There's nothing illegal of any of that stuff.

[01:38:13] In the US, you have those things called LLCs, right? That's kind of the same thing.

[01:38:18] So Hertz Co is kind of like an LLC, I guess.

[01:38:21] The understanding is that Hertz Co.

[01:38:25] That company was leasing materials to Haggis pinball.

[01:38:31] So now that Haggis pinball is going bankrupt, Hertz Co is now repossessing the materials and the machinery that it had been leasing to Haggis.

[01:38:42] Now, they're both owned by Damien.

[01:38:45] So that seems pretty sketchy, does it not?

[01:38:48] It, it, a lot of people do this though.

[01:38:50] So if Dave pinball needs a CNC machine, maybe I can get a government loan or a bank loan to help me buy the CNC machine or maybe the company that I have,

[01:39:05] my own private company, Dave Co.

[01:39:07] Maybe it's got a bunch of money and I can buy that machine and then I can lease it to Dave pinball.

[01:39:13] So there's like, there's nothing sketchy about that whatsoever.

[01:39:17] The other comment that people have been making is that Damien didn't put any of his own money into Haggis pinball, which is categorically incorrect.

[01:39:26] In fact, there is a creditor list that was listed in NAP Arcade.

[01:39:31] Have you seen this thing?

[01:39:32] Yes, I have seen it.

[01:39:33] That does not clear Damien and it does not clear Haggis pinball for taking deposit money to fund someone else's machine being built.

[01:39:46] That is categorically wrong.

[01:39:48] Damien will get his comeuppance.

[01:39:50] Okay, don't you worry.

[01:39:52] Either that's karma or lost sleep or a heart attack or something.

[01:39:56] He'll get his comeuppance and you're basically running a Ponzi scheme, right?

[01:40:00] So I need Ron's money so I can build Dave's pinball machine.

[01:40:05] That is literally what he was doing, trying to tie in other companies and stealing materials out of a building and all that stuff.

[01:40:14] That is just weird conspiracy theory stuff that I don't think has anything to do with.

[01:40:18] He was just over his head.

[01:40:20] He was over his head and he really wanted to make the games and he just got what is it?

[01:40:26] Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

[01:40:27] I never remember that.

[01:40:28] Exactly.

[01:40:29] That's right.

[01:40:30] And it just kept getting worse and worse and when he should have just cut it off early and just tried to finish up, give people their money back maybe, but he kept trying to go and go.

[01:40:42] Oh, well, I can't build enough machines.

[01:40:44] I need a bigger facility.

[01:40:45] I need to build a bigger facility in the middle of a freaking head.

[01:40:48] He said that he goes all out.

[01:40:49] I mean, when he's into something, he's in it and I'm sure he thought he could get through this, but he could not.

[01:40:57] So if we're looking at the creditors list here, these are in, I think it's USD, but it's listed as Australian dollars.

[01:41:07] One of the people listed here is Hart's Co.

[01:41:10] So that holding company or whatever they call that in Australia, that company is owed $388,000.

[01:41:19] Damien Harten is listed for $621,000.

[01:41:24] Damien's out like a million dollars apparently.

[01:41:27] He deserves no sympathy.

[01:41:30] Trust me.

[01:41:31] He deserves no sympathy.

[01:41:32] The guy doesn't deserve any sympathy for his poor business practices.

[01:41:36] However, to say that he is not owed any, didn't put any of his own money in there is categorically wrong.

[01:41:42] The one that blows my mind here, Ron, are the next two on the list.

[01:41:48] Okay.

[01:41:49] Distributors and individuals.

[01:41:51] Distributors, three in total, which I believe was, who was it?

[01:41:56] Flip it out.

[01:41:57] Nitro and the one in Europe.

[01:42:01] I'm sorry, the one in Europe.

[01:42:03] We didn't have your name.

[01:42:04] But I know Flip and Out said it was a wrap for them.

[01:42:07] It was around $61,000.

[01:42:09] They had to refund.

[01:42:10] $61,000 US, which is a lot of money, Ron.

[01:42:15] It's painful, but man, it's good marketing for his distributorship.

[01:42:19] I would totally just plug that hell out of that forever.

[01:42:23] I would say I am friends with Zach.

[01:42:26] I'm good friends with Zach.

[01:42:27] I'm shocked that even after we set up our bingo episode,

[01:42:31] here's the one that scares the crap out of me.

[01:42:33] There are 86 individuals who I believe dealt directly with Haggis,

[01:42:39] and they are owed $846,000.

[01:42:43] So those are your actual people who bought games.

[01:42:46] I would assume who paid it probably in full.

[01:42:49] Pay deposits.

[01:42:50] That is that breaks my heart.

[01:42:52] So there's 86 more games they had to make.

[01:42:54] So when you look at it, you're like 86 games.

[01:42:56] It's not that many.

[01:42:57] For them, I mean, for Stern, it's probably a couple of week.

[01:43:00] I mean, it's probably pretty quick.

[01:43:02] But it's crushing, right?

[01:43:03] If you can't get pinball legs, you can't ship them out.

[01:43:07] I like employees, $37,000.

[01:43:10] Excluding game, I like planetary pinball, $56,000.

[01:43:14] Which would be the license fee.

[01:43:15] License fee per game that maybe they actually sold or...

[01:43:18] But here's the thing.

[01:43:19] He owes his employees $37,000.

[01:43:22] I don't know for sure.

[01:43:23] It's quite possible that employees either gave him money or are owed wages.

[01:43:30] One of those people is poor Martin Robbins,

[01:43:33] who has been crucified for being an employee.

[01:43:37] It's terrible.

[01:43:39] In his case, it's interesting just because with Deeproot,

[01:43:43] there are certain people in the exact same boat

[01:43:47] that have not been crucified at all.

[01:43:49] Who've actually been welcomed in.

[01:43:51] They're now working for other pinball companies.

[01:43:54] You know what I mean?

[01:43:55] It is interesting.

[01:43:56] I think they almost treat it like they were best buddies

[01:44:00] or something.

[01:44:02] And it's just very interesting.

[01:44:04] And again, it's all speculation on my point.

[01:44:06] I've not talked to Martin Robbins.

[01:44:07] Yeah, we don't know if he was a partner or whatever.

[01:44:11] No clue.

[01:44:12] But it's just interesting.

[01:44:13] People are treated very differently.

[01:44:15] Now, there's a couple other things on the list here.

[01:44:17] A business loan from business fuel.

[01:44:19] That's likely like a local community helping small companies.

[01:44:25] The Commonwealth Bank of Australia's owed $100,000.

[01:44:28] How about the credit card?

[01:44:29] Wow.

[01:44:30] Running up a big credit card bill.

[01:44:31] $57,000.

[01:44:32] So that's an American Express.

[01:44:34] Right?

[01:44:35] So an American Express is supposed to be paid off in full every month

[01:44:37] or the cost of that is through the roof.

[01:44:40] That he owed $153,000 in back taxes.

[01:44:44] That would probably be payroll taxes or, I would say,

[01:44:49] some sort of income tax.

[01:44:53] What do they call that in the US?

[01:44:55] Social security?

[01:44:56] I just like he didn't even pay his landscaper.

[01:44:58] He owed $55.

[01:45:00] $55 for his landscaped lawn.

[01:45:03] There's a lot of people out of a lot of money here.

[01:45:06] Businesses go bankrupt all the time, mostly from poor corporate management.

[01:45:11] And that's exactly what has happened here.

[01:45:13] It's a terrible situation, but please, this is the second cautionary tale

[01:45:19] of startup pinball machine.

[01:45:21] So third or fourth, are you kidding?

[01:45:23] You have.

[01:45:24] But it's the one that we've covered here.

[01:45:25] Yes, you have, I mean, you have Haggis.

[01:45:27] You have deep root, which we'll probably cover eventually.

[01:45:30] You have like,

[01:45:31] Dutch, Skitbee.

[01:45:33] What was the pop-and-dook one?

[01:45:36] Zidware.

[01:45:37] There's so many.

[01:45:39] So please, just listen to us here.

[01:45:43] Did I go off too hard at the end there?

[01:45:45] Well, I'm sure our listeners will tell you if they think you did.

[01:45:49] But let's hear from Damien again.

[01:45:51] This was from the April of 2021.

[01:45:53] When I brought that pinbottom, I said,

[01:45:56] I can make one of these.

[01:45:57] I was a hobby woodworker.

[01:45:59] I can make a cabinet.

[01:46:00] You sort of start down that path.

[01:46:03] And then I need some electronics.

[01:46:05] I can buy a control system.

[01:46:06] But I still got to wire it up.

[01:46:08] I love wiring.

[01:46:09] And I can solder.

[01:46:10] Every little leaf you turn over,

[01:46:12] it's a whole new world of challenges.

[01:46:14] It just goes on and on and on.

[01:46:16] And it just never stops.

[01:46:18] The next time you hear somebody make a comment like that

[01:46:21] when they're starting a pinball company,

[01:46:23] that's a red flag.

[01:46:24] Well, in an interview in July 2023,

[01:46:28] it's probably one of the last interviews I would assume with Damien.

[01:46:32] Yeah, this was with a carry hearty on YouTube.

[01:46:34] He says, so already we know there's issues with the company.

[01:46:39] I wasn't even really cognizant of the fact that there have been

[01:46:42] this litany of failed pinball companies prior to me.

[01:46:46] Yikes.

[01:46:48] I would say a good rule of thumb with these comments,

[01:46:50] being that he wasn't who'd be getting into this.

[01:46:53] If you're going to have a start of pinball companies,

[01:46:55] kind of at least have some veterans in it.

[01:46:58] Some people have done this.

[01:47:00] Yeah.

[01:47:01] And somebody with a boat load of money.

[01:47:03] That always helps.

[01:47:06] But like somebody with manufacturing experience.

[01:47:09] A billionaire.

[01:47:10] That's a fun.

[01:47:11] Yeah, multiple people from spooky who made games,

[01:47:14] including the one owner.

[01:47:17] I think he worked in the film industry.

[01:47:19] So like licensing, he's getting killer licenses.

[01:47:22] I think with the other guy,

[01:47:24] I think he's got to cut him out of money.

[01:47:26] I think they're doing good with the money.

[01:47:27] They got the money.

[01:47:28] They got the experience.

[01:47:29] They have people already made multiple games there.

[01:47:33] So that's kind of, you know, if you have a start up,

[01:47:36] that's what I would think you're looking for.

[01:47:38] But then you could argue like, what about spooky?

[01:47:40] I mean, they had, you know, they were just from the ground up.

[01:47:44] They never made games before.

[01:47:46] So like a modern spooky,

[01:47:49] I probably would never buy any of this stuff

[01:47:51] unless they made a couple games first,

[01:47:53] to prove they could do it.

[01:47:54] Which spooky did?

[01:47:56] Now they, like every time they announced a new game,

[01:47:59] which should be soon.

[01:48:01] Like they don't necessarily sell out,

[01:48:03] depending on the theme,

[01:48:05] but they're doing good for themselves.

[01:48:08] So it is possible,

[01:48:10] but just tread lightly and be cautious.

[01:48:13] Just tread, just tread lightly.

[01:48:15] Just take your time.

[01:48:16] Yes.

[01:48:17] It's like for every successful one,

[01:48:18] there's like three failed ones.

[01:48:20] You go with that.

[01:50:05] So Damien Hartin, he joined the pinball hobby in 2008 when he bought his first pinball machine.

[01:50:12] No, 2018.

[01:50:15] And he spelled his name wrong.

[01:50:16] Hartin?

[01:50:17] No, Damien, it's with an A.

[01:50:19] How was it Damien?

[01:50:20] Yeah, at least when I looked it up, because I wasn't sure either.

[01:50:25] I don't care.

[01:50:26] But then in other parts of the art, you have it correct.

[01:50:28] Yeah, okay, weird.

[01:50:31] If you want to be a serious ticket holder, oh, Siri.

[01:50:44] No, I'm not doing it as the crocodile hunter.

[01:50:46] That's right, Matt, you call that a knife?

[01:50:48] Matt, that's a knife.
