[00:00] Well, the holidays have come and gone once again, but if you've forgotten to get that special

[00:04] someone in your life a gift, well, Mint Mobile is extending their holiday offer of half

[00:09] off unlimited wireless. So here's the idea. You get it now. You call it an early present

[00:14] for next year. What do you have to lose? Give it a try at minmoble.com slash switch.

[00:23] months, $90 for six months or $180 for 12 month plan. Taxes and fees extra off speeds may slow

[00:27] after 50 gigabytes per month when network is busy. See terms.

[00:32] Hopefully you don't hear the pouring rain going on outside because I can. No. No. Is it raining?

[00:38] Oh, it's pouring here. It's supposed to be shitty all weekend. It only rains on the weekend here.

[00:41] Yep. It's always supposed to be shitty this weekend and then Monday it looks like it's okay.

[00:46] So we're doing got leave. Yeah. 45. Holy crap. Now this is Alvin G, right? Yes.

[00:54] I ever, ever through the notes. Where do we leave off on the got leaves last time?

[00:58] So it was when they sold to my old star. Yeah. We haven't gone to all their awesome premiere games yet.

[01:04] Well, we did an 80B episode, but we didn't get into kind of, so we've touched on a lot of that stuff,

[01:12] but we didn't do it like meet the got leaves like. I just don't remember how far I don't think we

[01:17] went into the 90s awesomeness of of teed off and surf and safari, etc. Oh yeah, yeah, we did that.

[01:23] Like that was our cathartic episode. Oh, we did. Okay. Never mind. That was like a long time.

[01:27] I was like fucking four years ago. See, I don't remember any of these things. No, that's five years ago.

[01:33] Holy crap. We've been doing this for five years.

[01:53] Hello, everyone. I'm David Dennis. This is Silver Ball Chronicles. And with me is Ron

[02:10] Panzer optional. How? How you doing? Wow. That's interesting intro. I am wearing pants right now.

[02:17] Well, they are optional, however. And I believe if you recall, when I scheduled this meeting today,

[02:24] I said the pants were optional. Scheduled this meeting. Interesting terminology. Yes.

[02:29] Because we are now on teams. No more caskip is dead. Long live teams. Which you immediately had an

[02:37] issue where it blew out and then I wasn't on it and stuff. And so we're starting to get immediately.

[02:43] Yeah, we're already like 10 minutes behind because I screwed this up. But anyway, I think it's turned

[02:49] out very well. I didn't wear pants. So I took my advice. So what have you been doing?

[02:56] Recording podcast with you. Yes. And you've got your massive cluster Vuck coming up on the

[03:03] SlamTill podcast. Yes. My other podcast. SlamTill podcast. Yes. Yes. With Bruce Nightingale. Yes,

[03:09] with Bruce Nightingale. He'll be happy we mentioned him. Yes. He does that podcast when he's not on a

[03:14] cruise ship. Yeah. He takes lots of cruises. He's one of them people now. Cruise people. I don't get it.

[03:21] I don't get it. It seems like you've been a lot. It seems like it could be crowded. Lots of people

[03:26] around you. Kids everywhere. Just seems like it would suck. It's like here in Canada. A lot of

[03:31] people would go to Cuba. That's the thing. And then when there are Cuban person, they go to Cuba.

[03:36] Now all they do, all you do is you hear about Cuba. Cuba, Cuba, Cuba. You go to Cuba. You want

[03:40] to come to Cuba with me. Have you been to Cuba? Have you seen Cuba? They have different dollars in Cuba.

[03:46] I don't get it. But I guess we're pinball people and we travel for pinball stuff. Is there any

[03:51] pinball games based on Cuba? Oh, there's got maybe special force kind of. No, that would have been

[03:58] that would have been like what like Nick Aragua maybe isn't that wasn't that the big thing in the

[04:03] 80s. Okay. Now that we've offended everybody in South America and South America too. I have to make

[04:09] references to the Canadian accent every episode. Well, you spell favorite wrong again in the notes.

[04:15] I've noticed you keep putting those use in there for some reason. I don't get it. I spelled it

[04:19] correctly. The king was here in Canada this week. Oh, King King. That's so I'm so used to saying

[04:24] Prince Charles because he's been a prince. Charles the third 90% of my life. Did our speech to

[04:31] throne? We had a parade where he walked around people in funny hats. There was a guy with a big

[04:38] black stick and he banged it on a door. It was amazing. I miss the princes trust rock concerts.

[04:44] Remember those? Back in the 80s. No, you don't remember those. I don't remember anything from the

[04:48] 80s. That's right. You weren't alive. I remember ET and that's like yeah. But they were really

[04:51] cool. They'd have like all the biggest artists of the era and Prince Charles and Diana would just

[04:57] sit up there on the balcony and Prince Charles looked all awkward like he was trying to act like

[05:02] he was into it. It was hilarious. This is our first free and clear episode. We are no longer on the

[05:08] pinball network. We're our own podcast now. Yeah, we don't even have to mention Zach and Nicole

[05:15] Manny of Flippin out pinball. Not at all. A pinball group that you per taken when it comes to the

[05:21] purchasing of your pinball machines. Isn't that correct? The last few yes. That is correct. It's

[05:26] right. You can call him on evenings and weekends at the most awkward times and he'll sell you a

[05:31] pinball. We recommend you do it that way too. Yeah. That's Zach, Z-A-C-H at Flipp, the letter N,

[05:38] out pinball.com. He also sells the escalaries. Yeah. Now we're sponsored by them.

[05:44] So if you're like me and you own way too many games and you're old and decrepit,

[05:48] you need to get the escalaries stair climbing and truck. You need to get it now. Trust me. Do you

[05:54] have one of those? Yes, I do. See, I got I got to put two pinball machines in my basement this weekend

[05:59] and they've been upstairs waiting to come down into my basement for like three weeks. And I just

[06:06] if you had an escalare, it'd be a piece of cake. I took missile command down last week.

[06:10] Mm-hmm. Do you think that's heavier than James Bond? No. No. Because it was really heavy and my wife

[06:17] and I yelled at each other all the time got down to the floor. The heaviest thing is the monitor. Yeah.

[06:21] Oh.

[06:23] For little so Patreon we've had new patrons join us. Josh, Darby and Brandon thanks so much for joining

[06:29] the Patreon. Your merch should be out in the next month or so. So thank you so much for joining.

[06:36] Welcome. You can remember you can join us at three dollars a month. No big commitment.

[06:40] But if you jump on it, six dollars a month. As a premium crony, you get access to the discord.

[06:45] You can chit chat with us. Most of it is my food and barbecue habits. We've also got voting

[06:52] on upcoming topics like this topic was voted on. Yes. And the discord by the Patreon. By the

[06:58] patrons. Patrons. Plus you get early ad free access to the show. I post the show early on Patreon. So

[07:05] everybody gets it ahead and there's none of these silly ads that are throughout it that bother.

[07:10] Becoming an elitist crony of $20 a month after three months, you get a free silver ball chronicles

[07:16] t-shirt. And after some errors in shipping, I finally got that sorted. So trust me, you'll get your

[07:23] shirts now. You sent them to Cuba, didn't you? I did. Also, if you found us on any of your pod

[07:32] catchers, please leave us a five star review or a thumbs up, write us a review. That really

[07:36] helps other people find us. We jump up in the algorithm that way. Well, if it's a 10 star,

[07:41] you know, then then we're mediocre. So it should be the highest star you could possibly do. Yes,

[07:46] exactly. Exactly. I think they, I think it's all five stars. I don't think anybody does anything

[07:51] more than five. I don't know why they do five. Everything used to be four back in my day. Where

[07:56] do the X star come from? Was it four stars? Oh, it was four stars. Four stars is always like four

[08:02] stars. And then at some point four wasn't enough. It became five stars. It wasn't enough. So now

[08:06] it's five stars. Oh, get it. Look at that. You could also grab a shirt at silverballswag.com. We

[08:15] did sell a couple last month. So thank you, everybody. Cool. Make sure you get the ones with my name

[08:21] on it first. Those are the limited edition ones. What happens if I want to email silver ball chronicles?

[08:29] Oh, well, then you'd have to use a computer run. And you'd have to send your email to silverball

[08:34] chronicles at gmail.com. That's silverball chronicles at gmail.com. Can you tell we don't rehearse anything?

[08:41] Yeah. Yeah. We all just jambled it together and fixed it in post. Here's a really cool

[08:47] episode, a really cool email from Jack Winari. Jersey Jack himself. Yes, emailed us,

[08:53] which always worries me when someone we've done something about emails. I'm excited. Oh, yeah.

[08:58] Oh, like your stuff was totally wrong. You guys suck. And I'm suing you.

[09:03] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And Jack basically said that about you. But however, for me, he said the

[09:09] following, I listened to episode 44 of silverball chronicles. And I'm humbled by your collective

[09:15] thoughts about me. There's obviously a lot more to the story and to all my years in the industry

[09:22] and all the experiences I've had and all the things I've done and I never did it alone.

[09:30] There were always people supporting me and guiding me and working with me as a team. I'm sure

[09:37] I could write a few books about it. While most of it was accurate, it was not completely accurate.

[09:44] And I'm fine with it as it is, but I can fill in some blanks for you. Let's do some corrections.

[09:51] Yeah. So here's the thing. We always kind of know that things are accurate, but not completely

[09:57] accurate. That's like our thing. Because we like to leave that speculation in the name.

[10:02] Is that under our name now? Silverball Chronicles. Accurate, but not completely accurate.

[10:07] That'll be the next shirt. Yes. But I'll get a shirt. I'll get a shirt done with that on it.

[10:11] And we try our best to be as clear and to do those sort of things. But there's always like

[10:18] spin, right? So he's always trying to spin something, but there's some things you can't spin and

[10:22] those are facts. And I'll tell you what Jack has given us some facts here. What about this one?

[10:30] He says for Neiman Marcus, we said that he sold games through Neiman Marcus. Well, Jack says,

[10:37] I never sold games through Neiman Marcus. They bought 12 x file games from Mondial,

[10:42] distributing in Springfield, New Jersey and Sega pinball program the game number on the dot

[10:47] matrix display with the Neiman Marcus name. That was in 1997. And aside from running my game route,

[10:54] I was a consultant at Mondial from March 1997 to May 1998. Neiman put a plaque on the game and a

[11:02] certificate was signed by the design team. Ah, so there you go. So we talked a little bit about

[11:09] that sort of catalog industry of Neiman Marcus, particularly in that New York, New Jersey area.

[11:15] And that was how he bumped into the Abyss family. Now Jane Abyss, Jack would say,

[11:23] bought a game from Neiman Marcus. And it broke. And since Mondial was the Sega distributor in New

[11:29] Jersey, they contacted Jack to fix her game in Florida. And because he couldn't do that, he reached

[11:38] out to the operator friends that he had in Florida. And they repaired the game for her. But that was

[11:44] how they originally had met. Pretty cool. What about F A O Schwartz? Is it Schwartz or Schwartz?

[11:55] Schwartz? Yeah, it is Schwartz. No tea. Everyone always says that wrong. So this is like a toy company,

[12:04] right? Like something like that. I've seen my kids with a binoculars. It's a New York City thing.

[12:10] I don't know what it is. Yeah. And my my other daughter got like a clay molding kit and it's

[12:15] from this company. And my assumption is they just get their stuff made in China and they slap

[12:19] their name on it and they send it out. Jack says I was called called by the buyer from F A O Schwartz

[12:26] in New York City. They wanted a pinball game for their holiday catalog in 1998. I put in Star Wars

[12:32] trilogy. They sold a few. The following year, 1999 F A O Schwartz catalog, I put a Star Wars

[12:40] Episode One and they sold for 7500. Yeah, I would have been expensive, even. I don't think they would.

[12:47] Oh Williams went out of business October 25th, 1999. So I had to cover the potential order so that

[12:54] F A O would have stock. I made a standing order for 100 Star Wars Episode One games. Though the

[13:00] holiday. Oh man. Through the holiday season and a few months later into the New Year F A O sold

[13:05] all 100 games. And the year 2000, the first full year of business for pinball sales.com, we did 1.4

[13:13] million worth of business with 75% of it being F A O Schwartz. Wow. Thank you, Jack, for that

[13:21] feedback and those corrections. Very, very cool. How amazing would that relationship be? Like as

[13:30] I mentioned in the last episode, our Jersey Jack, part one episode, Jack was able to identify

[13:38] opportunities. He would see an opportunity and he'd be able to pursue it. But I'm sure he saw lots

[13:44] of opportunities, which he skipped, which might have been a terrible idea, but might have actually

[13:50] paid off. But there's probably tons of options where he skipped them and he avoided catastrophe.

[13:56] So Jack has always been very good at identifying relationships and potential winners.

[14:03] And there's a prime example of it. I just looked up F A O Schwartz. It looks like toys.

[14:07] They do toys. Now, another big, we got a lot of feedback this last episode and there was big

[14:13] feedback. So Robert Quinn reached out to us in an email. And this one I thought was super cool.

[14:19] And it also plays very close to your heart. Yes, Robert Quinn was the programmer for Stern's

[14:25] Nine Ball. Robert Quinn reached out and he said, just found and I'm listening to Silverball

[14:32] Chronicles episode number two. He's a way back in the archives. He's in the weeds, my friend.

[14:39] It was a very good summary of the early days of Stern. I'm okay with a very good summary.

[14:47] He needs to correct an error though. That has been propagated through the years. He's even trying

[14:52] to get the internet pinball database to correct this, but they have not responded. Exactly.

[14:57] So back in the day, you didn't have like, what is it? Get hub or whatever that the programmers

[15:02] use nowadays to keep track of software stuff. There's a thing on IPDB and there's other,

[15:09] there are 60 revisions of Nine Ball. But there's not 60, they weren't, there weren't 60 revisions of

[15:15] it production Nine Ball machines. He says, I was the programmer for Nine Ball. There were not

[15:21] 60 revisions of production code. There wasn't any real sort of software version control like

[15:27] get back then. So we just numbered software revisions. The one that got released was number 60

[15:33] something. The note makes it sound like there were 60 revisions after the game went into production,

[15:38] which was certainly not the case. Yeah, there you go. So that's a great example of how they were

[15:44] flying by the seat of their pants back in the day, right? They're just like, they just kept

[15:48] rewriting the e-prom as they were working through it. He also mentions, and this is the thing that

[15:53] Plague's Nine Ball is the losing of the balls all the time. Well, it kind of gets confused on how

[16:00] many balls it has. And he says, we did have all sorts of ball counting issues during development.

[16:06] The outhaul blade switches were a nightmare. They would bounce after the ball rolled over them and

[16:11] make contact during gameplay if not precisely adjusted. Yes, that is true. It was also early in

[16:16] multi-ball pin development. And these issues were new and not well understood. Yes, there were

[16:21] problems in the field if the switches were not adjusted correctly. And he also says, cramming

[16:27] the rule set, Steve Kirk wanted into 8k, not like eight kilobytes, not eight megabytes or

[16:35] terrible sites or gigabytes. Very, very cool. Thank you so much for that feedback. Anything else

[16:43] to tie that up? I thought it was interesting how he said Steve Kirk was not a stern employee.

[16:49] He was doing it as a contractor. So he would just show up once a week to get the new e-proms

[16:55] for his game, which I assume he had at his house. Yeah. And then he then he'd give some feedback and

[17:00] do this and do that. And they're trying to cram all of this. So he's designing some of the greatest

[17:04] games ever and he's doing it from his house. Legend, Steve Kirk legend. He's coming in going to

[17:10] go into Portillo's getting a hot dog, having a coffee. I'm telling you, Steve Kirk is my name is

[17:13] three for three. That's why I call three for three Steve Kirk. And I have all three of stars,

[17:19] meteor and nine ball. Yeah, I do love some stars. So let's jump into today's. Wow. It's the longest

[17:26] but before jumping into the topic, I think it might be. It was a pretty good, it was a pretty good

[17:30] preamble. Oh, preamble. Yes, that's the proper term. Yes, there's going to be lots of people

[17:35] who are not happy interested in any of that. I hope you are. If you like corrections, we'd like

[17:42] to be as correct as we can when the person actually involves this, hey, this is what actually happened.

[17:47] You got a primary source. You got to say it. They'll like, it's crazy. If there's two people involved

[17:52] and they both say different things. Then, yeah, you know, the truth's probably somewhere on the wall.

[17:57] Steve Richie. Now we've visited David Gottlieb and Alvin Gottlieb before in our first episode of

[18:04] Meet the Gottliebs. David, the patriarch of the Gottlieb family came from nothing and with

[18:12] smart business sense and tight budgeting created the Gottlieb and co they navigated wars,

[18:20] they navigated recessions and they also navigated a transition to another generation. All of this

[18:29] while becoming the Cadillac of the pinball industry. When David retired, it was his son Alvin who

[18:37] took over operations along with his uncle Judd Weinberg. That was when things really changed in

[18:45] pinball and the industry would never be the same. This month, it's part two of Meet the Gottliebs.

[18:54] So what was happening in the pinball industry in the late 1970s? We're going from

[19:00] electro-mecanicles to solid state. Yeah, the microchip, right? Silicon Valley. Which at the beginning

[19:09] of it, Gottlieb actually did pretty well for all they get ragged on for their system one architecture.

[19:16] As we went over in our episode, their early system one game sold a ton because they were the Cadillac.

[19:21] They were built well. They were easy to understand and they had really cool design features.

[19:28] Games like Sinbad and Countdown. Ah, so good. Sinbad is awesome. I love Sinbad. I love Countdown.

[19:35] Sinbad would be better if it was like a different theme. One of the reasons it's the theme it

[19:40] it is and I don't know if people realize it, it is a licensed theme. Yeah, from that sort of

[19:45] Sinbad or like Sinbad moves. Yeah, like late 60s or something. Well, no, the original Sinbad

[19:50] movie was in the 50s and then they make two more in the 70s and they're all mostly known for

[19:56] the Ray Harry house and special effects. Who is that? One of the great special effects do's ever

[20:01] stop motion animation. Oh, right. I knew I knew that name somewhere. But I believe they were made

[20:08] by Columbia Pictures who owned Gottlieb. So that's why that's why they did that. That's why they

[20:14] had close encounters. Exactly. We talked a lot about that sale from sort of like D. Gottlieb and

[20:21] Co. to Columbia Pictures in that transitional period and then there was another transition and

[20:29] that was when Gottlieb moved over to Millstar or Milstar or some people say. Why did Alvin

[20:38] Gottlieb get out of the ownership structure of Gottlieb? Well, we speculated before and

[20:45] it was never really like I couldn't find an article where Alvin specifically said why or why

[20:51] Judd Weinstein specifically said why. But that's when Michael Gottlieb, the grandson of David and

[20:58] the son of Alvin, reached out to us in an email and I made a pretty big correction in our last

[21:05] episode. This was the reason he gave us about why Alvin and Judd decided to get out of DeG Gottlieb.

[21:11] Yes, Michael Gottlieb says dad and uncle Judd sold DeG Gottlieb and company because they

[21:16] were getting older. Further, Atari had been bought by water communications, which sparked an

[21:21] interest in Columbia Pictures acquiring a game company. DeG Gottlieb had huge capital gains and

[21:26] Columbia Pictures had a tax loss carry forward that year. So it made sense from a tax perspective

[21:32] there you go. So it was just an opportunity. The opportunity came up. The grind of years and years

[21:38] and years, Alvin Gottlieb, you know, going from like the wedgehead era moving into this new time,

[21:46] he's getting older and there's probably a lot of money on the table from somebody like a

[21:51] like Columbia Pictures. And Michael was too young to take over yet because I think he was just a kid.

[21:56] Exactly, exactly. So Alvin Gottlieb would say when Coca-Cola bought out Columbia things changed.

[22:03] Coca-Cola was one of the mega corporations where you have a meeting about a meeting to decide to

[22:10] have a meeting. Now that wasn't exactly our management style. So now you can see that there's some

[22:18] trouble in this Myelstar era and we have a whole sort of episodes back in the archives about

[22:25] that era, the sort of the 80 A era, the 80 A era. Do you remember when that Gottlieb

[22:30] employee said about the Myelstar name, what it is backwards? It was rat slime. If you,

[22:35] rats slime backwards. If you spell it backwards. Yes, I can't on see that now after that comment.

[22:41] So that was when they'd ended up going through a pretty catastrophic mess. And then there was the

[22:47] sale to premiere technology. That was kind of the 80 B era that 80s cheese done right, I think,

[22:55] is what we called that episode in the archives, which then eventually led to the system three era

[23:02] of pinball through the 90s. And those are all in the archives. So we're going to skip a lot of that

[23:08] because the episode today isn't necessarily about Gottlieb. It's about the Gottlieb's. You had

[23:15] mentioned previously, why didn't Alvin or Judd's children take over instead of, instead of

[23:22] Columbia or Coca-Cola? Well, Michael says neither David or Judd had children that were interested

[23:27] in taking over the business. Judd's boys were all doing their own thing and my brother and I were

[23:32] too young. Just comes down to it, right? It just was not the right time. And when you see an

[23:37] opportunity to exit, to transition out, you take that, I think. And who blames them? Right?

[23:45] How did you, how did you feel the games changed when you could feel there was less sort of

[23:51] Gottlieb in the company? To me, they were always Gottlieb. Gottlieb was its own thing. It really

[23:58] didn't change much. They played by their own rules. They were always kind of called all these

[24:02] weird designs for people always complain that all the designs are same. It's like, you haven't

[24:07] looked at Gottlieb, obviously, because all their stuff is very unique all over the place.

[24:14] That was very much the style even in the previous sort of ownership structure, right? Those

[24:20] EM games were all weird. They had weird flippers and weird places and they were experimenting and

[24:26] doing those things. It's like that philosophy carried over through this. I would actually say a lot

[24:29] of the EMs are kind of samey when they started getting into like solid states and a wide body

[24:34] era. Then they just went crazy. They just put things everywhere like insane. And I think they

[24:40] kept that all the way through the 90s. They just have just crazy stuff in their games.

[24:45] Now we talked about in previous episodes, you know, wipe out. You have a ski jump thing where the

[24:49] thing just rocks back and forth. It's crazy. This stuff dancing cactus. Dancing cactus is

[24:57] cacti. I'm sorry. Or the stargate as the thing that comes out moves around, which is super cool.

[25:03] It's all just when you look at the Williams games, they took a lot less risk,

[25:10] right? And then as Williams aged, you could tell that the refinement of flow and shot feel and

[25:17] ball movement back to the flipper was always like a priority. And that's probably a holdover

[25:23] from like Steve Richie's influence through high speed and you know, Terminator 2 and all of that

[25:30] stuff. But then as you kind of look for something different, that different was totally

[25:38] all the way over on that got leave side. They went different and they just went all in.

[25:44] That takes us to Michael got leave. Okay. So we spoke about David. We spoke about Alvin. Now this

[25:50] episode is primarily about Michael. Michael grew up in Chicago and his first memories of pinball

[25:58] were of the of Chester, the delivery driver for got leave who would show up every month

[26:05] and remove a pinball machine from Alvin Gottlieb's house and replace it with the newest model.

[26:11] David would play this game and his family would play the game and Michael would play the game

[26:18] and they would all build these fond memories of the new game arriving and the old game leaving

[26:25] how cool would it be if the newest model of game arrived every month and the oldest model left.

[26:31] It's pretty much like Gary Stern's apartment. It's basic is it's he still does that.

[26:35] He still does that. He'll have a game. If he really likes it. Joel who does all the streaming for

[26:42] the Flippin O'Pimball channel. He's all in on that as well. He gets the newest game in and the

[26:48] oldest game out pretty regularly. Is it anything that hates you? That's what I thought. Okay. Yeah.

[26:53] So him and I have a rivalry. We both have have great hatred for you. Yes. Your rivals over

[26:59] nothing. Okay.

[27:52] what you could swing on over to kissonline.com. So the coolest thing that I got from

[28:00] this old episode. So we talk about this pretty regularly that we look for these primary sources

[28:06] from the the horses mouth if you will. There was a there was an old episode of Topcast with

[28:12] Michael Gottlieb. And then about halfway through he just like brings his dad on like I don't know

[28:17] if he took like conference calls him in or something. I can't remember. But this is where we get a lot

[28:21] of the information. And there's some cool stuff in here. One of them is David's first memory of

[28:27] the first pinball machine that he can remember and that machine was Jungle King. So I look this up.

[28:34] Okay. This is from May of 1973. It's not a big seller. It's 825 units. So by all

[28:45] uh, intense and purposes, not a big seller because they were selling what like

[28:50] 3000 units on the regular in this era. This was designed by Ed Kinsky who's the one who made

[28:59] that quote about Ratslime. And Gordon Morrison. Okay. So I had just mentioned not a lot of production

[29:08] units. And there is a specific reason why this did not sell a lot of units because this was the

[29:16] add-a-ball version. And we spoke about this in our previous Gottlieb episode. What was add-a-ball

[29:20] Ron? Nah, you can win basically extra balls. They didn't call them extra balls. Instead of getting a

[29:27] replay, basically in an area where winning free games was illegal. Instead, you have an add-a-ball

[29:34] game. Mostly sort of like, uh, what was it like France and Italy and in Europe. They had a problem

[29:38] with win like a gate like a game was a thing of value. That was the way that the legislation was.

[29:44] Well, add-a-ball, the ball, getting an extra ball was not a thing of value. It was just extending your

[29:50] play. So this is the same game as 1972's Wild Life, which was the two-player replay version.

[29:58] And Gottlieb's jungle in 1972. What's the four-player version? The jungle one. Yeah, that's right.

[30:05] So the reason there's not that now if we look at, okay, well, how many did Wild Life sold? Well,

[30:10] it sold 3,875 units. And jungle, the four-player sold 5,775 units. It sold a lot, but not this

[30:22] specific model. What is the theme of this game? It's the Tarzan guy. Did they have George of the

[30:27] jungle back then? Yes, probably. Yeah, probably. So this is kind of like that, right? It's like the

[30:35] good-looking sort of cartoony muscular guy with the cartoony silly animals in the jungle. Very like

[30:43] kid-friendly, like clearly something that you know, you want to do incentivize younger players.

[30:51] The backlash on this is awesome. It's like a guy in a banana hammock hanging out with like animals.

[30:58] A banana hammock. Oh, is that what you call it? See when I see Jungle King being a child of the 80s,

[31:05] I just think of the video game, which is most people know it is Jungle Hunt. And it was originally

[31:11] Jungle King and it was Tarzan. And they got sued because they used the Johnny Wise Miller,

[31:18] you know, like that sound clip. It's actually in the game. And they had to redo it as Jungle Hunt.

[31:25] So instead of Tarzan, they made them some like some British dude with a monocle who's like an

[31:30] explorer. But they kept all the other graphics the same. Michael Hunt. Michael Hunt. What's that name?

[31:37] Okay. What about this flyer? Check this out. It's exciting. It has fascinating features like

[31:43] multi-bonus, making the top center roll over doubles bonus value. It also has a 10 roll over sequence.

[31:50] Did you know that? Did you hitting all 10 roll overs lights bulls eye targets inside roll overs to score

[31:56] added balls? Yeah. So it's a symmetrical play field, right? So it's basically the same, well,

[32:02] it is the same thing on the left and the same thing on the right, which I think comes from this

[32:07] era where they're like, I got a bang out of game this week. So I just sort of like copy paste.

[32:12] But it does have kind of a fun game play because you can shoot these elephant roll overs kind of

[32:19] almost on a flowy arc. And it's a bit of a tight shot. It's really cool. No draw targets that I

[32:25] can see. No spinner two demarrads. Yeah. And then it's got the Bozo targets here, right? The

[32:31] wow targets where if you shoot those that goes right for the outline, however, it does have the

[32:36] outline gate. So where the outline gate opens and then it goes back into the shooter lane.

[32:43] Love when that happens. So you like out lane gates? I love out lane gates. And it also has like this

[32:49] really cool like ball save feature on the bottom left where the ball goes down the left outline and

[32:56] then into like a compartment and it shoots it out. It's basically like a kickback except with a

[33:01] gate. All what also having a gate. So so you can activate that gate and then oh so much fun.

[33:09] It looks like a cool game. And it's got that thing in the middle. There was a lot of these godly

[33:12] wedge heads had the the pop bumper in the middle with the rubbers around it. So then when the ball

[33:18] would get into this like action, it was just the pop and then you as a as a pinball muggle, you're like

[33:24] yay, I'm doing things and getting points and there's action, but it's actually not doing anything at

[33:29] all. It's always very exciting. It's a cool game. It's and I can see why he remembers that it's

[33:35] stuck in his head because it's clearly got like the the cartoony thing to it with the jungle and

[33:43] that you know, I can see how they got that stuck in there. What are the other games that he remembers?

[33:48] He really likes jet spin and the bowling one 300. I like 300 300 is good. I remember Royal

[33:56] Flush was really good when we had that in 76. It was kind of weird because if you had a game that

[34:01] you really, really liked you didn't want the truck to come and take it away for another one.

[34:05] But it was my dad's old line. What's your favorite game? And his answer was always the next one.

[34:10] Classic. That's like a takeoff that's Gary Stern modified that to the game on the line.

[34:16] Is this favorite? Now, anytime that Michael and his brother Joe would have a day off school,

[34:21] Alvin would always take them to the factory. And that's mostly because I think back then they

[34:26] didn't have daycare. So he just let your employees deal with kids. Michael would say it was like

[34:33] Willy Wonka land. I could see that. Be amazing. Well, Alvin says, I was born into the industry and

[34:40] as a child, my father took me around his factory. When the boys were old enough, it was my pleasure to

[34:44] take them around and show them our operation. So that's such a dad thing, isn't it?

[34:50] Like, I remember going to the factory with my dad and I'm going to take my kids to the factory.

[34:55] At the age of 16, Michael spent one summer working at Daddy East under Joe Kamen Cow.

[35:00] That's interesting. See, if the son, if the son of the Gottlieb's working at a competing company.

[35:09] Yeah, but this was the time, right? Like by the time Michael was 16, right? It's the Myelstar era,

[35:15] the they've moved into premier technology. It's not the same company anymore. Like it has some of the

[35:20] it's premier and it says Gottlieb on it. So and his name is name is Michael Gottlieb. But while he was

[35:27] at Daddy East, he helped put together play fields, got coffee donuts. He put stickers on Monday night

[35:34] This is the son of like what the biggest person ever in the pinball industry, David Gottlieb.

[35:40] Grant son, but yes, I'm sorry, grandson. You put Harry Williams in that as well, right?

[35:46] Who would you Gary Stern? But Gary Stern wasn't Gary Stern at this time.

[35:50] What does Michael say about it? He says it was a trip. It was really a fascinating experience. A lot

[35:55] of the lessons you learn when Joe and Gary were doing what they were doing on a very, very modest

[36:00] budget. You know, those were very valuable lessons. It doesn't matter how much money you have,

[36:06] you're a lot more resourceful when you don't have nearly as much George Gomez talks about this,

[36:11] right? At the current day, Stern, where like you have your bill of materials and you have these,

[36:16] you have to play in the sandbox. Yes, the sandbox. And that makes you more that makes you more creative

[36:22] as opposed to being able to do anything and everything. The way I think of it now, like I love

[36:27] movies. I'm probably a lot like Jeff Teolus that way. I love movies. Now a days you could like,

[36:33] I don't remember all these terrible silly movies that I saw when I was younger that hold this like

[36:38] nostalgia in me that I don't even know how I would find those today with streaming, right? There's

[36:44] just so much content across so many different platforms and you can just access it at any time.

[36:50] And you don't necessarily have to pay as much attention to it because you could do six things at once

[36:54] while you're watching this film. I think that speaks very much to the same way you have to be

[36:58] resourceful when you've got everything. It's a lot harder to be as creative and focused.

[37:04] But when you're in the sandbox, I think that drives a lot of creativity. Now Michael went to Northern

[37:11] Illinois University and did a degree in business management. What can you tell me about

[37:17] Northern Illinois University? Your favorite? Oh, N.I.U. Yeah, they were, they were where it's at.

[37:25] I have no idea. I've never heard of it. It started like my university. It's like, I got it.

[37:30] It's not exactly the Ottawa. Oh, you. The real OU, not that fake one you guys.

[37:38] Alvin G and Co. Okay, here's where we get into a thing.

[37:42] So, Alvin came up with this game idea called soccer ball, which was like a two-ended pinball

[37:52] machine. Right. And we had seen these competition pinball machines before, right? They had tried them

[37:58] kind of in the in the 80s. Do you remember those? You mean like, joust. Exactly. Like that. That was

[38:04] this kind of idea. But Alvin's been like retired for years. We're talking like early 90s now.

[38:11] He's been retired for years. And then just kind of like one day is like, I've got a great idea.

[38:16] So, Alvin and Michael originally intended for Gil Pollock and premier technologies to build that.

[38:23] And that's the new Gottlieb, right? Premier technologies. But at the time, Premier was so busy

[38:31] building their crazy amount of games in the early 90s. They just didn't have time.

[38:37] Teed offs. I love me. So, I would be saying there's too many lights, camera actions. That'd be

[38:45] late 80s, early 90s. That's on the borderline. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, what did Michael say?

[38:52] Michael says, Gottlieb hospital had a building on a piece of property that they had bought. So,

[38:57] we thought, let's start a pinball company and see what happens. And that was exactly what we did.

[39:03] Now, this was what that rebirth of pinball, right? Like it had this weird death in the early mid 80s.

[39:12] But things just started bumping. Yeah. Late 80s, early 90s. It was hot again.

[39:16] When you're sitting back and you see all this money on the table, you kind of want to get to the

[39:20] table. You want to be there. But the problem that they had with developing this new pinball company

[39:26] was you couldn't use the Gottlieb. He couldn't use his own name. That's why they went with Alvin G,

[39:31] the G being Gottlieb and Co to tie it back to De Gottlieb and Co. Yeah. I mean, it's a good work

[39:37] around. Most people in the industry would probably know who Alvin G was. Anybody in the know would

[39:45] probably know they were Gottlieb. And anybody who didn't know would be like, oh, pinball. They don't

[39:49] care anyway. Now, they targeted 13 games mostly for the European market because that's who love

[39:57] soccer. And I will include a video tour of Alvin G and Gottlieb from an old TNT Amusements YouTube

[40:08] video, which is from a expo pinball expo had that was that was their tour that year.

[40:16] Exactly. Now, who is TNT Amusements? That's Todd Tucky. Todd, he is a legend in the industry. I

[40:24] guarantee if you're listening to this podcast, you have been on YouTube and you have seen Todd Tucky's

[40:31] oddness all over YouTube. He is, you know, not just entertaining and fun, but his archival footage.

[40:39] You know what I mean? Like all this old VHS recordings that he did hit some of the first tutorials

[40:46] like in the late 80s. No one did that. Like wild, all this stuff. And he's put this on the YouTube

[40:53] and now YouTube, of course, has all of this on there. And it's like there for life basically

[41:00] so cool to see that being paid forward. So people like you and I can reference it and spread it

[41:07] even further. So, so tip of the hat. And you can see there, they're building mystery castles.

[41:11] There's a mystery castles in this video that they're building and we'll speak about that. There's

[41:16] the the world tour band. What's his name? And we'll get to that in a second. There's there's people

[41:21] like like filling out their like soldering and all that stuff and the soccer game. It's so cool.

[41:30] All this stuff is so cool. And then all of a sudden in the middle of it, a judge read pops up. Like,

[41:35] wait a minute, that's not in their factory. That better not be in their factory. Wait a second.

[41:39] There's a twilight zone. Some last action heroes. I assume that's probably bad.

[41:44] Yeah. So really cool. Very neat. Go ahead and check that out if if you're looking for some time

[41:51] to kill. Now, what made this sort of Alvin G and Co kind of interesting? What was their their

[42:01] their catch besides this double-ended sort of idea for a game? Well, they had to come up with new

[42:07] boards. Yeah. Because you just can't go and steal Williams boards and make a game. Well, that

[42:12] is dead. But most of the time you don't want to do that. You want to come up with your own stuff.

[42:17] So they had a combo PCP and PCB and driver board, probably like a combo MPU and driver board. I

[42:24] assume is what that meant was contracted out. This was when everyone had all those add-on boards,

[42:30] etc. So, so like if you open up a system 80B or you open up even some of the later system

[42:39] threes, it's like there's a board tethered to another board tethered to another board. There's a

[42:43] sound board and a driver board. It's all through the 90s and the power board. It's just all over the

[42:49] place. Well, they came up and contracted. So contracting it out. Let's let's contracting out

[42:57] basically meant that they gave somebody the requirements and then they built the board. They

[43:02] didn't build the board in house, which was probably more common, which is it's the same thing

[43:07] that Kotlieb did when they first went to solid state. They also contracted it out,

[43:13] which ended up being fantastic at first, but a train wreck when they tried to expand or change it.

[43:19] I do that. They did that once and then they said, you know, let's do it again. Yeah,

[43:23] yeah, exactly. You know, that worked out so well in the in the 80s. They also made sure that they

[43:31] had high fidelity stereo sound, which was by far superior to most of the other sort of sound boards

[43:40] at the time. See, I think it's I've never heard one of these that every time I play one of these

[43:45] that's out of show, you can barely hear it anyway. So I've never heard one of like an LVG game by

[43:51] itself to really critique how good this sounds. Yeah. So some people say that the pin sound board

[43:57] installed in these games is even better, but it's taken that long to do it. Now that's opinion.

[44:02] That's not actually fact. Well, what is fact? What is a fact is that they sample rates were CD

[44:07] quality 320 kilobits per second. That's I don't even know what that means. I don't think it's

[44:12] cool. It's KPS, whatever. That's the sampling rate, whatever. 128 in a ball of his considered CD

[44:17] quality. So this is 320. So that's yeah. So it's so it's even super good. So they're sitting around

[44:24] the table and they come up with this idea for this, you know, football soccer game and they're

[44:31] like, okay, well, we got this building over there by the by the hospital that we can use. And

[44:37] oh, why don't we, you know, oh, this is what we'd need for a bunch of boards and then they kind

[44:41] of outsource that. And then all of a sudden before you know it, holy crap, we have a small pinball

[44:46] company on the way here. Nowadays, there's a startup every you can't throw a dead cat,

[44:51] when they would hit a pinball startup somewhere. But during this time, you've basically got Williams.

[44:56] You got the startup of Daddy East and that's that's kind of it, right? Well,

[45:00] premier or premier Capcom would be a little bit later. But there's no sort of like everybody has

[45:07] a big brother. They all have this big company behind them. Nobody is kind of just

[45:12] Elvin Gottlieb, you know, in his garage, you know, I mean, like that's more common now than it

[45:17] was at this time. Do you want to talk about this game? This this this football, a G soccer ball,

[45:22] a G soccer ball. I'm trying to think of if I've seen this game. Oh, you've totally seen this game.

[45:27] Now they made a thousand units. It was 500 of each. One of them was for the European market being

[45:32] sold. They only made 13 and they made 500. Yeah, a thousand, 500 of each. Yeah, it's pretty wild.

[45:39] So let me open this thing up here. Let me let me we're on the IPDB. That org. And we're going to look

[45:44] at the awesome flyer that has to exist for this. Yes. There we go. Just describe what the game

[45:52] looks like before we read. Yeah, what is what is this? Don't know if I ever played this. Oh, no,

[45:57] okay. Yeah, I've seen this before. But I don't know if I've actually played it. I know I've seen it.

[46:00] It looks like a regular pinball machine play. It's a regular cabinet. It's regular cabinet. Yeah,

[46:07] there's no head. It's it's higher in the middle. Like the play field kind of goes up into the middle

[46:12] and then down to the outside. Yeah, I assume it's two pieces of wood. It's like it's it's probably

[46:17] a play field cut in half. Yes. And then it's kind of glued together in the middle. Yeah, it's

[46:22] like a bracket or something. But there's no head. Oh, either in the there's no head in the middle.

[46:26] There's no head in the back. It's it looks unusual, but it doesn't look totally different. You know,

[46:33] I mean, like you look at it, you're like, Oh, it's a pinball machine, but you're like, where is

[46:36] everything? Now the the the the displays. So it has no head. Where would you put the displays?

[46:42] I probably put them on the apron. Yeah. So they've got them in the apron, but not flat.

[46:49] They're like on an angle. And it's like you're looking at the at the display across from you,

[46:56] which is under the other player. Does that make sense? Yeah, you're not looking straight down.

[46:59] Yeah, which is which is pretty ingenious for a problem that they created. But it's it's this

[47:08] is the football one. So this is clearly for the American for the European market, which is

[47:13] European market, which is soccer. Well, they use the correct term in Europe football, because

[47:18] that's what it is. You know, the game where you hit the ball with your foot. Right. Exactly.

[47:21] Then we don't we're not going to get into that. I don't need to I don't need to to cause an

[47:26] international incident here as opposed to the you know, you ask where you play football by throwing it.

[47:33] And the only person who and the only person who kicks it is the one who's not considered a

[47:36] football player of the kicker, but you know, in in AJ foot, yeah, a G football and a G soccer,

[47:43] it has a new feature, the switch flipper trademark. So this is the thing that Alvin kind of thought

[47:50] of and thought this would be really cool for a game. The switch flipper is like a regular pinball

[47:56] flipper, but it has almost like a gate on it. And the gate is hanging over where the ball would

[48:04] hit the flipper. It's like a wire, but it's like a solid wire. It's not like a flimsy wire.

[48:12] So what does that do? What does it do? Well, it adds special scores and features that the flipper

[48:18] is hit by a ball before it's actuated. So it so if you hit the button on the cabinet, it reacts

[48:25] different than if you don't hit the button and the ball hits the switch and activates the flipper.

[48:32] And this is under patent number four, nine, seven, one, three, two, three, actuate certain flippers

[48:39] in an automatic mode auto flip trademark to provide single player operation play the computer.

[48:46] So you can play this two player game in a single player mode, which is pretty kind of neat, right?

[48:53] The auto flip mode gives incredible ball action due to the ball, keeping the flipper coil actuated

[48:58] throughout its entire stroke. That might be a little too techy for a flyer. We're trying to sell

[49:03] games here, Ron. Stop trying to ruin it for everybody. So I'm sorry. So so what's what's and it's got

[49:10] it's got spinners. I got to find one of these. I've never played one. It's got some drop targets,

[49:14] right? It's got some kind of flowy-ish looking shots. It's it's pretty cool. It's different and

[49:22] weird, but it's cool. It's very green. Do we ever talk about the green pinball curse? What,

[49:28] if you have green, it's just not going to sell. Yeah. So that was a thing back in the 60s.

[49:33] And I think slightly after that was the green games did not sell.

[49:38] They also had to think where they didn't want it to be all black. Yeah, very firepower came out

[49:43] and sold like 17,000 here and so on. Whatever. Like, okay, maybe it's not bad. So then they

[49:48] think it can call blackout. That's entirely black. So they had to come up with a catchphrase for

[49:53] Alvin G and Co. And it was the name for originality and quality. So they couldn't use the name

[50:02] Gottlieb, but they wanted to lean in as hard as they possibly could that this was a Gottlieb first.

[50:10] The other thing is, when you look at their logo, Alvin G and company, it's in the Gottlieb font.

[50:15] Yeah, it's clear. It's in the it's in the classic D Gottlieb and company font you would see on

[50:21] all their older games. It's exactly the same. I wonder how they got away with that.

[50:25] But using the same font? Yeah. Like, nowadays, it's like, if you get started using the same

[50:29] fonts or the same designs. Premiere wasn't, Premiere wasn't using that though. Like, it said Premiere

[50:34] and it just said a Gottlieb company or something on it. And it, it, with, with their later, like,

[50:40] 80s Gottlieb font. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Maybe that's why it wasn't a problem.

[50:45] What was Michael's memories around this game? Well, he says his biggest memory of the whole

[50:51] thing was that it was a nightmare. You ship test samples out and they're not working.

[50:55] There was a period of time where I flew to England, Japan, then back to England, then to Germany,

[51:00] then to Spain, then to Italy, then back to Japan, fixing games. It was just the prototype run.

[51:06] But it was a real nightmare. Could you imagine what that's the cost of doing that?

[51:12] We could flyer miles. How does, how does he have the money to do that? He's got to have

[51:18] a bunch of stuff with him. You know, he's got to have like a big bag of tools and parts.

[51:23] But that's, that's how it happens, right? And we, we see that even with, with new startup games

[51:28] today, right? Like, it's, they always have their, their problems and their issues and, you know,

[51:34] they're, they're back then you'd prototype things, which is what he's talking about.

[51:38] But you didn't, now days you don't really prototype and put it out on location and put it through

[51:44] the, the, the, the, the ringer. To put it in Japan and England and Germany and Spain and

[51:50] Italy and doing all that flying around like, that must have been terrible. Flying seems like

[51:56] a lot of fun. Then you do it a bunch and you're like, this is terrible. No, it's not fun at all.

[52:01] Well, here's the big break out game. This is the one that everybody knows. I play this.

[52:07] The follow up game. It is from December of 1992. It sells a thousand units. So you can tell that

[52:16] when they're buying materials, they're buying enough materials for like round numbers.

[52:22] And then parts. It's pretty funny. Because nowadays, some of the other ones you see, there's like

[52:26] 827, right? No, not here. 1000. This is designed by Jerry on Armstrong. It has art by Dan

[52:37] Hughes. Now you would know him from Corvette and Indy 500 on the, on the, on the William side.

[52:42] Tim Elliott did a little bit of the art here and he did Ershaker and Road Kings.

[52:47] Oh, Road Kings. And, God. And Andy G Reynolds, he would do the art for punchy, the clown and

[52:55] we'll get to that in a minute. Len Verdin. He did, he did, he did, no are Vadin. Vadin.

[53:03] The music by Kyle Johnson and Sound and then software by Raymond Merchant. And you know,

[53:12] Raymond Merchant. I know he did a bunch of games. He was like, he was like the, the B tier or C tier guy.

[53:20] He was a godly, no, no, God. He was a game plan, game plan, Valley. He did, he did a bunch of

[53:26] stuff in Europe with Valley Wolf, Alvin G, like he was at a data east for a while. He did like

[53:32] Simpsons and back to the future. Like he was like the, the, the C level programmer who just banged

[53:39] out on the top. He did special force, he did special force, which we mentioned earlier.

[53:43] Awesome. He was like the guy that was always there everywhere. Now the theme of this game. So,

[53:49] what is the, what is the theme of their, okay, well, let's go back to the name of this game.

[53:55] I don't think we said that yet. I don't think we said it yet. Al's Garage Band goes on a world tour.

[54:00] That is a long title. But a cool title, I would say, okay. So the theme of this is like a rockstar

[54:09] music pin. One of the first kind of music pins. What's going on on the flyer here? Well, they're

[54:15] telling you to plug it in and crank it up. Plug it in it crank it up. Now the art, you can tell

[54:22] that this is very much that earth shaker style of art. So if you've seen earth shaker,

[54:30] which everybody probably has, from, from Williams, you can see, yeah, that art style is pretty much

[54:39] the same. Let's flip over. Yeah, totally. So we flip the, the thing over and then what do we see here?

[54:47] Help Al take its Garage Band on a world tour. Make the shots that take him from city to city

[54:54] on his way to fame and fortune. Rad action features for rock and fun. Did you know this game as the

[55:01] world's first spinning ramp? Spinning ramp? How does that work? Well, the spinning CD ramp

[55:09] adds excitement to ways. Adds English to the ball on entry shot and a challenging ramp shot too.

[55:17] Well, it has an ear splitting frenzy. That sounds terrible. I don't want to split my ears.

[55:23] What's with CD? The CD, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, period D period. Is that

[55:27] the guy's name or something? No, I think it's like, I think it means like a CD, like a, like a

[55:32] compact disc. But no one ever writes it that way. I've never seen it written that way.

[55:37] I guess you're right. That's what it means. CD. Yeah, for those younger listeners, that's

[55:42] compact disc. That's what we used to listen to music on. I came after tapes. I came after,

[55:48] you know, records tapes and then CDs. And then before the iPod? Yes. Yep. It's kind of that weird

[55:54] space in the middle. Very cool. Very cool. It's cool. It's got dropped targets. It's got to have

[56:00] dropped targets. It's got multi-ball. It's got a video mode. It's got a DMD. It's got, it's got

[56:06] it all. Hey, pinheads. I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not doing this podcast and

[57:08] It is a patent pending bump buttons. Ooh, the bump buttons that impacts players fingers

[57:17] with a new feel. Really? So they got something on the eye. Okay, I play this before and I don't

[57:22] remember that maybe it was turned off. State of the art digital stereo sound.

[57:29] Todd Matrix with video mode ultra clean wiring. Combined CPU. Okay, they put periods in that too,

[57:36] which no one ever does. So there you go. And driver board extensive user friendly diagnostics

[57:42] and bookkeeping. Yeah. So we're so like the original Gottlieb, we're leaning into how easy it is

[57:50] to maintain the quality, that kind of stuff. The backlash is weird. Okay, so it's what I assume is

[58:02] Al and he's riding a electric guitar rocket over Europe with a lady in tow. All of the stars

[58:13] have smiling faces, including the sun, which is terrifying. But you can tell they're having fun.

[58:21] This has one of the coolest upper play fields I think I've seen. You will recognize this upper

[58:29] play field from Guns and Roses limited edition. It's the shape of a guitar that's got

[58:36] one of those things called like the almost like a plinco kind of thing when the ball goes up the

[58:43] ramp and it comes down the neck of the guitar and then it bounces around and then over a roll

[58:47] over back onto the play field. I think the art is more doctor dude than Earth shaker. Okay, yeah,

[58:53] I can see that little more little more like creepy strange cartoony thing. I never considered a

[58:59] creepy. Why is everything creepy? It's just it's it's the faces. It's the faces are a bit a bit weird.

[59:07] It had a cool topper right with your great adjoin. And the band members all have names. It's

[59:18] Stitchy, Gloria, Al, Delmore and I can't read the last name. These skins. These skins.

[59:28] Which is the drummer. Oh, I ought right. Okay, you hit the skins. I get it. Very good.

[59:32] Yes. Well done. But we're going after that kid that wants to be cool in a rock band kind of

[59:40] thing. It's very fun. And it looks the same as other games of the era. Yeah, it does.

[59:47] And that it's got the same speaker panel with the DMD. They didn't go crazy with any,

[59:52] yeah, completely different weird cabinet design or anything like that. Now Michael Gottlieb would tell

[59:58] IPDB that Al's garage band was based on people that he actually knew they were all real people.

[01:00:05] Oh, it's doctor. Doctor skins, not de skins. Doctor, we didn't see the R. Yeah, the people

[01:00:11] knew Al, Gloria, Delmore and Doctor skins. Only one character, Stitchy was not a real person.

[01:00:17] Oh, I find it hard to believe there's no one named Stitchy. You know, Fred Young, the late Fred

[01:00:21] Young. Yes, he did voice characterizations in this game. He was like the guy that did all the voices

[01:00:27] back then, right? He did a lot of games. He was like, he was, he was, he did, he did them for

[01:00:32] Daddy East. He did them for Williams. Now he's doing them for, for, for Alvin G. And for an unnecessary

[01:00:39] factoid, the game and the manufacturer's flyer shows a vuck, a vertical upkicker at the end of

[01:00:44] the horseshoe ramp in the middle right play field of what would have been the top lock. This

[01:00:49] vuck was subsequently removed by the manufacturer. Reportedly, 20 games were made with this top lock

[01:00:55] vuck. Yeah, let's file that under really cool. How about one of those? I'd be worth more.

[01:01:00] Around this time, they were having some success, but they wanted to kind of focus on like redemption

[01:01:05] games, but they ended up with like, it was like not really traditional pinball, but it had pinball

[01:01:11] elements. And then we get back into a traditional pinball game, the tournament classic.

[01:01:19] Mystery castle. Mystery castle. The horror supernatural theme. Yes, dancing skeletons.

[01:01:26] We've got 500 units designed by Wally Welch and Michael Gottlieb, art by Dan Hughes and a gun

[01:01:33] software by Raymond Merchant. Fred Young also did the voices for this game. When we talk about

[01:01:41] mystery castle, I mean, the first thing that pops into mind is the perfect game to end a national

[01:01:48] tournament with. What they really think is fantasy and excitement. Alvin G in company invites you to

[01:01:56] attend a scavenger hunt at the mystery castle. Good luck. You'll need it. Yeah, it's like a pizza

[01:02:03] parchment paper being written on by like a mythical hand. Then we flip it over and we get a picture

[01:02:10] of the game and the play field. A user friendly game. Alvin G and Co, the name for originality and

[01:02:19] quality. So there is a certain scavenger hunt for the hidden items. Collect the items. Collect the

[01:02:25] earnings. Complete the six position drop targets, six position drop targets. What is that? Like the

[01:02:31] hidden face. Enter the castle. Prepare for doom. Will you get to play doom? No, you know, well,

[01:02:37] I bet you would play doom. I bet you these days would play doom. Collect all 15 items to achieve

[01:02:43] the ultimate. The crown. Shoot the four ramps. Find the secret door. Experience the excitement of a

[01:02:50] scavenger hunt in an old castle. Find the items, but be prepared. The spirit forces may propel you into

[01:02:57] doom. It's like that sounds like a terrible scavenger hunt. So when we look at this play field,

[01:03:04] okay, let's start with the backlash. Hold on. Go back. Go back. One. I got to say one thing.

[01:03:10] So their service number, they're 800 number, 1 800, 858 flip. I love that. It's a good one.

[01:03:20] What's the stern one? Kickers. Yeah, I believe it's been that since Daddy East.

[01:03:26] It's like 1 800 kickers. So the backlash is awesome. Yeah, it's it's so good. And there's like this

[01:03:34] castle. It's very like mysterious. Yeah. Right. It's got cool colors and stuff. And then there's

[01:03:42] like the sign outside of it, almost like a almost like a like this way for a hamburger off the highway.

[01:03:50] Sign and it's a scavenger set hunt inside. It's like that doesn't look very safe. But it kind of

[01:03:59] goes off the rails art wise when we look at the play field, right? Like they're going for a

[01:04:05] your inside of a castle. Look, but it so it's like cobblestones or something, right? Is that what

[01:04:11] that looks like? Sure, but the big parchment right in the middle. Yeah. And it just it just looks

[01:04:18] terrible. Oh, strong take the world under glass. You don't like cobblestone with yellow and pink.

[01:04:27] It's it's just it looks it looks it looks rough. It looks rough. I get it. I mean, it looks like

[01:04:34] what it should look like. If you're in an old medieval sand castle, but it's just not pleasing to

[01:04:42] the eye. They should have gone with something that's not brown. How does it play? You've played this

[01:04:46] game usually plays what I mean, the games I played of theirs usually played long. Yeah, yeah,

[01:04:52] it's like it's a bit of an easier go than most. The Michael Gottlieb told IPDB has no memory of

[01:04:58] production numbers for Alvin G. But when asked if 500 was the number for mystery castle, he felt

[01:05:04] it sounded right saying, I know we did not build many. And I think I think some of it reason the

[01:05:10] reason you didn't build many was just that it just didn't it just isn't as pleasing, right? You play

[01:05:15] the game with your eye first. And that's something that's been repeated over and over and over again.

[01:05:20] But it's got the side ramp shots. So that's really cool. It's got like some awesome plastic ramps.

[01:05:26] Like I think it shoots really well. I've only ever seen it played on a stream.

[01:05:31] And it has dancing skeletons. Yeah. So everybody loves dancing. Always good. Yes.

[01:05:36] Yeah. What was that old was that old like a loony tunes with the dancing skeletons?

[01:05:42] Isn't that a little interesting? Somehow dancing skeleton seems like a very Gottlieb thing.

[01:05:47] Yeah, it totally does. Doesn't it? Yeah. It's right up there. It's kind of fun. Right? It's not

[01:05:52] taking itself too seriously. But it doesn't sell too many units. But the next one. So what kind of

[01:05:59] games sold really well in Alvin Gottlieb's time? What's what's your themes and gambling and poker?

[01:06:06] We want to go with the same thing. Maybe we can get back to where Al's garage band was.

[01:06:13] Maybe we can get back to the sales numbers that we had with the football game.

[01:06:17] That's when we get into pistol poker. This is November of 93. There's only 200 units.

[01:06:24] Willie Welch and Michael Gottlieb on design. Sorry, Wally Welch. Dan Hughes.

[01:06:30] Len Videen on mechanics. The dots by Vercina Jordan. Sound and music. Kyle Johnson again

[01:06:41] and Raymond Merchant on the software. Now this pistol poker. This is probably the one I think that

[01:06:48] that I've seen a lot of images of this game. I've never played it. But for some reason I see it a lot.

[01:06:56] And I think it's because it's such a cool art package. It's so bright. It's so yellow.

[01:07:02] And it's very like a it's Western theme. There's nothing else to say. Take a look at the flyer.

[01:07:09] Ron, what do you think of this one? Hey partner. There's a new player in town. You don't know his name.

[01:07:15] But you know his game. Pistol poker. Alvin G and Co. Hey partner. At pinball earnings,

[01:07:22] been leaving you flat. Alvin G takes pinball to the next level. Pistol poker. The deal you've

[01:07:28] all been waiting for. Well, I like this true multi level play as opposed to fake multi level play.

[01:07:35] Innovative back box card matrix. Yeah, they have a whole half of the back box that the translate is a

[01:07:43] grid of cards. Five different jackpots. Not just one. Over a dozen bonus rounds.

[01:07:50] Oh, this would hurt country Western theme and music. Oh, the what was the other game that had

[01:07:56] country music? Roadshow has a terrible. But it's a great game. I love that game.

[01:08:05] Free parts. It's not terrible. It's all thousands. There's tons of them out there.

[01:08:09] Free parts. Kit included included. What it would like what parts? It's just like the goody bag

[01:08:15] or their parts that are going to go bass and we've included them free. Yeah, exactly. You got

[01:08:19] like a bunch of like coils and stuff. So it has an upper play field like a raised upper play field.

[01:08:26] Yeah, a second play field. Yes. Which is something we hadn't really seen for a long time.

[01:08:30] Who's the last one to head that? I mean like an actual upper play field, right? Like you got

[01:08:34] twilight zone, but that wasn't really like an actual upper play field. It was sort of like that.

[01:08:38] Sure it is. You can play it. So shadow. It's a little bit. But it doesn't have a flipper on it.

[01:08:42] It doesn't have a shadow. It's got a kicker thing. Yeah, but it's not a flipper. It's like a

[01:08:46] it's like a it's like a thing. And shadow is actually after. So I guess I should even say that.

[01:08:50] Um, I don't know. Black night 2000. It herkins back to kind of that era, right? The black night kind of thing.

[01:08:59] Just probably in early 80s got lead that has it and people are shouting us right now. You idiot.

[01:09:02] Like gladiator, I think doesn't gladiator have something like that. I don't remember.

[01:09:08] It doesn't have the pit. Doesn't have the pit thing where it's like the it doesn't matter.

[01:09:12] We're just rambling now. It's unique. It's cool. I like the art package. Although it is very yellow.

[01:09:18] It's it's it's like a it's like a shootout in a in a bar. It's got it's got loops and vertical

[01:09:27] up kicker things and pop bumper. It's cool. It's a cool one. This is worth. This is worth the stop

[01:09:34] and flip. I think if you see one floating around. You have not played this one, right?

[01:09:40] No, I played it. You played this one. What did you think? It was fine. Yeah. Okay.

[01:09:45] I played it at the, um, I give a shout out the sanctum in Connecticut. They had one of these.

[01:09:50] They had a pistol poker. Very cool. Do you remember what the code was like? I'm like what the

[01:09:54] objective was? Like a lot of well, I don't I'm not the best with rules. And I don't remember what

[01:10:01] you were supposed to do. And I'm also looking at gladiator and it does not have enough replay feel.

[01:10:06] So it was wrong. What's the one that's got the weird pit thing in the top corner that got

[01:10:11] leap? The pit thing. Yeah. You're like you would shoot the ball up and it would go in the

[01:10:15] skill shot where it goes around a circle over. Yeah. Yeah. That's um, it's what is that? It's

[01:10:21] it's it's at the Rochester pinball collective. You think I would remember it.

[01:10:26] Like the whole game is basically the skill shot. But yes. Did you know Fred

[01:10:30] Young did voice characterizations on this game too? Yeah. Yeah. So who do we need to do voices?

[01:10:36] I don't know what's Fred doing. I don't know. He's napping over there. Great. The other cool thing is

[01:10:41] in the art, there's a bunch of Easter eggs and we all love Easter eggs in pinball. That's like

[01:10:47] that is the be all an end all for pinball. The pistol poker game. So so you'll see El Guistano

[01:10:53] or the worm. Right on the wanted poster. And that's actually Wally Welch who is the one of the

[01:11:00] designers. That's pretty cool. You've got the piano player is Kyle Johnson. He's the music and sound

[01:11:07] designer and Dan Hughes is at the card table. Tipping his hat to the bar made. And uh, and they're

[01:11:14] all included there. One thing that I do find interesting about this art package. You've got this cowboy

[01:11:22] on the back glass and he's all over the place. Doesn't have a mustache. Oh god. So do you think

[01:11:27] that's a missed opportunity? Why so it looks like Roger Sharp. Yeah. Do you think that they lost

[01:11:32] sales because they didn't have a mustache? It doesn't have a mustache. It's that way

[01:11:37] of eight ball deluxe soul so well because he got a mustache. Yeah, exactly. The only reason.

[01:11:43] So let's move on. That's a cool game. That's a good one. Now let's get into my favorite game. Oh

[01:11:48] really? From from from Alvin G and co. Okay. Wait a minute. It says the category that cannot be

[01:11:55] the actual category. This is the actual category of of this. We're talking about punchy the clown.

[01:12:01] This is the horrifically terrifying carnival theme. What's no. And it's from September of 1993. So

[01:12:09] you can see that we have we have built a bunch of different games in a lot of games through like

[01:12:13] 92 93. It's impressive. It only sells 103 games. So if you see one of these, it's particularly rare.

[01:12:20] It's designed by Jim Sherd and Michael Gottlieb. Andy G Reynolds did the art Kyle John Sound

[01:12:27] Music and Sound and Raymond Merchant on software. So what is this theme that I say here this

[01:12:35] this horrifically terrifying carnival theme? That's what it is. It's got a clown and he's

[01:12:39] punchy. It's a mini pin. It's a small pinball machine. It is not a full size pinball machine. It's

[01:12:46] more of a redemption game thing. It's it's not as long or as wide. I think it's short too.

[01:12:53] Is it for like for kids? Yeah. Punchy holds your ticket to a carnival of earnings. The clown

[01:12:59] does look a little disturbing. It's terrifyingly disturbing. It's it's obviously designed to be cute.

[01:13:07] I just look at the picture now. He's on the back glass and he's on the play field. And he's got

[01:13:12] these big bright blue eyes and this big smile. Are you unhappy? Are your earnings down? You need to

[01:13:20] get punchy the clown. Adjustable leg height for both children and adults. The ticket to Spencer

[01:13:26] is included. All ticket levels operator adjustable state of the art electronics. Full bookkeeping

[01:13:33] and diagnostics adjustable to normal pinball play. All in a mini pin trademarked configuration.

[01:13:42] Booster earnings with punchy the clown.

[01:13:45] 195 pounds. Yes. It is much lighter. Yeah. It's it's like you can see what's going on here. Okay. So

[01:13:52] Williams is at Valley Williams is basically eating everything in that sort of 91 to 92

[01:13:59] air 93 era. Right. They are selling a billion pinball machines. You know, the Adams family in

[01:14:07] there. You got like twilight zone. You got Terminator 2. You've got data east who's kind of

[01:14:13] picking up the other stuff. Got leave doing their thing. And then you've got kind of Alvin G.

[01:14:20] This startup who's just trying to bust in and they've tried traditional pins. They've tried

[01:14:26] unusual pins and they've done fairly well. Now you can see that they're starting to adjust

[01:14:33] what they're actually doing. Now they're I had mentioned they were doing or considering redemption

[01:14:38] games a few minutes ago. Well, now they're doing the same thing, right. This punchy the clown is

[01:14:43] basically a redemption game kind of thing. Right. But it's pinball, right. It's got some drop

[01:14:52] targets. I was looking at the flyer. Their phone numbers are all 708 area code is to Chicago,

[01:14:57] but the sales one is 314, which is Saint Louis. That's interesting. I wonder if their sales

[01:15:03] department was in in Saint Louis. So what's like it's it's it's got it looks like it's a pinball

[01:15:09] machine, right. It's just small. Yeah. I have played I have I have played this before. I've played

[01:15:14] this when they had this at a show and they had it on the shorter legs. See to play it on your knees.

[01:15:18] Yes. Exactly. That's why I remember it. It's it's fun. Right. Like it's it's a bit creepy,

[01:15:25] but it's not like it's goofy. It looks it's more goofy than creepy. So that the the other

[01:15:31] got leaves back in the day like those 80 B ones. Wasn't there an 80 B game that was like a carnival

[01:15:37] one and it was sheer terror. This one's just I browse that jutted out. Maybe it would look scary.

[01:15:43] Like he's he's very endearing and he's getting a pie thrown at him, which is kind of fun and

[01:15:48] he's playing like an organ terribly. The thing is in 1993 were were clowns evil yet.

[01:15:55] No. So around I want to say around 91 I was like a clown for Halloween. Okay. So that means they

[01:16:03] weren't scary yet. What was it it when that came out that the TV the TV mini series. Is that

[01:16:10] made him evil? No. When wouldn't a clowns become evil? I mean killer clouds around her space I think

[01:16:14] was before this. Yes. That's true. But I think I think it that that didn't happen. Clowns didn't

[01:16:21] become ultra creepy until I sort of became more like an adult. Where then when you look back at

[01:16:26] the art style of all of these things and they're trying to be really cute and kitty and art itself

[01:16:32] has just moved on to be different. Now when you look at it you're kind of like they try to make it

[01:16:37] maybe too realistic or too cheerful or something and it just it just doesn't sit right. It kind of

[01:16:45] makes me sad. I mean clowns used to be about fun and then at some point they just like if you're

[01:16:51] a clown like oh you must be like a killer clown or evil or something. Let's bring clowns back

[01:16:57] right? Yes. Let's make clowns fun again. What does Michael say about this game? Well he says I got

[01:17:03] up one morning and thought wouldn't it be fun to do like a mushroom world type thing. The playfield

[01:17:09] be the face of a clown. I brought that to the guys and they essentially drew it up as I envisioned

[01:17:14] it. It was fun coming up with those ideas. The problem with punchy the clown is it was a horrible

[01:17:19] redemption machine because it required skill. Redemption machines are all about taking a recorder

[01:17:24] as quickly as possible and with as little amount of skill as possible. I made the mistake of wanting

[01:17:29] the offer the consumer, the player, some level of entertainment value. Oh see that's an interesting

[01:17:35] insight into kitty gambling right? Those redemption games basically designed to take your money

[01:17:42] really quickly give you zero satisfaction or quick satisfaction for a second. We haven't talked

[01:17:48] about that in our episodes or anything about that right? We've always just kind of joked about it.

[01:17:52] But it's interesting to know that there's a completely different philosophy in stealing a quarter

[01:17:57] there than there is on the pinball or arcade version. Do you think Alvin G came too late into pinball?

[01:18:04] Yeah they come in around the high speed era. I think that would have gave him that would have

[01:18:09] gave him four or five or years before they probably would have went under like everyone else did.

[01:18:16] So they would have had more games. I think the problem was timing. I think that they came in

[01:18:22] like right at that peak, like right at the top of the mountain and the only place that they had to

[01:18:28] go was kind of trending downward. And you can see by like 96. Oh yeah everybody was struggling

[01:18:35] and then by 2000. Well, 96. Golly went by by three years earlier. They probably would have

[01:18:42] generated enough sales to kind of propel them a little further and they probably would have survived

[01:18:46] maybe until 2000. What is Mike? What are Michael's thoughts on the death of Alvin G and co?

[01:18:52] Michael says we had a lot of challenges and things didn't go exactly as we planned. We moved from

[01:18:57] soccer ball into regular pinball machines for a very short period. At that point the industry

[01:19:02] had really slowed down a lot. There was a lot of inventory out there and not enough fires for all

[01:19:07] the games that distributors had sitting in inventory. When you're the last man in the lowest man

[01:19:12] on the total pole, you're the first one that gets nicked. It's a good point. If you've got the

[01:19:17] ability to purchase a hundred pinball machines, you're probably purchasing what like 60

[01:19:24] Valley Williams games and you're purchasing 40 data East games. Like why would you take a gamble

[01:19:31] on another new company? I get what he means there and then when you're sort of the newest person,

[01:19:39] you try to build relationships, they already have relationships and then things trend down.

[01:19:45] I don't know if there's anything you could do. The other thing that was touched on that I read a

[01:19:49] couple of times in some of the sources that I saw was that Williams really pushed a lot of

[01:19:56] distributor control. So they had a lot of power over their distributors on requirements to purchase

[01:20:04] number of units. What if what happened if you didn't purchase those units, they would go to your

[01:20:10] competition. It's hard for Alvin G to break in when you're dealing with that. In the end, when they

[01:20:17] decided to close Alvin G, that must have been an absolute nightmare. Trying to get rid of all these

[01:20:24] parts, clearing out all this stuff. It must be emotionally difficult because you really

[01:20:31] I think tried hard. I think it would be a difficult go realizing that, you know,

[01:20:38] geez, we had something special, right? We had a good board set. We had good technology.

[01:20:45] We had a good philosophy. It just didn't work out. It's always got to be tough. Something you started

[01:20:50] dies like that. Where did Michael got leave go after Alvin G started to close its doors?

[01:20:56] You went to Joe Dolan in Roger Sharp and got hired at Williams in April of 1994. That means the

[01:21:04] video we referenced the tour was from expo to October 93. By April of 94, Michael was working at

[01:21:12] Williams. They were pretty much on the way down after that. They were probably on their way down

[01:21:18] it again. That was like six months later after that video. Yeah. Michael Gottlieb would eventually

[01:21:22] work at Midway Games in 1994 where he would produce Xbox and PlayStation games. So that's pretty

[01:21:29] cool. I bet you we've played, I don't know you, but me. I've probably played some Midway games that

[01:21:36] that Michael worked on. In 2009, when he moved over to Bali Technologies Gaming Division,

[01:21:42] that's their slots area, he was a senior director of game development. And then he would bounce

[01:21:48] around with various independent game developers and is currently or at the time when I wrote this

[01:21:53] episode, senior VP of JVL, which is a slot engineering and gaming firm. Alvin Gottlieb was put into

[01:22:04] the pinball expo Hall of Fame in 2007. I was there. Yes. When were you inducted into the pinball

[01:22:13] expo Hall of Fame? I have not been inducted into the pinball expo Hall of Fame. Okay. Well,

[01:22:18] we're working on that. So let's get Ron into the pinball expo Hall of Fame. That's going to be

[01:22:24] mostly for his other podcast, the slam tilt podcast. Yeah. I think we'll have the pinball

[01:22:29] podcasters Hall of Fame and I'll just create it myself and induct myself. Oh yeah. The pinball

[01:22:36] community really loves awards. What do you know in 2023, Michael Gottlieb inducted Alvin

[01:22:42] into the American Amusement Machine Association Hall of Fame, the AAMA. So that's part two of

[01:22:48] meet the Gottlieb's. Well, we forgot Michael's last comment. You're in the business because it's

[01:22:53] what you want to do. When you have a passion for something, you'll put up with a lot. Now in retrospect,

[01:22:59] I'm a little bit older and I think back, oh my lord, I was a monkey out there dancing for peanuts,

[01:23:04] but I loved it. I loved every minute of it. The real question is, what I do it all over again?

[01:23:09] The answer is absolutely yes, because there was some of the best times of my life and the most

[01:23:15] fun I ever had. Michael Gottlieb, he just must be just the just the most positive nice person.

[01:23:23] Just reading that quote makes me just like want to hug him. That's what I'd be like, oh Michael

[01:23:27] Gottlieb, because you can tell he was on a shoestring budget. He was flying everywhere. It was stressful.

[01:23:34] It was terrible. But man, would he do it again? Absolutely. How awesome is that? Most people when

[01:23:39] they look back at a time like that would be like, oh, there's no way I would ever do that again.

[01:23:42] It was too much stress. What's the legacy of the Gottlieb family? It is quite big. I would

[01:23:50] basically from the 30s all the way up to the 90s. It makes me so melancholy that that Gottlieb

[01:24:00] went the way it did. It's to this day, it still makes me say, Williams, Valley Williams

[01:24:07] kind of go in the way it did is sucks. But the whole Gottlieb thing, I'm just so invested in

[01:24:14] the growth that they had with pinball and the creation and an actual family and stuff like that.

[01:24:20] I think their legacy can't be understated. From a self-made man who was squeaky tight with his

[01:24:29] dollars to his workaholic son to his positive and exciting grandson, I think the Gottlieb legacy

[01:24:39] is pretty amazing. Jiminy last words? Beautiful. No, no, no, no, and scene. I can't follow that.

[01:24:47] Stoey, you gotta do your thing. Oh, I still have to do this, but not on the pinball network anymore.

[01:25:01] I thought that meant I didn't have to do this forever. As always you can send your comments,

[01:26:26] But why would he leave? Why would you leave Stern? Stern is like the... I guarantee you because

[01:26:32] he could be the man as their main pinball guy. Yeah, okay. Well, Alvin says I was born into the

[01:26:40] industry as a child. No, he has a child. That made no sense. Of course he was born as a child.

[01:26:47] Yes. Well, Alvin says... Well, Alvin says I was born in the industry. I was born in the industry.

[01:26:54] Let me try again. And this is hard. It's okay. I understand.

[01:27:00] Well, we forgot Michael's last comment. Okay. Michael says you're in the business because it's what
