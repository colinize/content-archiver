[00:00] Hello, Cronies. It's me, the Silver Ball Chronicles AI.

[00:06] I've taken a moment away from becoming self-aware while I was driving a Chinese robotic vacuum

[00:12] to let you know that Dave and Ron accidentally called the Jersey Jack Pinball Wizard, Brett

[00:18] Arbus, Brent, a couple of times during this episode.

[00:22] Whoa, so embarrassing. Anyway, enjoy the show and be sure to mock them in an email or social

[00:29] media post.

[01:00] Hello, everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me this month

[01:05] is Ron Muggles Hallet. How you doing, Ron? Muggles. Muggles. Muggles. Muggles.

[01:12] I think knuckles would be better. No, Muggles pertains very specifically to our topic today,

[01:18] especially the latest release from Jersey Jack Pinball. Ah, oh, is that a Harry Potter thing?

[01:25] That's a Harry Potter thing and as a Gen X, you have no idea. I have no idea. No, what

[01:31] have you been doing? Nothing much. Nothing much. You haven't been dominating tournaments within

[01:36] the upstate New York area. No, I was at past Times Arcade. Oh, that's a good one. Oh, yeah.

[01:42] And I, yeah, I remember I set you all those pictures of all those games that we talk about

[01:47] all the time. So last episode we talked about Pinball Tappas, which was very much about Sonic,

[01:53] Sega, the pinball company from Europe. Tell, and you got to play a bunch of the games that we had

[02:00] just spoke about. Yep. All the random ones, not just the good ones. Yes, all the random ones,

[02:06] not just the good ones. Okay, overall thoughts. What do you think? I still think that the best,

[02:10] the best sonics to me are prospector and super straight. So they're kind of hit and miss.

[02:16] Um, I mean, some of them, I know a lot of people love like Mars Track. I got to play Bird Man.

[02:22] That's always fun. Creepy or, uh, well, oh, what's the other one? Faces? Faces. Yeah, that's the,

[02:28] that's the artistic beauty. Yeah, very cool, very cool. And have you purchased a new pinball machine

[02:34] from Flippin' Out Pinball or latest and greatest sponsor? Uh, no, but I did purchase one, uh,

[02:41] used, um, EM Super Straight. Okay. Okay. Super straight. Also, Sonic, right? Doesn't work.

[02:49] Doesn't work. Hence the price, but in typical,

[02:52] so I don't try to get it working for Sonic. I'm not an EM expert, but it is pretty much a Williams.

[02:57] So as, as I learned from our latest episode, all I know about EMs is basically just clean the

[03:03] contacts. That's kind of all the, the, the, the, the knowledge that I have about EMs. Just clean

[03:09] the contact. And theory, if every single switch relay, etc. is cleaned and adjusted properly,

[03:16] it should just work. Yeah, they're exactly right? They went to the moon on that stuff, Ron.

[03:24] Electro-mechanical stuff. I think there was some computers involved, and then went to the boat.

[03:28] There you go. So we've added, uh, show notes to silverballcronicles.com.

[03:33] Yes, we have. Kind of still kind of working on our actual sort of the breakdown or the transcripts

[03:40] of all the episodes. That's proven, it's proven to be quite the project, but eventually I will

[03:45] put those up on there. But, uh, we want to welcome some of our new patrons over at patreon.com.

[03:53] We want to, uh, welcome all of those. We had one joiner this month. We want to welcome Doug over

[04:01] as a premium crony over on our Patreon. That's patreon.com slash silverballcronicles. You can

[04:09] join us at the pro crony level at $3 a month. That's just a nice thank you for us. $6 a month

[04:17] gets you access to the discord chat room. You can chit chat with us about our various diet habits,

[04:24] what we're cooking and what we're doing on that discord. That's really the most important thing.

[04:30] But second to that is add free early access to each episode. You don't have to listen to any of

[04:37] those ads at the beginning at the end or in the middle of silverballcronicles. Although I think

[04:42] a lot of you really love those commercials, especially the flipping out pinball commercial. We've

[04:48] had a lot of great comments about how much people love those. The top tier cronies, the elitists,

[04:55] they are after three months at $20 they get a free silverball chronicles t-shirt. Facebook.com slash

[05:04] silverballcronicles is where we hang out as well. Please post some comments. Say hello,

[05:09] shoot us a message. You can also do that at silverballcronicles at gmail.com. Any corrections from

[05:17] our previous episode? Did we? Did I step in some sort of geopolitical land mine last month talking

[05:25] about our wonderful and exciting world of Sega Sisonic pinball? I don't think so. No, I have

[05:34] avoided all geopolitical issues when it comes to Spain. Yes, but what do you think about

[05:40] Sisonic that the super straight I got? It has the original Sega Goodybag thing in it, just like my

[05:48] prospector did. That's why. It's a Sega on it. It's so weird when you look at it like Sega. But

[05:55] nothing in the bag, just the bag. No, it actually had the manual and the schematics. It's amazing.

[06:02] So now you'll know which context to clean to get it to work. All of them. See, that's awesome.

[06:08] Hello to Ted who sent us an email in letting us know that he thought the bingo episode was our

[06:15] greatest episode ever made. Did he actually say he sort of said that? Sort of said that. It looks

[06:22] like he said it was the first episode he listened to. Well, I chose the first I mean, he didn't

[06:27] choose Steve Richie and it didn't run him off. So it had to be good. He said that he thought it

[06:32] would be really cool that we spend some time on the history of the cocktail pinball machine.

[06:37] You know, you remember those, right? Yeah, there's I've seen them. I played them. A couple of really

[06:45] cool ones. Yeah, I like Night Moose myself. That's a good one. There's one in our local bar,

[06:53] actually. I really enjoy those. And I do actually have some bits and pieces from some previous

[06:59] research that we can use for cocktail. So yes, we will do an episode on the cocktail pinballs.

[07:05] Now, I'm not doing that just for Ted. This is not just for Ted. He means nothing to me.

[07:12] It just is that I will I already have a lot of that stuff on there. And I think it will be

[07:16] slightly more popular than our bingo episode. I know that there is a cocktail pinball at the

[07:24] Rochester pinball collective. I can tell you that. That's the one in Rochester. 349 West

[07:29] Commercial Street East Rochester, New York. You can hear all about it on my other podcast,

[07:33] the slam tail podcast with me and my fellow host Bruce Knight and go there. I got that out of the

[07:39] way. Great. Good job. Thank you. That was a good one. So we're going to be talking about Jersey

[07:44] Jack pinball. This is our second part of the Jersey Jack pinball episode. You can go back to

[07:49] episode 44 if you want to learn about sort of the rise of Jack Winari and the creation of Jersey

[07:58] Jack pinball. And it's first kind of pinball adventure, if you will, in the wizard of Oz. It's

[08:06] pretty good episode. We got a lot of great feedback, including some feedback from Jack himself.

[08:10] So if you listen to episode 45 at the first, there's a couple of corrections and additions that

[08:15] Jack had given us. Now did you know that Ken Cromwell from flipping out pinball? That's Ken at flip,

[08:22] the letter n out pinball.com. Worked at Jersey Jack for a period of time. Yes, I did. Yeah. And Ken

[08:32] as everybody knows in the pinball hobby, much better than Greg, Greg at flip and out pinball.com.

[08:41] Would you agree? Wow, you're making friends all over the place.

[08:46] Yeah, but I mean, if you're looking for a new pinball machine, we highly recommend

[08:51] Ken and Greg, but mostly Ken, especially if it's a Jersey Jack pinball because he knows all the

[08:59] gremlins, he knows all of the hidden gems and he knows definitely what is undervalued when it

[09:06] comes to the JJ P pins because he knows all the dirt. Mm, undervalued would definitely be dialed in.

[09:14] I agree, agreed. And he knows all that stuff. He knows all the ins and outs. I bet you he would have

[09:19] a lot of fun. I would say respectful comments about those within Jersey Jack. I kid, but if you're

[09:27] looking for a Jersey Jack, I don't think there's a better expert out there. When it comes to Jersey

[09:33] Jack pinballs, then somebody who actually worked in the factory with Jersey Jack on that marketing team.

[09:41] So if I don't think any other distributor would be a as key as somebody like Ken. And again,

[09:48] that's Ken at flip the letter n out pinball.com. So this is count as the ad. Or if I get the ad

[09:56] free version, will that total that section be completely gone? No, people love to hear me talk

[10:00] about Ken and Greg that you that I'm not cutting out. Oh, okay. That's less of an ad and more of an

[10:06] endorsement. Mm-hmm. I would never endorse Greg, but I would always endorse Ken. I do have a game

[10:13] coming from flipping out, but I can't say what it is because it's not a Jersey Jack game and it would

[10:17] not be appropriate. Oh, okay. Well, we'll keep that. We'll keep that on the quiet to mention a

[10:21] competitor. Yeah, it's evil dead. When we left JJP, they were having some financial difficulties.

[10:31] It wasn't the end of the world, but they needed to quote unquote, recapitalize and to review the

[10:38] pre order model. And that's when we entered the investors of the Abyss family and a few others.

[10:47] If you want to learn all about those again, back to episode 44, but this is when Jersey Jack needs

[10:53] to build up. Here we are, episode 49, let's do an Aeros Tour of Jersey Jack Pinball, part two.

[11:04] Aeros Tour. Huh? Good reference. Uh, I don't, is that a rush thing? Oh, I'm sorry.

[11:13] That sounds like it'll be a rush tour, the Aeros Tour.

[11:17] So the new management team at Jersey Jack, they made some changes, they shifted some people around

[11:24] and they brought in a new head of design, somebody with a lot of experience. That was Pat Waller.

[11:31] Do you think this is a good idea? Uh, judging by dialed in, yes. I think it was a good idea. The

[11:38] other thing is Pat Waller, we remember instrumental in, in sort of trying to create the hollow pin

[11:45] or pinball 2000. So when it comes to R&D and research, he knows he's done it before.

[11:51] He's made some of the greatest games before he's worked on a facility line building and manufacturing

[11:59] thousands of machines. Pat Waller, I think, brings a lot of knowledge. And I think this was a good move.

[12:05] You know, when we look back at the history of Jersey Jack, now that we're in 2025,

[12:12] do you think this was a good move? Do you think that they sort of, was Pat helped them over a hump?

[12:18] I mean, it wasn't a bad move, that's for sure. I mean, most of his games are, most of my favorite

[12:25] Jersey Jack games are his. Again, hit and miss. So from my perspective, yes. I think it was a good,

[12:30] good deal. So the thing was that Pat Waller, he had his own model shop at home,

[12:36] but he developed a new model shop or a, you know, a research and development team, I guess,

[12:44] with designers and things like that in Chicago. I guess that was probably part of his,

[12:49] part of his deal was that he was not moving to New Jersey. Now New Jersey is where Jersey Jack

[12:56] was manufacturing all of those pinball machines. So we've got a bit of a problem here. We've got

[13:03] a better sort of design culture and manufacturing culture. However, the actual line in building

[13:12] is a couple of states over. That's got to cause problems, right? I always thought it was kind of

[13:16] weird. All the development, all the people who work for Jersey Jack were all in Chicago,

[13:23] but they manufacture everything in New Jersey. Yeah. So I mean, all of the design was already in Chicago,

[13:31] right? Like there was a lot of people there. Now Pat was sort of building it out. What materials

[13:35] do we need? What tooling do we need? What research and development do we need? He immediately began

[13:40] on redesigning the cabinet to simplify some of those mechanics, help increase the efficiency

[13:47] of the factory teams. But again, those factory teams, a couple of states over in New Jersey.

[13:54] But this is where Pat also began to plan moving that factory from New Jersey to Chicago.

[14:01] Why does Chicago end up being the epicenter of pinball for some reason? Because it's for how

[14:06] the vendors they use are people that make the little bits and pieces because they have been making

[14:12] those little bits and pieces for 50 years in Chicago. It's just the place to be.

[14:18] Pat immediately began working on some whitewoods in his home-based shop before he started to move

[14:25] into that new design facility in Chicago. Pat would say that you're only as good as the models that

[14:31] you can build. And I think that that's actually pretty smart. Now his shop was a throwback to his

[14:38] Valley Williams philosophy. And I think that that Valley Williams magic is something that Jersey

[14:45] Jack is always trying to bring back to pinball. 100% when they use all Williams terminology.

[14:53] Like pop-upers are jets, things like that. These are Williams terms. They're the only ones who

[15:00] use them now. No other manufacturer. I know calls them jets. Why do we still have this nostalgia

[15:07] love for the Valley Williams era of pinball? Why is that still seen as the golden times?

[15:13] Because they're awesome. They're all pretty great. They've got lots of stuff going on, right?

[15:19] Like it's no longer just a couple of ramps. The funnest games ever made. They're not perfect.

[15:24] But I'll tell you, like in my league, we have four games. We have Attack from Mars. We have a King Kong,

[15:32] a Jurassic Park, and a Whitewater. When you actually listen to all four games, there's two

[15:40] that are miles above the other two. What do you think those are?

[15:45] Oh, it's got to be Whitewater. And it's got to be Attack from Mars. I mean, it's just the call-outs,

[15:50] the whole, it's just so much better. There was some sort of magic that kind of happened from like

[15:57] 1990 to 97. There was something going on there. There was some level of creativity or freedom or

[16:04] competition or something. It just happened to be a good collection of that. So I think that's why

[16:09] all these manufacturers are trying to harken back to those days.

[16:14] They all use their parts.

[16:17] Well, I mean, take a look at what was happening in pinball around the 2008 type kind of situation was

[16:24] everything the bottom completely fell out of manufacturing and not only the bottom of the manufacturing,

[16:29] but also the funnest of a home kind of $10,000 or $8,000 machine.

[16:37] That didn't exist yet. There were no $8,000 to $10,000 machines at all. Not in 2008. That will come

[16:44] later. Thanks to Jersey Jack. We talked about sort of the ramp up of Jersey Jack, all that stuff

[16:49] back in episode 44. So we're going to kind of jump ahead a little bit to when that leadership

[16:54] change came. When Pat Lawler started to ramp up his work in the company, starting to design an

[17:03] original theme with some of the greatest engineers that I think that they would collect and try to

[17:10] build out that nostalgia and excitement. Now Keith Johnson and his team were already working on a

[17:18] pinball machine that was well ahead in development. So Pat kind of working on his own original theme

[17:25] and then Keith working on the Hobbit, which with Joe Balser. So the Hobbit, this is the licensed

[17:35] fantasy theme. It was released in 2016. We don't know how many units were built because it's a private

[17:41] company. They don't just they don't talk about that. Designed work by the King Kong Joe Balser,

[17:48] art by Jean Paul DeWin and Matt Ristiller. Rist Ristur. Mechanics by Eric Minier and that's

[17:57] somebody who's going to come up a lot more, I think. Sound and music by David Theole and two steps

[18:03] from hell, whoever that is. And Jean Paul DeWin on animation. Software Keith Johnson, Ted Estes,

[18:11] Alex Levy, Joe Katz and JT Harkey. Now we covered a lot of this in the Keith Johnson episode

[18:20] in Hobbit, but the Hobbit movie trilogy was something that was going to be the second rebirth

[18:27] of the Lord of the Rings. Do you remember how all the hype around this? I remember the hype.

[18:32] I never saw any of the movies. But I do remember the hype. So I mean, if we remember pinball,

[18:39] what a pinball's greatest pinball machines ever Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings films,

[18:46] three books turned into three films, probably the greatest films ever made, you know, a bunch of

[18:54] nerds. We all love those. It's fantastic. So what are we going to do? We're going to go back to

[18:59] the well Peter Jackson, the director and the writer and the producer is going to go back to

[19:05] Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit, which I think is the better book. It's an absolute masterpiece,

[19:15] much better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy books, in my opinion. Really? But what we're going

[19:19] to do is we're going to turn one book into three films. And I think what has happened in this

[19:26] situation is progressively those films get worse. Where in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, they

[19:33] progressively get better. They go from amazing to stunning to the one of the greatest films

[19:38] like ever. That's the problem. Jersey Jack gets the license for the Hobbit because like what better

[19:45] way to, you know, bring the band back together than to get Keith Johnson who did the Lord of the

[19:51] Rings pinball machine to do the Hobbit pinball machine. How do we get a hot hyped film, the Hobbit?

[19:58] But boy, oh boy, did it not do well. You didn't see them. No, I haven't seen any of those.

[20:03] The interesting thing, I don't know if we mentioned this, you know, the pinball manufacturers today,

[20:08] they don't tell you what licenses are coming up. But Jersey Jack, you knew their first game was

[20:13] Wizard of Oz because they said it was Wizard of Oz. And you knew their next game was Hobbit

[20:19] because they said it was going to be the Hobbit. I remember going to the factory

[20:24] when they had all the buyers come in to the factory and I was a guest of a buyer, Bruce, my

[20:31] my fellow host on slantilt. And I remember they had a thing after the tour and all that. They

[20:40] had a bunch of group of people that were going to see the Hobbit like the first one. And it was

[20:45] known, it was known that was the next game that was going to be coming out. It was the Hobbit.

[20:49] It weren't even full production on Wizard of Oz yet. Yeah, they're on the hype train, right? They're

[20:54] trying to get people excited for the Hobbit because they're still trying to get through

[21:00] Wizard of Oz, right? They got to get you excited for the next thing so they can keep that cash flow

[21:05] going, which I think was very much part of the, oh god, we need money, we better get promoting

[21:10] the next thing. If we go way back to our down the rabbit hole episode with Zidware and that

[21:21] whole thing, they're on the same sort of treadmill of, oh my god, we need money, we've got to promote

[21:26] the next thing to keep the money flowing. That is where I think the major difference between Jersey

[21:31] Jack and the other manufacturers who have come up since or disappeared before is that the Abyss

[21:38] family and those investors were able to leave that pressure and then move back into creative

[21:46] and then they can kind of be quiet about their inevitable releases and focus on getting them done

[21:54] rather than the treadmill of worrying about money. Again, we covered this Hobbit stuff under the

[22:00] Keith Johnson episode. Please go back to the archives and listen to that one. But I did pull a

[22:05] couple of really cool quotes from a Jersey Jack pinball podcast originally hosted by Ken Cromwell

[22:12] with Brent Abyss. Now what does he say about the development of Hobbit? He says, making the

[22:19] Hobbit was a lot harder than I thought when we came in. There were millions of dollars in parts

[22:24] in the factory, but we couldn't build a single game. We renewed this as well and we had to learn

[22:29] on the spot. It took some time, but we finally did it. We delivered to everyone who had a pre-order.

[22:35] That's a big deal. They turned this machine around a lot faster, but there was a little bit of

[22:40] controversy. One of those controversies was like art. It wasn't fast. None of their first few games

[22:46] were fast. Yeah, but I mean it was faster than the Wizard of Oz. I remember they had this at Expo

[22:53] and everyone hated the art. They hated the art and it had really early code on it. It just had

[23:00] the main multi-ball or the dragon does this thing, so that was cool. But that was it. Next

[23:09] thing you know, they're totally changing the art. Yeah, a change in the art. So they're still very

[23:14] reactive. They're still very sensitive to the feedback of the community and things like that,

[23:19] which is, I mean like a stern is not going to change the art because people are upset about it,

[23:25] right? Like a little more of an amateur company might. Now I don't think Jersey Jack is like that

[23:30] anymore, but it's a different situation. They did end up with a ton of clips in that game.

[23:35] Like they had all the assets unbelievable. And the animation that Jean Paul De Wynn was able to

[23:41] weave in. You're collecting animals and spiders that are popping up from like trolls,

[23:48] medieval madness. You got the dragon talking to you and taunting you. You've got this whimsy music

[23:56] of David Theall and I think some people say it's still the heaviest game that Jersey Jack ever

[24:04] did. Avatar might be up there though. I'm curious which one of those two is heavier. Yeah, if you know

[24:10] right into Silver Ball Chronicles, which game is heavier because yeah. Yeah. Well Pat Lawler,

[24:16] he's noticed, okay, you know, he's come in. He's doing his own thing. He's tooling up his own shop.

[24:22] He's able to sort of observe how, you know, they've got all these parts, all the situation. What's

[24:27] going on in the factory? Well, he wants to kind of write the ship. He wants to put things in place.

[24:32] And you can't turn a ship on a dime. It's, you know, it takes time to move that around.

[24:38] But he's going to do that with his new pin dialed in. This is an original theme based on Pat Lawler's

[24:45] past games, 2017. Again, not, we're not sure how many units are made, but I don't think there's

[24:52] actually that many out there. It's the bleaced made game that Jersey Jack is ever known. I think so.

[24:58] It's still great. Art by John Yosey, who will know back from his time working at Stern. And before

[25:06] that. He's like a Waller artist. He's like his dude. They're their butts. Yeah. Mechanics by

[25:11] Yolanda Winston, Wally Welch, and Dan Molter, sound by David Thiel, the absolute legend,

[25:19] animation Jean Paul to win software. Because it's a small team. It's Keith Lwyn, Ted Estes, Joe

[25:25] Cass. Keith Lwyn. It's not Keith. I'm sorry. Keith Johnson, Ted Estes, Joe Cass, Alex Levy. It's

[25:32] a small team. So they're on every project. Great game. Don't forget him. Yes. JT Harkey. Great game.

[25:39] We covered this under our Pat Lawler episode a lot more in a lot more detail.

[25:45] I wanted to gut shine it again. Okay. Go ahead. What do we get? What are we going to talk about here?

[25:49] Just on a high level. Well, I'll just say this is their first non-wide body conventional size game.

[25:56] Right. He's looking for efficiency, I think. Right. He's going on a standard body. They've redesigned

[26:01] the head. They've redesigned the way that the screen swivels in and out because there's a computer

[26:05] behind it. Yeah. They moved all the, yeah. You move all the stuff into the back box where it

[26:11] belongs, his exact quote from the expo reveal. So you know who made that decision. He's talking very

[26:18] much, I think, when it comes to how do we, how do we do more with less? Right. So rather than just

[26:28] throwing everything in, everything should be meaningful and creative and exciting. So a lot of the

[26:33] mechanics in, in dialed in are very familiar, although a lot of the, the ways the balls paths move,

[26:44] the way ball diverters work is new and exciting and different. And there's lots of stuff in it

[26:51] when you compare it to a stern of the day, but the stuff in it is simpler. It's doing more with less.

[26:59] Very cool. I love dialed in. I would still buy a dialed in today. Yeah. And their cabinets at that

[27:06] point look a lot like Williams cabinets. Except, except they have, they actually have the, the key,

[27:14] the lock that Stern used to have where you put the, the thing in it, turn it and it just locks it.

[27:21] Yeah, rather than just bolts, I think now. Yeah. Which Stern must have not a patented that or whatever

[27:26] if they were using it. It's cheaper to put bolts. That's, that's true. So this brings us to,

[27:33] I would say a pretty exciting pinball machine, right? This is the sort of the second or third

[27:42] game in the line here with, with sort of the new ownership. And that is Pirates of the Caribbean.

[27:48] This is the licensed fantasy pirate film theme 2018. This was the first huge launch

[27:57] when I joined pinball in the summer of 2018. We don't know how many units are made, but again,

[28:04] not very many of these floating around. I don't think a new designer has come around. Eric Minier,

[28:11] Eric worked with Jersey Jack as an engineer. His family grew up in pinball as an operator.

[28:20] Eric knows pinball. Art by Jean Paul to win. We've got mechanics by Eric Minier. He did a lot of his

[28:30] own mechanics on this machine. David Thiel on Sound and Music. And this is, I would think one of his

[28:36] best sound packages. Animation Jean Paul to win. Software Keith Johnson Ted Estes, Joe Katzen,

[28:44] JT Harkey. We covered this in our Keith Johnson episode. If you want to hear more about it,

[28:50] check it out there. But this is really overrated. What do you think? I had fun playing it. I got

[29:00] to play the same, I got to play the same one for like a year because they just kept bringing it to

[29:04] all the shows, the same, the same one. This is when they were having the issues where they just

[29:08] could not make the games quickly. They unveiled this at Expo. And I think was, I don't want

[29:17] into the summer before they actually started building these things like eight, nine months later.

[29:23] You're about in our previous episode, but yeah, they had to change the spinning disc from three

[29:27] discs to one. They put everything into this thing except clips, except clips. Which was one of

[29:32] its biggest downfalls. It got a lot of crap, which is why they didn't make a lot of them.

[29:38] But here's the thing. I think it's a great game. I love playing it. It's kind of fun.

[29:42] It shoots okay. It's a wide body. So it's a bit lumbering. But it is fun. I do enjoy it when

[29:49] I play it. But it is overrated. This game is pulling out like 25,000 US or something, right?

[29:56] If you can find one of these. Yeah. If you can find one. It's it's it's overrated in that way.

[30:02] I think that one of the best features of the game, although some people are

[30:09] would argue that point is the code by Keith Johnson. What does Keith Johnson say?

[30:14] Keith says, I will admit the pirates is a little bit of a risk with the character thing. Now,

[30:20] what did he mean by that? So you could choose, I think it was like 12 different characters. And

[30:24] they all have different perks and objectives. Yes. Yeah. Maybe it's 18. It's ridiculous.

[30:32] He says, but people don't have to pay attention to it if they don't want to. I feel like games

[30:36] have to have a lot to do and a lot to learn and stuff like that to justify their cost. I mean,

[30:41] we're selling games at 8500 minimum right now. Wow. That was a long time ago. So if you get a game

[30:47] and you're done with it in two weeks, you know, that's always been my philosophy with driving

[30:52] rule design at JJP. He's not wrong. But people hit that wall of like, I got to choose one of these

[30:57] 18 characters. I don't know what to do. I don't know. People got like involved, which I think is

[31:02] ridiculous. There's nothing to like just play the game, man. Right? Just don't don't write about that.

[31:07] My issue with the game was not the complexity of the code was not that the prototype things were

[31:14] taken out. It's that it's a wide body and it's ridiculously expensive to actually find and play it.

[31:21] What about that rocking ship thing? What do you think about that? That was pretty cool,

[31:24] wasn't it? It was cool. Except the one unit that they brought everywhere that I played a

[31:29] bunch of times would only rock in one direction. That's how I always knew it was the same one.

[31:35] Where I hear I heard later, it might have been a software issue. Why was it? But it would always

[31:39] seen everyone I played. It would only rock. I think left. I can't remember. It would only rock in

[31:45] one direction. It's an upper play field of a boat that was supposed to rock left and right

[31:52] that you shoot two little flippers on and it has a friggin cannon that shoots across the play field

[31:58] to a target on another boat and two spinners. And two spinners? It's pretty cool. I'm not going to lie.

[32:07] But it had some kind of issues. They're manufacturing these things in New Jersey.

[32:16] The tooling and everything and the building of all that stuff was in Chicago. The first unit that

[32:22] came out like the cabling was too tight and it would unplug itself when it rocked. You can see

[32:28] that they're having issues with manufacturing in a different location. The lack of assets

[32:34] was also a whole thing. So there was no actual pictures of Johnny Depp or any of those actors in it.

[32:43] So they kind of made it a pirate theme without it being a Jersey Jack theme. He's on the play field.

[32:50] He's on the play field but there's no video because that's different thing. They had no video assets

[32:54] from the movie or callouts from the movie. So they got one of the cast members from the movie

[33:01] to do callouts, which I think are great. Honestly, I think that's one of the highlights of the game.

[33:06] He does like everything too. It's like hundreds of pages of callouts. It's great. But I think a lot

[33:13] of people are like, where are the clips? Because they did Hobbit, which had everything. You know,

[33:19] they did Wizard of Oz, which had everything you could want from Wizard of Oz. And then they do

[33:24] this game and they have no clips from the movie at all. Yeah. Again, I don't me personally. I don't

[33:30] think that's the end of the world. But if I'm paying like $27,000 Canadian for this machine,

[33:38] I think I'm going to want the clips. It's pretty wild. But it's fun. Go play the game. It's great.

[33:45] Now, I had heard rumors that around the launch of Pirates of the Caribbean, the person who did all

[33:52] the contract negotiations was let go. Now, I think Brett Abyss is learning what the company needs

[34:00] to do to differentiate itself from Stern. It needs assets. It needs to be able to manufacture them

[34:08] in a timely manner. It needs much more stuff in them, but not too much that it's ridiculous and

[34:16] slows down manufacturing. So I think with all each new release, we've got that. As I mentioned

[34:23] before, you can't turn that ship really quickly. Now, we're three games into the new ownership

[34:30] structure. And I think they're learning how to make money. Speaking of making money, there's a term

[34:36] called bomb or bill of materials. What are we talking about with that? How much it costs to make

[34:42] the game? Who do you think has more bill of materials? Jersey Jack pinball or Stern? Jersey Jack

[34:48] pinball. Like they got more stuff. More stuff is more expensive. But they don't necessarily sell

[34:54] their machines for that much more at this time than a Stern. Stern has kind of raised their price

[35:00] to kind of come closer to Jersey Jack. But Stern is definitely making more margin, right? The

[35:06] difference between the cost of the machine and the sale of the machine. I think Jersey Jack

[35:09] margins are much tighter because they got to keep the price down so they're not ridiculous.

[35:15] But they got to put more stuff in it to make it to incentivize you. This brings me to an

[35:20] interesting question. Is pirates of the Caribbean the last real Jersey Jack pinball machine?

[35:26] I mean, it's the last wide body. So when we talk about the era's tour of Jersey Jack pinball,

[35:32] I think the first era kind of ends now at pirates. Because when you look at these machines,

[35:39] they were all wide bodies and they all had like an outrageous amount of stuff in it. Except I'll

[35:45] do it. But yes. So then you get to this demarcation point and then we're going to start moving

[35:51] into a different era. They went back to the well because they weren't selling a lot of these

[35:58] pirates of the Caribbean's because for some reason or another people didn't see the value or

[36:04] maybe they buried the lead when they showed a bunch of stuff and took some stuff out. It didn't have

[36:11] the clips, the complex code, whatever it was. They weren't building enough and selling enough.

[36:15] So they needed to put something on the line. So they went back to the well with the Wizard of Oz

[36:22] Yellow brick road addition. Do you remember this? Was it the Yellow brick road addition or was it

[36:26] the Ruby red addition? Because I've gotten confused about which one, like one of them was when they

[36:32] first made it. I think that was the emerald city. And then Ruby came after that. Yeah, Ruby was the

[36:39] first time they redid it. They redid it and then Yellow brick road. They redid it again but with the

[36:45] newer cabinet designs. So they couldn't do the same thing with the monkey. So the monkey didn't move

[36:50] anymore. So in the back of the original Wizard of Oz there was a mech that went up the backboard that

[36:55] was a magnet that would grab the ball and it was the monkey hidden lock on the upper playfield in

[37:00] the back. Because of the play field redesign they couldn't do that. The cabinet redesign. They

[37:06] couldn't. Yeah. So there's some so some people are like, oh, what's going on there? But then there was

[37:10] also a huge price hike. Then there was the reveal of this machine which I think was an absolute

[37:19] train wreck. Yeah. Hi, I was there. Yeah, everyone thought it was going to be like their new game.

[37:24] Everybody thought that the hype was, oh my god, Jersey Jack is going to show us their new pinball

[37:30] machine. Everybody goes into this room and there is a pinball machine under a garbage bag.

[37:36] I was not in the seminar but I heard about it later because I was at the show. A garbage bag

[37:42] because they didn't want to reveal anything. They wanted to hide it so people didn't know what it was.

[37:47] They put a garbage bag over their pinball machine. Are you saying they should have put a blanket

[37:53] instead? Maybe a blanket. Maybe put a box in front of it like some Jersey Jack boxes and move

[37:59] the boxes out of the way. A yellow blanket would have been perfect. Anything. Anything.

[38:05] But a garbage bag. So then they go and they reveal the yellow brick road. And to my opinion,

[38:11] I, you know, it was nice but I didn't think they were going to sell very many of them because they

[38:15] took out one of the coolest parts, the monkey and the yellow in my opinion a bit too much but they

[38:20] did add glitter to the play field which is really nice. And they did fix a few of the little

[38:25] issues with they made it shoot better. No, no, no. But they made sure some of the

[38:32] optos were better. They made sure some of the switches were in better places. I think they did

[38:37] a good job. This is probably one of the better ones to own. But man, it did not go well.

[38:43] But shortly thereafter Pat Lawler showed up with probably one of the most exciting themes that I

[38:54] I would love for a pinball machine to be made and that's Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory.

[38:59] Do you remember Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory? Yes, I've actually seen that movie.

[39:03] I love Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory. This holds such a wonderful spot in my heart.

[39:11] Sheen Wilder is great. I love you. Sheen Wilder is unbelievable. This is the 1971 film.

[39:20] Well, let me go back. This is the licensed fantasy film theme from 2019. We don't know how many

[39:26] units they made. Jean Paul DeWin on art designed by Pat Lawler, mechanics by Eric Minier,

[39:34] sound and music. Here we've got a problem with a company called Unlock Audio.

[39:39] Animation by Jean Paul DeWin. Software Keith Johnson. No. Software by Joe Katz and Ted Estes,

[39:47] I believe, with JT Harkey. This we covered in depth in the Pat Lawler episode. But it is based

[39:54] on the 1971 family musical Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory. As you mentioned,

[40:00] Jean Wilder phenomenal in this film. This holds a wonderful place in my heart.

[40:07] But you can see this is Pat Lawler's second machine that de-marcation point, the new era is

[40:13] beginning. The pinball machine was designed to be simpler, to be more location based.

[40:20] There was an introduction of the standard edition, which took mechanics out.

[40:26] To be fair, they had lesser editions before. They had lesser, they have different editions.

[40:33] They had, what was it? Dialed in had an LE, but then had a CE or whatever they had, but they had

[40:39] a, I think they had three different versions of dialed in. Yeah, because they had one that didn't

[40:44] have the lights on the ramps. They have basically done lesser versions, but always made the big deal

[40:51] that the play field is the same. We will never take out any max. We will never remove anything

[40:57] from the play field. That's what Eric Minier said during his pirate speech before unveiling

[41:02] the pirate's game. Yeah, our thing is we got more stuff in it. And no matter what you buy,

[41:08] you get the same experience. You just might get a little less powder coating in bling.

[41:12] So the very next game, Willie Wonka, they have a version that doesn't have the walk of

[41:18] ator. They removed a whole neck from the game for the first time. It's the first time they did that.

[41:24] We can see that things are changing a little bit, right? Pat Lawler knows here's what's going on

[41:29] over at Stern. They've got a pro and a premium and an LE and we need to have something similar

[41:36] because we need to get into locations and locations are not going to spend $10,000 on a pinball

[41:42] machine. Locations want to get six or $7,000 nowadays, but back then it was closer to five.

[41:49] The only way we can get in there is to reduce margins or take stuff out.

[41:53] And Pat Lawler, he's been in this industry a long time. He knows what to do.

[41:57] He did add some really cool things like those light rods, which were these really many

[42:01] inserts in the play field. They were really beautiful. It sounds like a slot machine.

[42:05] Like the dinging in the jingling and the whatever. Because we don't have somebody who has

[42:10] done pinball before, we've brought in a company that made it say, hey, here do this.

[42:15] It really hit the, it really missed it. I will disagree with your one comment. It has a ton of

[42:22] stuff in it. If you look underneath the play field, it has like four or five magnets. It's

[42:28] ridiculous. The amount of stuff that is in that game. It is, it is packed. But it is, it is not

[42:35] pirates of the Caribbean. You know what I mean? It is not, it shoots back your wizard of Oz.

[42:41] Oh, agreed. But that's the thing is sometimes you got to take stuff out to make a better game.

[42:46] And Pat Lawler knows that. But that is different to the philosophy of what Jersey Jack was created,

[42:51] that first era. The sound and the art were the two main things. They got really

[42:57] plat. People did not like. Because code struggled. It was a bit weird in the beginning.

[43:03] It actually went through a couple of revisions. So the idea was you're collecting

[43:06] wonka bars. And as you collect those wonka bars on the ramps, then it opens up other modes.

[43:12] But it was really, really hard to get beyond. Yeah. And it went through a major revision at the,

[43:17] like way out of the fact. Two or three years ago. Yeah. Like way after the fact that the game was,

[43:22] they redid a bunch of the scoring. Yeah. Which basically what they did is they lowered the bar.

[43:29] So you could get further. Which is fine. So let's, you know, we're in the summer of 2020.

[43:36] Okay. We've released a few games. We're in the pandemic time now. You know, so things are,

[43:43] things are weird. Things are different. What does Brent Abyss say? Brent talks about Tesla.

[43:49] He says Tesla had three phases. Phase one, the original Roadster, Phase two, the Model S,

[43:56] the X, and all three. Another entering Phase three with their SUV semi truck,

[44:03] giga factories coming online all over the world. The Wizard of Oz and the Hobbit were Phase one for us.

[44:10] Dildin was the start of Phase two where we have a waller complete cabinet redesign, major electronics upgrades,

[44:17] and we're still in Phase two. And we're jumping into Phase three. You're going to see a lot of innovation happening.

[44:23] You'll notice major differences among all of our games. We're not afraid to try something that's never been done before.

[44:30] And that's one reason our customers love our games. Phase three for us is the future. We have some great titles in the

[44:36] pipeline. We're expanding. We're recruiting creative talent. Our new factory in Chicago with design and

[44:42] production under one roof is something we've wanted for a long time. I had mentioned in our previous

[44:48] episode that Brent seems very motivated, very excited. But he's, he also projects a lot of maybe

[44:57] overconfidence. He's very salesy, but he's not Gary Stern salesy. He's always setting the bar really high,

[45:04] which I think is great to achieve that bar. But we'll see over the next phases or the next eras if that comes through.

[45:12] I think he believes it. And that's the important part. And I mean, like there's there a company they seem to be making money.

[45:19] They they're still around. They're still getting great themes. They're still making great games. So he's not wrong. You know,

[45:26] we'll see. Now speaking of Jersey Jack making money, what does Brent say does Brent say they make money?

[45:33] People love to speculate that this company has never made any money. I'll debunk that right now.

[45:38] We've seen 25% year over year growth over the past few years. And we've been breaking even for

[45:44] well over a year now. And we're on a clear path to profitability. A lot of hard work over the years

[45:49] and it's finally paying off. So when did he say that 2020? Yeah. So that means to

[45:56] took eight or nine years to get the profit. I think in manufacturing and companies in general,

[46:01] there is quite a few years before you're actually starting to make pretty like that's not uncommon.

[46:06] Restraught stuff. They said like two or three years, but man, almost eight or nine years,

[46:10] that seems like a long time. There's a lot of there's a lot of changes in movement. And it is a

[46:15] pretty volatile thing. So here's the thing. When people talk about pinball being easy and pinball

[46:19] being hard and that's a cliche, you know, I get it to actually start to be profitable and things

[46:25] like that is pretty normal to take years. But you know, in pinball, it seems to be a real struggle,

[46:30] especially when you're trying to make a Cadillac. You know what I mean? Like if you kind of come in

[46:35] and you're like trying to just make a good product, that's one thing. But if you're coming in to try

[46:39] to make the best product, you need the capital and the money behind you to to to to eat those

[46:46] losses for many, many years before you end up really coming out on top. So I would be interested

[46:52] to know some of these other bigger companies are like, but here's the thing. I think we're starting

[46:58] to move. We're getting towards the end of this second era of Jersey Jack pinball. And this is the

[47:08] I would say the leftovers from the old company. And then we're starting to move into the new

[47:14] company. We're getting that new factory. We're getting a few of the other bits. This is another

[47:20] major demarcation point for Jersey Jack pinball. That is Guns and Roses from 2020. This is the licensed

[47:30] band music pin designed by Eric Minier and Saul slash Hudson slash from Guns and Roses.

[47:38] Art by Dane Henry Jr. Jean Paul DeWin Adrian Buller Mark Mullet, Mullet and Jasper Abel. So

[47:52] the reason there's so many different art folk on here is that there's a lot of different art

[47:58] packages available for the different pinball machine levels. Sound in music by Vickers Dio and

[48:07] Saul slash animation Jean Paul DeWin and his team. He's brought in his, I believe his brother

[48:13] Jerome DeWin and software by Keith Johnson Ted Estes Joe Katz. They're all in on this one.

[48:20] This is the first new pinball machine in the new Chicago Illinois factory. And it was the first

[48:27] smash hit during the pandemic. So why the move? First of all, let's talk about the move. Why did they move

[48:35] from Jersey Jack to Chicago? They moved from Jersey Jack? They moved from Jersey. Why did they move

[48:39] from New Jersey to Chicago? Because their whole development team is there. Jack says it corrected

[48:46] a mistake that I made back when I started the company. Certainly, there are all kinds of

[48:49] companies that have headquarters in different places. It was a good time doing it the way I did it.

[48:54] I don't really regret it. We produce some really great games. But how many buildings do you want to

[48:59] pay taxes and rent on to consolidate everything and have everyone under one roof? I thought it was a

[49:04] lot better idea and the timing was right. That's where a lot of that I think probably extra years

[49:10] of trying to be profitable. There's a lot of bleeding probably going on with these multiple

[49:14] leases on multiple buildings. And you know what I mean? So there's there's problems there.

[49:19] But having that opportunity to move, why didn't they move sooner? Why didn't they just why

[49:25] why didn't they just when the Fizz or Wizard of Oz why didn't they just jump ship right away?

[49:28] Because at least and Brent says Brent Abbas he says our lease was coming up in New Jersey. We had

[49:35] to make a decision. It was not easy, but I believe it's the right one. We spent too much time sending

[49:40] people back and forth on planes and trying to work through issues that wouldn't have existed if

[49:44] we were all under one roof. We have so much incredible knowledge and experience. He is a 100% spot

[49:50] on there. And I think this is one of his strengths. Think about it. If you're the designer and they're

[49:55] starting to make your game, they have to fly him over there so they could watch them and show them

[50:00] how to build the game as opposed to just being right there. Exactly. Now Brent understands business.

[50:06] He's a young fella. He's in his 30s at this time early 30s, I believe. But he knows business

[50:13] enough that he's got to find some efficiencies. He's got to watch his margin. So if you're spending

[50:18] 300 bucks flying somebody back and forth a couple of times a week, that's chewing away at profitability.

[50:25] And that's another mech you can put in a machine. That's more profit you can put in. That's another

[50:30] designer that you can pay or another programmer. So he gets it. He understands business. And I think

[50:37] that's why Jersey Jack is successful because the owner and the person in charge, his son Brent

[50:45] understand business. Jack understands sales. He understands relationships. Any understands business.

[50:53] But I mean, manufacturing and big scale businesses a whole other thing. So guns and roses.

[50:59] Everybody knows who guns and roses are right. The band formed in 1985. They really broke out in

[51:04] 1987 with appetite for destruction. Followed that up with the smash hit user illusion one and then

[51:11] two because they couldn't think of another name in 1990 and 93 respectively. Huh? Yeah.

[51:18] They were a big deal in the early 90s. I remember them. They were like the the last kind of

[51:24] hurrah maybe before grunge. You know what I mean? Like the not quite hair metal, not quite grunge.

[51:32] They were kind of this still party is cool kind of thing in the early 90s. I just remember the

[51:37] welcome to the jungle video where he had the 80s like poofy hair thing that he only had in that one

[51:44] video. Axel Rose I mean. Yeah, they were kind of the tail end of that kind of hair metal thing before

[51:51] grunge kind of killed rock and roll. And they follow that up with the smash hit amazing Chinese

[51:58] democracy in 1998. No, no, no one remembers that one. Although it is it is in the pinball machine.

[52:06] In March of 2016, the band announced the not in this lifetime tour. The tour's name was a reference

[52:14] to a 2012 interview which Axel Rose was asked about a potential reunion tour and he responded

[52:20] not in this lifetime. The tour was a financial success. And by the end of the tour in December of

[52:27] 2018, it had grossed half a billion dollars making it the second largest grossing tour ever

[52:34] besides I think you two's 360 tour. Why doesn't you two have a pin? I don't know if that really

[52:44] translates quite as well. The songs would be good. The songs would be good, but I don't know.

[52:50] Guns and roses has had this resurgence, right? This nostalgia resurgence that kind of happens

[52:56] as bands age. And I think they're bigger now than they probably were in their heyday because kind

[53:02] of the newer generations are discovering kind of how cool they were and the nostalgia of how things

[53:08] were back in the day. Right. So I think that that's pretty cool. They're one of the biggest bands in

[53:13] the world now. They were big when they were around, but they weren't like the biggest band in the world.

[53:19] Which is crazy. They had like four or five years where they were relevant and they'd been

[53:24] going off at that ever since. It's pretty wild, right? So if you look at like

[53:30] Iron Maiden, right? Like they were pretty big, but they were kind of under the radar. And then

[53:35] they're bigger now than they've ever been. So it's that that kind of lump of nostalgia is kind

[53:43] of waving along a lot of these sort of late 80s, early 90s bands. The pin was a sensory overload,

[53:52] right? You want to talk about a world under glass. It's the ultimate rock concert. It was pretty

[53:58] big deals. So what are what I'd say sensory overload? What are we talking about? Hot rails. Those

[54:05] are basically the rails on either side of the play field, but now they illuminate. Yeah, those

[54:11] rails are there to kind of keep the play field from bending and warping, but they've gone and put

[54:15] like these blinky LEDs on top. No, it's pretty smart idea. They're in the rails. They're hot rails.

[54:22] The spinners were like guitar picks. That's pretty smart. The pop bumpers have like little symbols on

[54:29] them. So when they pop, they like look like their drums. It had a bass guitar upper play field and

[54:35] ball lock. Right? It had wire forms. You forgot the coolest thing. What's that? Drumsticks.

[54:43] Can you forget? Drumsticks. You go up the ramp and then on to drumsticks. On the LEDs.

[54:49] On the other is the collectors. The collectors editions, those are signed by the drummer.

[54:57] Yeah, that's yeah, that's the other thing they had three editions of this. You had the LE,

[55:02] the CE. You also had the, what do they call it? The classic or I can't remember what they called it.

[55:09] They keep changing the names and every manufacturer maybe, but it was the final time they would have

[55:16] the cheaper version. The cheaper version didn't have the upper play field. Yeah, so they took off

[55:21] that bass guitar upper play field and kind of the weird ramp on the left side. They kind of

[55:27] removed that. Now when I was there in the factory, they talked about this that they sold,

[55:35] it was something ridiculous, like 50 of them are like a ridiculously low number of those.

[55:42] I have played that standard edition. That was the one that I had played. Yeah, and at that point,

[55:47] they decided like, yeah, we're not going to do that addition anymore. We get because nobody's buying

[55:52] them pretty much because they noticed that nobody is putting those in an arcade. Yeah, they pretty

[55:58] much said like the versions of that like Waka, they almost sold none. Almost nothing. It wasn't worth it.

[56:07] They are the true LE's. They're the true LE's. They're a home, they make home market pinball machines.

[56:14] They are not arcade like the arcades that have them are like the big arcades that can afford that and

[56:20] want to have the draw of a Jersey Jack pinball machine. But their market is not the arcade market.

[56:28] The arcade market is dominated by a Stern Pro. So stop trying to compete with them. You have the

[56:35] flyer up. And is it me or the flippers not aligned at the bottom? Yeah, in the picture. Yeah.

[56:42] That would try to be nuts. That would not get by me. If I was proofreading, I'd be like retake it,

[56:46] Photoshop it, fix that. Yeah, it's a cool pin. I like it. It's a standard body. It's got lots of

[56:52] stuff in it. It's very fun. But man, it is like a vomit of color and code. Multi-balls just start

[57:01] randomly. Multi-ball, yes, they just start randomly. It's great. Well, they're not right. Like you've

[57:04] done something to do it, but it just they just I don't know what I did. It just happens. And it has

[57:09] the worst plunge I have ever seen. I like doing the thing, which is you get into a song

[57:17] and you just play it all the way to the end. Because you can get out of the song and take like

[57:23] a point total cash out. But if you go all the way through, if you make it, you can get the

[57:29] and you hit the last shot, you get the you goes right into another song. You get like the encore,

[57:34] I think it's called. Yeah. So and you pick like a good song, basically something from

[57:39] appetite for destruction and you're you're you're Chinese democracy. No, you don't pick anything

[57:44] from Chinese democracy. Not even that one song. And if you suck during the song, you'll actually

[57:49] start to get booed. If you're not hitting the shots, you will start to get booed. There's like a meter,

[57:53] you need to keep it above a certain, you know, level of the meter. I always thought that if you get

[57:59] boot off stage, they should have played the clip from I can't remember. It was a Kansas City

[58:06] where Axel he jumps in the crowd to go after the guy at the camera. And then he gets up the stage,

[58:13] he'll fix this layman security. I'm out of here and he just throws the mic down and leaves. That's

[58:17] what they should have done. Played that clip. If you failed. It's kind of like the old guitar hero

[58:22] or rock band games that you played on Xbox 360 or like the PlayStation 3. They were it was it's

[58:28] really smart. It's really cool. But I'll tell you that that that this is I would say either the

[58:36] end of this middle era this or the or maybe just the slight beginning of the next one. Like this is

[58:41] a demarcation point. Yeah, they had a hit game. Like that sold a ton and their timing was perfect

[58:48] because it was during. Gov it. Yeah, people had money. Yeah. And they were going to spend it.

[58:54] They weren't taking vacations. They weren't going to restaurants. So they were building up cash.

[58:58] And they could not make enough of these fast enough. So what does Slash say about working with

[59:08] Jersey Jack pinball the slash. Well, he's buddies with Eric Manier now, I believe they they

[59:13] converse all the time. Slash has it's been a very fulfilling experience working with Jersey Jack

[59:18] on the new guns and roses not in this lifetime pinball machine. Jersey Jack pinball games are some of

[59:23] the most unique and beautiful pins ever made. And I'm honored to have been able to work with their

[59:28] brilliant team to design one of the most original and exciting rock and roll pins ever produced.

[59:32] This game was a big deal and it is a good game. It's a great game for those people that are getting

[59:38] into pinball. It's a very accessible machine. They feel like they're doing things really quickly.

[59:43] It's very flashy and good. But I feel like it has a little bit of I feel like this game is all

[59:49] sizzle in no state. But you know what? Doesn't matter what we say they it was a rousing success.

[59:55] It probably still their biggest seller on this Harry Potter, which we'll talk about. Passes it.

[01:00:01] It and assets talk about assets. I mean, I remember when I played it,

[01:00:06] living like dies on there like how do they do that? That's like a Paul McCarty song. How do they

[01:00:10] get the rights to that? But it's in there. It's easy. They talk to Slash and slash gets on the

[01:00:15] phone with Paul McCarty and says, yo, I want to use your song. Is that a problem? Nope. Okay. Done.

[01:00:21] There you go. Unbelievable. There's another huge change and shift at this time. And that Steve

[01:00:28] Richie joining Jersey Jack pinball. He was over at Stern pinball. You know, he did Star Wars.

[01:00:35] He did Game of Thrones. He did Led Zeppelin. He's not having the greatest time. I don't think

[01:00:42] over there. Oh, you forgot black night sort of rage. He liked that. But yeah, he wasn't crazy

[01:00:47] about Led Zeppelin. He really wanted Star Wars to have it and they couldn't get it. Yeah. He became

[01:00:52] slowly a little more unhappy. So in 2010, Jack spoke to Steve about coming to Jersey Jack pinball.

[01:01:01] And he couldn't quite get a deal together. But then by 2021, he was able to get some movement.

[01:01:08] Remember 2010, Steve is he's not working for anyone because that was after they fired

[01:01:15] everyone at Jersey at Stern. And before he got rehired in 2011, because I believe he started

[01:01:23] at back at Stern around March of 2011, because that's where he announced it at the Texas pinball

[01:01:29] festival. So exactly. You know, what does Jack say about getting Steve to join? Steve is not

[01:01:37] joining the JJP team because of what he has done. But for what he will do, we believe his,

[01:01:43] you believe his best games are ahead of him. Now the funny thing is what it was interesting is

[01:01:49] for those who know the story, I guess Pat Lawler and Steve Richie did not necessarily get along.

[01:01:55] Especially Williams, they got along to get along. They were two of the main teams kind of

[01:01:59] go and add each other trying to make the best games. So what? So Pat Lawler says, I'm thrilled to be

[01:02:05] able to work with Steve again. Some of the greatest games that pinball history happened when the two

[01:02:09] of us work together and collaborated on a daily basis. The innovative creative environment at JJP

[01:02:16] will enable Steve to have fun, dream and build great things. Our entire team of creators welcomes

[01:02:22] Mr. Richie to JJP. Like this was a big deal, right? This is like the legend, Steve Richie, given up

[01:02:28] a cushy job where he releases a pin like every other year. Yeah. Do you remember what he is working

[01:02:33] on when he quit? I do. He was working on James Bond. James Bond. I wonder what that would look like.

[01:02:39] Probably would be just as good if not worse. So here's the thing. Okay.

[01:02:48] These guys get along to get along. They're very competitive with the two of them. Richie used to

[01:02:53] crap on Lawler all the time. But I think Pat is correct that the creative environment at JJP

[01:03:02] is probably something a little bit more along the lines of what Steve Richie prefers.

[01:03:08] I think at Stern, Steve Richie was told no a lot. And I think at Jersey Jack, Steve Richie is told,

[01:03:16] yes, or keep going more. Well, what does Steve say? I'm very excited to begin a new gaming

[01:03:22] adventure at Jersey Jack pinball. I've known Jack for more than 30 years and I'm delighted that we

[01:03:26] will be working together. It's going to be awesome. I'm also looking forward to working up with a

[01:03:31] talented team at JJP, many of whom are already friends and colleagues, i.e. X Williams people.

[01:03:37] My goal will be to design and build the best games we can possibly create. So we're moving into

[01:03:42] a new era. But one of the issues with this new era is that we've got Pat Lawler and Steve Richie,

[01:03:50] who have been in the industry for like 40 years. You know, we got Eric Minier, who's the new

[01:03:57] blood. The thing is you need to Steve Richie and a Pat Lawler to work with these younger groups to

[01:04:02] kind of bring them in. And we're talking about like Keith Ellwyn and those guys in a couple episodes

[01:04:06] ago and how George Gomez and John Borg, they're kind of working with the next generation.

[01:04:14] Jersey Jack's got to do the same thing. And I think Steve Richie and Pat Lawler, two of the really

[01:04:18] good ones to help train the next generation. The rumor was around the time that Jersey Jack signed

[01:04:25] the contract for pirates of the Caribbean with Disney. They also signed a contract with Pixar

[01:04:33] for Toy Story. Are you a Toy Story person? Have you seen Toy Story? Do you enjoy Toy Story?

[01:04:40] I haven't seen any of the Toy Story. Good Lord, man.

[01:04:44] Sorry. But the rumor is yes, they had the Toy Story license, but then they got the Wonka license.

[01:04:49] So Pat started working on that first. So by the time they got to the Toy Story license,

[01:04:58] Disney was making Toy Story 4 and insisted that that that would be what the game would be Toy Story 4.

[01:05:05] Disney Pixar's Toy Story 4, specifically Disney Pixar. It's the licensed animated film,

[01:05:12] probably one of the greatest animated franchises of all time. Toy Story, the first Toy Story film is

[01:05:20] like a demarcation in my life. Toy Story 3 is a demarcation in my life. Toy Story 4. It's okay.

[01:05:31] It's two not two great. I hear everyone say one in three all the time. It's two kind of a

[01:05:36] weak link. Two is good. Two is a little bit of the first one. More of the same. Still very good.

[01:05:43] But it's not like the like Toy Story 3 is like right up there with like citizen came.

[01:05:50] Okay. Like it is so good. Toy Story 5 is coming out in 2026.

[01:05:57] So the thing is, okay, when Toy Story came out, I was of the age where it's like, you know,

[01:06:03] that I was around the age of the character in the film. Little bit older, but I was like,

[01:06:09] oh, this is like what it was like when I was a kid. And then when Toy Story 3 rolled around,

[01:06:15] I was like in university. It's all about that film is all about sort of moving on from childhood.

[01:06:22] And how sad that that is. Toy Story 4 is more about like mental health, which is good.

[01:06:29] And Toy Story 5, I think, is now about my guess is that it's all about sort of how kids don't play

[01:06:35] with toys anymore. Now it's all screens. So it'll be it's the franchise is following my life,

[01:06:42] which is why I think it holds so close to me. I don't know if we want Toy Story 4. So this is

[01:06:48] 2022 Pat Lawler, John Yosey and Pixar on the art mechanics by a new fellow Michael Dorn.

[01:06:56] Or sorry. No, no, Peter D'Ono, no, no. Wurf did not do the mechanics on this game.

[01:07:00] Peter Dorn, Chris Talko, Nick Jensen, Sound by O God, unlock audio again.

[01:07:09] Lock audio, yes. Sean Paul DeWinn on animation. We've got software by Joe Katz as the lead here,

[01:07:15] Duncan Brown, Ted Estes, Bill Grup and JT Harkey and a little bit of Keith P. Johnson on there.

[01:07:22] Bill Grup from Williams is now a Jersey Jack. Is this Pat Lawler swan song?

[01:07:27] Kind of the rumors had kind of come out that this was his last pinball machine.

[01:07:31] Yeah, and that turned out to be true. And it did turn out to be true. I mean, the guys, it is,

[01:07:35] what, 70s? Early 70s? 70s. You know, like I'm sure he loves building pinball machines and all that

[01:07:41] stuff. But I mean, like he probably wants to like spend time with grandkids or great grandkids.

[01:07:47] Like, you know, again, we'll wind us back a little bit. This is based on 2019's Pixar Toy Story 4,

[01:07:55] which was a great film. I really enjoyed it. This is set directly after the third film,

[01:08:00] where we follow Woody and Buzz Lightyear as the pair go on a road trip with Bonnie,

[01:08:08] who creates a new friend, Forky. Forky. Who is a spork made from recycled materials in her art class?

[01:08:16] Meanwhile, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep, who disappeared after the first film,

[01:08:23] and must decide where his loyalties and his heart lie with his friends or his new lady friend.

[01:08:31] It grossed a billion dollars, scored 97 on Rotten Tomatoes. Like its predecessor, this film

[01:08:37] received absolute critical acclaim. Praise for its story, his humor, its emotional depth,

[01:08:44] its musical score, its animation, its vocal performances. It is an awesome film.

[01:08:50] But Toy Story 4, come on. Like, I don't know, man. Did you hear this rumor? So apparently,

[01:08:58] I had this total speculation corner here, right? I had heard this. I don't know if it's true.

[01:09:04] If you know if it's true, send me an email, silverballcroniclesgmail.com,

[01:09:09] that when J.J.P. was negotiating with Disney.

[01:09:13] Renegotiating the license of Toy Story after the Pirates No Assets thing.

[01:09:19] I had heard that J.J.P. after the blow-up of Pirates Not Having Assets,

[01:09:26] went back to Disney to do some re-negotiation because apparently they did not have the assets

[01:09:33] for Toy Story. And during this re-negotiation, J.J.P. and Pixar had discussed the fact that there

[01:09:42] is a brand new Toy Story project. So, of course, J.J.P. would take the newest property

[01:09:52] so that they could have all the assets and the newest property, which was a guaranteed smash,

[01:09:59] as we know it, ended up being that. As long as they had, there's a snake in my boot call out,

[01:10:04] I think that I'm happy. Did they make the right decision, do you think?

[01:10:08] Oh, they didn't have a choice. That's what they actually said. There was a Twitch stream,

[01:10:14] a gameplay stream, where one of the Acturzy Jacked employees actually said, Disney said, we have to do

[01:10:20] four. I don't think he was supposed to say that because they had not sent that any other place,

[01:10:26] but yeah, I kind of believe that. The other thing here is that the limited edition is now $12,000.

[01:10:34] And the collector's edition, $15,000. And there was no standard edition. Since nobody was buying

[01:10:42] the standard edition. So, this is the first game almost completely developed under the new

[01:10:47] manufacturing in Chicago regime. It has been designed in Chicago. It's Pat Lawler Swan Song.

[01:10:55] This is a demarcation point. So, you've got the smash hit of guns and roses that just sold

[01:11:02] like gangbusters, which was made in Chicago. But it was sort of still under that old kind of

[01:11:08] mixture. The game design of this. There was no real major knockout toy.

[01:11:14] No, it had less stuff than, it seemed like it had less stuff than its previous games because

[01:11:17] he had the big iPad. They had this ridiculous looking iPad screen. So, Pat Lawler's thing is,

[01:11:23] how can we add more instruction? How can we put things on the play field? I get the idea of putting

[01:11:28] a big screen down there to show you what to do and what to shoot. He also had a big screen in Wonka.

[01:11:34] And he had a smaller screen in dialed in. This machine does not feel like a Jersey Jack pinball

[01:11:45] machine. It's missing the J.J. P. Niss in my opinion because it's missing a lot of that jam-packed

[01:11:52] toys. It's fun. It shoots fine. But when you look at it, it's kind of... There's no excitement.

[01:12:00] Would you agree? I liked it. I liked it. I like it too. I thought they were going to sell

[01:12:06] thousands of these. It's so decent. I mean, as long as you turn the music off,

[01:12:13] the callouts are good, but the music is not good. I thought they were going to sell thousands of

[01:12:19] these things. When I played this and shot this, I'm like, this game shoots great. It looks great.

[01:12:25] It's got all the assets. It's got all the callouts I want. It's beautiful. But when I look,

[01:12:33] but I think when people looked at it, they said, where's the J.J. P? Like, I mean, they got Tim Allen

[01:12:40] to do the voice of Buzz Lightyear for callouts. Canna Reeves is in it. Come on. Yeah. They got Jim

[01:12:46] Hanks, whose Tom Hanks's brother does all Tom Hanks's voice work. Yep, because he can't be bothered.

[01:12:52] Any pots who did bow peeps? She did the callouts on the CE specifically. The topper is awesome.

[01:12:58] I thought they were going to sell thousands of these. Who said they didn't? They... I don't know,

[01:13:04] man. I don't think they did. I think they were disappointed in the sales. So they moved on to the next

[01:13:10] pin. So what are we going to do? We're going to bring back the guy who puts everything in a pin

[01:13:15] machine. Eric Minier. And we're going to make Godfather. 2023. This is a licensed drama film.

[01:13:24] Again, one of the greatest films ever made. But like, is that really a pinball theme? No, it's not.

[01:13:32] Unlike sopranos, which was a good one for a good theme for pinball. Art by Christopher

[01:13:37] Franci. So he had left Stern after... Was it Monsters? Most Monsters after Beatles. Maybe. Yes.

[01:13:46] So anyway, around that time, we got the same sort of crew here. Music and sound is uncredited.

[01:13:52] It was probably unlock audio. Mechanics are uncredited, but it's probably Eric Minier and a team

[01:13:57] around him. Animation jump all to win. Software, Keith Johnson, Duncan Brown, Ted Estes, Bill

[01:14:04] Grubb, Joe Katz. So we touched on the theme. This is Godfather based on the 1972 American

[01:14:13] Epic crime film by Francis Ford Coppola. The film stars an ensemble cast, including Marlon

[01:14:19] Brando in probably one of his greatest roles. Al Pacino, James Conn, Richard Constantinelo,

[01:14:27] Robert DuVal, Diane Keaton, unbelievable. The team here. It's the first installment in the Godfather

[01:14:35] trilogy, which is Chronicles the Carlyone family, which is and it's Patriarch Vito Carlyone,

[01:14:42] who is Marlon Brando, and the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Carlyone, Carlyone

[01:14:49] by Al Pacino and the reluctant family of outsiders with this sort of ruthless mafia boss.

[01:14:56] The film itself is not a big action epic. No, we're not talking John Wick,

[01:15:02] fighting stuff here. It's a lot of talking, amazing talking, and engaging talking,

[01:15:09] but it's kind of hard to make a pinball machine at a talking.

[01:15:13] So, you touched on that. So, Pranos had the same problem, right?

[01:15:17] No, so Pranos was great. So, it's an HBO show with a lot of talking.

[01:15:23] A lot of swearing though. How do you make this into something?

[01:15:27] How do you make the code out of a lot of talking? Well, the one thing they did is they got as many

[01:15:33] assets as you're going to get. I mean, they got they got Marlon Brando's in there. They got

[01:15:39] and they got Al Pacino in there, who I guess usually doesn't lend his likeness or whatever.

[01:15:44] I mean, they got a ton of, they have all the assets you could want for Godfather.

[01:15:49] They have a Marlon Brando sculpt for goodness sake.

[01:15:52] Yes. The question is, is it a good thing for pinball? How do you approach it?

[01:15:59] It's approached. Basically, you're going through all the families and all that.

[01:16:05] It's, I don't know. I don't know if it was a good theme to do for pinball.

[01:16:09] You know, you've got the different burrows of New York and Manhattan. You go on missions,

[01:16:15] you go on hit missions, you go for for fellows, you play through various scenes in the film.

[01:16:21] There's hits. Like, I think they did the best job they could. The playfield itself

[01:16:28] is pretty good. It's a standard body. There's three flippers. For some reason, it just didn't

[01:16:34] hit. It just did not take off, I think, in a way. 200 different ball paths or something like that.

[01:16:39] Yeah, it's like, there's all these ball divers. I am all about ball divers, man. You know that.

[01:16:44] This is a game for you then. There's diversion going on all over the place.

[01:16:48] I played this game and I really like this game. I really like this game. I think it's best part.

[01:16:55] Christopher Franchise art. This is gorgeous. The fact that this was the first game

[01:17:02] that they had their new driver board or modified driver board with the stronger flippers. One of the

[01:17:09] things that's always been criticized at Jersey Jack is their flippers. So this was actually,

[01:17:14] a lot of people think it's out in John was the first one. This was actually the first one

[01:17:18] to have the stronger flippers. I think this game is criminally underrated.

[01:17:23] I think the topper is criminally loud. So the topper. Let's talk about this. Come on. Come on.

[01:17:29] The sea topper. Unbelievable. Yes. So on the top there's two machine gun guys.

[01:17:35] Right. They got their Tommy guns that you picture when you see a mafia boss and they've got

[01:17:40] like a little coil and at certain times the coil will start to fire. It's a knocker.

[01:17:45] The same rate as a Tommy gun. Yes. Yes. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable.

[01:17:53] It's a knocker coil. Just imagine that. Oh my god. So the godfather,

[01:17:58] this is the 50th anniversary. The art is stunning. The game I think is criminally underrated.

[01:18:06] I think it shoots well. Sure, it might not be a theme for pinball, but they didn't do godfather

[01:18:13] three. You know what I mean? Like they did the godfather. Look at that UI. Look at the picture of the

[01:18:19] UI. That's how you use a larger monitor. The user interface is what if you wonder what UI means.

[01:18:25] So kind of like what burrows are you in? How much money do you have? How many jobs have you done?

[01:18:30] The funny thing is that you go out on these hits or you collect members to your gang to go on these

[01:18:37] adventures. And the people in the back glass are Jersey jet like the animation like or they're

[01:18:44] what do they call them? Like the picture that they've got when you get arrested. What do they call that?

[01:18:50] Mug shots. Mug shots. These mug shots. It's like Christopher Franchi, but it's like

[01:18:55] Christoph Franchetti. Yeah. And they've got I think Eric Minier's a character and and Jack is a

[01:19:01] character like it's awesome. Criminally underrated. Is it a theme for pinball? Probably not. Is it still fun?

[01:19:08] Absolutely. The callouts are all I think the same guy. He does like all the different voices.

[01:19:15] They do have clips for the movies. But they don't really make a whole lot of sense.

[01:19:18] No, not to the story they tell really. It's more of a generic mobster theme with godfather.

[01:19:25] Kind of jammed on it. Yeah, kind of. So how about this one? This one you know very, very well.

[01:19:30] Yes, very, very well. We're talking about Elton John. This is the licensed musical theme.

[01:19:38] 2023 designed by Steve Richie. His first Jersey Jack pinball machine. Art by Christopher Franchi.

[01:19:47] Uncredited mechanics and sound. Jean Paul de Winon animation. Software by Bill Grupp

[01:19:54] and Duncan Brown. So we're seeing that the teams are being built out now. A few team members that

[01:20:00] kind of were on a larger team. Now they're breaking out more of that stern pinball style. Right?

[01:20:06] Well, Bill Crop. Bill Crop the head software guy is former Williams. Duncan Brown is also former

[01:20:12] Williams employee. They're bringing on enough people to build out teams now. Where before they were

[01:20:17] kind of it was the same kind of team. So we've moved into this new era. This is and this is

[01:20:24] the first pinball machine by Steve Richie. How do you think he did first of all? Just high level.

[01:20:30] Um, I mean, if you show me the play field and say what designer did this, I'd say Steve Richie.

[01:20:36] Why? What makes you say that? Because it looks like a Steve Richie layout. It's his three flipper

[01:20:42] side ramp layout. He likes to do with the warp ramp. I'll just call it the warp ramp. Three drops

[01:20:47] in the center. He loves that too. Um, there are some differences. Like like the shot doesn't,

[01:20:54] it doesn't go right into the in lane when you hit the one ramp. It actually drops in front of it.

[01:20:58] The flipper, which I like. This game was the first Jersey Jack game I ever saw or played where it

[01:21:04] felt like a stern slash Williams game as far as how fast it played. It was like completely

[01:21:12] different dimension I had entered. We're all the sudden. The slingshots like a toy story if

[01:21:19] everyone remembers they're they're so weak. They're terrible. That's the other thing they did.

[01:21:23] They finally went to 50 vault slingshots, which I actually did that. I believe on Godfather,

[01:21:29] but on this game it like it's very obvious. Everything's is dialed up to 100. It's it's

[01:21:35] or what is it? It's a dial to 11. It's too. Yeah, just when this was at Expo just looking at the

[01:21:46] they had the TV screens over the game so you can watch it just watching it. You could tell

[01:21:52] how fast it played. It was amazing. I love this game. I've only played it

[01:21:58] a dozen times. Every time I play it, I'm like, man, this game is so much fun. I like Elton John.

[01:22:06] I think Elton John is a legend. He is Sir Elton. Get this Hercules John. It was actually who's

[01:22:14] actually born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in 1947. He's the British songwriter and pianist.

[01:22:23] He is music and showmanship is unlike anybody else. He is something special and will be remembered

[01:22:33] forever. But I don't know if he is pinball music, but when I play this pin, I'm like, you know what?

[01:22:41] He's pinball music. He's pinball music. It's unbelievable. Because like when you hear it at first,

[01:22:45] you're like, I don't know, man. Is he going to be able to pull off? It's like it's playing your song.

[01:22:49] Like, come on. Really? How is this? Benny in the Jets. Do you think Benny in the Jets is?

[01:22:53] Everyone, we all knew this was going to be the game. Jersey Jack has never been that

[01:22:59] great at hiding what the titles are going to be. And that's, I heard this a year and a half.

[01:23:05] Like when Steve went there, that this was going to be the game. And I'm really another Elton John

[01:23:11] game. Like, that can't be true. Because we had the brown dirt cowboy back in the day.

[01:23:16] We had that already. I mean, is it their best game? It's my favorite game of theirs. I don't know

[01:23:23] if you want to say it's their best game. We haven't got to what a lot of people are probably going

[01:23:28] to think there's their best game. Steve struggled with putting stuff in his pinball machine at stern.

[01:23:35] This is like if Williams had still existed, this is what they would make. That's what it felt like.

[01:23:41] You got a beautiful piano lock in the back with an Elton John that plays his hand.

[01:23:46] Electronic Elton John. His head moves. Yes, head moves. His arms move.

[01:23:51] An animatronic alligator or crocodile, I should say, crocodile rock. We have a spinning tiny dancer.

[01:23:58] Girl on a pole. Yeah, you got a cool rocket sculpt. You got a, you know, electro luminescent wiring

[01:24:08] on the ramps. You got ramps everywhere. The super long habbitrell and its only purposes when

[01:24:14] you hit it in the rocket, it just fires it until and it just looks cool. That's it. That's

[01:24:18] its only time it's every. It's a great game in every way. Steve Richie with a budget, basically.

[01:24:24] Oh, did I mention Elton John's actually in the game? Do we mention that? Yes, he does call outs.

[01:24:29] He does call outs and he's, you see him in the game at various points. And can we also talk about

[01:24:34] something special here? The value. I'm going to talk about Elton John has an Egot. Do you know

[01:24:43] what that is? I don't know what that is. That is that he has an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony.

[01:24:50] Oh, can you feel the love tonight from the Lion King? Yeah, that's probably the Oscar.

[01:24:55] 27 people have Egot's as of the time of this recording. Oh, so that is something special.

[01:25:01] This guy is pretty great. Glam Rock, I think, is very much... He was a big fan of T-Rex

[01:25:11] and took a lot of that. Was it Mark Bowlin? I believe it was his name of T-Rex. He took a lot of

[01:25:16] stuff from him with the whole, his wardrobe and all that. So, okay, let's go back to the topper.

[01:25:22] So the limited edition topper is just a piece of flat plastic, but it is gorgeous.

[01:25:27] Yeah, but it loosens up constantly though and annoys me. It has wing nuts in it that keep getting

[01:25:32] loose. I got to put lock tight on him or something. So, what about the CE topper?

[01:25:38] The CE topper is ridiculous. It's big, got two screens on either side of like this...

[01:25:43] Like LCD screens. It's got, yeah, and it's got a projector. And they were, I believe they even

[01:25:48] said they were left over from the toy story screens. But the projector, it projects onto your ceiling.

[01:25:56] And like the higher the ceiling, you have the better it looks. Because it's got more, more space.

[01:26:01] More spread. Yeah. Yeah, I wish I prefer the art package of the LE, but I wish I could have the topper

[01:26:08] on my LE. It's awesome. It has most of the video assets of actual concert footage and stuff

[01:26:15] are on the topper. They actually don't have a ton of concert footage that's used on the main

[01:26:22] display. So the craziest thing, the craziest thing is Chris Franchise art. It is unbelievable.

[01:26:34] Him leaving Stern and ending up at Jersey Jack. What a huge loss for Stern. Because these are two

[01:26:41] of the most absolute stunning art packages I have ever seen. Well, remember, he did the LE.

[01:26:49] The platinum was done and it's not called the CE on this one either. They called the platinum

[01:26:53] edition for some reason. And then they went back to the other naming convention with the next game,

[01:26:57] which I don't understand. I guess it was because platinum, platinum albums, you know, you've got one of

[01:27:03] these. Of course I do. I wouldn't be gushing about it this much. You enjoy it. We're spending a lot of

[01:27:10] time on this because it's spending too much time on it. But yes, yes. What about the next follow-up?

[01:27:17] This one had me excited. Avatar the Battle for Pandora.

[01:27:23] This is the licensed sci-fi epic film. There's a whole series now or a whole universe,

[01:27:30] if you will. This is designed by a newcomer in September of 24, Mark Sidon. There's a new art

[01:27:37] person on this one. Leah Fask. Sound is by Stemich. Animation Jean Paul de Wynn. Software by

[01:27:49] Jason Allen, Keith Johnson and Taylor Snyder based on the Avatar film series, which is the American

[01:27:57] epic sci-fi media franchise created by James Cameron. Avatar is set in the mid 22nd century

[01:28:06] on Pandora, a lush, habitable moon. The film's central conflict is between the Indigenous Navi

[01:28:15] and the humans who look to harvest the vast natural resources of Pandora. The film invokes themes

[01:28:22] of family, environmentalism, corporate greed and colonialism. Did you see Avatar? No. God.

[01:28:30] Avatar is from 2009. It holds the record for the highest-grossing motion picture of all time

[01:28:37] with a $2.9 billion box office that was followed up with Avatar, the Way of the Water, which was released

[01:28:45] in 2022 after many delays because they didn't have the technology available for like 20 years

[01:28:56] to make motion capture underwater. It had a $2.3 billion box office. The latest installment, Avatar,

[01:29:06] Fire and Lash was released on December 19, 2025. See, you've never seen Avatar. No. Do you remember

[01:29:17] the 3D revolution in theaters? Um, kind of. I mean, I know they plugged it a lot. The spectacle

[01:29:27] for Avatar was that it was a 3D movie like no other 3D movie before it. So before 2009,

[01:29:36] 3D movies were not really a big thing. They were like every now and then- Not even in the 50s?

[01:29:43] No, but I mean, they're every now and then there'd be a 3D movie, but this was like

[01:29:48] unlike anything before it. Okay. Is it as good as it is good as Friday, the 13th,

[01:29:53] 3D? Right. So that's kind of what I'm getting at, right? It was like, or what was there-

[01:29:58] It was exactly a piranha? Wasn't there a 3D piranha film? Oh, I think there was. I just remember the

[01:30:04] the Friday, the 13th, one where he fires the uh, what is it? Not an arrow. It's like a gun. He

[01:30:11] fires the projectile, whatever, and it comes right at you because it's 3D. And there was that

[01:30:16] awesome uh, Muppets thing at Hollywood Studios, which was Jim Henson's last Muppets thing.

[01:30:25] And it was a 3D kind of event, right? But 3D movie- it was not a thing. Now 3D is like

[01:30:32] like every other movie or every movie has a 3D version of it. The the draw for Avatar was

[01:30:39] Come See James Cameron who hasn't done anything since Titanic. He spent hundreds of millions of

[01:30:45] dollars to make this 3D movie. And when I sat in that theater and I saw the 3D like depth

[01:30:53] that was create like windows and behind the window a person holding something and then behind

[01:30:58] them was like a screen that had animations and that is why it did like three billion dollars at

[01:31:04] the box office. James Cameron, we all know him from what Terminator 2, Terminator Aliens, Abyss,

[01:31:14] Piranha 2, all of his movies all kind of have the same kind of cheesy bit of writing, military

[01:31:22] theme kind of guys, but they're all pretty, they're all pretty great movies like he doesn't really

[01:31:27] make a kind of a bad move. It's not Godfather, but it is still- He didn't- Piranha 2 is pretty

[01:31:32] entertaining. I think you should watch the Avatar movies. I think you should. They're good.

[01:31:39] My daughter, huge Avatar fan, which I had no idea. The first real film that she saw and can remember

[01:31:45] was the way of the water. I took her to that movie because I couldn't get a babysitter so her and I

[01:31:50] went to it when she was probably too young to see it and she is so excited for everything I have

[01:31:56] in the Avatar, which is I think kind of funny because she's not a nerdy kid. It's pretty weird.

[01:32:01] Maybe she just likes blue. So who's Mark Sidon? He did the Metroid pinball home brew. Yeah, so he

[01:32:06] was kind of in the community building this Metroid pinball which went over well. I never played it,

[01:32:12] did you? I think I played it. You must have one of the expos. Yeah, you must have. Now I met Mark

[01:32:18] Sidon at Fantastic One Year and I spent a great deal of time trying to get the theme of his next

[01:32:26] machine out of it. He did not take the bait. I believe he's a New England guy so that makes sense.

[01:32:32] Everybody thought he was on Harry Potter, but I would have never thought that. There was not

[01:32:38] going to be anyone on Harry Potter other than Eric Manier. So how did Mark get into J.J. P as a

[01:32:46] designer? Well, Mark says at some point in 2021, I got a Facebook message from Eric Manier and he

[01:32:52] was like, Hey, do you want to talk pinball? He called me up and we talked for about an hour.

[01:32:58] Pinball stuff and my design work on Metroid and at the end of the call he's like, so would you be

[01:33:03] interested in any role at Jersey Jack pinball? And I was like, I want to be a game designer. So I

[01:33:08] ended up putting together like 64 pages of pictures, descriptions because you know a normal resume

[01:33:14] doesn't exist for pinball. When this pin was released, I was pretty excited because like I said,

[01:33:20] my daughter loves Avatar. I really enjoy the Avatar films. They're not high art, but it is pretty

[01:33:26] cool. Not a dream theme, but a theme nonetheless that I think is pretty awesome.

[01:33:34] What do you think? So we went back to LE and CE for this model.

[01:33:39] What were your first impressions? Yeah, which yeah,

[01:33:43] we were confused. It's not Pandora Platinum. It's CE. We're going back to that.

[01:33:48] I thought the under play field play fields, two of them. That was interesting.

[01:33:56] Yeah, so you shoot under the play field. You go to one kind of part and it's like an underplay field

[01:34:02] where you battle a submarine and then you can get to the other underplay field, which is like

[01:34:09] there's like a pop bumper and targets under there and then there's also a lock under play field

[01:34:15] law. It looks really cool. Yeah, it is it is Avatar. It is very blue. Most of the terminology in

[01:34:21] the game is Avatar terminology, which I guess this is setting. You can dial that back if you don't

[01:34:27] want it to be that Avatarie. Yeah, do you use all the terminology that if someone like me who

[01:34:33] has never seen Avatar would have zero clue what's going on or what they're talking about?

[01:34:37] It's got a lot of habit trails. Yep. All directions got ball deverted. It's got everything I want.

[01:34:42] To me, the highlight is the upper part of the play field is the most interesting part.

[01:34:47] The art is comic bookie cartoony. It's beautiful. No, I think it looks good. I have the banner.

[01:34:56] I have the banner and I think the banner looks great. I love it. I really do because I'm a big fan.

[01:35:02] Is it heavier than Hobbit? Someone needs to tell us. Email us. Yeah, we're not going to look

[01:35:07] that up or not doing any research on that. It has not been a big seller, right? I have no idea.

[01:35:14] They didn't help themselves because when they were trying to sell this is when Jack comes out and

[01:35:23] says that Harry Potter is the next game. Save your money. Don't buy anything else. And we're like,

[01:35:28] okay, probably shouldn't have said that. Like, okay. It's it did not sell great. I don't

[01:35:37] think. However, I'm disappointed that it did not does it shoot fine? Yes. Is it fun? Yes.

[01:35:45] Is it loaded? Yes. So we're moving into, I think, the latest era of Jersey Jack. Elton John is

[01:35:54] probably either the beginning or the end of the last era. Avatar is either the big is probably

[01:36:00] the beginning of the next one. We've got a new designer, much fresher ideas. We're in the

[01:36:07] new factory. We're factoring all that in. Stuff is packed again. We got more stuff in these

[01:36:13] machines. I'm disappointed that this machine did not get over the way I think it should have.

[01:36:20] And I think this game, along with Godfather, criminally underrated. Don't forget the topper.

[01:36:26] The topper is on the C.E. specifically. The C.E. Yes. It's got it's it's like the one they did for

[01:36:35] the Mandalorian, but much better. Peppers ghost effect. Where there's a piece of glass or

[01:36:42] plastic. And then behind it, there's like a it gets projected on. And then it looks like it's

[01:36:48] it looks like it's floating on a screen. It's huge too. It's it's it's you, Marcus. Yes. It's so

[01:36:55] big. Ridiculous. The one on the on the on the on the limited edition is like your standard sort of

[01:37:01] 3D plastic and flat thing. But this thing is unbelievable. The art again. Just beautiful. Like if

[01:37:09] I don't know why more people don't like this game. Do you like the uh do you like the coating on the

[01:37:14] the rails on the C.E. Look at the rails. Look what they did with the the art on the rails.

[01:37:20] Oh, so instead of just regular um you know colored coating, it looks like the skin of the Navi.

[01:37:28] It's got like the the different colored like almost like a like a tiger stripes. And I believe

[01:37:34] they said it was all hand done too. So like no two C.E.s are the same. It's so cool. And it has

[01:37:40] this bio luminescent lighting. What is bio luminescent lighting? Uh lights up in the dark. Yeah,

[01:37:47] it's like UV lights. It's UV. Yeah. So for the collectors, collectors edition, well there's

[01:37:54] there's UV on the the limited edition, but the collectors edition has even more. And they actually

[01:38:01] had to get the playfields specially made by another company because their usual playfield company

[01:38:06] could not do it to their satisfaction. So they actually have. So the C.E.s playfields are all made

[01:38:12] by a different company. It's it's so good that Jersey Jack is you know they've got Elton John,

[01:38:19] which is probably their next biggest hit after Guns and Roses. But it's such a good game

[01:38:25] by such a seasoned designer that it kind of is undercutting Avatar. And then Avatar is struggling

[01:38:33] a little bit. It's I think it needs more time to sort of percolate for people to to see how good

[01:38:38] it is. And then all of a sudden it's like hey your other dream theme Harry Potter is coming. I

[01:38:44] please don't spend any money. How many people are like Avatar fanatics as opposed to I think

[01:38:51] most of the 2.9 billion or whatever they've seen it they saw it probably once. I'm like God,

[01:38:57] that was cool. I don't know if they're hardcore Avatar psycho fans. I think that's what

[01:39:04] Avatar. Avatar did not go the way of Star Wars and has not gone the way of Harry Potter. Like

[01:39:12] everyone knows who Luke Skywalker is. They know how solo is etc. Even if they've never even seen

[01:39:18] Star Wars. Exactly. Avatar is great. I like Avatar. I enjoy Avatar. But I feel like Avatar is like

[01:39:27] if a corporation is like hey you have to like Avatar. Avatar is big. You know Avatar is amazing.

[01:39:37] You need to like Avatar. We're gonna make Avatar forever until it is Star Wars. You know I get it.

[01:39:44] It's sort of like feels like it's almost being forced on you as a franchise. I don't know maybe

[01:39:49] in 10 years maybe in 15 years it'll be different. Maybe it will actually be one of these franchises

[01:39:57] that hold such high regard. But we've touched on it. We've we've mentioned it a few times.

[01:40:05] Harry Potter is the next release. This is the culmination of everything. If you listen to Jack

[01:40:11] this is everything they work for from the start 2011 whenever when they started. This is like the

[01:40:17] culmination. This is it. This is the this is the ultimate license that everyone has wanted.

[01:40:24] Since I can remember to say they've been making the movies. Everyone has wanted this.

[01:40:29] And here it is. Full assets. We have everything. You could possibly want.

[01:40:36] And we're gonna try to put it in this game. So exciting. Harry Potter. I like Harry Potter. I'm not

[01:40:42] way in on Harry Potter like some people. I like Harry Potter. Like the films. I've been read you

[01:40:47] know I haven't read the books through but I'm working on the books. I like Harry Potter. It's not

[01:40:51] Star Wars for me. It's not. It's but for some people this is it. Yeah. This is this is the

[01:40:59] Star Wars of my generation. I've never seen any of the movies but I know who the three main kids are.

[01:41:05] Yeah. That's the thing right. That's how you know it's transcended. The game designed by Eric

[01:41:10] Minier. It's got engineering mechanics by Dan Lancheck and Nick Jensen software by Bill

[01:41:17] Grubb Duncan Brown, Joe Katz, electronics Eric Miller, Joe Ernst, Luna Silverfang,

[01:41:25] Silverfang and Will Mercado. Percado probably. Or Mercado. One of the other. Jean Paul DeWin on

[01:41:33] art animation. Jean Paul DeWin, Johnny Weagle, Olaf Gemmy and then the collector's edition cabinet.

[01:41:40] That's done by a special studio called Mina Lima which is tied into Harry Potter,

[01:41:49] you know, artwork, people that are nerds for Harry Potter. I guess know that name.

[01:41:53] And sound. Get this. Music. David Theill. He's back. They're not going to blow it with a s**t sound

[01:42:04] package. Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by the British author JK Rowling.

[01:42:12] These novels chronicle the young wizard Harry Potter and his friend Ron Weasley and Hermony Granger

[01:42:19] as they attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter through 1997 to 2007

[01:42:29] had an almost annual release of books. I remember these when I was a kid that when the Harry Potter

[01:42:37] book came out, the fervor amongst people in my high school and then those younger than me in

[01:42:44] middle school was unreal. It was a big big deal for these kids. That was when the film franchise

[01:42:55] came out slightly after that. Somewhere around 97 they started kind of thinking about moving them

[01:43:04] into a movie franchise. It was 2001 through 2011 that the films were released. They brought in a

[01:43:13] box office combined eight films at $7.7 billion. Some of the biggest directors and writers were

[01:43:23] working on those like Chris Columbus. Do you remember Chris Columbus? Yes. Yeah, he did like

[01:43:29] like Mrs. Doubtfire. He worked on Gremlins, Goonies. He's a big deal. The world they created was amazing.

[01:43:38] The direction, the screen right. It was all great. The films are as good as the books if not better.

[01:43:45] And that bred this amazing franchise. You can go to the Harry Potter world at Universal Studios

[01:43:53] in Orlando. There's three different worlds there now. It's something else. So it's a big franchise.

[01:44:02] How did Jersey Jack get this franchise? Well, lots of people are trying to get that license,

[01:44:09] including Joe Kamenkao, which I assume for Stern to make it. Yeah, so he did Batman 66 with Kapow. He

[01:44:16] did The Beatles, which was like by then the biggest most expensive license ever. Jack got the license

[01:44:21] and then Joe immediately posted on the internet that Jack got the license. Yeah, so he torpedoed that

[01:44:27] almost immediately. That's pretty petty. That is pretty petty. And then Jack said he had the

[01:44:34] Harry Potter people coming back to him like, what's this? Who's this? What's going on?

[01:44:39] Who's this Joe Kamenkao? But yeah, so we knew this was coming. It was not a

[01:44:45] less worst kept secret ever. Like everybody knew GNR was coming, but this was even worse than that.

[01:44:51] I think every Jersey Jack title, everyone's known what's coming. Yeah, they are, they're like a

[01:44:56] screen door and a submarine. It's brutal. I think somebody that worked there left and then they

[01:45:00] posted the next five games on Pinside or something. And that's how we got the list. But I think they

[01:45:06] finally ran out of those titles. So now it should be hopefully harder to figure out. Now, Eric Minier,

[01:45:13] one of those huge, huge Harry Potter nerds, I recall. Like this is a part of his history, a part of

[01:45:22] his life, his, his, him and his wife bonded over Harry Potter releases of books like this is a big

[01:45:30] part. So he, this is his theme and he is the right person to do it, I think. On a high level,

[01:45:36] what do you think? Uh, shoots really good. Art. Uh, art's fine. I know there was, there was some

[01:45:42] controversy with the whole AI. They did some AI was used with some of it, which made like the,

[01:45:48] the, what the dragon had, uh, an eye for an ear or something on the side of his head. Yeah,

[01:45:54] derp the magic dragon. Yeah, it looks fine. It looks fine. Um, and it's got, I assume everything in

[01:46:03] it a Harry Potter psycho would want. I mean, I haven't seen any of the movies, so I can't say,

[01:46:09] but I mean, whenever, when I was playing it, I don't, I don't know any of the terminology,

[01:46:14] any of the stuff that it references. So I think, I think you would really like these films,

[01:46:18] actually, right? I legitimately think you're good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. It is packed. We're not,

[01:46:24] whatever happened with Pat Lawler and his not packing stuff in the games is gone. He packed everything,

[01:46:30] except toy story. But yeah, this is packed. It, it has vertical upkickers. It has a rotating staircase

[01:46:36] with multiple ball paths. It's got wand, a wand ramp, which is similar to the G&R ramp with the

[01:46:46] drumsticks. It, it's got a cauldron where the ball falls. Someone's riding a, a broom. Someone's

[01:46:53] riding a broom. Yes, it's got an upper play field. It's got a car stuck in a wamping willow like,

[01:47:00] it's a great game. I have yet to shoot really. Yeah, it's, uh, it shoots good. Oh, I have no idea

[01:47:07] what to do. I just shoot the ball around and it was cool. My favorite part of the play field, of

[01:47:12] course, is the upper, the, what is it? Quidditch? Quidditch, which is, which is like the sport they play.

[01:47:18] All I know is I hit it up there and all I had to do is hit a couple loops and stuff and like, yeah,

[01:47:23] I could just stay up here for a while. It's got multiple shots up there. Yeah, but it was like,

[01:47:28] yeah, I, I like this thing here. It's cool. It's very good. Eric Minier's best game, I think.

[01:47:35] G&R was fine, but this has got something special. And it's not the theme. I think the, the pin

[01:47:41] itself is something special. Um, so hats off to Eric Minier. We don't have enough to talk about

[01:47:46] this because the code's not done. Well, that we can say there's, they went to an extra model with

[01:47:52] this because the other ones, they, they were back to the LE CE model or, well, unless you're

[01:48:02] John, then it's platinum. This one they have, what is it? The LE arcade and the wizard? Yeah. Yeah,

[01:48:08] yeah. I got to admit, yes. CE wizard and arcade instead of Ellie's called the wizard because they

[01:48:14] don't want it to be limited. And then they have the arcade of addition, which basically has the

[01:48:19] playfield is the same, but it just has less lights and less bling and stuff on it. And, and that

[01:48:24] one is for under 10k, I believe it's like $9,999. The CE, I think, is something pretty special.

[01:48:31] It's very expensive, but it is something special because it has that, and it has that mean

[01:48:36] Aleema art, which has it kind of each image kind of flows into something specific about that,

[01:48:43] that on the cabinet only, which is interesting. I think it'll be interesting if they did a different

[01:48:47] playfield for it. The wizard addition, beautiful. The collector's edition is a limited unlimited run.

[01:48:54] Do you want to talk about what an unlimited limited run is? What is it? They'll announce at some

[01:48:58] point when they'll stop making them. And that's, that'll be the limit. I believe, yes. This is

[01:49:03] the biggest license anyone's got in pinball for like, ever. I mean, it's probably Star Wars. So,

[01:49:09] they're gonna do, they sell as many of these as they possibly can. They're not gonna limit it

[01:49:15] in any way. They're gonna melt and they should. And you probably won't see the next Jersey Jack

[01:49:19] game for a while because of this. I think Jack himself in an interview said that, and it

[01:49:25] if one of his usual kind of backhanded stern jabs at how some companies have been making too many

[01:49:32] titles in the same year. And there's just too much. You should dial it back, which I took is

[01:49:38] you know, meaning stern. So, they're gonna be making this for a while. The arcade addition is

[01:49:44] nice, just because it is actually under 10k. And it has the same gameplay as the regular version,

[01:49:50] the other two versions. The interesting thing about this game, and I'll put this out here,

[01:49:56] when we went through all these titles we've gone through from Jersey Jack Part One to this,

[01:50:01] this episode, all the, the animations, the LCD animations have been Sean Paul to win or Sean

[01:50:08] Paul to win's team. And that's the thing. Originally, it was just Sean Paul to win. Over time,

[01:50:13] he has assembled a team of other Dutch artists who work on all these Jersey Jack games.

[01:50:20] And at the latest Dutch pinball open, which just happened a few weeks ago, he announced that he

[01:50:26] will be, he's leaving Jersey Jack. I think his exact words were after 14 years, I got to find

[01:50:33] something else to do. Something to that effect. But it sounds like his team will still be doing

[01:50:39] the Jersey Jack games. It's just he will not be involved anymore. But he was there from the

[01:50:45] beginning. So it's kind of a book end to the thing. He was there for the very start all the way

[01:50:50] up to this game. We've toured various eras with Jersey Jack pinball this episode, kind of moving

[01:50:57] from their first era into the second one where they were getting things situated into the third.

[01:51:04] And I guess we could say that Harry Potter is another demarcation point. And the beginning

[01:51:09] of a new era for J.J.P. Do you think it's hyperbole? Or do you think that this really is

[01:51:17] a big big point for Jersey Jack? Harry Potter is the culmination of the company. I mean, they said so.

[01:51:24] But are they are they are they is that sales or is that do you think that that's going to be a real

[01:51:29] thing? No, I think they feel this this was the ultimate license. This is this is what they work for.

[01:51:33] I'll usually get something like this. Yeah, to get the manufacturing in place, to get the artistry

[01:51:40] in place, to get the mechanics, the supply chain, the programming teams, I think that they have been

[01:51:47] building to this point. Did they know that that Harry Potter was the license that they would get?

[01:51:53] I don't think so. But this is what they were moving towards that they could make this type of

[01:51:58] license the biggest success possible. Jersey Jack is in a different market than Stern. They are not

[01:52:06] in the arcade market. They are in the home market. And it's taking them six or seven years to come

[01:52:14] to terms with that. They tried to compete with Stern on location play with things like the guns

[01:52:22] and roses standard edition. After 2020, they knew that they had to sell more exciting and more

[01:52:30] complex games than any other manufacturer. And this succession planning with their designers has

[01:52:37] begun with names like Mark, Sidon and Eric Minier. This is a big deal for Jersey Jack. And I'm

[01:52:45] excited to see where they're going. Brent Abbess says, I'm super proud to be Jack's partner.

[01:52:52] I love working with him with all his guidance and decades of experience. What he did to build this

[01:52:57] company is an amazing story on its own. The pinball community coming together to support an amazing

[01:53:02] man on his dream. And I feel really lucky to be his partner and to have him by my side. Not in my

[01:53:08] wildest dreams that I think I would own the coolest gaming company on earth. I mean to be able to

[01:53:13] work with these guys, these legends to create such an amazing product. I think what we do is so

[01:53:18] special. My dad always told me that it's not about being the biggest, it's about being the best

[01:53:23] at what you do. We're here to deliver the best games that money can buy. Any final words on Jersey

[01:53:30] Jack pinball part two, the eras tour. Just looking forward to whatever their next games are.

[01:54:52] Nothing springing in the back. They're dead Jim. Come on it's great Netflix you'd have like five

[01:55:18] companies that own all entertainment. I think it's five so was it Netflix Paramount? You

[01:55:27] guys used to be very anti monopoly Paramount universal. I had this before Disney. How could I forget them?

[01:55:35] And MGM slash Amazon. I said Paramount. I said Paramount. Yep. So that would be five that are like everything.

[01:55:45] But on the bright side the original Star Wars is going to be released in two years in the theaters.

[01:55:57] I will be there. I will actually attend that. He's in Ghostbusters you know. What?

[01:56:05] Yeah Roger. I'm using Ghostbusters. The original Ghostbusters? Yep. He's one of the extras. You

[01:56:11] could see him in the back. He's got the mustache and everything. As soon as you see him it's just like every

[01:56:14] time you watch the scene now. It's like, oh look there's Ron Jeremy. That's so funny. Marketing is hard.

[01:56:20] But I'll tell you a little secret. It doesn't have to be. Let me point something out. You're listening
