[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Ow! I just let my chair keep injuring yourself.

[00:22] I just wanted to boost my chair up and I tilted it forward and I hit my crotch on the...

[00:30] That sounds like a major injury there, Peter. Better get a let down again, sorry.

[00:52] Hello everyone, I'm the man with two first names, David Dennis. And this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[01:13] With me every month is Ron Hallett. I didn't give you a nickname this month.

[01:18] Yeah, that's good. Very good. I apologize everybody. I have a bit of a cold this month.

[01:23] Uh oh, COVID. Yes, I actually, my doctor did suggest I get a COVID test. So I did the all up the nose test.

[01:31] Although uncomfortable, it was not quite as horrible as you might think. So a little bit of a PSA here.

[01:37] If you think you got the COVID, get yourself tested. Sort of like how on the final round podcast,

[01:44] they always tell you you should get your prostate checked. We're telling you to be on the COVID thing.

[01:51] Anyway, what's up in pinball? Blood Zeppelin's coming out. Yeah!

[01:57] Yeah, I kind of, I was thinking, I was thinking Led Zeppelin was going to be some sort of a, like they were going to throw us a curveball there,

[02:04] a little bit of a swerve. It looks like that's on its way out. So that's pretty exciting news.

[02:10] See what Steve Richie does with his Led Zeppelin. Yeah, and we've also got deep root has done their thing.

[02:16] So they've, they've stumbled their way into the party here and they're taking their orders and doing all that stuff.

[02:22] So that's pretty cool. And looking forward to a few years down the road doing our deep root episode.

[02:28] Tons of fun. Tons of fun. Lots going on in pinball optimism is through the roof now. Right?

[02:34] We're making our way through winter. Christmas is upon us.

[02:38] And it's all joy and happiness except for, you know, the stuff in the world.

[02:45] Ron, social media update. Do do do do do do do do do do do.

[02:52] We've had a lot of interaction over at Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles. That's where we spend a lot of time chit chatting, talking about our upcoming things.

[03:01] And if you'd like to join us, please swing on over there as well. The twip pinball promoter's database.

[03:07] Of course, that's the best place to leave us a review. So if anybody's looking for pinball oriented podcasts.

[03:13] If you're looking for Twitch streams or YouTube channels, that's usually where you go.

[03:16] We love to get our comments up there because it's a lot easier.

[03:19] Leave us a five star review. That way other people can find us and enjoy some of our awesome pinball content brought to you by Ron Hallett and myself.

[03:29] Much better than that other podcast that Ron is on. No, no, no, no. First of all, kill me if he hears me say that.

[03:37] That's right. So we have to make sure that we promote slam tilt podcast at least three times.

[03:44] Ron, your producer and manager and life coach and inspirational individual has said that you now have to at least three times promote slam tilt on the podcast.

[03:57] So that's one down. We're going to bring that up at least two more times to make sure we fulfill your contractual obligation here.

[04:04] We have comments. We've got a couple of comments. One of them here. I wanted to bring up.

[04:09] Because it made me sad. This is from Mr. D. The big D. The big D. I love the show and have listened to every episode.

[04:17] My only critique is that for some reason, David has gotten more and more negative and contrairian about the games and features.

[04:24] This is show is progressed. It's gone to the point where Ron is on defense half the time. At first, the show is a breath of fresh air amongst the excess of bros give opinions on pinball podcast.

[04:35] But it's been inching towards that, which is too bad with a slight course correction. The show could rival top cast your two negative dude.

[04:42] Surprise, surprise there, Mr. D. I am super positive on this episode. I'm pumped towards this one, which is a lot of people I think would not enjoy this topic here this week.

[04:53] This month, but I enjoy this topic and I am going to be positive on this. Don't you worry, even though everybody would assume that this is a time where you don't want to be positive.

[05:04] One thing that I did notice Ron is that people can leave comments in other places and we haven't been reading those mostly because I have a hard time finding those.

[05:13] I don't use Apple podcasts. I don't use any of those other apps. I use pocket casts and you can't really leave reviews on that. So generally I rely on the trip database to bring in those quotes.

[05:24] But I did find a couple one of them from Apple podcasts.

[05:28] I'm not trying to say this name. I'll leave that to you.

[05:31] I wish, yeah, you're going to let me screw up the name. So I seem dumb.

[05:36] Seek kitie. Seek kitie from Apple podcasts says really enjoy the silver ball of chronicles like the history of the hobby and hearing about designers and artists from years past. Well, thank you.

[05:54] Seek kitie. I'll do the easier one here. Minty fresh from Podbean says another fantastic and engaging podcast. Nice work.

[06:05] Yeah, thank you. So we just wanted to recognize that one thing that we also have T shirts. People are buying T shirts over at silverball swag.com.

[06:15] Lots of design choices, there's some mugs and stickers. We don't actually get a list of the names of those people who are buying those shirts. That's a privacy thing, I guess.

[06:26] And, you know, if you have bought a shirt, please let us know on our Facebook page because we want to give you a shout out. We want to say thank you.

[06:35] Even though we're not doing that in person and we're not doing that sort of proactively, it would be awesome if you would reach out. So please, by all means, swing on over to silver ball swag, pick up a shirt and enjoy keeping your nipples warm.

[06:52] So corrections and comments from the previous episode, that was our Borgie episode. I haven't got any corrections. Have you?

[07:00] I have not. I guess there was not an error to be seen. Where can I send corrections if I wanted to? If you wanted to send corrections in, you can send that into silver ball chronicles a Gmail.com.

[07:13] So if we screw anything up, there are a lot of sources that I'm pulling from from a bunch of different places. And, you know, quite frankly, I'm part of the quote unquote hobbyist media.

[07:24] So being part of that hobbyist media, it means that I actually am not putting as much effort into as most professionals might. And, you know, errors do happen. So please, by all means, if we make a mistake or say something silly or you completely disagree, shoot us an email, silver ball chronicles Gmail.com.

[07:42] Anything else you want to add, Ron? I'm ready to get started. This month's topic, a positive topic. Pat Lawler is a pinball statesman, a magnet or perhaps a tycoon.

[07:56] One thing's for sure, he is a powerful person in the pinball industry. Pat has a deep and controlled thought process, which is often why his designs and mechanical toys are so detailed and dedicated to being exciting.

[08:13] Some people would call Pat Lawler a pinball academic. He's sometimes even called a prickly fella. He has a long lumbering and detailed way of explaining himself. And he certainly doesn't shy away from sharing his true thoughts, even if he has to go on a 10 minute journey for everybody to hear those thoughts.

[08:32] Pat began his career at Williams in the late 80s, but we're not here to talk about that today. No, no, no. That's an awesome topic for another day. We're here to talk about Pat's time at Stern. And eventually his company changing role at Jersey Jack pinball this month's topic, Pat Lawler pinball's roller coaster tycoon.

[08:55] What a great title. Why did we call it pinball's roller coaster tycoon? Cause you asked me and that's what I came up with. Yeah, I couldn't come up with a title and you just named the first machine that you could think of. Great play field, great play field. Pat Lawler is a bit of a tycoon in the industry. So I think that that actually fits very well as a title. And of course today we're not talking about peak Lawler.

[09:19] We're not talking about fun house and Adams family and Twilight zone. We're sort of talking about on the other side of the roller coaster, the lower part, if you will. But one that I still think is so much fun. So we'll get into that.

[09:35] Well, I guess we should start with where he came from and what his upbringing was and where he was, even though you know, this isn't the beginning of his career. I think we should probably start there anyway.

[09:45] We want to make sure that we leave you wanting more. So that's why we're doing, you know, low end Lawler first. Any who he played pinball like everybody else in the industry as a kid on Saturday mornings. His father actually was a delivery driver for various bars in his hometown.

[10:02] And he would be in those bars and he'd play some pinball. It was often building and tinkering with toys and not necessarily playing with him. He'd like to take them apart and put them back together.

[10:13] Now he bought his first machine in college and he put it in his kitchen. It was a flipper cowboy funny story.

[10:22] The Jersey Jack pinball podcast hosted by Ken Cromwell actually had an entire episode where they reunited Pat Lawler with that exact flipper cowboy. Did you hear that episode? I did not.

[10:35] It's kind of neat where they they go through all that. So jump into that Jersey Jack podcast. I'll include that in her show notes. It's a very odd story. The exact machine that was in his kitchen.

[10:45] Pat would move on to post secondary education at the St. Mary's College of Communication and Arts. He went into radio. He was a late night FM radio DJ playing things like Led Zeppelin.

[10:57] Not great pay for the work and he lasted about eight months. Pat Lawler would say if the money was good, he probably would have stayed, but it doesn't seem like that that was really the position for him.

[11:08] Do you picture Pat Lawler as a radio DJ? I do not. So I don't know if the money was good enough or not. I just don't think he's he's the radio DJ type. He's like I said, he's a bit of an academic right? He's he's kind of lumbering and slow. He doesn't have that mark silk up and down voice stuff going on. Right. Like he's pretty even keel. Maybe he did a DJ voice of some kind. Yeah. Maybe maybe Pat Lawler.

[11:37] He's actually like this huge partier and he's all about like classic rock. If anyone can find any clips of him DJ send them send a link to them to or mail back.

[11:52] Please by all means, I think the industry would be a better place if we could have something like that. I think Pat's a bit of an introvert. So I've listened to podcasts. I've read some articles. Have you been watching some videos from expos of years past?

[12:05] And although very personal and very nice. He he seems a bit uncomfortable at times when it comes to talking about himself and talking about the industry. You know, would you say that Pat's an introvert?

[12:18] Maybe I'd say he could come off as somewhat negative at times. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Now there was a bit of a controversy in in 2020 with Pat at Jersey Jack pinball when they were moving factories from New Jersey to Chicago.

[12:34] I think that that mostly comes down to the fact that you know, Pat's a business guy. He's business first. He's you know, he's not everybody's best friend. But he certainly is good at what he does. And some of the critiques are always like you only see Pat Lawler when he launches a game. Then he's disappeared or he doesn't sign trans lights or I just think he's a bit awkward. I just think he's an awkward dude. Do you agree with that?

[12:59] I've seen him sign trans lights. So I can't say that. Right. So I think a lot of this critique is a bit silly. You know, I think people should go to a show when those open back up and things like that. Meet Pat. See what he's like. Make your judgment for yourself. After his old DJ and gig, he became a shop and service manager at a big auto center where he spent seven years working at the end. He said he was completely burned out because customer service job just was very demanding.

[13:28] And it wasn't for him. So there you go. Right. When you're dealing with the public, that's a difficult job sometimes. And if you're more of an introverted personality, that's really, really difficult.

[13:37] Pat says people think you're a crook. My employees were demanding too. I'd go to the bar with my co-workers and play pinball while others had drinks in a good time. By 1980, I'd moved on to space invaders and Pac-Man.

[13:49] Yeah. So you're going out with your buddies, your co-workers and you're like, you know what? I don't want to talk to these people. I'm going to go play pinball. Although that probably sounds pretty great to a bunch of us.

[13:59] You know, you can see how that kind of created a bit of a barrier. After he left there, he disappeared for about three months. He doesn't talk about what he did there. And he said that he actually used an apple to you played a lot of with that during this this time. It was his first computer. And he has said he spent a fortune on that computer.

[14:18] On that computer in 1978 where he learned to program. There's probably thousands of dollars. I remember when my father said that he bought his original IBM like 186. And I think he said that he spent like $3,000 on that thing, which is insane.

[14:39] The future. A lot of people would say that they didn't understand why Pat would buy such an expensive computer and learn programming. But I guess if you love to learn and again, you're a bit of an academic. Why not? 1979 and 1980. Now this is when Pat started to move deeper into actually professional programming.

[15:00] So now the newspaper for computer programmers and he took some courses in college. And he interviewed for a job. After he got that job, he lasted a year. Pat says I get daily calls from headhunters at other firms. One day I said, don't call me unless you can get me a job in video games. The guy grumbled and hung up. He called back after a while and said I had an interview at a ballet affiliate. This is kind of that late 70s kind of early 80s era. We've spoke about this tons of time.

[15:29] Across a bunch of different podcasts, but there's like a race for programmers, right? Originally the programmers in the industry were the engineers themselves and they're using electromechanical switches and everything is pretty straightforward. Now we're getting into people that actually have to be professionally trained that are building programming in computer chips.

[15:48] So there's a race for anything programming and programmers. Now the coding is done by creative folks who are creating something as opposed to something that's sort of more purpose built.

[15:59] Pat says programmers were one thing, but they wanted creative people. Everyone else was looking for programmers. They wanted to make things that were sellable and fun to make money being ballet.

[16:08] Yes, his first project at ballet was a game called demons and dragons. I had to actually look this up. I'm going to include this in a show notes. If you want to click on it, it was actually a bit of a rabbit hole to find this was not particularly popular.

[16:23] It's basically a 2D game where you have to save a maiden in a castle from some demons surprise. They're trying to burn down the castle with the maiden inside and you're kind of like trying to put it those fires and catch them.

[16:34] This was around the beginning of the great sort of video game collapse. The game itself was kind of shit.

[16:44] Negative. No, I'm sorry. Sorry. The industry moved into survival mode shortly after this. Right. This is where all that high tech shuffle alley stuff started coming in.

[16:56] They're all trying to find something to move back to. Pat ended up working in those areas learning a bunch of different tasks.

[17:06] If you take a look at his education so far, he's in sound design and music. He's done computer programming. He's done people management and management rules.

[17:18] He's not very old. He's in the early 80s. He's got a lot of experience in a bunch of different specialized areas.

[17:28] Somebody like Pat Lawler, I think, is going to bring a lot to the table when it comes to building teams and building machines. What do you think?

[17:36] I mean, it's a very good thing to have a track record speaks for itself. Yeah. Yeah. Now we're not going to talk about when he came into Williams in the late 80s, and of course, his smash hits in the 90s, because that would be far too easy for for a first episode of Pat Lawler.

[17:50] We're going to talk about his other years. But around the collapse in 1983. Pat would say, money was thrown around the video game industry.

[18:02] It was so big and massive that there was more money around than you could imagine. Then it went to nothing overnight. It was all gone.

[18:12] Now that was well before my time in video games and things like that. So I don't really know what that time was like. But what I look at like some of the Atari games at the time, it brings a lot of sadness and a couple of tears to my eye.

[18:29] So Pat went to work for a company that transferred arcade games and video games into specific cartridges. And a year after he was there that collapsed.

[18:41] Then he worked on a bunch of odd tech jobs for a year or so. And he ended up working at a bowling tech company, which you might be familiar with called Brunswick Systems. That's where he met a fellow named Paul Desson.

[18:54] How do you how do you how do you how do you American say that it would probably disalt with the salt right. Of course Paul Dessolt would know Larry DeMar and Larry DeMar was working in Williams.

[19:09] And he was really very much at the time working on some bowling tech because they were getting into those bowling things, which were all the rage. Do you have one of those bowling things? What are those called?

[19:21] I mean shuffle allies. Yeah, I do not have a shuffle. That doesn't really get me going those things. Are they great? It just seems like that's very much a part of this hobby and I don't get it.

[19:32] I'd say some more of a bar thing. Yeah. It's it's not bowling. It's not shuffle alley. Well, it is a shuffle alley. It's a shuffle alley and you hit pins. Well, you slide under the pins.

[19:46] What's the one what's the one that's just just the discs? What's that called? Just the discs the old people the old people do it. The old people do it. Yeah, they got the little stick. I'm far too young to know what you're talking about. They do it on cruise ships. Oh, croquet. Oh, no.

[20:05] Anyway, if you know what that is, shoot us an email, civilball Chronicles at gmail.com. And I'll bring that up in the next episode. Any who. So Larry Larry, Demar came in to Brunswick to take a look at some bowling tech that they were working on.

[20:18] And then Pat recognizes name from high speed because he'd go out for a lunch and play high speed. Everyone was playing high speed. Yeah, it was a big deal at the time. High speed really became this turning point in the industry, which is really interesting because as

[20:34] I'm going through all of this reading and all these podcasts and things like that high speed comes up like all the time. People all the time are like, oh my god, I played high speed and it was like it was like something changed. So it's pretty interesting.

[20:47] So Pat would actually meet Larry tomorrow and he'd say, I told him, hey, I have an idea for a pinball machine with a vertical play field in the back glass. And he basically said, let's go build this. Of course, that game would become bonsai run.

[21:02] I think originally was wrecking ball. Yeah, spoilers. Oh, yeah, that's for the other. That's for part one. We're doing part two now. Yeah, we're going to go backwards going back in time song about that one time.

[21:16] It's a good movie that that was a portion. It was a shit pin though. Negative.

[21:20] Positive Dave. So of course now let's jump in the old time machine here with the dog and the kid with the glasses. Is that show? Oh, that's.

[21:31] Shut up you. Oh, Mr. Mr. Peavody. Was that yeah, yeah, like that. Yeah.

[21:37] So if we jump forward in time, Williams would shut down their pinball division after the whole pinball 2000 thing. Again, we're going to add that into its old dedicated podcast by itself. Pat would become a contractor within the gaming industry in general.

[21:52] This is where Pat would start something called Pat Lawler designs PLD. Pilled one day. Gary Stern would call Pat Lawler.

[22:01] Pat says they wanted to know if I be interested in working on pinball. They decided they could get their hands on the monopoly license. And that was a license that Pat wanted that they believes didn't get IE safe cracker.

[22:13] Pat says I thought it would be really cool. We struck a deal to go off and do that. Yeah, so this brings us into Pat Lawler's first game at Stern.

[22:22] Monopoly. This is a licensed board game theme from September of 2001, which is a really rough time to launch anything.

[22:33] Because of the whole 911 thing. It was a Sega Stern white star board set sold 3,640 units designed by Pat Lawler mechanics by Kurt Anderson, art by John Yousey, sound by Chris Granner.

[22:50] And software by I'm going to have to say this American way. Lewis, Cazaria's and Greg Dunlop.

[22:58] Should be Louis. Shouldn't be Lewis. Should be Louis. This game is great. I think this is a great game. Wow, it gave me like I think this is a great game.

[23:09] Now, I want to talk about the history of monopoly. My father, true story, was they a runner up in the Prince Edward Island, provincial monopoly tournament in 1982.

[23:26] Monopoly is a thing in our in my family. I've been played it in years because my father used to just crush me at it and I hate this game.

[23:38] The board game is published now by Hasbro. It's created in 1935 under the Parker Brothers name. And of course that was designed on another game or you know, some people say stolen from another game called the landlord's game by Lizzie Maggie.

[23:55] In 1903, this game was originally designed as a bit of a critique on large monopolies and corporations. And it was a way to demonstrate the economy, which were which rewards wealth creation was much better than one where monopolists work under a very few constraints.

[24:15] And as many people know, monopoly has sold millions of copies worldwide and is one of the 20 worst games ranked against 10,000 others.

[24:24] Huh? Worst? It is it is apparently one of the worst board games ever created judge by who? Judge by a bunch of board game nerds on the internet. I guess so. Yeah, because it's it's like it's long and grinding and incredibly adversarial. Basically the strategy of the game is to never trade or deal or do anything.

[24:52] People do, but that's not the object. The object is to read the rules and just never do anything but just grind and probably you know never have any friends.

[25:06] Wow, what a dark world monopoly is. I was unaware of this. Yeah, so yeah, honest to God, if you want to win at monopoly, basically play exactly to the rules, never trade anything to everybody.

[25:19] Always bid for everything you land on and it is just horrible. And that's probably why they say it's one of the 20 is 20 worst games of all time. Now the pinball machine, I think is actually very, very good.

[25:33] Late it twice, which is probably why I think it's very, very good because I have a not a lot of experience on it, but I think it's a lot of fun.

[25:42] One of my favorite things on this is this really strange spinning mini flipper. Yeah, but it just spins around and around.

[25:50] It's got a solid dust spins both ways. It's got two way motor. No idea what it really does. It's just it's just very saucer.

[25:57] It's got a saucer there. Synactical out of the saucer.

[26:00] Yeah, but then it could knock it kind of back towards you like really uncontrolled. Yeah, it's very cool.

[26:07] It's it's so simple, but yet it's so I don't know. It's such a great little thing. So cool.

[26:12] People would argue the play field is very similar to Adam's family. And what are some of the similarities there?

[26:18] What are some of the things that you can kind of look at really quickly and say, oh, that's very Adam's family.

[26:23] The SGO ramps, the side ramps jackpot shot.

[26:28] Instead of the scoop, it has the railroad ramp in the same spot. Very similar.

[26:33] Yeah, he played it safe. Why would you not copy that?

[26:36] It's coming back into the industry. He's been kind of gone for a couple of years. He figured, okay.

[26:42] Let's play it a bit safe. And of course, Monopoly is kind of cool anyway.

[26:46] This is also one of the machines that has those early stern white star mini DMD scrolling things on the play field.

[26:57] So kind of on the side left. There's a little dot matrix display and it'll scroll left to right and tell you stuff.

[27:04] But what's kind of annoying about that is it takes forever to scroll.

[27:08] So you basically will trap up and watch if you're not a good user.

[27:14] But it was actually quite smart at the time, if you asked me, right?

[27:17] Where, hey, these games are getting a little more complicated and just having a little piece of paper on the apron was really difficult.

[27:27] I mean, when you look at something like the Simpsons, oh my god, thank god it has that screen up there.

[27:31] There are a lot of games that use that screen and that era, the early 2000s.

[27:36] Yeah, they certainly knew it was with the bomb was on that. You could just throw it in pretty cheap, I would say.

[27:41] Did you know on the apron card, it says no to beginner shoot the flashing shot and watch the mini DMD.

[27:46] Yeah, that's pretty straightforward. Yeah, basically. Yeah, it's like any Steve Richie game is just shoot the flashing light. You'll be fine.

[27:53] I mean, you can put that on any friggin pinball machine.

[27:57] The, the bank, you were talking about some similarities to the Adams family.

[28:02] Well, the Adams family had that really cool sort of rotating bookshelf.

[28:06] Well, this has a horizontal moving bank. So it's like a, a bash toy and you hit it and horizontally open, which is kind of neat.

[28:16] That's a, that wasn't an easy mech to actually build.

[28:20] One thing that was very cool and a little bit confusing when I look this up is the platinum edition.

[28:26] Yes.

[28:27] Pat Loller has to be a nerd because he knows this like scarcity, special edition kind of thing.

[28:37] They did it with Adams family gold back in the day. Well, they're doing it with the platinum edition of monopoly.

[28:45] Basically, it's the same game except it has chrome trimmings. It's signed by Pat Loller, John Yosey and Gary Stern.

[28:52] There was a production run of only 40 of these games.

[28:55] You'll notice it is because it has a plaque on it. This is platinum edition.

[28:59] Is there, I've never, I knew my, my podcast made Bruce actually has a platinum edition.

[29:05] There's nothing on it that says platinum edition.

[29:09] There's supposed to be a little plaque under the DMD.

[29:13] There was supposedly like a certificate you got with it that told you what square you were.

[29:17] Each, each of the 40 is a different square on the board. So, you know, if you had 40 squares on boardwalk, I guess that would be the ultimate edition that you could possibly get.

[29:29] I literally didn't know. The first one monopoly ever played was a platinum and had no idea.

[29:37] Oh, there it is. There's the plaque right there. It was, it was the funny thing.

[29:41] It was the, it was sold through pinball sales.com, which for those who don't know, that was Jersey Jack, Jack Winnery.

[29:49] He was their largest distributor.

[29:51] Yeah, Jack knew how to sort of do those special little things that he could charge a little bit more for.

[29:58] And in fact, one of those 40 was the platinum boardwalk edition, which itself is sort of a subspecial one.

[30:09] And if you've got that one, woo, you're a big deal. Friends are very impressed.

[30:16] What, what's the code like on this? Now, I of course have only played it a few times.

[30:21] I enjoyed shooting it. It was kind of fun. It was fairly straightforward. It was a bit unusual.

[30:25] But I couldn't get into the deep codeness of it or things like that. It's very grindy.

[30:31] Yeah, it takes a long time to get a big score.

[30:34] Yeah, it's, it's, it's very much the stern white star gold standard for grinding.

[30:40] All those games were very weird that it just took forever to get going.

[30:44] And then when it did, it was like, it just didn't stop. It was very weird.

[30:50] Great design game. A lot of fun.

[30:53] Kind of unusual. It's monopoly, right? So it's, it's cool-ish theme. Would you buy one?

[31:00] I don't like it that much, but I do think it's a good game. I always enjoyed it.

[31:07] So if you Google pinball and you type in cows and Easter eggs, it'll bring up a whole web page.

[31:15] In those areas, it'll often tell you about some of the flipper codes and some of the interesting little bits and pieces.

[31:20] There's a bunch of flipper codes for this game.

[31:24] It doesn't tell me what those flipper codes do. It just says for a secret message, which is probably like high mom or something.

[31:30] But anyway, they're in there. If you really care, you want to do some flipper codes.

[31:35] Does slam tilt have a flipper code on any of the any any machines?

[31:39] Do we have anything in a game?

[31:42] Yeah, you guys are friends with Tim Sexton, right? Surely he's put a flipper code in a game for slam tilt, right?

[31:47] He is not. We have no flipper codes.

[31:50] So he's put, but Tim Sexton has put your initials.

[31:53] Oh, no.

[31:54] From slam tilt podcast.

[31:55] No, he did not.

[31:56] He hasn't done that either. And he was like one of the biggest guests.

[31:59] Yeah, he hasn't done that. But you know, he did. Raymond Davidson did.

[32:03] Well, you're not friends with Raymond Davidson like you are with Tim Sexton.

[32:07] Sure we are. We love Raymond.

[32:09] Yeah, but not like Tim Sexton.

[32:11] How many times has Raymond been on slam tilt podcast with you and Bruce?

[32:14] Quite a few times actually.

[32:16] Oh, well, all right. That's our second mention of slam tilt podcast.

[32:20] Oh, they're very good, very good. And Tim Sexton bashing for some reason. That's so mean.

[32:25] Well, I've never met Tim, but I'm sure he's okay.

[32:29] Oh, so one thing that's interesting here is, of course, Pat grew up in the industry at Williams,

[32:37] the peak of the peak of pinball and then sort of saw the downturn of that.

[32:42] A lot of people who worked at Valley Williams in those, you know, late 80s, 90s upswing will say that it had,

[32:51] it was like working in like a toy factory.

[32:54] It was like the greatest most exciting thing that you could be creative.

[32:58] You had lots of time. You had lots of budget.

[33:00] That was not necessarily the environment at Stern.

[33:04] Pat Loller would often talk about the different environments between Stern and Valley Williams in a way that sort of made you feel sad.

[33:13] Now, Pat would say that it was not because one company was better than the other, but because the companies had totally different backgrounds and philosophies.

[33:22] And of course, we're in totally different eras, right?

[33:25] And in the 90s, we're on the upswing.

[33:28] Right? You're throwing money at themes and mechs and toys.

[33:31] Until the end of the 90s, but yes.

[33:33] But now we're in 2000, in the 2000s and you know, we're basically just trying to hold on and stay alive.

[33:42] So you can't really blame Stern for being in survival mode.

[33:45] Both companies come from planet pinball, but we're from different tribes and speak different languages.

[33:50] Sometimes we flail our arms around to communicate.

[33:53] People came from Williams and Stern. Don't entirely understand one another. I'll leave it at that.

[33:57] What do you think some of the discussions they had?

[34:01] That gave them such a hard time. What do you think those discussions between sort of like like a like a pat law or ultimate Williams designer, have it Stern?

[34:10] Yeah. They went from a pinball 2000 board set to white star, which is kind of basically going down.

[34:16] I know I think they was harder to program.

[34:19] Just from the people worked on the tech side. It was like going it was like regressing going to see that beautiful WPC sound boards too.

[34:28] That sounded better than that.

[34:30] Yeah.

[34:31] And it just, you data East, Sega, they were getting all those licenses.

[34:38] They were all about like licensing.

[34:41] They were all about, I mean, it's just Williams is more creative. Let's put it that way.

[34:47] In my opinion, again, just just my opinion.

[34:50] Now, if we were, if we were on speculation island, speculation.

[34:54] Do you think a lot of that flailing was like budget conversations and costing?

[35:00] I could have been that, but it's also Williams was like the Cadillac of the industry.

[35:05] Data East, Sega, Slashing, it was not.

[35:08] And now you're basically working there.

[35:11] I think that had something to do with it.

[35:13] You can always tell the Williams guys too, because they all call pop bumpers jets.

[35:17] That's how they give themselves away and they'll still do it.

[35:21] Like, if you listen to any of them now, they still will call them jets.

[35:25] And if you look a pat, he brought that in, well, we'll get into it later.

[35:30] But when he goes to Jersey Jack, what do they call the pop bumpers?

[35:33] They call them jets.

[35:34] Would you say this is like going from, you know, playing for the New York Yankees to playing for the Pittsburgh pirates?

[35:42] Yeah. That's a good analogy.

[35:44] Yeah. I'm really sorry, Pittsburgh.

[35:46] And I think they had jets before Pat Waller went there.

[35:49] I don't want to get a correction.

[35:51] Dwight Sullivan, of course, one of the, you know, I would say fathers of modern pinball code,

[35:59] he worked at Williams, worked on a lot of the top tier machines at Williams.

[36:03] In fact, with guys like Steve Richie and Barry Osler and a bunch of others.

[36:08] Now, he of course came over to work at Stern around this time as well.

[36:13] And of course they had that fancy pants WPC boards that you were talking about with their fancy pants sound boards and big budgets and loads of time to develop.

[36:22] Now those programmers like Dwight Sullivan, well, you know, they had to kind of hold on because they just didn't have what they had before.

[36:31] Well, Pat would say Dwight Sullivan is one of my good friends would say we've all just come from the holodeck on the Star Trek Enterprise D.

[36:40] And we're in hell in the bridge of the original series Enterprise.

[36:45] What's going to I saw of an I assume Enterprise D is next Jan.

[36:48] I thought you were a nerd. You should know that.

[36:51] I know it's NCC 1701 of the original Enterprise.

[36:56] All this fancy cool technology and leading edge awesome to sit non basically red and blue painted cardboard.

[37:07] That's what that tells me.

[37:10] And you get this noise every now and then.

[37:13] Just in the background for no reason.

[37:16] That's coming from three episodes of Topcast, which I would say is probably the gold standard when it comes to industry interviews.

[37:23] Now that there's some space.

[37:25] So there's 10 years between when this interview was actually done and today.

[37:29] So there's been a lot of really cool changes in the industry people in and out of the industry.

[37:34] Pat at this time, he quit in 2008 at Stern and he sound so bummed out about his entire time at Stern, which I don't think was actually that bad.

[37:45] He sounds like he sounded like that during most of his seminar.

[37:49] So I think it's just his way.

[37:51] Right. So so I guess that kind of goes back to where I started the podcast, which is sort of like he kind of has this lumbering kind of.

[37:59] Lez a fair sad demeanor.

[38:03] You know, you look at like not all the time though, which which I'll get into that once we get to it.

[38:08] There's not there's like this war in the industry.

[38:11] It's like you're a big Pat Lawler person or you're a big Steve Richie person and these two shall not touch.

[38:18] Because like Steve Richie's like this rock star and he's like Mr. Energy and he's he's he loves hanging out with people and talking about things and making jokes and.

[38:28] Pat Lawler is a little more like ho hum.

[38:31] I don't think one is better than the other like I'm a huge Steve Richie fan, but I I love Pat Lawler too.

[38:37] I'm like maybe one of these anomalies that doesn't pick a side and I don't know maybe it's because I'm Canadian or maybe because I'm new to the industry.

[38:44] I don't know.

[38:45] I'll go with Canadian.

[38:46] So the next game that he dove into was roller coaster tycoon and this is a licensed video game theme.

[38:53] It's from August of 2002.

[38:55] It's a Sega Stern white star board set.

[38:58] We don't know how many it sold.

[38:59] So there is no production numbers designed again by Pat Lawler mechanics by John Kursich.

[39:06] Kurt Sitch.

[39:08] Does that sound right?

[39:09] I thought it was John Crutch.

[39:10] John Crutch.

[39:11] You might want to like that spelling.

[39:12] I'm just trying to go by previous interviews with him who was mechanical engineers usually were.

[39:17] John Yosey on art Chris Granar on sound the man Chris Granar and software again.

[39:23] It's Louis.

[39:24] Cousier.

[39:25] Cousier.

[39:26] Cousier.

[39:27] Cousier.

[39:28] Cousier.

[39:29] Sounds good to me.

[39:30] Yeah.

[39:31] Corrections can be sent to super ball chronicles at e-mail.com.

[39:34] It's like a running joke with me in these names man like oh my god.

[39:38] Give me a francophone name.

[39:40] Give me a French name.

[39:41] No problem.

[39:42] I'm an aglophone but you give me these these Ukrainian Eastern European names.

[39:47] It's like my god.

[39:48] Yes, comrade.

[39:49] Did you notice based on the top selling PCCD game?

[39:52] So I actually took that from the roller coaster tycoon marketing materials.

[39:57] It says PC hyphen CD game.

[40:00] That's how old this PCCD game was.

[40:03] That's pretty old.

[40:04] This is before steam.

[40:05] Oh wait, wait, before steam.

[40:07] This is when you would go to the store and you'd buy a box.

[40:09] Yep, you had to actually buy the media.

[40:11] Yeah, yeah.

[40:12] We don't even have DVDs yet.

[40:13] It's on a CD.

[40:14] Yeah, and the CDs were a big deal, right?

[40:16] Like if you had a, if you, you know, this was like the future was this thing.

[40:22] Let me, let me bring up some stats here about the best selling.

[40:27] I'm sorry, top selling PC hyphen CD game.

[40:31] Roller, Ty, roller coaster tycoon, of course, is a series of simulation video games

[40:37] based on building and managing amusement parks.

[40:40] Each game in the series challenges players with open-ended amusement park management and development

[40:46] and allowing the players to construct and customize their own unique roller coasters and thrill rides.

[40:54] This sold millions of copies in March of 1999 and started an entire series and subgenre.

[41:02] And it was, of course, published by Hasbro.

[41:05] Who probably got them in when they did monopoly.

[41:09] Did you play roller coaster tycoon?

[41:12] The PC game, no.

[41:13] You didn't.

[41:14] I did not.

[41:15] Oh my god.

[41:16] I played this game.

[41:17] And this game was awesome.

[41:19] This is when I was like, I want to say like 13, 14 probably, early high school, late middle school.

[41:27] You could make these crazy roller coasters and then get people into your park and they've ride them.

[41:33] And then they would go and walk throughout your park and just throw up everywhere.

[41:36] And then you had to have dudes that would come and clean it or you'd have to have like washrooms really close to the roller coaster.

[41:43] So they would throw up.

[41:44] What we're seeing is that should have been in the game.

[41:46] Yeah.

[41:47] That's somewhere.

[41:48] Yeah.

[41:49] Like a barfing station or something.

[41:50] Yeah.

[41:51] Some people would say that the rules in roller coaster tycoon make you want to vomit.

[41:54] Oh.

[41:55] Negative.

[41:57] But I would say like roller coaster tycoon was an amazing game.

[42:02] And it started this whole sort of sub genre of, you know, it was sort of like Sim City was a big thing before that.

[42:08] And then now you've kind of moved into this other genre.

[42:11] And it's been a lot of fun.

[42:13] But I really, really like roller coaster tycoon the game.

[42:18] Again, I've only played it a couple of times.

[42:21] But this game makes me smile.

[42:24] I have, I have a lot of fun like the, you're shooting the ramps and things are whirling around.

[42:31] It's got great Chris Grant or sound package music and callouts.

[42:35] It is a fun fun game all around.

[42:37] I want to pass best play fields.

[42:39] Yeah.

[42:40] Probably the biggest negative of the game, which probably turns a lot of people off is the troll.

[42:47] The troll.

[42:49] So there's a troll doll kind of went back left, back center and you can kind of dunk them in the dunking like a dunk tank.

[42:57] But you can't.

[42:58] But you can't.

[42:59] That's the problem.

[43:01] You can't have an annoying character bouncing up and down that you can't at least hit.

[43:05] Right.

[43:06] As well as troll dolls at this time were very much way past.

[43:10] Kind of when they were popular.

[43:14] So I mean, I don't know if they found a bunch of these like out back behind like a store and a dumpster and they're like, hey, here's 4,000 of these.

[43:22] We can put them into a game.

[43:23] Another thing that was interesting about this era of stern was it's like they would go to target and they would just buy a toy and stick it in there.

[43:32] Almost definitely most definitely we'll run into more of those as we go.

[43:37] Other than that, if we leave out the kind of the weird troll thing, I think the play field itself is.

[43:42] So much fun.

[43:43] There are so many ramps and so many shots.

[43:46] Pat Lawler loves multiple flippers.

[43:49] And this is an example where those multiple flippers are awesome.

[43:53] If this was made today, it'd be an Ellie.

[43:55] Oh my god.

[43:56] Could you imagine the bottom?

[43:57] Yeah, this would be the ultimate premium package.

[44:00] They'd have to take out one of the ramps for sure.

[44:03] Now colored ramps ramps ramps ramps ramps everywhere.

[44:08] But there's one specific yellow ramp that kind of starts in the back left.

[44:12] It comes all the way to the right, all the way down and then under around the flippers and off into like a lock on the left.

[44:19] I don't think that's a ramp.

[44:21] That's like the fuck.

[44:22] That's the kind of glove kicker you hit it and literally that whole thing is just to look cool when you fire it up.

[44:28] It comes all the way around like a roller coaster.

[44:30] Yeah, it's called the rocket.

[44:33] And in the promotional and the promotional documentation, it says it's the biggest baddest ramp ever in a pinball machine.

[44:39] I guess.

[44:40] Now if this were coded by Dwight Sullivan, you'd never get to use that ramp.

[44:45] Just like the hyperm.

[44:47] Wow, Star Wars hate in a Pat Lawler episode.

[44:52] Star Wars hate knows no ends obviously.

[44:56] I'll tell you what, the back glass on this makes me smile.

[45:00] It makes me so happy.

[45:02] I don't know what it is.

[45:03] It reminds me of like when I was a kid.

[45:06] It's one of John Yousey's probably best.

[45:09] It's goofy.

[45:11] It's fun.

[45:12] It's got a guy he's like oiling it while he's riding, which I think seems quite dangerous.

[45:17] An elephant, a panda.

[45:18] With sunglasses, no laughs.

[45:20] Yeah, of course.

[45:21] There's a there's two gentlemen in the front.

[45:23] There's one fellow who has these amazing like white hair just kind of.

[45:29] Just perfect.

[45:30] And his hands are over his face.

[45:31] I think that's supposed to be Gary Stern.

[45:33] What do you think?

[45:34] It could be.

[45:35] It's also got the scrambled eggs thing on the left side.

[45:40] So in the upper play field, you kind of shoot it up to where like the orbit shot was.

[45:44] And there's like a spinning disc or something there.

[45:48] And I mean, I don't know.

[45:49] It's got a cool.

[45:50] It's got a cool 360 up flipping ramp thing.

[45:55] Which is pretty cool.

[45:56] It's a pack game.

[45:57] It's got the midi DMD in the back also.

[45:59] Oh, there's so much going on.

[46:00] Now as you said, though, the software.

[46:02] Yeah.

[46:03] So at least among the tournament crowd, this game is known for you.

[46:08] You just start a mode and time it out.

[46:10] You time out every mode.

[46:12] You don't play any of them.

[46:14] Except I think one of them might be a multi ball or something, but it's just known as not being the greatest software package.

[46:22] This is one I'd like to see almost they redo it.

[46:27] I keep the play field.

[46:28] Maybe redo the software.

[46:29] Yeah.

[46:30] Albert Ager, who is the host of the pinball nerds podcast.

[46:35] He says that he thinks roller coaster tycoon is Pat's most underrated game.

[46:41] I also think that it's.

[46:45] The pat luller game with the most flow.

[46:48] But that's debatable, of course.

[46:50] If the game were to get some sort of soren code update that would somehow prevent you from simply timing out the modes, it could be one of his best games.

[47:00] There you go.

[47:01] I see the opinion is shared.

[47:04] At least for the couple of people.

[47:06] Yeah.

[47:07] So, you know, he his background, of course, tournament play.

[47:11] My background is mostly just screwing around.

[47:14] Yeah, you can't go by with the tournament players say.

[47:17] Yeah, because it's it's it's funny, right?

[47:20] When you all play games, you think about it very differently than most.

[47:24] Well, not me.

[47:25] Not me.

[47:26] I'm not the rules guy.

[47:28] Yeah, you're not the rule guy.

[47:29] I just asked somebody.

[47:30] What am I supposed to do here to score the highest points?

[47:32] Yeah, but I just I just love ramps.

[47:35] You know, I just I love it.

[47:37] Going different places.

[47:38] It's got some great call outs.

[47:39] So it seems you really like roller coaster tycoon.

[47:42] It's a lot of fun.

[47:43] I don't get it.

[47:44] Right.

[47:45] It's one of those early, you know, white stars.

[47:47] Look at this four flippers.

[47:49] Yeah.

[47:50] Captive ball.

[47:51] Drop target.

[47:52] Colored ramps.

[47:53] Second dot matrix display.

[47:55] I mean, this thing is ultra-LE version.

[47:58] There's a lot of stuff going on there.

[48:00] Even as annoying as the dummy is, he does move.

[48:02] He moves up and down with the laugh.

[48:05] It's a lot of fun.

[48:07] If you can see this game, go ahead and play it.

[48:09] I mean, it's not, you know, it's not the Simpsons.

[48:11] It's not lower to the rings.

[48:12] But it's a lot of fun.

[48:13] And I bet you could pick one up for a pretty decent price.

[48:15] Oh, yeah.

[48:16] Now, this brings us to his next game.

[48:18] Ripley's believe it or not.

[48:19] And this is right when I got into the hobby.

[48:21] Okay.

[48:22] So this is kind of this is so.

[48:23] So when you started in the hobby, it was like the dark days of pinball, right?

[48:28] And this was your new box that you're right.

[48:30] Dark days.

[48:31] I mean, this was a pinball machine.

[48:34] My dark days are the outbreak where I've only had four stern machines being released.

[48:39] And one of like Jersey Jack's greatest games ever.

[48:42] I would say this was.

[48:45] It just seemed like a weird license, I remember.

[48:48] Yeah.

[48:49] Or please believe it or not.

[48:50] It's like a license.

[48:51] What is it?

[48:52] Like a it's like a freak show thing.

[48:54] Well, I'm.

[48:55] I just think of the Jack Palants hosted show when I see.

[48:59] Yeah.

[49:00] Believe it.

[49:01] Or not.

[49:02] March 2004 was when this was released.

[49:05] It's again a stern white star.

[49:07] We don't know the production.

[49:08] Basically, the same crew is all of the other but John Yosey and Chris Granger.

[49:13] Ripley's believe it or not.

[49:14] Now, this is based on Robert Ripley, who was this guard, this fellow.

[49:20] He would do deals in bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers of magazines

[49:28] and books would want to read about these.

[49:30] And this was way back way back in the in the 20th century.

[49:34] Way back in the 20th century.

[49:37] It was like a newspaper panel, which was like a column, I guess, or a section news

[49:42] reels.

[49:43] I remember seeing newsreels from like the 30s with Robert Ripley himself.

[49:47] Yeah, it would feature these like popular, weird.

[49:51] This man's eyeballs come right out of his skull.

[49:54] The tallest man in the world and the shortest man in the world hangin' out at the coffee shop.

[50:00] It was in comic books.

[50:01] It was on TV.

[50:02] It was on radio.

[50:04] It was really this like turn of the century popular, you know, these tribes of Papa New Guinea

[50:12] kind of thing of the.

[50:13] And he apparently, Robert Ripley had collections of like 20,000 photographs, 30,000 of these

[50:20] random, weird, like artifacts, like fertility idols and basically things that you would see

[50:27] in a tourist trap now is what is a Ripley's or believe it or not.

[50:33] These are like franchise museum things now.

[50:37] This game is amazing because of one thing and one thing alone and that's a very target.

[50:44] Yeah, bring it back to very target.

[50:47] Right, or what Stern calls it.

[50:49] Did the God leave a patent expire?

[50:51] Called it the variable push target.

[50:54] Yeah, it's a very target.

[50:56] Although this target, you can push it all the way back and it goes into a hole.

[51:00] Yeah, so a very target is like this target.

[51:02] You hit it and every time you hit it, it kind of clicks back slowly, unless you really give

[51:07] it a good smack and then it'll go all the way back.

[51:09] And this one head, it kind of would go back and down and there was a scoop behind it.

[51:14] Pat Loller, a little bit like John Borg, modern John Borg, love in the scoops, which is probably

[51:22] one of the downsides to the next couple of games.

[51:25] It also has a cool sun, like shrunken head in the back.

[51:29] Yeah, it's kind of cool.

[51:31] Cool story.

[51:32] So my first Chicago pinball expo ever when we took the Stern factory tour, they were giving away

[51:40] the shrunken heads.

[51:41] Yeah, so that'll give you an idea how much it's so old.

[51:44] Those shrunken heads, they were quite detailed.

[51:48] It looked like an actual shrunken head.

[51:51] I still have it sitting downstairs right now.

[51:53] They got them from, I don't know, Walmart, wherever they got them from.

[51:56] I mean, they were just a store bought thing.

[51:58] This is probably what, his best rule set of this era?

[52:01] I know it's very popular with Keith L. Win, so that must mean yes.

[52:05] Yeah, I think so.

[52:07] I got a friend of mine and he says he just loves the rules for this game.

[52:10] I've never played it.

[52:11] This is one that I haven't.

[52:12] It has a grid.

[52:13] Yes.

[52:14] Keith L. Win loves his grids.

[52:17] I mean, it's another pack game.

[52:19] It's got ramps.

[52:20] It's got the extra display ramps for days on the upper left.

[52:25] It's got wire forms, curling a little coily, curly coily, wire forms, always like those.

[52:31] We're gonna go up kickers into top into top flippers.

[52:37] This game has a couple of really cool Easter eggs.

[52:40] One of them is a call out.

[52:42] So when you shoot the bozo hole.

[52:44] It's got more than call outs.

[52:45] Do you mean a call back?

[52:46] Yes.

[52:47] Is that what I meant?

[52:48] No.

[52:49] Yeah, call outs.

[52:50] So basically it says like there's a there's a bozo hole and when it's unlit, you shoot it in and the guy says it's not plugged in man.

[52:57] It's a call back.

[52:58] It's a call back.

[52:59] Oh, okay.

[53:00] A call back.

[53:01] Which is.

[53:02] They're all call outs.

[53:03] If I say jug pot, that's a call out.

[53:05] Right.

[53:06] It's not plugged in man.

[53:07] Is a call out that is a call back.

[53:10] Yeah.

[53:11] Yeah, I get you.

[53:12] Okay.

[53:14] All right, Mr. Semantics pants over there.

[53:18] There's another one.

[53:19] So when you tilt, it'll say skate with the penguins at your own risk in the Ripley zone, which is quite similar to a tilt quote in Twilight Zone.

[53:27] Yeah, it's got one of the voices to skate with the penguins at your own risk in the Ripley zone.

[53:32] Yes, which is a call back.

[53:34] That's why lights up.

[53:35] Very good.

[53:36] You're welcome.

[53:37] And there's a two times bonus that gives you a cow with two heads and a magnet.

[53:42] It's got a magnet over on the lower left.

[53:45] When you hit the idle, it screws the ball.

[53:48] I don't know.

[53:49] Kind of, you just think think of what we got to this later, but think of dialed in, but on the left side.

[53:54] Very similar.

[53:55] Yeah, very cool.

[53:56] This is, it's a packed play field.

[53:57] There's lots going on.

[53:58] There's like a little other play field on the top.

[54:00] Absolutely packed.

[54:01] And the art's not terrible.

[54:03] It's got a ton of inserts.

[54:05] Like you have seen number of inserts.

[54:07] So they really want you to know what to do by looking at the play field.

[54:11] There's a lot going on.

[54:12] Now there's a bit of a rinse and repeat design here.

[54:15] Like if you look at that left side with the scoop and the target and the pop bumper.

[54:21] It's a little whirlwind-esque.

[54:23] Whirlwind-y.

[54:24] Whirlwind-y.

[54:25] Windy.

[54:26] I mean, you know, I mean, just there's not that much else though.

[54:32] That looks like a world.

[54:33] Pat Waller loves his shot through the pops.

[54:35] He's a big orbit through the pops guy.

[54:39] So I mean, yes, once a designer gets into a groove, they tend to kind of do the same things.

[54:45] However, you only have single inlanes in this one.

[54:48] Yeah, which is weird.

[54:50] He's always doing that five inlane outlane thing.

[54:54] But there's like an odd lock on the right side.

[54:56] So over by the plunge area, there's also kind of a lock, which is a little bit similar to the twilight zone lock.

[55:03] But of course, it's a standard body.

[55:05] So it is shorter.

[55:07] So something had to give somewhere, I guess.

[55:09] I mean, what we've seen so far after monopoly, which was heavily influenced by Adam's family,

[55:16] we see some pretty cool original playfields coming out here that would cost a ridiculous amount to make today.

[55:23] You know, there's a lot of quotes from this sort of era, particularly maybe early stern,

[55:29] where a lot of people, you know, are very much down on this era.

[55:34] In fact, Josh Robb from loser kid pinball podcast said that this era almost killed pinball completely from some of the playfield designs.

[55:44] Although I understand the critique, I disagree a little bit.

[55:49] But you know, some of them were pretty lackluster and I'll tell you, Pat Lawler's were not lackluster.

[55:56] No, they were doing, they were doing the best they could.

[55:58] I mean, we weren't, I mean, I don't see how you can consider this like the worst era when later on they would have like big box honor and NBA and games like that.

[56:07] Just saying.

[56:08] One thing that's that's kind of neat that I learned when reading through IPDB was that there was actually a couple of issues importing this game into the UK.

[56:17] There's this whole like game of skill versus a game of chance thing that the industry is always set an issue with.

[56:24] In the UK, if you were importing games to the UK, you had to put posts, controllable posts in the game wherever the ball would drain with extra buttons.

[56:34] So you could save the ball.

[56:35] They did that stern had to do that for a few games.

[56:38] So the left out lane, the right out lane and the center lane had up posts and there would be extra buttons on the cabinet sort of like a Magna save button.

[56:46] And you push the button and the post would come up to keep it from draining.

[56:49] So it was more of a game of skill versus a game of chance.

[56:52] You push one button, it would be on the left side, you push the other one to be on the right side, you push both would open the one in the middle.

[56:57] It's a similar to Williams superstar from 1972.

[57:00] This is a much more complex rule set than the other pat lower games. Isn't that right?

[57:05] Yeah, there's actually a Keith L. Intuitorial on this game that's like 30, 40 minutes long and loses me.

[57:13] So yes, that means it's very deep.

[57:15] Yeah, it's trying to remember what the last mode is called.

[57:19] If you're looking for like a pat lower kind of game around this time, you're looking for something that's reasonably priced plenty deep lots of weirdness going on.

[57:30] This is probably your game.

[57:31] This is a very popular game amongst collectors.

[57:33] There's a lot of collectors alike this game.

[57:36] Jason Fowler, formerly of the Slapsave pinball podcast.

[57:40] Actually, this is one of the games that he searched and sought out for because he really wanted to get a Ripley's believe it or not.

[57:48] And I put my friends here in town really wants one of these Atlantis Atlantis.

[57:53] That's what the final mode. That's the Wizard mode getting to the last hit you Atlantis.

[57:58] Yeah, now these machines always have a massive amount of wear on that scoop.

[58:05] They are always a mess around this time. So you're going to have to bondo that throw a cliffy on.

[58:11] They're going to be rough.

[58:13] Anything else on that one you want to talk about?

[58:15] Yeah, it's Ripley's.

[58:16] It's a good one.

[58:17] Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty good.

[58:20] Now we're going into kind of like a weird one.

[58:22] This is a Grand Prix slash NASCAR.

[58:27] This is a licensed race car slash NASCAR theme August of 2005.

[58:35] Again, we're still on the Stern white star board set.

[58:38] We're sure you have to have the Grand Prix edition for non-US buyers.

[58:43] That's right.

[58:44] You know, same team all around except Chip Curtis is the different individual here on software.

[58:51] Now, Grand Prix, again, you mentioned the more European centric game.

[58:57] NASCAR, and I'm going to disappoint a lot of people here, particularly big in North America,

[59:03] basically only big in the United States, and only really, really big sort of, you know, in the Southern States.

[59:11] I enjoy NASCAR.

[59:13] I think it's really great.

[59:14] If it was commentated by a British man, I think the world would probably enjoy it more.

[59:19] You insulting some accents there.

[59:22] You Canadian with the weird Canadian accent and spelling stuff wrong.

[59:26] You're going to make fun of us.

[59:28] I don't think so, boy.

[59:29] And to be true to a little bit of all style like that.

[59:32] Usually the Play-by-Play guy will have no accent, but then the color guy is some extraver who will have a very thick accent.

[59:38] I enjoy all motor sports in general.

[59:41] I think the skill level of NASCAR drivers is outrageous.

[59:47] I'm also a huge F1 fan, been an F1 fan for years.

[59:52] I actually had my honeymoon at the Montreal Grand Prix, the F1 race in the Eil of Notre Dame in Montreal.

[01:00:02] So I love racing. I love racing cars.

[01:00:05] I would love a Grand Prix.

[01:00:08] I would play a NASCAR.

[01:00:11] Now, we talked about Ripley.

[01:00:14] Ripley is having a play field that's packed.

[01:00:18] You know, NASCAR has a friggin' packed play field.

[01:00:24] Just packed.

[01:00:26] I think it's more open.

[01:00:28] He had less room to deal with here because he made a track.

[01:00:31] It goes all the way around the perimeter of the play field to simulate the race track.

[01:00:36] It's like a hyperloop or the supercharger, but like done probably, I think, better to be honest.

[01:00:46] So the idea is you plunge on the right side.

[01:00:50] The same thing for Grand Prix or NASCAR.

[01:00:53] It's exactly the same.

[01:00:54] Just different artwork and sort of different call-outs and animations.

[01:00:57] But you plunge and it kind of goes all the way around the top orbit and kind of comes down.

[01:01:03] The left side and then it goes under the apron and there's magnets under there.

[01:01:08] Very much like your hyperloop and Star Wars or the supercharger.

[01:01:12] And it will go back around and the diverter will either stay open or stay closed and it will go around again

[01:01:19] or it'll come popping out of the bottom of the play.

[01:01:23] It is so cool.

[01:01:24] I'm going to put a video of this in the show notes because it's really, I mean, a bit difficult to describe the way it zips around

[01:01:32] and then sort of shoots up into the play field kind of from the bottom corner.

[01:01:36] So cool.

[01:01:37] The test car.

[01:01:38] Don't forget the test car.

[01:01:39] Yes.

[01:01:40] So the test can explain this.

[01:01:42] This is one of the coolest toys.

[01:01:43] So in the top center, there's a test car that you can hit it with the flipper or if properly adjusted when you plunge.

[01:01:53] And it goes around the track a couple times.

[01:01:55] It will come out and hit the test car for you.

[01:01:58] If you bash the car enough, it'll pop up exposing a scoop which you hit it into.

[01:02:04] And NASCAR's our notorious for the scoop.

[01:02:09] When it comes out of the scoop, it invariably goes right down the middle on a ton of them.

[01:02:14] Because it's a bit wiggly.

[01:02:15] Right.

[01:02:16] Yeah. And it's pointed directly at the middle and it's just gone.

[01:02:19] I've actually played games where they put like a rubber cushion in the out hole, which is huge.

[01:02:25] The huge out hole.

[01:02:26] So if it goes right down the middle, it'll actually bounce and bounce it out.

[01:02:30] So it doesn't drain.

[01:02:32] It's got some super smooth plastic ramps and it's got two ramps, one on the left, one on the right.

[01:02:38] I don't like favorite things in the game, which is goofy.

[01:02:41] Is this got the checkered flag that moves?

[01:02:43] Yes.

[01:02:44] Like it waves back and forth.

[01:02:45] There's like this little flag.

[01:02:46] It's like on a solenoid or something.

[01:02:48] Yeah, little flag.

[01:02:49] And it just moves back and forth.

[01:02:51] So when your mystery is lit, this little flag will shake.

[01:02:55] So now a days that would just be a blinking light.

[01:02:57] Not Pat Lawler, man.

[01:02:58] Pat Lawler is making a freaking flag that moves.

[01:03:00] Again, like the art's not bad.

[01:03:02] Ton of inserts.

[01:03:03] It's a great game.

[01:03:04] Ton of inserts.

[01:03:05] Most people will not like this game.

[01:03:08] Yeah.

[01:03:09] Yeah, there's it's it's it's it's not too photoshoppy yet.

[01:03:14] Right.

[01:03:15] And John Yowcy is still sort of hand drawing a lot of it.

[01:03:19] One thing that I think is really weird is because of that hyper looper, because of the raceway

[01:03:26] that goes around the the whole outside of the pinball machine, they've had to move the out hole

[01:03:32] like really close to the flippers.

[01:03:34] And there's this weird hole that you can see and it's really off putting.

[01:03:39] It really just looks horrible.

[01:03:41] But that's the out hole and then it goes under there and then under the racetrack and then

[01:03:46] kind of gets spit up underneath the apron.

[01:03:49] It's really weird.

[01:03:50] It's got this truck on the back panel and it's like the the truck that your car arrives

[01:03:56] to the racetrack in.

[01:03:58] And there's a diverter at the top of the left ramp.

[01:04:02] So it'll either come up.

[01:04:03] I almost forgot that.

[01:04:04] Yeah, the truck goes by and you can hit the truck.

[01:04:07] Yeah.

[01:04:08] And then it'll kind of fall back down and go down the left side into the pit or it'll kind of

[01:04:15] go to the right and fall over I think or it'll go all the way through the truck and then around

[01:04:21] to the ramp on the right side.

[01:04:23] It's like a multi stage little toy, but it's just like a spinning thing that sort of spins around.

[01:04:30] Like there's a lot going on in this game and it's really, really cool.

[01:04:34] And if you're a NASCAR fan and there's millions and millions of NASCAR fans, there'd be no

[01:04:39] cooler machine to have kind of in your garage than this thing.

[01:04:43] Or if you're a European, listen to us or you're from down under and you're a big Mark Weber

[01:04:48] fan or something like that, a grand prix sitting in your in your what do you call them, your car park.

[01:04:53] It actually had Alan Bestwick, which was the NASCAR television analyst for NBC to do a lot of the voiceover.

[01:05:01] And they actually included the recording of Sammy Haggars, I can't drive 55, which is a popular

[01:05:08] tune among NASCAR fans.

[01:05:10] But it wasn't Sammy Haggars singing it, which was that.

[01:05:13] Yeah.

[01:05:14] Yeah.

[01:05:15] That that piss some people off, which is funny because I believe that his version is in Mustang.

[01:05:20] Interesting.

[01:05:21] It's like, hey, they finally got the rights for that one.

[01:05:23] Uh, there's the number two Miller light Dodge driven by Rusty Wallace.

[01:05:29] And number 29 GM Goodrich Chevrolet driven by Kevin Harvick, Richard Childress racing.

[01:05:37] I do watch at least through my father, I know who the names are.

[01:05:42] And the number 21 motocraft Ford driven by Ricky Rudd.

[01:05:48] Now that's an NASCAR name right there of Wood Brothers racing.

[01:05:54] Now in 2007, they actually reran this game as the Dale Junior, the junior junior.

[01:06:00] It's got 600 in the May.

[01:06:02] I'm going to offend a lot of people with this accent.

[01:06:04] What about me?

[01:06:05] Yeah, but you're allowed to.

[01:06:06] You're like an American.

[01:06:08] I think I'm trying to remember the dealer hurts that I saw had chrome.

[01:06:13] And I don't know if that was the came that way or some the one I saw was just crombed out.

[01:06:18] So if you have a NASCAR that's the Dale one, you got the fancy one.

[01:06:21] Yeah, they work on it.

[01:06:22] Yeah, we're at least that one in the picture.

[01:06:24] The ones all the ones I saw were always chrome.

[01:06:26] So I figured with some kind of super limited edition thing.

[01:06:31] Now I would say the art much worse in this one.

[01:06:35] Oh, it's very photoshopped.

[01:06:37] It's not very photoshopped.

[01:06:38] It's photoshopped.

[01:06:39] It's literally this picture.

[01:06:40] Yeah, and on the side of him and it's like, you know, Dale earned Harvick Junior is a big deal.

[01:06:45] If I was a pinball fan and I had a game made for me and I saw this as the art, I'd reject it.

[01:06:50] Yeah, but what if it was 2007 and you're like, wow, this computer.

[01:06:57] Good point.

[01:06:58] Metallica hadn't been made yet.

[01:07:00] So we're kind of used to this art at this point.

[01:07:02] So you're right.

[01:07:03] Yeah, we're a bit spoiled nowadays.

[01:07:04] We were spoiled in the 80s and kind of the early 90s.

[01:07:08] And then it just all went to hell real quick.

[01:07:11] Now this is where we get into a real hot topic here.

[01:07:16] Oh, yeah.

[01:07:17] Family guy.

[01:07:19] This is the cartoon license television theme August of 2007.

[01:07:24] It is a stern Sam S.A.M. board set.

[01:07:27] So we've switched generations designed by Pat Lawler, John Kersic again in mechanics,

[01:07:34] John Yosey and Margaret Hudson on art, David Thiel on sound, the man himself, David Thiel,

[01:07:42] software by Lonnie Robb Keith P. Johnson and Dwight Sullivan.

[01:07:46] Do you know what the Sam stands for in the Sam board?

[01:07:49] Oh, do tell.

[01:07:50] I don't know.

[01:07:51] If anyone knows or if they just put because usually they spell it, you know, S period, A period, M period,

[01:07:58] I always thought it just meant Sam Stern.

[01:08:00] Gary Stern's dad.

[01:08:01] I mean, that's what it's named after.

[01:08:03] Now whether it actually stands for something, please let us know at our email address,

[01:08:09] silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[01:08:11] The family guy TV show, this was a big deal.

[01:08:14] Big, big deal when I was in high school in university.

[01:08:17] I loved, loved family guy.

[01:08:20] Yeah, this is surprising.

[01:08:21] They got this license too.

[01:08:22] It was the American animated sitcom by Seth McFarland for the Fox Broadcasting Company,

[01:08:28] a premiered in January of 1999.

[01:08:31] After the Super Bowl.

[01:08:33] Right after the Super Bowl, it was a big, big, big deal.

[01:08:37] The series centers around the Griffins, a family consisting of the parents Peter and Lois,

[01:08:42] the children Meg, Chris and Stewie, and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian.

[01:08:49] The show is set in the fictional city of Cuohog.

[01:08:52] Let me help you there.

[01:08:53] The show is set in the fictional city of Co-Hog Road Island.

[01:08:56] Nick Zimins, much of it's surreal and dark human, the form of metafictional cutaway gags

[01:09:00] that are often lampoon American culture.

[01:09:02] So in 2002, the show was canceled because of low ratings, but because of massive DVD and rerun ratings,

[01:09:09] the show was brought back in 2004.

[01:09:12] The show is won three Emmys, been nominated 12 times, and it's just been renewed for its

[01:09:18] 21st, 22nd and 23rd seasons.

[01:09:21] Damn.

[01:09:22] Take that to Simpsons.

[01:09:23] The family guy theme, as you alluded to a few moments ago, a little bit controversial.

[01:09:28] I know Pat did not want to do this game.

[01:09:31] Pat is always being, Pat is about being family friendly.

[01:09:34] He said that in multiple interviews.

[01:09:37] Pat says, when I see that line being crossed, I don't like it.

[01:09:40] Why not cast a wide net and try to bring in more people?

[01:09:43] There is a group in pinball that are really hyper focused on family friendly pinball.

[01:09:48] Why is that such a focus, Ron?

[01:09:50] Because they have it in their homes and they have kids.

[01:09:53] So you're telling me that machines with Satan, boobs and swearing and sperm, just not a big thing?

[01:10:01] Games like Walking Dead.

[01:10:03] I mean, look at the art on there.

[01:10:05] I know there's people who wouldn't own it because of that.

[01:10:08] The reason I don't have an iron maiden.

[01:10:10] I mean, even getting...

[01:10:11] Pretty bad by my wife.

[01:10:12] This is...

[01:10:13] It's not just a pinball.

[01:10:14] Back in the day, I think it was...

[01:10:16] I think it was Balli Midway.

[01:10:18] I think George Gomez has said this.

[01:10:20] The Satan's Hollow, which is a video game, which had his joystick on it the one he designed.

[01:10:24] And they couldn't sell him in the South.

[01:10:26] So they already took away some of the...

[01:10:28] And the game we just talked about, Masscar.

[01:10:31] They kind of hurt...

[01:10:32] I mean, they had the Grand Prix version.

[01:10:34] They hurt yourself when you don't have either universal themes.

[01:10:37] You know, you want the widest reaching theme possible.

[01:10:40] That's why we're seeing Marvel.

[01:10:42] We're seeing Jurassic Park.

[01:10:44] I mean, back when you started Wheel of Fortune, no one like, why are they doing Wheel of Fortune?

[01:10:48] Because in Europe, the Wheel of Fortune is nothing.

[01:10:51] It's not even...

[01:10:52] I mean, I'm a big, Alex Trebek guy.

[01:10:54] I'm not dealing with that Wheel of Fortune crap.

[01:10:57] I want that jeopardy stuff.

[01:11:00] You start sort of focusing in even tighter on an already niche market, right?

[01:11:06] And I agree.

[01:11:07] Something like Rick and Morty.

[01:11:09] Yeah, I'm sure he's not a fan of that.

[01:11:11] If you think about Family Guy, you know, that was pretty racy.

[01:11:15] And it was often compared to The Simpsons, which in it's time was quite racy, which is now quite tame.

[01:11:20] And then you look now at Rick and Morty, which is way out there.

[01:11:25] And that's almost like the Family Guy of today.

[01:11:28] So, there are keeps moving.

[01:11:30] And, you know, there's something to be said about that.

[01:11:33] Like, I have a Simpsons in my house.

[01:11:36] You know, when my kids play it, they think it's all, you know, fun and games and whatever.

[01:11:39] But if I had a Rick and Morty, and there's like aliens exploding and swearing and all that stuff, like that's, you know, that's pretty different.

[01:11:47] Callouts, callouts, callouts, callouts, callouts, callouts.

[01:11:50] Oh my god, the callouts on this game are amazing.

[01:11:54] Amazing.

[01:11:56] They created one of the best universes ever, with some of the best characters ever, and all of the callouts are in there.

[01:12:04] Which luckily most of the cast is done by Seth McFarlane. So, the only had to pay one guy.

[01:12:08] Yeah.

[01:12:10] Stewie Pinball, you want to talk about that?

[01:12:13] Yes, I will.

[01:12:15] As I will.

[01:12:16] Steve Richie would say that Black Knight is the best upper play field ever until Stewie Pinball.

[01:12:21] That's quite the compliment from somebody like Steve Richie, who him and Pat Lawler don't really get along.

[01:12:26] I think it was the best mini play field of its kind until Monsters.

[01:12:29] Yeah, I would totally agree, because it's actually Pinball.

[01:12:32] Because they took the same blipper vats, the same, they basically took the same thing and they added ramps.

[01:12:37] Well, actually what am I saying? What am I saying? I'm going to get corrected again.

[01:12:40] The other freaking Stewie Playfield had ramps. What am I thinking? They added multi ball.

[01:12:44] Yeah.

[01:12:45] You could lock the ball and play multi ball mini playfield.

[01:12:48] You know what you're saying thing about the Stewie mini playfield?

[01:12:51] It's one of the first times I can remember LEDs on a production game.

[01:12:57] I remember that because they flashed a little differently.

[01:13:00] It's like, because they're LEDs, it's smaller, they'd have fit them in there.

[01:13:03] Yeah, and it's not just mini flippers. They're like little teeny tiny flippers.

[01:13:08] Oh, they're tiny flippers. Tiny flippers. They're fun to work on, I'll tell you that.

[01:13:12] The only issue that I have.

[01:13:16] Now I've played Shrek and we'll get into that in a minute.

[01:13:19] Is that when you're up there, it's the same problem you kind of have with monsters.

[01:13:24] Is it's kind of numb.

[01:13:27] Like, like there's no kinetic feedback. Is this sort of like you just kind of hear like a click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, you can't feel it.

[01:13:35] Which is not a big deal, but at the same time when you're playing pinball, it kind of feels weird.

[01:13:39] Are you saying you're not feeling me?

[01:13:41] Here we go.

[01:13:42] It's a lot of fun. This game is a lot. I would probably have one of these.

[01:13:47] I've never shot one, but theme alone, theme, theme, theme, theme is everything.

[01:13:51] Come on, man.

[01:13:52] I own one.

[01:13:54] I'll say it's...

[01:13:55] No, you owned one.

[01:13:56] Oh, I own one. I'll say it's the last game I can think of that had the ball saver between the flippers, the pop-up post.

[01:14:04] Oh, yeah.

[01:14:05] I can't think of one since then that's had that.

[01:14:08] Pretty simple.

[01:14:09] Like a nice next one.

[01:14:10] It's a pretty simple Mac actually.

[01:14:12] But the thing about the play field, it has the super cool, stewey mini play field.

[01:14:17] However, if you actually take that play field off the game and you just look at the play field, it's barren.

[01:14:22] There's always nothing on it at all.

[01:14:25] I would say that's...

[01:14:27] If I had a criticism.

[01:14:29] But I mean, all your callouts make up for that.

[01:14:32] Yeah, it's like...

[01:14:33] Keith Johnson has this reputation for like...

[01:14:37] You need to save your pinball machines and layout.

[01:14:41] You need Keith Johnson on code.

[01:14:43] Yeah, Keith Johnson did the wizard modes on this.

[01:14:45] So like the TV wizard mode, which is super cool.

[01:14:48] The fact that if you have any game with the second play field, you have to have some kind of mode where that and the main play field are active at the same time.

[01:14:56] It's just required, in my opinion.

[01:14:59] The bash toy is also really cool.

[01:15:01] It's got...it's like a beer.

[01:15:03] Yep.

[01:15:04] A Pawl-Tucket Patriot with Brian on the top.

[01:15:06] The only things that aren't really clear to me, did you know that Peter...

[01:15:10] Peter...everyone has a shot.

[01:15:12] So you know, Lois is the spinner.

[01:15:14] And they're pretty obvious for the...

[01:15:16] The Meg is...

[01:15:17] Meg, where she... her figurine is.

[01:15:19] Chris is the ramp.

[01:15:20] Stewie is like the...the captive ball.

[01:15:23] Because it got his picture right there of him firing his laser.

[01:15:26] Brian is the...the can.

[01:15:29] But what's Peter?

[01:15:30] What's Peter's shot?

[01:15:33] The...no, the ramp is...

[01:15:36] That's the...the...the...

[01:15:38] The answer is...it's the pop-up where he's standing on.

[01:15:40] Oh!

[01:15:41] I had the only game and I didn't know that.

[01:15:43] That's a good point.

[01:15:44] Like, you know, shoot Peter.

[01:15:46] Okay.

[01:15:47] Where the hell is that?

[01:15:48] You just shoot the pop-up or that Peter's standing on.

[01:15:50] That's his shot.

[01:15:51] And I mean, it's...this is a weird pat-lawler.

[01:15:54] It's only got one ramp.

[01:15:56] Yep. This is...

[01:15:59] It is a bear in playfield, except for the...it's got the Stewie Mini playfield and...

[01:16:03] Not much else on it.

[01:16:04] Do you think maybe Pat was a bit...um...

[01:16:07] Unhappy with the project and it sort of shows in his design or do you think he was just trying something different?

[01:16:12] No, he was just trying something different.

[01:16:14] I don't see him as a kind of...

[01:16:16] We just sabotaged the thing because he didn't like it.

[01:16:19] Well, I don't know if he didn't sabotage it, but maybe he just didn't give it a...

[01:16:22] You know, 100%.

[01:16:24] You know?

[01:16:25] Like, he's a very diplomatic guy.

[01:16:27] He knows how it goes and it's totally different than anything else he's done.

[01:16:31] So maybe that was just the problem.

[01:16:33] Well, Pat also said he...he heard feedback.

[01:16:35] He heard feedback like, there's no way I'm gonna buy this game because my wife won't let me.

[01:16:39] Or I can't put it in a kid friendly location. I'll get killed.

[01:16:42] So enter.

[01:16:44] The Shrek Re-Theme.

[01:16:46] Pat says...

[01:16:47] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

[01:16:49] Pat says, theme is everything, which is kind of funny if you think about the future, but...

[01:16:54] Theme is everything and that's why they thought, okay, how do we save this game?

[01:17:00] Well, let's re-theme it to Shrek, which was a big deal at the time.

[01:17:04] The movie Shrek and the series that it would create.

[01:17:07] Another person who was very instrumental in getting the theme change was a man named...

[01:17:12] Jersey Jack Winery.

[01:17:13] Let the Italian...

[01:17:14] Winery.

[01:17:15] Let the Italian help you.

[01:17:16] Thank you.

[01:17:17] Keith says they released 1500 units, then only about 900, and Stern began to worry about all the parts they had.

[01:17:24] That's true. They had a 1500 unit, I think a 2007, and then they had a shorter one in the beginning of 2008.

[01:17:31] At that point, they had the idea to make Shrek, which was a Jersey Jack idea.

[01:17:36] Then when we brought the game out there, people really liked the game, and they bought up the 1500 machines and a few more.

[01:17:41] I don't know what the final number was, then they had to buy more stuff for family guy.

[01:17:46] It did pretty well and was well received in the end.

[01:17:48] Yeah, so what happened was that it didn't take off really quickly.

[01:17:53] It was a bit of a slow burn.

[01:17:55] Stern, along with a lot of the distributors, like Jersey Jack, who was a big distributor at the time, started to worry and panic.

[01:18:05] So then they're like, oh god, how do we fix this?

[01:18:07] And they're like, kid friendly, quick, the theme.

[01:18:09] So then they picked Shrek, and they just sort of took the exact same play field, changed the art, changed the dots, and the callouts.

[01:18:18] And you've got to hold totally different game.

[01:18:20] And the cool thing is if you owned either game, you could play either game software.

[01:18:24] So I have actually paid a Shrek, played one in Halifax. Didn't like it.

[01:18:30] Yeah, I've switched my family guy out with the Shrek for a while.

[01:18:35] See, I would probably take the Shrek and make it a family guy.

[01:18:40] Now, Shrek, of course, is the 2001 American computer animated fantasy romantic comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairy tale movies and books that were done by William Stegg directed by Adam Adamson, which is a very, or directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicki Jensen with their deck directorial debut.

[01:19:07] It also stars Mike Myers, Mike Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John let's go as some of the voices.

[01:19:15] Shrek was like, I love the original Shrek, and of course, like all animated features.

[01:19:21] They just have to take something that's really awesome and just beat it to death.

[01:19:25] And really, really, really enjoyed this because it's like a spoof of fairy tales in general.

[01:19:31] Shrek itself had a budget of $60 million and it did a box office of $484 million, which was huge.

[01:19:42] One of my favorite characters of all time is the gingerbread man from the Shrek movies.

[01:19:50] When they break his legs off and then they tease him about running away and he can't because just hysterical.

[01:19:58] And it also made sure that we had the worst fricking song of all time played over and over and over.

[01:20:09] That's all star by Smash Mouth.

[01:20:12] Jeff Powell, who was the sound guy for the game, he says another huge nightmare was enailing down the licensing of Smash Mouth's All Star for the opening music of the game.

[01:20:21] I recorded an instrumental version of the tune with Dan Peters, a guitarist Chris Granner introduced me two years ago.

[01:20:27] We also found a singer who was able to piece together for us a reasonable vocal knockoff.

[01:20:32] Well, Smash Mouth said they would not allow anything but the original recording to go into the game, which of course meant bigger bucks.

[01:20:40] I have no information as to what Gary paid, but ultimately the original recording starts the game and runs through the first chorus.

[01:20:46] From that point, it's my instrumental version during the remainder of the general main play.

[01:20:51] That didn't sound like a lot of fun. So here you go.

[01:20:53] We're freaking out because we've spent all this time and money with Pat Lawler designs to get family guy.

[01:20:59] And we're panicking because it doesn't seem to be selling very well.

[01:21:03] We changed the theme and now we're running into a whole lot of other costs.

[01:21:08] And a lot of other spending that we have to do with this pinball machine Shrek.

[01:21:15] And that sounds horrible.

[01:21:18] Maybe that's why they took one of the coils out of the game.

[01:21:21] Oh, so why don't you explain that?

[01:21:23] On family guy, the Meg shot, if you hit Meg, she bounces up and down.

[01:21:28] Meg.

[01:21:29] I like how they made the shot worthless in the game.

[01:21:32] It's still perfect to the theme.

[01:21:33] But she bounces up and down on Shrek.

[01:21:36] I don't know what character is in the same spot, but they don't do anything.

[01:21:39] They don't move.

[01:21:40] The coil isn't there.

[01:21:42] So that's some money they saved.

[01:21:44] I'm trying to figure out there's something else here about Shrek.

[01:21:47] Well, it's green.

[01:21:48] And you have the donkey play field instead of the stewie play field.

[01:21:52] Yeah, and the donkey.

[01:21:54] That's, you know, that's the one.

[01:21:56] If you're running Shrek's software in a family guy, stewie never faces the right direction.

[01:22:02] Because it's coded for donkey.

[01:22:05] Who's facing in the other direction?

[01:22:07] Yeah.

[01:22:08] Yeah.

[01:22:09] Yeah, when he moves, he's like he's never in the right position.

[01:22:11] I think in the end, many more family guys were actually sold than Shrek's.

[01:22:18] I don't have those numbers, but I think I heard it.

[01:22:21] Somebody else mentioned it in a roundabout podcast somewhere.

[01:22:25] And I didn't write it down and I'm kicking myself on the butt now that I didn't.

[01:22:28] But I just, it was looking for the sales numbers.

[01:22:30] And I can't seem to find them here.

[01:22:32] I just like that.

[01:22:33] They're all sound alike in the game.

[01:22:35] Yeah.

[01:22:36] But they had to be, but they had to be approved by the actual actors.

[01:22:38] We talked about that a little bit in our previous episode about John Borg, about Mike Myers being sort of difficult to kind of work with.

[01:22:46] Or not necessarily wanting to work with the individual.

[01:22:50] So they had to do a lot of a lifting directly, lifting of the audio directly from the movies.

[01:22:58] So that became a, you know, that became a thing.

[01:23:00] So now, now we've created this sort of albatross, which is the, you know, family guy Shrek games.

[01:23:06] And in the end, they sort of don't really, you know, they don't shoot the lights out with sales.

[01:23:12] Now, in the Williams days, Pat would say that the first question was always about what, what does the ball do?

[01:23:19] What do the shots do?

[01:23:20] And in the stern era that he found himself, the first question was, what's the theme?

[01:23:26] And of course, Gary was very smart about licensing.

[01:23:30] He'd been doing it for years.

[01:23:31] And rebranding a play field into Shrek, I think was probably a massive risk.

[01:23:38] Because if you remember something like Jackpot, where Jackpot is the exact same play field as the pinbott play field,

[01:23:46] just with a DMD and some updated code, boy, Williams really took it on the chin from people when they said,

[01:23:52] they did that.

[01:23:53] But as Pat Lawler said, our distributors hated us.

[01:23:58] Don't you dare give us the same play field.

[01:24:01] Yeah.

[01:24:02] So they were gambling here with Shrek being the same play field.

[01:24:06] And it went over OK.

[01:24:07] Didn't go over bad.

[01:24:09] But, you know, they didn't rape, they didn't rake them over the coals.

[01:24:13] Do you know who was originally supposed to be Shrek?

[01:24:16] Oh.

[01:24:17] Chris Farley.

[01:24:18] No.

[01:24:19] I think he was actually recorded a good portion of the speech.

[01:24:22] That's disappointing.

[01:24:23] Yeah.

[01:24:24] More useless information.

[01:24:27] Yeah.

[01:24:29] So it was said that, well, I got it here.

[01:24:32] It said, Shrek sold in the hundreds and family guy sold about 3,000.

[01:24:36] So there you go.

[01:24:37] Yeah.

[01:24:38] Seeing way more.

[01:24:39] Way more family guys than I've ever seen Shrek.

[01:24:42] But Chip Curtis, the engineer from Pat Lawler Design, says,

[01:24:45] I did the lamp effects and all the low level code support for Stewie's play field.

[01:24:49] I also designed the electronics for Stewie's doll and the electronics for the play field.

[01:24:53] Good or bad, the electronics in the mini play field was all mine.

[01:24:56] LEDs were still hated in pinball.

[01:24:58] Well, that's hard to believe.

[01:24:59] So my philosophy was to stay away from lamp effects used in tungsten lamps.

[01:25:04] Tungsten lamps.

[01:25:06] I guess that's just a regular old lamp.

[01:25:08] OK.

[01:25:09] LEDs were still hated in pinball.

[01:25:11] So my philosophy was to stay away from the lamp effects used in regular lamps.

[01:25:15] And focus on the effects and attributes that LEDs were capable of.

[01:25:18] Fast.

[01:25:19] Fast was what I aimed for.

[01:25:21] Just make it dazzle.

[01:25:22] Now towards the end, corporate took over all the software development for the machines.

[01:25:27] So you can see that they were concerned about this machine very much from it's from the get go.

[01:25:32] And it was bittersweet.

[01:25:34] Chip would also say that we weren't happy with the direction that the games were going.

[01:25:39] So we were grateful to let go of it.

[01:25:41] But it wasn't the game that we wanted to make.

[01:25:44] So we were sad to see it go.

[01:25:47] So it ended up being a bit of a mess this game.

[01:25:50] And I think this is sort of where Pat and Pat Law are designs.

[01:25:56] You know, they started to kind of not be all warm and cozy with everybody at Stern and they started growing apart.

[01:26:04] This brings us into the next game.

[01:26:07] CSI.

[01:26:08] And television show theme November of 2008.

[01:26:13] It's a Stern Sam board set.

[01:26:16] Designed by Pat Lawler and John Borg.

[01:26:19] John, you see Margaret Hudson on art David Thea on Sound software by Lonnie Robb Keith P. Johnson,

[01:26:25] Lyman Sheets Jr.

[01:26:27] And Mike Sviet.

[01:26:29] We have a Pat Lawler and John Borg.

[01:26:32] What happened here?

[01:26:34] What happened here, Ron?

[01:26:36] Well, one thing that happened was CSI, someone on CSI, the producer, the director,

[01:26:42] one of the main people who ran the show was a pinhead.

[01:26:47] So that's where it eventually got pitched.

[01:26:50] That's how the game came to be.

[01:26:52] And CSI.

[01:26:54] CSI is still a fairly big show kind of now.

[01:26:57] The different spin-offs of it.

[01:26:59] Well, CSI was a big show.

[01:27:02] It's first five or six seasons.

[01:27:04] Yeah, like huge.

[01:27:05] Yeah.

[01:27:06] By the time they made this game, several of the cast members have left.

[01:27:11] Including I think the main guy, what the hell was his name?

[01:27:14] William Peterson.

[01:27:15] The actor.

[01:27:16] He had just left before the game came out.

[01:27:19] But he's on the back.

[01:27:20] He's on the back.

[01:27:21] He's clashes off all the time.

[01:27:22] No, that's David Kruzio.

[01:27:23] That's CSI Miami, you're thinking of.

[01:27:26] Yeah.

[01:27:27] So he left.

[01:27:30] I remember, he left the show, but the game had him on there.

[01:27:33] He was still on the show and is in development.

[01:27:35] They left him on the back last, which was smart because he was the main.

[01:27:38] This game is probably best known for its art package.

[01:27:43] I mean Photoshop art.

[01:27:46] It's this is the like coming from a guy who has a tron.

[01:27:50] This is like the pinnacle of really bad Photoshop, stern art.

[01:27:58] You know, like this is this bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

[01:28:02] It has one good art element.

[01:28:04] Did you know it has a custom shooter rod?

[01:28:06] No.

[01:28:07] Like from the factory?

[01:28:08] Yep.

[01:28:09] It's not like a $200 on the shooter rod.

[01:28:13] It has a thumb print on the end of it.

[01:28:16] Oh, yeah.

[01:28:17] It's like a like a police thing.

[01:28:21] So it's a guy.

[01:28:23] Yeah, yeah.

[01:28:24] It's so cool.

[01:28:25] Now CSI was a big deal.

[01:28:29] But the biggest deal is this amazing skull lock that this game has.

[01:28:37] Oh, wait, actually, before we get into that, let's chat a little bit about this art.

[01:28:42] So John Yaucy was the lead on this art.

[01:28:47] So he would always work with Pat Lawler.

[01:28:49] He's worked with Pat Lawler on everything since Earth Shaker.

[01:28:54] And he's always been a pen and ink.

[01:28:57] You know, airbrush kind of guy.

[01:29:00] John says, I avoided digital for a long time as much as I could.

[01:29:03] It was a hostile takeover.

[01:29:04] I went kicking and screaming, but I ended up embracing it.

[01:29:07] I was lucky to get into it when I did when I can kind of transition easily to the new thing.

[01:29:12] Yeah, it was a big move from physical to digital art.

[01:29:15] The good old days.

[01:29:16] I'm traditionally trained, you know, and I learned to love the paint splatter and the stink.

[01:29:22] You know, the airbrush overspray.

[01:29:24] We all had big exhaust fans in our homes.

[01:29:27] And it was what we were born into.

[01:29:30] This is obviously when Photoshop was really the quick and easy get it done.

[01:29:41] But Photoshop then is not what sort of like Photoshop or Lightroom or whatever there is now, right?

[01:29:47] This is very much the sort of the beginnings of using digital art.

[01:29:53] And now that we have some perspective of like 10 years and looking back at this thing, it's like, oh my god, it's bad.

[01:30:00] But what isn't bad on this machine is an amazing toy, which is the skull lock.

[01:30:07] Can you explain some details on that one?

[01:30:09] I've never played a CSI.

[01:30:10] Oh, really?

[01:30:11] Well, you shoot the ramp and it goes into a skull and it was an eye socket.

[01:30:19] Then you like lowers down.

[01:30:21] I'm actually trying to remember myself.

[01:30:23] I believe he starts low.

[01:30:25] Then he raises up and you get a ball in his eye.

[01:30:28] Then he lowers again.

[01:30:30] Then it'll raise up again and you get another ball in his eye from two locks.

[01:30:34] Then you just hit the ramp over and over if I recall.

[01:30:37] It's a cool back.

[01:30:38] Then it has a set refuse.

[01:30:40] Then it comes all the way up and then it falls down.

[01:30:42] Yeah.

[01:30:43] It's a set refuse.

[01:30:45] Now the thing is, when this game was being made,

[01:30:50] somewhere in the middle of the production, Pat Waller quits.

[01:30:54] Oh, he's done.

[01:30:56] He's done.

[01:30:57] I don't think I've ever read too much detail about what exactly happened,

[01:31:01] but he quit and Borg had to come in to finish up the game.

[01:31:06] He doesn't talk about this in this 2010 podcast because it's only a couple of years out since he left, right?

[01:31:11] So it's still maybe a bit fresh.

[01:31:14] Nor have I heard any interviews later where he's talked about either.

[01:31:18] I remember when I was in development, I remember being an expo in October,

[01:31:22] month before it came out.

[01:31:24] And Waller was there, but he just stopped by to visit and left quickly.

[01:31:28] And the word was around like, yeah, he quit.

[01:31:30] He's not on the game anymore.

[01:31:32] Yeah.

[01:31:33] So Pat Waller designs sort of around this time also more or less dissolves, right?

[01:31:38] You don't have the formal Pat Waller design anymore, the website.

[01:31:42] Now this is a, you know, 10 years later, 12 years later, doesn't exist anymore.

[01:31:47] It might on paper and tax filings, but you know, it's not Pat Waller designs anymore.

[01:31:51] It's Pat Waller working for Jersey Jack around the time that Williams went under,

[01:31:56] Pat created Pat Waller designs.

[01:31:59] And that's where he would do his independent contracting.

[01:32:02] And he brought in guys like Chip Curtis, who did a lot of the programming and mechanics.

[01:32:08] He brought on John Yosey, who did an exclusive contract on all of his designs.

[01:32:13] So he sort of had created this kind of foe company itself.

[01:32:17] And in fact, Pat Waller designs was in talks with Jean Cunningham after he bought a lot of the William Williams assets.

[01:32:24] And we'll get into a whole Jean Cunningham episode some other time.

[01:32:28] They never did actually come together with Jean Cunningham.

[01:32:31] And that's when Pat Waller designs ended up over at Stern.

[01:32:34] And we can see that that sort of, you know, it lasted what like eight years about.

[01:32:38] And then it sort of ended and it ended in a way where nobody who works around it really talks about it.

[01:32:44] So we'll leave it at that, I guess.

[01:32:46] Yeah. I've never heard anything from either side.

[01:32:49] It brings us sort of into the post great recession of 2008 era.

[01:32:53] And that was a whole, a whole mess of a thing.

[01:32:57] Now, you know, as much as we are a history pinball podcast.

[01:33:00] I can be a podcast in itself.

[01:33:02] Yeah.

[01:33:03] And then it collapsed right after expo 2008 Stern fired everybody.

[01:33:08] They did the right sizing.

[01:33:11] I think it was called at the time.

[01:33:13] But I mean, they fired.

[01:33:15] They just had Borgas all these like.

[01:33:17] Yeah, they Borg was their only programmer.

[01:33:19] Lime and sheets and Lonnie Ropper, they're only coders.

[01:33:22] And they started making games like well, they had the games that were in development before this happened that came out, which was for CSI.

[01:33:30] And then 24.

[01:33:32] They were the last full featured games for the $4,000 price point or whatever it was.

[01:33:37] And then they did like NBA big buck honor Iron Man.

[01:33:43] How little could we put into a game and still pretty much.

[01:33:48] That's when they get rid of like the service rails underneath the play field and start putting pegs in.

[01:33:54] Oh, yes, they started that with Iron Man.

[01:33:57] They're using plastic aprons instead of metal aprons.

[01:34:01] Like they are trying to save a dollar or whatever they can save a dollar.

[01:34:04] And you know, God bless Gary Stern and those guys for doing that because that's a tough call, man.

[01:34:09] And they're still here because of it.

[01:34:11] And the world was totally different man.

[01:34:13] Everybody was incredibly panicked about manufacturing in general.

[01:34:16] You know, major companies like Ford and Chevrolet, you know, having major issues with their finances.

[01:34:23] You know, Chrysler going bankrupt that kind of stuff, right?

[01:34:26] So it's a it's a tumultuous time in everything, let alone pinball.

[01:34:32] It was two years after that where Pat Lawler is doing his, the podcast, which, well, quite a few of these ancient or older quotes come from.

[01:34:43] And he generally said that pinball now has two paths to either live or die.

[01:34:50] The first path was to sell the products only to collectors and to sell as many as you can to people who will put them into their basement.

[01:34:58] So that's it.

[01:34:59] Either you know, you sit back and you double down on people like you and I and those probably listed this podcast that are buying them for their home.

[01:35:06] And you completely forget about everybody else.

[01:35:09] So they have a different set of needs and wants right.

[01:35:13] They're going to want deeper code.

[01:35:14] They're going to want, you know, less stuff to break because you can't really work on them and that kind of stuff.

[01:35:21] He said path to that's where you try to revive pinball as a profit device and one that is designed to take money.

[01:35:31] Where pinball is a return on investment device.

[01:35:34] You buy this device, people put money into it on location and you make money.

[01:35:40] So if you're a manufacturer, your main goal is to make sure that those operators make money.

[01:35:45] Pat says you need to attract new customers to the game.

[01:35:48] You need to make machines like they were in the heyday.

[01:35:51] You need to be willing to take a risk.

[01:35:53] People want to see something new.

[01:35:55] We're past the point where you can keep stuffing toys into game and people will think it's cool.

[01:35:59] In this time in 2010, what do you think Stern was?

[01:36:02] Which one of those two?

[01:36:04] They were definitely not the home one.

[01:36:06] And they were more the operator than the home.

[01:36:08] They were like this really wishy, washy time, right?

[01:36:12] They kind of didn't have deep code.

[01:36:14] Well, they were trying to survive and honestly Stern, until the premiums and the L.E.'s and stuff started coming out, they did not really cater to the home buyer at all.

[01:36:23] Yeah, that's for sure.

[01:36:24] Now, if you look at something like Lord of the Rings or the Simpsons pinball party with their code and all of that crazy stuff, they're very much, you know, that's very much focused at the home market.

[01:36:33] Yes, they did probably decent on location, but long ball time.

[01:36:37] They played too long.

[01:36:38] That's one of the reasons they started going simpler and shorter ball times.

[01:36:42] Right.

[01:36:43] So you can see Pat's critique here is kind of like, okay, well, either you make a bunch of deep code or you don't.

[01:36:50] But you can't have an inspired game either.

[01:36:53] He seems to be going for path two.

[01:36:55] Yeah.

[01:36:56] But he joined a company that is clearly on path one.

[01:36:59] Right, which is kind of where we're kind of leading the crowd here as we go through today's podcast.

[01:37:03] But it's an interesting thing to say, okay, well, you need to get, you need to take a risk.

[01:37:09] Clearly, Stern was not taking any risks in 2010.

[01:37:12] And they probably wouldn't take any risks until maybe 13 or 14 like ACDC might have been a bit of a risk with a lot of the toys and stuff they put into that.

[01:37:23] Yeah, that's a pretty safe game.

[01:37:25] And the theme is perfect.

[01:37:26] When was the last one that they had to like they took a risk on?

[01:37:29] Really?

[01:37:30] Took a risk.

[01:37:32] Hey, Wheel of Fortune.

[01:37:34] Yeah, there's risky business.

[01:37:37] But you can see that they're playing it safe, right?

[01:37:39] Like, and they have very much been playing it safe since.

[01:37:42] But you can't just keep stuff in toys, any sense, right?

[01:37:45] Like that people think, cool, you got to have more there.

[01:37:48] He wants things to be more bally Williams-esque is what I read from that quote, right?

[01:37:53] Hence the heyday, yes.

[01:37:55] Yeah.

[01:37:56] Now the complaint around this time is that code was becoming too complex.

[01:38:00] And I remember when I first, after a few months into the hobby I found an old documentary, which everybody in this industry hates called Special When Lit.

[01:38:09] In there, there's a part where Dwight Sullivan is trying to explain the rules to pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:38:15] Code is becoming too complex.

[01:38:17] People want it to be just like it was in the Balli Williams days, right?

[01:38:20] That's, we're at a Pandora's Box now, right?

[01:38:22] We're a way ahead of that.

[01:38:24] So there's a lot of like time now where people are sitting back that we're in the industry and they're trying to say, how do we, how do we save it?

[01:38:32] Because quite frankly, a lot of people said that it would be dead by now.

[01:38:36] And we're going through another golden era.

[01:38:38] Pat had a couple of suggestions as to what you can do.

[01:38:42] Like actual specifics as to what you can do to change things.

[01:38:46] Lots of people basically know how to fix things, but they rarely actually do it.

[01:38:51] So for example, I know what Pat Loller would eventually go ahead and do it.

[01:38:55] So here's a couple of his suggestions.

[01:38:57] Pat says you need to make a small video thing in the game.

[01:39:00] A trap door with a character waving at you that you hit with the ball.

[01:39:03] I have the wherewithal to do all this innovation, but do I see anyone beating down the path to my door to do it?

[01:39:09] Question mark.

[01:39:10] That more or less sounds like, hey, I got all these great ideas and I'm just sitting here and nobody wants them.

[01:39:14] A trap door with a character waving at you.

[01:39:17] So what does sounds like dialed in, doesn't it?

[01:39:19] Yeah, it sounds like the QED guy.

[01:39:21] So I mean Gary Stern doing the best that he can with what he has.

[01:39:26] And the company in the way it is and manufacturing within North America, it was difficult.

[01:39:34] It basically took us 2008 all the way to really what, 2016, 2018 to really start digging our way out of that?

[01:39:45] I would say, oh, the economy or pinball?

[01:39:50] Yeah, they're just in general, right, to get things kind of feeling more normalish when it comes to outside of pinball in general, but sort of the economy as a whole.

[01:39:59] Things kind of finally started to feel pretty good until this whole COVID thing.

[01:40:04] Pat would say that every bump in pinball came from a technological innovation.

[01:40:08] It was some sort of technical innovation that ended up pushing it a little bit further.

[01:40:11] He said that the problem is an idea.

[01:40:13] The problem is building those ideas as production numbers go down.

[01:40:17] The parts manufacturing costs go up and this vicious cycle continues to take place.

[01:40:22] So it gets more expensive to build games as your production goes down and your production goes down because you're not innovating and putting enough cool things in your game.

[01:40:31] So it's like this is terrible, terrible.

[01:40:33] It's like circling the toilet drain.

[01:40:35] Larry Dimar says there are 99 bad ideas and one good one.

[01:40:40] It's our job to find the one good one.

[01:40:43] In his post-stern years, Pat basically did his home.

[01:40:46] He had his own home shop outside of Chicago where he'd been for many years.

[01:40:51] While he was at Stern and even before he was at Stern, he spent a lot of time creating prototyping materials,

[01:40:57] CNC machines, all of that stuff at home.

[01:41:00] He worked from home before it was cool, right, Ron?

[01:41:03] Yeah, he was ahead of his time.

[01:41:05] During this time, Pat would really work on a lot of redemption games for kids,

[01:41:10] which he described as technologically advanced beyond pinball,

[01:41:15] which is quite funny to think that those redemption games were more advanced than pinball,

[01:41:19] but I would probably agree with him.

[01:41:21] John Yousey would also leave Pat Loller designs along with the others,

[01:41:25] and Pat was asked if he would return to designing.

[01:41:29] He said that we need to shake up what these games do first,

[01:41:33] then maybe I'll give it another shot.

[01:41:35] Things got to change a little bit.

[01:41:38] Basically, it says, I don't want to work at Stern.

[01:41:41] Isn't that what that sounds like?

[01:41:44] Whatever happened with that breakup, it was a whole thing.

[01:41:48] Where does Pat end up next?

[01:41:51] I don't know. Where does he end up?

[01:41:54] Pat goes to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:41:57] Yeah, this new Young Start company.

[01:42:01] A young start? They're an upstart, too.

[01:42:03] Upstart, yes, this upstart company.

[01:42:05] What I read about Jersey Jack's beginnings is they were quite rocky.

[01:42:11] Is that true?

[01:42:13] Yeah, pretty much.

[01:42:16] We'll do a whole Jersey Jack episode.

[01:42:18] I don't want to give away too much.

[01:42:21] But they had a difficult time to go cost over runs,

[01:42:25] machines maybe being sold too much.

[01:42:27] Then all of a sudden they were bought out by an angel investor

[01:42:30] who's very much changed the face of the company now.

[01:42:35] During the time that Pat came aboard,

[01:42:38] J.J.P. was trying to finalize the Hobbit machine,

[01:42:41] and they ended up in financial troubles.

[01:42:44] They were acquired by the investor group who now runs the company.

[01:42:48] They needed these new investors.

[01:42:50] They wanted to really have an overseer of the company.

[01:42:54] An overseer of the head of design,

[01:42:57] Jersey Jack, the actual Jersey Jack,

[01:43:00] and the leadership team thought that maybe Pat Loller

[01:43:03] would be a good addition to the team.

[01:43:05] With some of Pat's ideas and thoughts,

[01:43:09] they started building up better model shop

[01:43:11] at a new facility in Chicago.

[01:43:13] They started to tool things up with a bunch of different machines

[01:43:16] that could do different designs and different things

[01:43:19] that they could use.

[01:43:21] Since that time, they have actually moved 100% of the manufacturing

[01:43:27] and design and everything all of it from Jersey to Chicago.

[01:43:32] Pat says going from good to great is to build them

[01:43:35] and fix all the problems.

[01:43:37] Steve Rich used to say all pinball machines look great on a piece of paper.

[01:43:40] Along with the management position at J.J.P.

[01:43:44] Pat was also able to design machines.

[01:43:48] There is a rumor that Pat demanded that he design an original game

[01:43:53] when he joined J.J.P.

[01:43:54] is one of the reasons that he would come aboard,

[01:43:59] basically a rider on his contract,

[01:44:02] which is not true in any way.

[01:44:05] And he has been given a lot of flack for his first machine at Jersey Jack,

[01:44:09] one that I really, really disagree with.

[01:44:13] Oh.

[01:44:14] The first Jersey Jack pinball machine was dialed in.

[01:44:18] Pat says after Jack had done the first J.J.P. games,

[01:44:21] he called me up and said, Pat, will you do an original game?

[01:44:24] I told him that was suicide.

[01:44:26] He shouldn't do an original game in this day and age,

[01:44:28] and people would never buy it.

[01:44:30] Lucky for me, it turned out I was wrong.

[01:44:33] In the history of what we do, it's very dangerous to do that.

[01:44:36] Almost everything in recent times has been a licensed product

[01:44:39] in one way or another.

[01:44:40] This isn't an interesting quote for a couple of reasons.

[01:44:43] One of them is that it was Jersey Jack's idea

[01:44:46] to make an original game.

[01:44:48] This is directly from Pat.

[01:44:50] This was not Pat Lawler's idea.

[01:44:52] The other thing was that Pat Lawler told Jack that it was probably

[01:44:55] a very bad idea, and nobody will buy something that's not a theme.

[01:44:58] And then he says,

[01:44:59] oh, good thing I was wrong,

[01:45:01] and he wasn't wrong.

[01:45:02] It did not sell.

[01:45:04] It is the selling game, I believe.

[01:45:08] And I think probably still their best.

[01:45:11] Okay, so I was told that I could use this specific quote.

[01:45:18] Dildin is my favorite Lawler game,

[01:45:21] and that comes from Dennis Kreisel from the Electric Gamers podcast

[01:45:25] and the pinball show.

[01:45:26] He also said some other things about Pat Lawler,

[01:45:29] but that was off the record.

[01:45:31] The other Pat Lawler story, I remember,

[01:45:35] is before he started working at the Jersey Jack,

[01:45:40] as the Renaissance of pinball was picking up steam.

[01:45:44] He was at a bar somewhere,

[01:45:46] and they were getting ready to do a tournament,

[01:45:48] and they had some guy there that was like really into Steve Richie.

[01:45:51] He was like really excited,

[01:45:53] and he starts talking to Pat.

[01:45:55] He has no idea what Pat Lawler is.

[01:45:57] And he says,

[01:45:58] that's Steve Richie, man, it's games that shit.

[01:46:00] Then he asks him,

[01:46:01] like, you ever play any pinball and Pat's, you know,

[01:46:03] back in the day, I played some pinball.

[01:46:07] Yeah, man.

[01:46:08] What had done a thing or two?

[01:46:09] But he said that was almost like,

[01:46:11] it kind of got the juices flowing.

[01:46:13] I can't remember what show he said that on,

[01:46:15] but I just remember that particular interview.

[01:46:17] I really, really like Dildin.

[01:46:21] I don't know what it is about,

[01:46:23] I'm very much a theme person, right?

[01:46:26] I got a Simpsons and a Tron.

[01:46:28] I'm all about theme, right?

[01:46:30] You're one for two.

[01:46:31] That's good.

[01:46:32] Right, I love love theme.

[01:46:36] Right, and I don't know if I would ever buy a machine

[01:46:39] that isn't a theme.

[01:46:40] But for some reason,

[01:46:42] it makes me smile so much to see Dildin

[01:46:46] and to play Dildin.

[01:46:47] It's just, it's whimsical, it's fun,

[01:46:50] it's a bit strange,

[01:46:52] it makes me laugh,

[01:46:54] it's a great game all around.

[01:46:57] And I was there.

[01:47:00] During the launch.

[01:47:01] I was there for the original reveal.

[01:47:04] Yeah, Raymond Dates say that Dildin is dope,

[01:47:08] which I think is how the young kids say cool.

[01:47:11] I would say it's lit or something.

[01:47:13] Yes, and that's a direct quote by the way.

[01:47:16] Yes, when they unveiled this at the Chicago pinball expo,

[01:47:19] you know, we're talking about, you know,

[01:47:21] the pad always seems to not be in the greatest of moods.

[01:47:24] This was polar opposite.

[01:47:26] This might have been the first time I ever saw him smile.

[01:47:29] He was 100% invested into this.

[01:47:32] Now is this the, is this the video that you can see on YouTube

[01:47:35] that I think I've included in the show notes?

[01:47:37] There might be, if it's the reveal stream.

[01:47:40] Yes.

[01:47:41] It wasn't a stream, but it was the reveal.

[01:47:43] Yes.

[01:47:44] He was literally, they had like a stage,

[01:47:46] they had the games below the stage.

[01:47:47] I think it was three of them, two or three of them.

[01:47:49] And he's just standing up on stage,

[01:47:51] just smiling for the whole thing.

[01:47:54] And if you had any doubts about his influence at Jersey Jack,

[01:47:59] when they unveiled the cabinet, number one, it's not a wide body,

[01:48:02] because he's not going to do a wide body.

[01:48:04] It doesn't want to do a wide body.

[01:48:05] He's very much on the record about how much he hates that.

[01:48:08] And one of the first things he says is,

[01:48:10] we've taken the, we've done a redesign of the cabinet,

[01:48:12] and we've taken the electronics from the body

[01:48:15] and put them into the back box where they belong.

[01:48:18] Like, woo!

[01:48:19] Like, okay, so I think I know who made that decision.

[01:48:23] Shots buyers.

[01:48:25] So, yeah, I think you get to see at least some of his influence at Jersey Jack.

[01:48:29] That's just like, no, we're putting this stuff in the back box.

[01:48:32] I've, the only time I've ever played a dialed in is when I'm on vacation.

[01:48:36] So, nobody has one of these in the Atlantic region as far as I know,

[01:48:41] or there's nobody who will let me in their house or has ever talked to me,

[01:48:44] which is quite possible.

[01:48:46] But I have played these on location,

[01:48:48] and it doesn't matter where I go, I always play this game.

[01:48:52] I think one of the reasons for that is the ramps and the flow

[01:48:59] and the kind of interesting things the ball does.

[01:49:02] Pat, outside of his home, he very much has a shop.

[01:49:07] He would always, he said a few times in some of these videos

[01:49:11] that were only as good as the models that we can build.

[01:49:14] So, his shop was very much a throwback to the Bally Williams philosophy

[01:49:18] where he could experiment and play with a lot of these toys.

[01:49:22] This machine, the ramps are, you know, the machines called dialed in,

[01:49:27] but the ramps are dialed in.

[01:49:29] The ramps are interesting, the orbits are interesting,

[01:49:32] everything feels really good.

[01:49:35] He had a lot of time and a lot of fun designing this.

[01:49:38] A lot of the ramp work and play field stuff was done

[01:49:43] while the engineering team was actually trying to finish up the hobbit.

[01:49:47] So, he had a lot of lead time to sort of play an experiment

[01:49:50] because they were still trying to get the other machine.

[01:49:53] He worked on this for a year and a half, it's two years, it is a long.

[01:49:57] You can really, you can see that in the tweaking.

[01:50:00] One of those things is the orbit ramp.

[01:50:02] So, the plunge or the orbit ramp?

[01:50:04] Now, it's a very unique shot.

[01:50:05] So, it's the right orbit and it goes up into a ramp

[01:50:08] that kind of comes through the middle and then back down to the right side.

[01:50:12] Pat wasn't sure if it would work.

[01:50:14] Now, you're asking yourself, well, come on, everybody's done a, you know,

[01:50:17] George Gomez has done a play field to a ramp thing like a million times.

[01:50:21] What does he mean?

[01:50:22] Well, he really wanted to change the way the play field ramp transition went.

[01:50:27] Usually, it's a wire form that's kind of hammered into the play field.

[01:50:31] Pat Lollard didn't like that design.

[01:50:33] He didn't think it was, it wasn't smooth enough.

[01:50:35] It didn't go quick enough.

[01:50:37] What is it, now I don't know, Ron?

[01:50:39] What is it, what is that transition like on the play field?

[01:50:41] What does it look like?

[01:50:42] I actually don't know. It's in the back of the play field.

[01:50:45] You have to really look close in there.

[01:50:47] You might even have to take some stuff off if you want to really look at what it's doing.

[01:50:51] You can tell when you plunge that ball or you shoot that orbit, it is incredibly smooth.

[01:50:57] And it is.

[01:50:58] Like where it kind of goes halfway up and then comes back down like months,

[01:51:02] it's not as tight and as quick as the one in Lord of the Rings by George Gomez as well.

[01:51:10] Whatever he did there, you can tell it worked.

[01:51:14] And it worked because he had time to develop it.

[01:51:17] You're really into the ramp.

[01:51:19] What about the cell phone?

[01:51:21] I love dialed in.

[01:51:23] I'm like the craziest person out there.

[01:51:25] People think I'm like insane.

[01:51:26] They're like, but it's got mom jeans in the middle of the play field.

[01:51:29] But the cell phone.

[01:51:30] It's great.

[01:51:31] It's got a cell phone.

[01:51:33] See, the thing is, it's a bizarre theme.

[01:51:36] And either you get it or you don't.

[01:51:38] Yeah.

[01:51:39] And if you get it, like I play, when I play the prototype, I just, I got it.

[01:51:44] It's like, okay, the phone, every, all these disasters, goofy characters.

[01:51:49] I like goofy stuff.

[01:51:51] Music was killer.

[01:51:52] David Thiel.

[01:51:53] And Jersey Jack.

[01:51:54] Oh, the sound is.

[01:51:55] The sound is insane.

[01:51:57] And it was nice to play a non-wide body Jersey Jack game to be honest.

[01:52:02] That shot that good.

[01:52:04] I just was never, I was never used to fan of.

[01:52:07] Was it Vos or the Hobbit, but this thing.

[01:52:13] Yeah.

[01:52:14] When I played it, it's like, I may have to get it.

[01:52:16] Jersey Jack game.

[01:52:17] Yeah.

[01:52:18] I feel bad that it gets as much crap as it does, because I think it's a great game.

[01:52:22] But it is a weird theme.

[01:52:24] It's totally weird.

[01:52:25] What's the cell phone?

[01:52:26] What are the disasters?

[01:52:27] Are you causing the disasters?

[01:52:29] Is the phone causing this?

[01:52:30] Are you the bad guy?

[01:52:31] What exactly?

[01:52:32] What's QED?

[01:52:33] What's this woman in the back with the, what is she there for?

[01:52:36] What's going on?

[01:52:37] There's people driving.

[01:52:38] They're like, theme is everything, David.

[01:52:40] The reason it's not a good game is because it's not Sim City.

[01:52:44] Or it's not, you know, Guardians of the Galaxy.

[01:52:47] And I'm like, yes, I know that.

[01:52:49] But I'm not like, everybody listening to this is like some weirdo enthusiast in the industry.

[01:52:54] Right?

[01:52:55] He said it, not me.

[01:52:56] We're able to look at it differently than somebody who's coming into a random showroom

[01:53:02] and sees Guardians of the Galaxy or dialed in.

[01:53:05] Right?

[01:53:06] Like, they're going to go Guardians of the Galaxy because they don't know any better.

[01:53:09] They don't know the ramps are too tight.

[01:53:11] And the LCD screen sucks.

[01:53:14] Wow.

[01:53:15] Sorry, John Borg.

[01:53:16] No, they see Groot.

[01:53:17] And like, that's Groot.

[01:53:18] I know what that is.

[01:53:19] Right.

[01:53:20] So I realized that yes, the theme is better and the theme is everything.

[01:53:24] But man, I would buy a dialed in if it wasn't a fortune here in Canada.

[01:53:29] They're still available.

[01:53:30] The theater is pretty cool.

[01:53:32] Yeah.

[01:53:33] I can probably get a CE if I wanted.

[01:53:34] The theater originally had a drop target in the middle and it was taken out.

[01:53:39] What do you mean costing a JJP?

[01:53:41] Right?

[01:53:42] Like, they never cost anything.

[01:53:43] Oh, no.

[01:53:44] According to Pat, he says you put things in, you think it'll be fun, cool, or exciting.

[01:53:48] You might learn they ain't.

[01:53:50] You also have to think about the kinetics or putting wires on the underside of the play field.

[01:53:54] All the costs should be reviewed.

[01:53:56] So it's till they have a hologram in there.

[01:53:58] Yeah.

[01:53:59] The drones?

[01:54:00] Those little drones on the right side?

[01:54:02] They, you know, every now and then you hit them and they spin, they just go, yeah.

[01:54:06] Yeah.

[01:54:07] They're from Amazon.

[01:54:08] So they ordered them from China.

[01:54:10] They come in from China, JJP sort of like, changes, creates a little circuit board and solders them all on.

[01:54:17] And they did have problems with those.

[01:54:19] A lot of them died.

[01:54:20] Did yours die?

[01:54:21] Mine still spin.

[01:54:22] Yeah.

[01:54:23] So they'll, you know, you give them a call up and they'll replace them.

[01:54:26] You know, let's talk about the development of this theme.

[01:54:29] Right.

[01:54:30] Where did this theme come from?

[01:54:32] Well, Pat, you know, obviously they sit back and they go, what's popular with kids today?

[01:54:40] Mobile phones.

[01:54:41] Right.

[01:54:42] Like, I don't necessarily think that that's how the discussion went.

[01:54:46] But, you know, everybody's got a mobile phone.

[01:54:48] Your mobile phone runs your freaking house now.

[01:54:50] Even my Christmas lights could turn out by my mobile phone.

[01:54:53] Well, they originally called it killer app.

[01:54:57] And they didn't think they're putting killer and it was a really good idea for location play.

[01:55:02] And then they thought, okay, well, if the cell phone's in there, maybe like the secret government organization lost the phone.

[01:55:11] And this phone was able to control like a bunch of secret government weather control disaster devices.

[01:55:19] At the beginning of the project, they actually didn't have an artist.

[01:55:23] Because John Yousey wasn't really available at first.

[01:55:27] So what they did is they commissioned another artist who just did a bunch of concepts.

[01:55:32] And a lot of those concepts came out of these like 50s robot B movie kind of style, which I think would probably have been better.

[01:55:42] What do you think?

[01:55:43] I agree.

[01:55:44] And Betty, if you want to, Betty is the woman in the back of the game.

[01:55:48] Like the diverter.

[01:55:49] The diverter.

[01:55:50] She's supposed to be representation of a giant characters that sold things on the side of Route 66.

[01:55:56] Yeah. So instead of like a robot, they kind of wanted a character or like 50s B movies.

[01:56:02] They would kind of like push the ball away.

[01:56:04] She's like one of those like roadside signs.

[01:56:08] And the QED is an exterminator.

[01:56:10] He's the exterminator, dude.

[01:56:12] They put a spider on the post and the mech didn't fit.

[01:56:15] So the spider stayed.

[01:56:16] They were going to jump up and down like scared stiff.

[01:56:18] So there's a lot of kind of like collaboration going on on this thing, right?

[01:56:23] Like it was like a 50s B movie with like giant spiders and you know killer robots and mutant rats and spiders and zombie cats.

[01:56:35] They would say and it just didn't make it in the end.

[01:56:39] Which I think is kind of cool.

[01:56:42] One thing that Pat had predicted in that 2010 top cast interview was putting screens under the glass.

[01:56:52] Well, this is the first pinball machine that has three screens.

[01:56:57] So it's got the large LCD monitor in the back glass.

[01:57:01] It has the phone under the above the scoop.

[01:57:07] Right. It has the phone above the scoop.

[01:57:10] And it also has the theater to the left.

[01:57:12] So these are three independently run screens and monitors.

[01:57:19] All of them being run by the same operating system.

[01:57:23] All of them running different things at different times.

[01:57:28] That's seriously difficult.

[01:57:30] Like that's a technological feat that I don't think people give enough credit to that machine for.

[01:57:35] What do you think? Do you think that's easy? Come on.

[01:57:40] I'm not a programmer. I'm guessing not.

[01:57:44] It's like just drag and drop, right? You just put it in the file.

[01:57:47] Don't forget it has a camera.

[01:57:49] Yeah. That's a cool bit.

[01:57:51] It was actually Jersey Jack's idea to put the camera in the game.

[01:57:54] Jack's got some bad ideas, but man, he's got some good ideas sometimes too.

[01:57:57] And they're still using the camera.

[01:57:59] One of the biggest issues with an original theme is what do you do with the LCD screen?

[01:58:04] What do you do with animations?

[01:58:06] And we know hands down unquestable 100% Jersey Jack is the best screen animations.

[01:58:12] Sometimes there's too many of them.

[01:58:15] And there might be too much going on.

[01:58:17] But they are the best.

[01:58:19] Now with the Hobbit, you've got 17 hours of, you know, pretty darn good movies.

[01:58:25] Now they're not Lord of the Rings good, but they're still very good.

[01:58:28] 17 hours. How many movies did they make?

[01:58:30] They did three movies.

[01:58:32] But they got like, but they got the extended versions of them, right?

[01:58:35] They're all like four hours.

[01:58:37] Even four hours is 12.

[01:58:39] Yeah, but then they've got like the special hours.

[01:58:43] Oh my God, that's way too much.

[01:58:46] They don't have that with dialed in, right?

[01:58:48] They got to make their own stuff.

[01:58:50] So Dan Multons, one of the head guys on the dialed in team.

[01:58:53] He was really integral with trying to figure out what the heck to do on this screen.

[01:58:57] He said we had to come up with some ideas.

[01:58:59] We thought how about a 24 hour newscast?

[01:59:02] They were big, so we went with that.

[01:59:04] We could have news tickers, real headlines and funny headlines.

[01:59:07] Except the Cubs been the World Series.

[01:59:09] That was a wishful thinking.

[01:59:11] Except they did.

[01:59:12] I know.

[01:59:13] So this machine was designed well before the Cubs did the World Series.

[01:59:15] So dialed in, predicted the Cubs winning the World Series is what you're saying.

[01:59:19] Exactly.

[01:59:20] And they probably won the World Series because of Jersey.

[01:59:23] Yeah.

[01:59:24] 100%.

[01:59:25] Yeah.

[01:59:26] Another thing that they implemented beyond putting the electronics in the correct place was changing the arch plaques.

[01:59:34] Can you explain the complexity of the arch plaques?

[01:59:36] I think so, only because I actually have the game.

[01:59:39] They give you options.

[01:59:40] You could either have pricing cards in it like an operator or you can put, you can configure differently like more of a home collector.

[01:59:48] So does the art on it.

[01:59:49] The funny thing is, guess how I did it.

[01:59:52] I put the cards in there like it's a routed game.

[01:59:55] Why would you do that?

[01:59:56] Just because what I'm used to.

[01:59:57] I hate you.

[01:59:58] And it looks good.

[01:59:59] Because I got to line up like all the other ones.

[02:00:01] No, it just I'm used to my, I'm used to my cards.

[02:00:04] Okay.

[02:00:05] Do you read the card before you play it?

[02:00:08] I should, but I don't.

[02:00:09] Do you have the dollar amount of per play or is it all say free play?

[02:00:13] Oh, I have to look at it.

[02:00:14] It's the cards that came with the game.

[02:00:16] So, yeah, it's like a dollar a player or whatever.

[02:00:19] Now, you mentioned this a little bit.

[02:00:21] David Thielon's sound.

[02:00:22] And I'd say one of the biggest losses that Jersey Jack has had has certainly been David Thielon.

[02:00:31] I think the sound on dialed in is probably one of the best sound packages ever.

[02:00:37] And the only one that's maybe better than that is probably Chris Granner's the next generation.

[02:00:45] Or Thiel's Tron and probably Jersey Jack's Pirates of the Caribbean.

[02:00:53] Like those are some solid sound packages.

[02:00:57] Deadpool.

[02:00:58] Deadpool's is amazing as well.

[02:01:00] Shout out to Jerry Thompson.

[02:01:01] Love me some Jerry.

[02:01:02] But David Thiel met Pat Lawler while making video games in 1983.

[02:01:08] David had heard Pat was making a game for J.J.P.

[02:01:11] I sent an email to Pat to say hi because I recently finished up at Stern.

[02:01:15] Basically, a great to see you back.

[02:01:18] Pat email me back and said, do you want to do sound for my game?

[02:01:21] Well, you don't say no to Pat.

[02:01:23] Yeah, and I would say that this was an amazing collaboration.

[02:01:26] During the Lord Lawler dust up of 2020, it was said that David Thiel after doing this game said that he would never work with Pat Lawler again,

[02:01:38] which turned out to be completely untrue because David Thiel himself said that like everybody, you have disagreements when you work on a pinball machine together,

[02:01:48] but he would undoubtedly work with Pat Lawler again.

[02:01:52] Yes, he did.

[02:01:53] He did say that.

[02:01:54] Anything else you want to talk about, Dioded?

[02:01:56] It's awesome.

[02:01:58] It's a great game.

[02:02:00] So to get a Jersey Jack machine, the problem in Canada, especially with those Stern, Ellie, the Jersey Jack machine,

[02:02:09] sort of those high-end kind of above a pro price points is the cost of actually getting them in your house.

[02:02:17] So you add 30% in the currency, and then we have a harmonized sales tax in most of our provinces where you add an additional 15% sales tax on top of that.

[02:02:29] So if you wanted like a Jersey Jack, Ellie, you're looking at about $11,000 US.

[02:02:38] And if you can get a used dialed in, you're probably looking at $80, $300 US.

[02:02:44] So it's not particularly cheaper easy to get a Jersey Jack machine, which is a bummer because I would totally own a dialed in.

[02:02:55] I just have expensive children, and they destroy all of my disposable income.

[02:03:03] Now it was a couple more years before Pat Lawler was heard of again on the Jersey Jack stage with Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory.

[02:03:18] This of course is done from the beloved Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory movie.

[02:03:27] And of course that was based on the book by Roldald Charlie and the chocolate factory.

[02:03:33] But of course we're talking about the one with Gene Wilder in it.

[02:03:36] Not the one with Johnny Depp.

[02:03:38] We're not even, don't, yeah, no, no, we're not talking about that.

[02:03:43] Oh, okay.

[02:03:44] Don't even start.

[02:03:45] This movie was a commercial failure.

[02:03:50] It had a budget of $3 million back in 1970.

[02:03:54] And when it was released in 1971, it had a box office of $4.5 million.

[02:04:00] It has however turned into a massive American musical cult classic.

[02:04:08] But they made money.

[02:04:11] How was it a loss?

[02:04:13] Well, it like you never want to make a million and a half more than what you spent.

[02:04:21] Right. You want to make $14 million, not four.

[02:04:25] Okay.

[02:04:26] I mean, since then it's a cult like this is one of the movies of my childhood.

[02:04:30] I love every song in this movie.

[02:04:33] I love the art style in the movie and how weird it is.

[02:04:38] I love how Gene Wilder like murders children and has funny songs about murdering children.

[02:04:45] Like this is Gene Wilder's probably best movie.

[02:04:48] What do you think?

[02:04:49] He was in Blazing Saddles.

[02:04:52] Oh, yeah, Blazing Saddles.

[02:04:53] And young Frankus signs.

[02:04:55] Yeah, that's true.

[02:04:56] The saying.

[02:04:57] Outside of a male Brooks film.

[02:04:59] Oh, okay.

[02:05:01] We're going to shorten that up a bit.

[02:05:05] Yeah, I like this.

[02:05:06] It's crazy.

[02:05:07] That was pretty good.

[02:05:08] Yeah, not really.

[02:05:10] I've read the role, doll book to my to my daughter who, you know, doesn't even know what's going on.

[02:05:16] But she loved Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory when I showed her.

[02:05:19] And she just she loves everything about this world as much as I do.

[02:05:23] And it brings me back to being a child.

[02:05:25] So when the rumor was that Pat Lawler, one of my favorite designers, was working on Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.

[02:05:34] One of my favorite movies of all time.

[02:05:38] You pre-ordered.

[02:05:40] And I also heard that it was done by Jersey Jack, who is, you know, the new Bally Williams, the not-cut, cost-cutting brand.

[02:05:49] Ooh, the excitement was real.

[02:05:54] And then it just kind of went, eh.

[02:05:59] What do you think?

[02:06:00] Are you being negative?

[02:06:02] I'm not being negative.

[02:06:04] I'm being controlled in my emotion.

[02:06:06] Control?

[02:06:07] Um, it shoots like a dream.

[02:06:09] Like a dream.

[02:06:10] It might even shoot better than dialed in.

[02:06:12] There, I said it.

[02:06:13] I said it.

[02:06:14] I don't know.

[02:06:15] It's got the four flippers, man.

[02:06:17] So it just got the pop bumpers on the left side.

[02:06:20] It's just, it shoots great.

[02:06:23] The art is, mmm.

[02:06:29] They were handicapped by the license.

[02:06:31] Let's just say that.

[02:06:33] I would say a lot of the shortcomings in this game are not the fault of the design team or Jersey Jack.

[02:06:42] No, they're licensing limitations.

[02:06:44] But are the licensing limitations, which I think probably got tighter and tighter and tighter as development went.

[02:06:51] I think that they were given sort of an idea.

[02:06:53] They went in one direction.

[02:06:55] Then the licenser looked at it and then they overruled it and then they had to water it down a little bit.

[02:07:00] For example, the biggest critique is where are the songs that we love from the musical that we love?

[02:07:08] Well, there's probably an issue there, maybe with licensing.

[02:07:11] I don't know what that is.

[02:07:12] They haven't talked about it.

[02:07:13] They won't talk about it because that's not how things work in the industry.

[02:07:16] You'll find out 10 years down the road.

[02:07:18] But something's going on there with licensing.

[02:07:22] It's a bit of a bummer.

[02:07:25] This is also the first pinball machine by Jersey Jack, which had a feature in the limited edition and the high-end collector's edition, which was stripped out of the on location standard edition, which is the wonkivator ball lock.

[02:07:46] Which is a change for Jersey Jack, who said very early on they would never strip anything out of a game.

[02:07:53] Every game would have the same features.

[02:07:55] So with Willy Wonka, I believe it's the first one where they, like, nope, we're going to have an edition for on location and we're going to take out a mech so we can make it cheaper.

[02:08:07] Yeah, they really, they're leaning a little bit more into that sort of stern-esque differentiating factor.

[02:08:17] But taking that mech out and simplifying the art, they were actually able to significantly reduce the MSRP of the standard edition, which then they were able to do again in the latest Jersey Jack game, Concent Roses.

[02:08:33] One thing that is a bit silly about the limited edition is it's limited to 5,000.

[02:08:38] Yeah.

[02:08:39] Do you think Jersey Jack has sold 5,000 in any of their machines?

[02:08:42] No.

[02:08:43] The CE collector's edition is limited to 500.

[02:08:47] Do you think they sold all of those?

[02:08:49] I don't know.

[02:08:50] Don't probably not.

[02:08:51] I do very much like this game.

[02:08:53] I did play it a couple of times.

[02:08:55] I've played it a couple of times.

[02:08:56] Again, when I'm on vacation or had been on vacation.

[02:08:59] I do enjoy it. It shoots really well.

[02:09:01] I feel like for this game to shine, I think you have to have it at home.

[02:09:07] I think you got to really sit down, really digest it, really play it.

[02:09:12] And then I think it's going to really come out because right out of the gate, I don't think it catches you quite like some of the other Jersey Jack games.

[02:09:21] Do you agree with that?

[02:09:22] Yeah, it's Willy Wonka.

[02:09:23] It sold better than dialed in.

[02:09:25] Yeah.

[02:09:26] Of course, which is a bit crazy.

[02:09:30] Some of the comments that I got here from a few individuals when I asked them their thoughts on Willy Wonka.

[02:09:36] Dr. John Kossin would say that Willy Wonka's rules are too confusing to advance the tickets.

[02:09:42] And he owned the game.

[02:09:44] And he owned the game.

[02:09:45] Again, I plead ignorance on rules.

[02:09:48] It's shot good.

[02:09:49] I know you hit the gop stopper a bunch of times and multi ball starts.

[02:09:53] Raymond Davidson number one ranked.

[02:09:56] I have PA pinball player Raymond Davidson would say, Wonka would be dope, except for the pop bumper situation.

[02:10:03] Similar to dialed in, I wish Pat Lawler made a path for the ball to escape to go to the upper flipper.

[02:10:10] That sounds like a tournament player critique.

[02:10:13] Not really. He didn't say anything about the rules.

[02:10:15] I totally agree.

[02:10:16] I actually very much agree with that.

[02:10:18] I feel like if it had a way to get into that sort of upper flipper to the left side thing.

[02:10:22] I also find the spinner placement, although it's kind of cool in Willy Wonka, you know, a bit of a bummer.

[02:10:29] I love spinners. I love watching spinners.

[02:10:32] But it's kind of in an odd place behind a ramp.

[02:10:35] You can only access it from that upper left flipper.

[02:10:38] The object is to collect wonka bars on the ramps, which feeds into your bonus.

[02:10:44] And then wonka bars will kind of unlock various modes as you start collecting them.

[02:10:49] It's a different kind of way than most Jersey Jack games are.

[02:10:53] I know there's a lot of stuff on the display.

[02:10:55] Like a lot of different statuses.

[02:10:58] That's the one thing we actually didn't talk about with dialed in.

[02:11:02] It has probably the simplest rule set of any Jersey Jack game by far.

[02:11:06] Yeah.

[02:11:07] I mean, it does not have the complexity that the other ones do.

[02:11:10] Maybe that's another reason that I liked it.

[02:11:12] Initially, I was very much all in on a Willy Wonka.

[02:11:15] Like, if I were to buy a Jersey Jack, I was like, oh, this is the one.

[02:11:18] And then I played it and I did really enjoy it.

[02:11:21] And I thought it was fun.

[02:11:22] And the art does not bother me as it does some people.

[02:11:25] I'm probably a bit forgiving that way, maybe.

[02:11:28] This sound package was really bummed me out.

[02:11:32] There's a lot like it's dinging and chinging.

[02:11:36] And it sounds like a gambling machine.

[02:11:38] It's whimsical.

[02:11:39] It's, I don't know.

[02:11:41] It's like they're too loud or they're taking over too much.

[02:11:44] And again, maybe that's just because I haven't headed at home or haven't had it at a location where it's been close and I've played it and played it and played it.

[02:11:51] Like the more I played Star Wars, the more it grew on me.

[02:11:54] And I feel like this game would be exactly the same.

[02:11:57] I think the more you kind of figure it out and play around.

[02:12:00] But I'll tell you that gobstopper toy, that bash toy with the the gobble hole subway.

[02:12:08] That's an awesome toy.

[02:12:11] I don't think people give that enough credit.

[02:12:13] That's some difficult mechanics going on on that thing.

[02:12:17] So the ball isn't going flying in all directions.

[02:12:20] That's a heck of a lot cooler than, you know, the pop up toy that that's on Avengers.

[02:12:26] Like come on.

[02:12:27] The Avengers subway thing is nowhere as cool as as this.

[02:12:33] And everybody fawns over Keith L.

[02:12:35] Wins, you know, spinner raising spinner on Avengers subway.

[02:12:39] And they don't fawn over this thing.

[02:12:41] And this thing is there.

[02:12:43] Keith doesn't get the budget.

[02:12:45] That pack gets.

[02:12:46] Okay.

[02:12:47] I'll give you that one.

[02:12:49] I think Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is actually a pretty great game.

[02:12:53] It does have some shortcomings.

[02:12:54] I think it gets maybe a little more grief than it should.

[02:12:57] It's probably trying to think it would be their third best selling game.

[02:13:02] Then fifth last dialed in.

[02:13:04] Yeah, there's some exciting stuff going on at Jersey Jack.

[02:13:07] And I'll tell you this.

[02:13:09] Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory was very much a turning point.

[02:13:13] I would say in the history of Jersey Jack pinball that something changed when this machine came out.

[02:13:20] The investors have control and they instituted a new new policy.

[02:13:25] That's why there's a standard now.

[02:13:27] Well, what's next for Pat?

[02:13:28] So allegedly Pat is working on another fantastic theme of my childhood.

[02:13:36] And my children's childhood toy story.

[02:13:39] Yeah.

[02:13:40] Whoo.

[02:13:42] So that brings us to the end of our Pat Lawler.

[02:13:47] pinball's roller coaster tycoon.

[02:13:50] He came into stern.

[02:13:51] He's at the sort of the lower end of his career.

[02:13:54] It's not really the greatest of games.

[02:13:56] Although I think some of them are a heck of a lot of fun and a lot certainly bring a smile to my face.

[02:14:01] Now he's very much ended back up on that top of that roller coaster.

[02:14:04] I would say with a leading role at Jersey Jack pinball to amazing games at Jersey Jack.

[02:14:12] And I would say this guy's the limit at Jersey Jack.

[02:14:15] Well, Pat says I grew up drawing games and being a game geek, which ended up serving me well.

[02:14:21] I spent my life not knowing it being in pinball.

[02:14:24] Ron, do you have any closing thoughts on Pat Lawler?

[02:14:27] Diled in rules.

[02:14:30] A lot of his stern games are really good.

[02:14:32] Give him more of a chance.

[02:14:35] Some of the rules that might not be the greatest, but the play fields are good.

[02:14:39] Certainly more original than a lot of other designers of the era.

[02:14:42] I'll say that.

[02:14:43] I'll keep my comments to this era.

[02:14:45] Go out and have some fun.

[02:14:47] Play some fun Pat Lawler games.

[02:14:48] He's one of the best designers out there.

[02:14:50] Play some roller coaster tycoon.

[02:14:51] Take out the troll.

[02:14:52] Just remove him from the game.

[02:14:54] Just burn it in your backyard in effigy.

[02:14:57] 2020 has been our first year.

[02:14:59] We're very much at the end of the year here with our podcast.

[02:15:03] This is our 10th episode.

[02:15:05] Wow.

[02:15:06] I've had a lot of fun so far.

[02:15:08] 10 episodes.

[02:15:09] At first, I was very concerned that I wouldn't have enough content to get through the year.

[02:15:14] But as I continue my research, I find more and more topics that I could research more on.

[02:15:21] And we could make those into pins.

[02:15:23] So I'm looking forward to 2021.

[02:15:25] Do you realize 10 shows means 30 hours of recorded content?

[02:15:29] Holy moly.

[02:15:31] For those out there, we typically record for, and it's amazing.

[02:15:34] It always ends up being three hours.

[02:15:36] Yeah, well, I always time them out to be about 5,000 to 5,500 words in my show.

[02:15:41] Oh, really?

[02:15:42] Which ends up to be approximately three hours of me talking on and on.

[02:15:47] Now see on your other podcast, slam tilt podcast, you and Bruce are much, much smoother.

[02:15:54] You guys know each other.

[02:15:56] You know how to edit out all of Bruce's, Bruce's isms, all of us.

[02:16:01] Oh, no, we leave those in.

[02:16:02] We leave those in.

[02:16:03] The stuttering, yes, that's removed.

[02:16:05] That's removed.

[02:16:06] Yeah, but I'll tell you, your other podcast, slam tilt podcast.

[02:16:11] That's a good one too.

[02:16:12] So if anybody wants to hear more about sort of the news of the day, you want to hear some silly running jokes and what kind of new technologies are there to fix your old crappy stirons, that's the show for you.

[02:16:27] Slam tilt podcast.

[02:16:28] Wow, all these mentions did Bruce threaten you if you didn't mention.

[02:16:31] No, no, I'm just making sure that everybody knows.

[02:16:36] And make sure everybody knows about the twippies that are coming up.

[02:16:40] And everybody out there needs to think, okay, I want to make sure that Ron gets a twippy this year.

[02:16:46] Okay, you've been doing this for so many years.

[02:16:49] The best way to make sure Ron gets a twippy is voting for silver ball chronicles in that this week in pinball yearly awards.

[02:18:27] I had to get a COVID test.

[02:18:32] Did you do that yet?

[02:18:33] We get saliva tests weekly.

[02:18:35] I haven't had the thing up your nose test yet.

[02:18:38] Yeah, I got the nose.

[02:18:40] But I have a cold.

[02:18:41] My doctor is like, oh, you should get a COVID test.

[02:18:45] I'm like, I have a cold.

[02:18:46] She's like, yeah, but you know, you're in your 30s.

[02:18:48] I'm like, I'm going to get a COVID test.

[02:18:50] I'm going to get a COVID test.

[02:18:52] I'm going to get a COVID test.

[02:18:54] I have a cold that she's like, yeah, but you know, you're in your 30s.

[02:18:57] And most of those people don't get symptoms.

[02:18:59] And it's like something out of a friggin outbreak movie with Cuba-gooding junior and rainman.

[02:19:06] Yeah, it was Dustin Hoffman.

[02:19:09] Wasn't he in the movie outbreak?

[02:19:10] I never saw.

[02:19:11] Or was that Bill Pullman?

[02:19:13] Or Bill Paxton.

[02:19:14] Just give me a second.

[02:19:16] See if I can remember it.

[02:19:18] Remember better.

[02:19:21] And I look at the sockets and one of them was different.

[02:19:24] Then you know, it's nine sockets.

[02:19:27] One of them was different than the other eight.

[02:19:29] And it's like, oh, it's one of those newer sockets.

[02:19:32] Did you shake your fist in the air?

[02:19:34] Yeah, I did.
