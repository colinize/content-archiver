[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:14] Can you hear that talking in the background?

[00:16] I can't.

[00:17] Good.

[00:18] My wife is on the other side of the door talking to her mom.

[00:21] And when you're Latin and you talk to your mom, it's like a whole thing.

[00:27] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:54] With me this month, my co-host who I haven't caused to leave in a fit of rage because

[00:59] of my massive, off-air demands, Ron Hallet.

[01:02] Hello, Ron, what's up?

[01:03] Howdy.

[01:04] Things are good in upstate New York, I hope.

[01:06] Yes, nice and sunny.

[01:08] Beautiful out here.

[01:09] Yes, you're quarantined up there with your good friend Stu McVicker, so that must be

[01:15] difficult.

[01:16] Oh yeah, kind of.

[01:17] I tolerate him though.

[01:18] What have you been doing over the last month?

[01:21] What's going on in Ron World?

[01:23] I work listening to Warp Showskid cancel.

[01:26] Yeah.

[01:27] Realizing I'm probably not going to any pinball events this year.

[01:30] I've been to a weekly league at a friend's house.

[01:35] There's only been about six of us that have gone out to actually play.

[01:39] We're all wearing a mask.

[01:41] We're all sanitizing on and off games.

[01:44] It is very, very, very unusual and we're just sort of playing just to keep ourselves from

[01:49] going crazy.

[01:51] And it's a weird time.

[01:53] We are lucky in my province.

[01:55] There's no cases in my area.

[01:58] There's only 24 cases in the whole province.

[02:01] Those are mostly away up north in a very rural community.

[02:04] So we're all taking a lot of precautions, but I would say we're probably one of the

[02:09] luckiest places really in the country.

[02:11] Anything exciting announced in the hobby recently or what?

[02:14] We got some pretty cool stuff up here now.

[02:15] All there's new games still coming out.

[02:17] The wheels are starting to start up again, which is really, really nice.

[02:21] We've had Ninja Turtles announced.

[02:22] Super excited for me.

[02:24] We've got a Hot Wheels announcement that just happened and everybody's yearly anticipating

[02:29] Jersey Jaxx next release.

[02:31] So things are starting to open up again.

[02:33] There's lots of exciting stuff, but we don't want to talk about today, pinball, right?

[02:37] We want to talk about yesterday year.

[02:39] That's what this podcast is about.

[02:41] And our listeners have spoken.

[02:43] They have.

[02:44] I have made a terrible mistake and that mistake was letting the community decide what our

[02:50] topic would be.

[02:51] So on our Facebook page, which is Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles, we put up a

[02:56] poll from last month on the two topics that we could choose.

[03:00] Those topics were Gottlieb System 1 and Steve Richie episode 2, The Mullet Years.

[03:07] It was a lot closer than I had expected.

[03:09] Did you think that these two topics would be basically 50-50 when we talked about this

[03:14] last month?

[03:15] Ah, probably more than you.

[03:16] There's a lot of God-leaved love out there.

[03:18] Can't be a Steve Richie snob, you know?

[03:20] I do love a good God-leaved and God-leaved System 1 is obviously an interesting topic, which

[03:25] is our topic today.

[03:26] But I was pretty sure everybody would go Steve Richie episode 2 because that was where we're

[03:31] getting into like black night and T2 and those kind of things.

[03:35] But I'm going to call out one person on our Facebook page here.

[03:39] And that's Edward Partridge from Australia.

[03:41] He did some significant lobbying on that Facebook page and things dramatically turned, I would

[03:50] say, in the last 24 hours.

[03:52] Steve Richie was slightly ahead by two votes.

[03:55] And then all of a sudden I woke up the next morning and I was flipping through the Facebook

[04:00] as I normally do.

[04:02] And huge jump in votes that night by about 10 votes and they all went to Gottlieb System

[04:09] 1.

[04:10] So you can blame Australia for the topic today if you wanted the Steve Richie one.

[04:14] Well, they are in the future, so they already knew that Gottlieb 1.

[04:17] I'm excited for this topic.

[04:19] We've got the research done.

[04:20] And if you really need Steve Richie, some Steve Richie thing, I'll give you one Steve

[04:25] Richie Gottlieb thing right now.

[04:26] Oh, here we go.

[04:27] One of Steve Richie's favorite Gottlieb games was Hollywood Heat.

[04:31] There you go.

[04:32] Well, you seem a shock.

[04:35] I just don't know what to say.

[04:37] That's seriously disappointing.

[04:41] Wow.

[04:42] Man, this and poor Hollywood Heat.

[04:46] I guess we should dive into a couple of the sort of housekeeping items.

[04:53] One of them is that this week in pinball pinball promoters database and that's where you

[04:59] can leave all kinds of reviews and comments on podcasts, Twitch streams and YouTube channels

[05:05] that are focused on pinball.

[05:06] You can go there to discover new podcasts and new Twitch streams.

[05:11] We would love for you to take a moment to just jump over there.

[05:13] Give us a five star review.

[05:15] Leave some comments.

[05:16] My major goal with the pinball promoters database is to keep silver ball chronicles above

[05:23] the slam tilt podcast, which is Ron's other podcast with Bruce.

[05:28] Classy.

[05:29] That is the only thing that matters.

[05:31] I don't care if we're on the third page, the fifth page.

[05:33] I don't care if we've got less than five stars as long as we're ahead of slam tilt.

[05:38] That's all that matters.

[05:39] And we are not ahead of slam tilt.

[05:41] So I'm slightly disappointed in our list.

[05:44] Yeah.

[05:45] That's as much more professional podcast.

[05:47] I would think this would be above slam tilt, honestly.

[05:49] We have a couple of comments from the pinball promoters database.

[05:54] If you want to jump in there, go ahead, Ron.

[05:56] This is from Joe C. Joe C of Kid Rock fame.

[06:00] I thought he was no longer with us, but he's back from the grave.

[06:04] And he says that Ron Hallidge, Jr. has been documenting the growth of pinball for over

[06:08] a decade.

[06:09] He offers insightful firsthand accounts of the history of pinball that goes far back

[06:13] before the resurgence of pinball.

[06:15] I greatly appreciate the use of documented primary sources without relying on the perceived

[06:20] wisdom that may not be entirely historically accurate.

[06:24] His co-host David is obviously not as well versed in pinball, or as Ron.

[06:28] And his attempts at adding humor often fall flat in my honest opinion.

[06:34] But he does a Yolman's job of leading the show with a direct focus.

[06:37] He said something nice.

[06:38] This series is quickly becoming the definitive historical record of pinball's fascinating

[06:43] history and the people who made it what it is today.

[06:47] Yeah, that's a review.

[06:49] Yeah.

[06:50] He's filled humor with a U, so he's probably Canadian.

[06:53] Yeah.

[06:54] I'm going to find you, Joe C.

[06:56] So you'd like to see American, but not the Canadian?

[06:59] Hmm.

[07:01] Something up there.

[07:02] That's not you, is it?

[07:03] You didn't write that, did you?

[07:04] No, it's not me.

[07:05] I don't spell humor wrong.

[07:08] Yeah.

[07:09] All right.

[07:10] Emily D says this is a great podcast for the true pinball nerd that enjoys learning

[07:15] more about the complicated dynamics and characters that created their favorite pinball machines.

[07:20] The co-host David Dennis is also the sexiest man alive.

[07:24] This is not his wife talking.

[07:26] So that's probably your wife talking.

[07:28] That's...

[07:29] That was my wife.

[07:30] She left us a review.

[07:31] Yes, she spelled favorite wrong too.

[07:33] Yes.

[07:34] I was thinking the other day, we are on the pinball network.

[07:38] And the pinball network is like a Canadian haven.

[07:41] Yeah, it's like we've got nothing else to do up here when the maple syrup isn't running.

[07:46] Well, I got into my podcast feed, which everyone should, of course, she plugged there.

[07:52] The pinball network.

[07:53] And I just hear more instances of the word out than I ever remember hearing it in my life.

[07:59] Here's a true story.

[08:00] When I was a little kid, I used to watch Nickelodeon and they had the program, you can't

[08:03] do that on television.

[08:05] Oh my, that was a staple.

[08:07] Yeah.

[08:08] And as a little kid, I was always confused why everyone said out on the show until years

[08:13] later, I realized it was a Canadian show and they were all Canadian kids and that's why

[08:17] they said out and like, oh, that's why that happened.

[08:20] That's...

[08:21] I just thought they all had a stroke.

[08:23] Holy crap, we've got T-shirts.

[08:25] So we open up our own Silver Ball Chronicles shop over at silverballswag.com.

[08:31] You can jump in, you can order yourself a Silver Ball Chronicles shirt.

[08:35] If you want to support the show, we don't make a lot from a T-shirt as mostly to feed

[08:40] my ego, but the shirts are there.

[08:42] If you want to help us out a little bit by supporting the podcast, just simply pick up

[08:46] a shirt and wear it when you're out in a boot.

[08:50] Another thing that is pretty cool about that store.

[08:52] And if you look at our new shirt, it's a Silver Ball Chronicles, David and Ron.

[08:58] We actually have a special one that says, Ron and David, the better one, be first.

[09:03] If you get that one, you win the grand prize of a brand new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

[09:08] Spin Mulmushi.

[09:09] There you go.

[09:11] Which may or may not be a lie, but you'd have to buy a lot of shirts to find out if I'm

[09:14] telling the truth.

[09:15] That's true.

[09:16] And that special shirt is hidden within all the regular shirts.

[09:21] It's like, remember when I had the ivory soap that sunk?

[09:23] And if you got that one, you won some kind of prize.

[09:27] That's where I got the inspiration.

[09:29] Perfect.

[09:30] Perfect.

[09:31] Swing on over to silverballswag.com to check out the new Silver Ball Chronicles Swag Store.

[09:37] So let's just dive into the topic here, Ron, because I want to get this done.

[09:42] So I can go enjoy the rest of my day.

[09:46] Gotleeb was a giant in the pinball industry.

[09:49] Some would say that they created some of the most fun, electro-mechanical machines of

[09:54] the era.

[09:56] When the sea change of the solid state era appeared in the horizon, Gotleeb rose to the

[10:00] occasion, changed everything, and continued to dominate until today.

[10:05] They did?

[10:06] Oh, let me try that again.

[10:08] Gotleeb, the industry giant, began immediately to step on rakes and never fully recovered.

[10:16] We are, of course, talking about Gotleeb System 1.

[10:19] The thing to remember to think about the plane back then, the plane of existence, you

[10:25] have, it's the mid-70s.

[10:27] You have three, you have more than three, but you have three main pinball manufacturers.

[10:32] You have Gotleeb, you have Balli, and you have Williams.

[10:36] In that order, Gotleeb is king.

[10:38] They are truly the Cadillac of pinball, but it's about to change.

[10:42] Well, why don't you tell us about Gotleeb?

[10:44] Well, here, before we start talking about Gotleeb System 1, I'm going to need something

[10:48] to help me get through this.

[10:50] Hopefully it's not alcoholic.

[10:54] Oh, it's so good.

[10:56] So let's catch up on Gotleeb in the late 70s.

[10:59] So you had said that Gotleeb was the Cadillac of the pinball industry at the time.

[11:04] It was established by David Gotleeb in 1927 as De Gotleeb and Co, and was based in Illinois.

[11:11] Would you say that Gotleeb really did dominate in the 60s and 70s, were they the go-to brand

[11:16] back then?

[11:17] Most definitely.

[11:18] Most definitely.

[11:19] You just look at the numbers.

[11:21] Yeah, jump onto IPDB.

[11:24] Take a look at some of the sales numbers.

[11:25] They're selling 3,000, 4,000 units regularly, and that's a lot of units at the time.

[11:33] Because they're making like 12 games a year, sometimes.

[11:36] It's funny.

[11:37] You'll hear stories about those old, those first engineers and designers that really did

[11:42] pinball like Wayne Nions, Ed Kinsky, those guys.

[11:45] And they're just banging them out on a weekly basis.

[11:49] It's crazy.

[11:50] It's like they couldn't keep up with demand.

[11:53] And they had some really fun themes and interesting gameplay elements too.

[11:58] They were really innovators.

[12:00] And if you want to see some interesting stuff, you just Google, Google like Gotleeb factory

[12:06] 70s.

[12:07] There's like pictures of the Gotleeb factory from like the early 70s, and it literally

[12:11] seems too clean that they could actually be making pinball there.

[12:14] It's absolutely incredible looking facility.

[12:18] They were the leader.

[12:19] When you're the king in the mountain, you have a different perspective than everybody else.

[12:22] The coin op and pinball industry is kind of interesting because it spends a lot of time

[12:26] focusing on operators and bar owners and distributors, right?

[12:30] They have a very tight knit relationship because if you make a bunch of your distributors

[12:35] angry, they may not support you and buy the units that they're going to sell to the

[12:40] bars and so on.

[12:41] So there's a lot of politics being played at that time.

[12:44] And the electromechanical era, it was Gotleeb that really dominated that sort of political

[12:48] atmosphere of keeping everybody kind of happy, continuing to make some minor innovations.

[12:53] Pinball machines hadn't really changed much in that dominant era.

[12:58] Besides the flipper being started, the tilt bob by Harry Williams and the mechanical

[13:02] score reel, you know, no real major shifts had kind of happened in that 60s and 70s era.

[13:09] Isn't that right?

[13:10] Yeah, it's safe.

[13:11] So other than the flipper went from like a two inch flipper to a three inch flipper.

[13:15] So a little more skillful.

[13:16] The price went up over time, but the basics, the basics of the pinball machine were pretty

[13:20] much the same for quite a while.

[13:22] So when we say electro mechanical pinball machine, could you kind of like describe that a little

[13:26] bit for for those that, you know, maybe more of a modern era pinball enthusiast that might

[13:32] know only maybe spike in Sam systems?

[13:34] Well, unlike the current electronic games of today, there are no electronics.

[13:39] Everything runs up.

[13:40] There's a motor and then there's tons and tons of relays, switches, stepperies, and

[13:46] rear units, which is like a little, it's a circular with little contact points on it.

[13:51] There's score reels for your scoring.

[13:54] And basically everything runs on that logic.

[13:58] Like if these three switches are closed, then this thing goes, you know, if this is closed,

[14:03] you know, if this relays in this position and this switch is in this position, then it

[14:06] can do this.

[14:07] You wouldn't have like the manual, usually with those games, you get a large, just schematic

[14:11] that would have all the logic of the game.

[14:14] And they're like stapled inside the cabinet, usually.

[14:16] So if you look at it, it's, what isn't working?

[14:19] Okay, what needs to be, what state does everything need to be for this thing to be working?

[14:24] Well, this relay needs to be in this position.

[14:25] These five switches need to be in these positions and the motor needs to be here for this

[14:29] to work.

[14:30] Okay, which one of those is not right?

[14:31] That's how you would diagnose issues on an electronic mechanical game.

[14:35] Yeah, so those things, those computer boards, it was like a board with a bunch of relays

[14:40] and switches and they're, it's inside the bottom of the cabinet.

[14:43] So if you think of today, we have a board with diodes and, you know, resistors and transistors

[14:48] and icy chips and all that stuff.

[14:51] That didn't exist.

[14:52] It was a board, like a piece of wood and that had a bunch of screwed in moving pieces,

[14:59] actually moving pieces.

[15:00] Yep.

[15:01] And the other thing to remember is the whole reason the pinball machine is the shape it

[15:05] is because you might think like, well, why is the cabinet have to be so big when you

[15:10] think about it?

[15:11] Yeah, that's interesting.

[15:12] Of course.

[15:13] Like nowadays, if you open up a cabinet on a new game, say you just got your new teenage

[15:17] mutant injectorodles and you lift up that play field, it's pretty much empty except for

[15:21] a speaker.

[15:22] Yeah, they don't even put the power supplies down there anymore.

[15:24] It's like, why does it have to be so big?

[15:26] Well, back then, it was completely full.

[15:30] If you open up, if you lift the play field up on an old EM game, there's tons of stuff

[15:34] on the bottom of the play field, there's tons of stuff on the bottom of the game.

[15:37] Like you said, there's a whole wood panel that you can disconnect and remove that has

[15:40] all the logic of the game.

[15:42] It's always the back box so big because we got to put all the score reels, we got to

[15:45] put all the steppers, we got to put all the stuff in there.

[15:48] So it needs to be that big to fit everything in there.

[15:51] And that's how the basic size of the game that we know today was established.

[15:57] One thing that I find really neat when I look under an electric mechanical machine, oddly

[16:02] enough, every time I look under an electric mechanical machine, it's always a got leap

[16:06] from this era.

[16:08] They have this massive rat's nest of cabling, similar, I guess, maybe to today, but it's

[16:15] all covered in instead of plastic covers on the wiring.

[16:21] It's all like a material.

[16:23] It's a fabric.

[16:24] Yeah, it's like a fabric.

[16:25] I mean, they take knob and tube out of houses because it's going to burn down your house.

[16:29] Yet this thing is just loaded with basically knob and tube cables.

[16:32] And it's funny.

[16:33] It's going to be in the Cadillac of the era, just from a lot of people I know who work

[16:37] on a lot of these era games.

[16:40] They almost all of them, to a man, actually says they prefer working like a Williams game

[16:45] as opposed to a got leap game because I guess with got leap, they said their documentation,

[16:50] they would like use their own numbers for things and they would be different than the other

[16:54] manufacturers the way they did stuff.

[16:56] So it's harder to follow.

[16:59] I have a Spanish eyes and that has like you have a manual, like a full complete manual

[17:05] that shows like every position of every step or like what's supposed to be and it's

[17:10] very detailed and then it has the full schematic from what I've been told.

[17:14] Again, someone can correct us by sending an email to our email address at silverballcrontacles

[17:19] at gmail.com.

[17:21] They can correct me.

[17:22] But I've been told that the got leap manuals are not always that complete.

[17:26] Like a lot of them will just have a schematic.

[17:27] Just your basic stuff.

[17:28] Get it done.

[17:29] It's not necessarily as clear and I asked like, well, why if they were the cat like of the

[17:33] industry, why wouldn't they have like the best manuals and a lot of the responses I got

[17:39] is like they didn't have to.

[17:40] They were the cat like of the industry.

[17:42] You were going to get a got leap.

[17:43] I mean, at that point, most of the people that had a pinball machine were operators.

[17:50] They knew all of those machines and if you knew a got leap, you knew a got leap.

[17:55] It just was one thing or the next, right?

[17:57] Now the problem with those electric mechanicals, you start into a certain level of complexity

[18:02] where you're just going to need too many relays, too many switches, too many steppers to do

[18:08] what you want to do.

[18:09] There's a limit to the logic that you can do with that equipment.

[18:14] Yeah.

[18:15] You sort of reach a peak.

[18:16] The ultimate peak if you've ever seen like an old bingo like electric mechanical, they're

[18:21] kind of, they make a pinball look simple.

[18:24] The amount of logic that they have and that's kind of the highest level of insanity that

[18:30] you can do at electric mechanical as far as the logic.

[18:33] Yeah.

[18:34] So if we want to do more stuff and maybe do it cheaper, what do we do?

[18:39] Yeah, we're going to have to come up with something.

[18:41] Something's going to have to change in the industry and that's sort of where we're leading

[18:45] to today.

[18:46] The 60s and 70s, specifically were big for Godly.

[18:49] They were completely the marketplace leader and just sort of through my basic sort of

[18:55] looking through IPDB and a few other places, they really outsold Williams and Balli, usually

[19:00] three to one.

[19:02] Yeah.

[19:03] And Balli and Williams, they've had some very good games from time to time, right?

[19:07] There's a lot of really good electric mechanical Williams and a lot of really great electric mechanical

[19:11] ballies.

[19:12] But you know, those are the anomaly where Godlyb is just a consistent market dominator.

[19:18] Yeah.

[19:19] Balli started cranking it up, I'd say in the mid 70s when they started going for licenses.

[19:23] It's funny that it's taken so long and we continue to have issues with licensing in the

[19:28] industry.

[19:29] Ron, do you have a, do you have a favorite 60s or 70s Godlyb?

[19:32] Yes, I do.

[19:34] I have a couple.

[19:35] I like, I like 2001 if you've ever seen that one.

[19:39] It's also known, I think, dimension is the, the other version.

[19:41] No, I haven't seen that one.

[19:43] It's got, if you like drop targets, you're going to get your full drop targets.

[19:48] There's like a ton of drop targets are on both sides and it's, it's used as colors,

[19:53] maybe because I like countdown too.

[19:55] I like something with colors.

[19:56] It has different colors for each sets of the drop targets.

[20:00] If you knock them all down, the associated colored saucer will light up and that's where

[20:05] you get your real points and it's up at the top of the play field.

[20:08] It's super fun.

[20:09] I've played a lot of Godlyb.ms.

[20:12] The one that sticks out for me is really jungle queen or jungle princess.

[20:16] Is that the monkeys?

[20:17] It's got the monkey drop targets on the left and the right.

[20:20] Then you collect your bonus on the top left side.

[20:22] I really, really, really like that one.

[20:25] I've also played a lot of super soccer from 1975 with the two spinners on the inside

[20:31] near the pop bumpers of those that stick out.

[20:34] I played Solar City too, which is that one that we spoke about last month where they recycled

[20:39] the design a million times and it's got the large bank of drop targets at the back.

[20:43] I don't know.

[20:44] Jungle Princess, Jungle Queen, right, is the four player EM version.

[20:48] It's so interesting and strange and it's got the four sets of flippers.

[20:53] It doesn't have that traditional Italian bottom in lane, out lane.

[20:58] It's got no slings on the inside.

[21:01] It's really neat, very cool.

[21:04] A lot of people speak very highly of Abra Kadabra.

[21:06] Do you have any experience with that?

[21:08] A lot of these I haven't played.

[21:10] Well, a lot of these I've probably played like once at a show just to say I played everything.

[21:15] But I would say that I got leaves of that era my favorite to be like 2001 target pool,

[21:22] actually mini pool, which is the same as target pool, different art.

[21:25] I actually like the mini pool art better.

[21:27] Both 2001 and target pool mini pool are two flipper games or two inch flipper games that

[21:32] have in lanes.

[21:33] Maybe that's why I like them.

[21:35] The actual bottom of them looks like a normal Italian bottom with two inch flippers.

[21:39] They didn't actually make that many of those with the two inch flippers.

[21:43] You can do things like you can do a bounce pass, you can alley pass, you can do a lot of the skills

[21:47] that you can typically do on a newer game.

[21:50] You can do them on that game.

[21:52] Yeah, very cool.

[21:53] One of my friends here, he picked up a sin along, which I had a lot more fun playing

[22:02] than I actually expected to.

[22:04] That's from the early 60s, no in lanes.

[22:08] It's always moving.

[22:09] It's always fun, very cool machine.

[22:13] You can really see that their machines are still around today and they're still very

[22:17] much fun to continue to play today.

[22:21] Another two I can think of, three inch flipper games, the volley.

[22:24] I love volley.

[22:26] Yeah, I heard good things.

[22:28] And far out.

[22:29] Do you ever see a far out?

[22:30] That one's got an amazing art package.

[22:33] Yeah, very, very cool.

[22:34] And because I really wanted to do the Steve Richie episode today, I made sure that we got

[22:39] a Steve Richie quote.

[22:41] So when he was a young pinball player in a local bowling alley at 10 years old, he was

[22:48] often playing pinball.

[22:50] One day the service tech walked in to take a look at one of the machines and he started

[22:53] chatting with Steve.

[22:55] Steve would then say that the guy looked at me and said, you know what?

[22:59] This is a got leave.

[23:00] The Cadillac of the industry.

[23:03] Did they say that because they probably weighed as much as a caddy?

[23:06] It's got, you know, he ams are heavier than I realized.

[23:09] That's when I got my Spanish eyes, which is a single player.

[23:12] He am.

[23:13] I figured, oh, no problem.

[23:15] And I went to lift the thing.

[23:16] It's like, oh, oh yeah, these are heavier.

[23:19] One of the, I guess, you know, mid 70s, you know, early 70s, things are starting to change

[23:26] at Gottlieb specifically.

[23:28] So in 1976, Alvin Gottlieb, son of David Gottlieb, who was the D and D Gottlieb and

[23:33] Co sold Gottlieb to Columbia Pictures.

[23:37] Yes, the movie folk and we'll go into more of that in another episode and some other

[23:42] time.

[23:43] But the leadership was more or less kept the same at Gottlieb at that time.

[23:48] The ownership changed, but the leadership within it, the Wayne Nions, whose a legend in

[23:53] the industry, continued to stay around.

[23:56] Alvin continued to stay around the, the guidance of the old Gottlieb in the 60s and early

[24:02] 70s is still there.

[24:05] Just things and priorities are starting to change kind of at the higher up ownership level.

[24:09] The competitors really started to change at this time.

[24:11] Didn't they run?

[24:12] We're starting to kind of get into that mid 70s.

[24:15] Everybody's trying to kind of catch up a little bit.

[24:16] Yeah.

[24:17] Like a say, like, Valley, I guess the ballies starts to try to do some licensing making games

[24:22] like Wizard, Captain Fantastic, trying to do that to boost sales, which if you look

[24:27] at the numbers, you can't argue.

[24:29] That definitely boosted sales.

[24:30] Work.

[24:31] Then you have Atari, which basically tried to do everything different.

[24:35] They had all wide body so their games would look completely different than the competition,

[24:39] but their scores, score displays on the apron again, so look completely different than

[24:43] their competition.

[24:44] Yeah, when you're behind in the market, you know, most companies know that you need to

[24:48] do something to jumpstart business.

[24:50] So to either compete on price, you know, if you start competing on price, you start a

[24:55] race to the bottom, right?

[24:57] Who can make the cheapest pinball possible?

[24:59] Who can take the most stuff out?

[25:01] Who can just get it out the door?

[25:03] If you're not able to come up with some sort of other innovation, you have to invest in

[25:06] technology, you have to invest in talent.

[25:09] You're going to close your door if you don't do that.

[25:11] There's a great risk to doing things differently.

[25:15] In a great example of that, and you mentioned in a moment ago was Atari.

[25:19] They tried to do something totally different with their machines.

[25:23] Nolan says I felt we could make a business meeting pinball, but we could not do commodity

[25:27] pinball.

[25:28] One that looked like it was the same size.

[25:30] So we created wide bodies and these other various innovations which allowed us to price

[25:35] them anywhere we wanted.

[25:36] Yeah, so that's a great example of doing something different.

[25:40] So he calls it commodity pinball.

[25:42] So he just didn't want to be like everybody else.

[25:43] He had to do something totally different.

[25:45] That is an example of when things went bad.

[25:49] Because we can see that Atari's pinballs, they had maybe two good machines, both done by

[25:53] Steve Richie.

[25:54] They did some crazy stuff with like Hercules, boards in the bottom.

[25:59] It just things just didn't work.

[26:02] So you continually need to evolve your offering to consumers.

[26:06] So let's take a look at like McDonald's salads.

[26:09] People all of a sudden are demanding changes in the market and McDonald's starts making

[26:13] salads.

[26:15] Right.

[26:15] Do you think McDonald's wants to make salads?

[26:17] They want to make hamburgers.

[26:19] Great.

[26:20] With great seed meat.

[26:21] Yeah.

[26:22] Like McDonald's needed to capture another part of the market because people were going

[26:26] to other fast food places because they had salads.

[26:29] So McDonald's creates salads to follow the market demand.

[26:33] And then when people end up coming to McDonald's and realize the salad sucks, they probably

[26:37] just go back to the burgers and fries anyway.

[26:40] But this is like pinball industry, right?

[26:42] They need to continue to move the market and Gottlieb has to follow where the market is

[26:47] going.

[26:48] Pinball decided to invest in solid state.

[26:50] And when we say that word, it's like, what does that mean?

[26:53] What does solid state pinball mean?

[26:55] It just basically means all those breals, all those burlays, those stepper units, all

[27:02] that stuff is going to be replaced.

[27:03] Yeah, we're able to reduce cost, right?

[27:05] We can get rid of all that metal and all those bits.

[27:07] We can reduce the cost by having a computer board, which is the future of the world.

[27:12] It's funny because I'm in my mid 30s and I've never really known a non solid state, I guess

[27:20] world.

[27:21] I've always known the silicon processing microchip.

[27:24] Many companies in the 70s were working on creating these silicon processing chips.

[27:29] And that was companies like Texas Instruments, Intel, Western Digital, I'm sorry, Western

[27:34] design center.

[27:36] All of these companies are all starting to come up.

[27:38] And the race around the world, particularly in the United States, was the microprocessor.

[27:45] It was all about sort of dominating the new world that was coming.

[27:49] Eventually pinball would notice that quick computing in the microprocessor, as well as their

[27:54] ability to keep a memory, all of that stuff could be leveraged in pinball to help create

[27:59] efficiency.

[28:00] Pinball machines would be lighter.

[28:02] They wouldn't need those massive squarrials anymore.

[28:05] They could have digital displays.

[28:07] They would require less tinkering, less adjustments.

[28:09] And hopefully they'd be cheaper and easier to manufacture.

[28:12] And that savings could be passed on to the distributors and the operators.

[28:18] This information actually we're going to go through.

[28:20] This is where we're going to get a bit nerdy.

[28:22] This is from an article written by Dennis Kreisel.

[28:25] It had originally been put into this week in pinball and it sort of breaks down the early

[28:31] solid state by manufacturer.

[28:33] And we're going to make it a lot less boring and hopefully add some kind of fun commentary.

[28:41] So Ron, do you want to go through the chronological order of who's launching their solid state

[28:46] platform and who's following who and what's going on?

[28:49] Sure.

[28:50] First out of the gate was Bally.

[28:52] Mmm.

[28:53] The innovator.

[28:54] The innovator.

[28:55] And the thing to remember about Bally is when they came up with their system, they actually

[28:59] tried to patent not just their system, but patent the actual idea of a solid state pinball

[29:06] machine.

[29:07] They wanted to say if you've got a computer board in it, you got to pay us.

[29:09] You got to pay us.

[29:10] Yep, it went to court and the judge did not agree.

[29:14] But I'm wondering what would have happened if the judge had decided the other way and

[29:18] everyone had to pay Bally if they wanted to make a solid state game.

[29:23] That would have been interesting.

[29:24] Man, so they went with a sort of a prototype approach.

[29:27] So what they did is they wanted to take an existing machine and try to make it work in

[29:33] solid state.

[29:34] That was in late 1974.

[29:36] They took a bow and arrow in 1974 and they decided to modify it.

[29:42] An interesting note, of course, is that the EM version of bow and arrow sold 7,630 units

[29:47] in November of 75.

[29:49] They just had a bunch of these laying around.

[29:51] I would assume.

[29:52] So that's why they chose this one.

[29:53] This was followed by one prototype flicker and one boomerang.

[29:57] Doug MacDonald was a Bally engineer in the late 70s and the boards for the machine were

[30:00] designed by Doug.

[30:01] Doug MacDonald is a name that would pop up fairly often when it came to mechanics throughout

[30:06] the research.

[30:07] So certainly a very important engineer at Bally and his initials, the letters D and B are

[30:13] sort of like decibel back to back DB and you'll be able to actually see them on those prototype

[30:18] machines.

[30:19] They made 17 of the bow and arrow machines to try to get these to continue to work.

[30:24] They've got an understanding of how do we make a machine that we have work with these

[30:29] boards, right?

[30:31] So they're in the factory.

[30:32] They're all just trying to figure it out, which is pretty interesting.

[30:36] What did they end up eventually coming out with?

[30:38] Well, their system, I always get confused at what their actual system is called.

[30:42] It's like the Bally 17, the Bally 35, named after the CPU board.

[30:48] It came out with a MPU board that was MPU stands for.

[30:51] What does MPU stand for?

[30:53] Processing unit?

[30:54] Yes.

[30:55] It is powered by a Motorola 6800 series chip, which is an 8-bit Biker processor.

[31:00] Yeah, so this is where we get nerdy.

[31:04] Things are going to get nerdy with Ron and I here because we're going to talk about chipsets

[31:07] and stuff.

[31:08] So if that's not your thing, go back to episode one about Steve Richie.

[31:11] Well, and they're the most basic, the most basic way I can break down a Bally board set.

[31:15] You have an MPU, which is your main, the brain.

[31:18] I think it's the brain.

[31:19] Runs the game code.

[31:20] Does all the math?

[31:21] Yeah, does all the math.

[31:22] Does solenoid driver board?

[31:23] It runs all the solenoids.

[31:25] Yes, so the flippers, the kick-outs, the driver for like score displays.

[31:29] Then they will have a lamp driver board.

[31:31] Does all the lights?

[31:32] Does all the lights.

[31:33] Yeah.

[31:34] And then they will have a rectifier board, which is the thing that the transformer plugs

[31:39] into this board and this board provides the voltages for the whole system.

[31:42] Yeah, so clean power voltages don't go up and down.

[31:45] And that's at the beginning.

[31:46] Later, they would add things like, you know, they'd be auxiliary boards if it has special

[31:50] feature sound board, a speech board, that kind of thing.

[31:53] Bally decided to drive all their lamps and solenoids.

[31:56] So all of the light bulbs and all of the things that drive the flippers and the drop

[32:01] targets and stuff directly.

[32:03] So right from the thing, which is why you would have that driver board rather than using

[32:10] a matrix.

[32:11] So what is a matrix?

[32:13] Matrix is a series of rows and columns.

[32:15] Yeah, so what does that mean?

[32:16] Oh, it means if you have say you have an eight by eight matrix and you want to fire

[32:22] something, it's that position, say row two, column one, but it decreases the amount of

[32:29] transistors you need.

[32:31] Because you don't need one for, like, say, if you have eight by eight, you don't need

[32:35] 64 transistors.

[32:37] You just need eight by eight.

[32:39] I had a system ADB got lab.

[32:42] My stand-up targets weren't scoring.

[32:44] And after a bunch of troubleshooting, I traced it right back to the matrix and one specific

[32:50] chip and one specific leg of a chip.

[32:54] And that one leg on that one chip ran the scoring for that stand-up target.

[33:01] So that had to be replaced.

[33:02] That whole matrix of tracing things, computer boards, it's beyond me.

[33:07] I am not that kind of person.

[33:09] But I find it super cool that after being in the hobby a short period of time, I was like,

[33:14] oh my god, that's how a chip works.

[33:16] That's how a matrix works.

[33:17] It was very cool.

[33:19] You don't belly control to 60 lamps in 19 solenoids.

[33:23] 15 that were momentary in use and four that were continuous.

[33:27] This is a big deal.

[33:28] You could have 19 solenoids.

[33:31] So you could have 19 things.

[33:32] You could have drop target, you know, up.

[33:36] You could have two flippers.

[33:37] You could have four flippers.

[33:38] You could have a kick out.

[33:40] You could have the out hole has solenoid, right?

[33:44] You've got like all of these options, right?

[33:46] What you want to come up with.

[33:47] And the lamps.

[33:48] So these are like having playfield lamps underneath, right?

[33:52] Like spinner is lit when the light is on.

[33:54] Yeah, 60 lamps have to be controlled lamps.

[33:57] So one's that it can light to tell you to do things.

[34:01] GI, meaning general illumination or lights that are just always on.

[34:05] Yeah.

[34:06] Okay, there you go.

[34:07] You've now proven Joe C.

[34:08] Correct.

[34:09] Yeah.

[34:11] Valley also used a five by eight matrix for their switches.

[34:15] Thereby allowing their system to use up to 40 switches on the playfield.

[34:19] And switches are the things that are telling the board where the ball is going and does things

[34:24] like scoring, right?

[34:25] So in lane, out lane, out hole, kick out, drop target, all of those things.

[34:30] They can have up to 40 different switches on playfield.

[34:33] And it's at its least technical that just means instead of 40 different things that

[34:39] need to register, you just have five by eight.

[34:42] And you just use the matrix like row two, column five.

[34:46] Okay, it's this switch.

[34:47] Yeah.

[34:48] So for their score displays, Valley took advantage of what's called gas plasma high

[34:52] voltage displays.

[34:53] Yeah.

[34:54] And they'll solid state machines.

[34:55] Actually, the highest voltage thing in it are the score displays.

[34:59] That's why they will usually have some kind of warnings, cardboard over them or just little

[35:04] things covering the pins that say don't touch it.

[35:08] They don't have voltage.

[35:09] Do not touch because yeah, you don't want to mess with those.

[35:12] Yeah, those are the ones where you don't go.

[35:13] Ah, those are the ones where you pee yourself, get knocked across the room and clutch your

[35:16] chest.

[35:18] The original sort of first Valley solid state machines used a chime box actually.

[35:23] And they did that first specific reason, even though they're going with the solid state

[35:27] and they're experimenting with it.

[35:29] They're not sure how the player base is going to take this.

[35:32] So they don't want to change too much.

[35:35] They want to keep something familiar.

[35:37] So a lot of these first initial solid state games would have chimes.

[35:41] Yeah, you don't want to follow the Atari, which was just too much.

[35:43] I mean, they pretty much all did that too.

[35:46] Valley did it, Williams did it, Stern did it.

[35:48] The first few games were going to have chimes in them.

[35:50] Something wonderful about a chime box.

[35:52] Williams went even further and their first full production solid state game, which I believe

[35:57] is hot tip, they actually have a real, like a little score real in the cabinet.

[36:04] So it'll just turn so you'll get that real sound.

[36:08] Even though it's not doing it, it's like it's not even, it's just spins.

[36:11] It doesn't actually do anything with this.

[36:13] It's just for sound just so you get that, that effect.

[36:16] That's amazing.

[36:17] They didn't know how people would respond to this.

[36:18] They could have totally said, like, where's my chimes?

[36:20] Where's my, I don't like this.

[36:22] Yeah, where's the, where's the, when you started up, it goes click, click, click, click, click,

[36:25] click, click, click, click, where's that?

[36:27] Yeah.

[36:28] We've gone through kind of, you know, a year and a half, maybe almost two years worth

[36:31] of sort of development and playing around.

[36:35] Their first valley with a solid state board set in it was fireball and it sold 10,000 units

[36:44] and it was a non commercial home use model.

[36:48] Yep.

[36:49] I guarantee you had people here and you say that and they're like, no, fireball came

[36:52] out way earlier.

[36:53] Like he's not talking about that one.

[36:55] Yeah.

[36:57] So they actually had a little group of these home models.

[37:00] They did.

[37:01] Evil, an evil, a captain fantastic, a galaxy ranger and this weird fireball.

[37:05] There was a, I think Texas pinball festival or one of the shows where they had them all

[37:09] there in a row and they're small.

[37:11] They're, they're smaller too.

[37:13] They're physically smaller.

[37:14] Yeah.

[37:15] They, you know, going back to your comment of they didn't want to make everybody angry.

[37:20] This was probably a really good way to maybe test the water, right?

[37:24] Because it's not for commercial use.

[37:26] It's kind of more for home use.

[37:28] But immediately you can say people were like, this is awesome.

[37:31] Yeah, this will be the, this will be the equivalent of like stern on their Star Wars

[37:36] home edition trying some new thing.

[37:38] Yeah.

[37:39] That had never been there before just to see if it worked if people liked it.

[37:43] In December of 1976, they saw 1500 units of freedom, which was a previous EM design.

[37:50] So you can see that they're really waiting into solid state sort of very cautiously.

[37:54] Right.

[37:55] They're going to be in a year and a half of tinkering to kind of come up with the,

[37:59] with the board sets and how things work.

[38:02] They've launched a home model.

[38:03] They kind of launched a small run of some previously, previous EM machines are being

[38:08] very, very cautious.

[38:09] You want to really geeky little note on freedom?

[38:13] Do I?

[38:14] Here's a geeky note, note on freedom.

[38:15] If you remember from our, our stern, our stern podcast we did on a stern, a classic stern,

[38:21] if you tilt before a single switch is hit, it doesn't count the tilt.

[38:25] Like the first switch hit can't be a tilt.

[38:27] So you can't tilt through on a stern.

[38:29] I think we covered that.

[38:30] But Bally's don't have this.

[38:32] Like if you were to walk up to say a Harlan Globe trotters ball one and you tilted and

[38:36] then you plunge the ball, you would start a ball too.

[38:39] Freedom works like a stern in that if the first switch hit is a tilt, it won't count

[38:45] the tilt.

[38:46] Interesting.

[38:47] They did it for freedom and then they didn't do it for any other game for some reason.

[38:50] I don't know why.

[38:51] Probably because they could make more money if they tilted through.

[38:55] I guess so.

[38:56] But I thought that's an interesting tidbit that they actually did do that.

[39:00] Well, one of their first games, but then they just, they didn't do it again.

[39:05] In February 1977, so we're moving, we're now into 1977.

[39:09] Their first production run solid state machine was Bally Knight Rider, a truckin theme with

[39:16] orbit spinners.

[39:17] Yeah.

[39:19] No?

[39:20] No.

[39:21] They sold 7,000 units, which was of course the solid state version.

[39:28] It was also released in Electromechanical.

[39:30] So they're running these like parallel kind of platforms, right?

[39:35] They've still got the EM version.

[39:36] They also have the solid state version.

[39:38] They don't want to make distributors or operators angry that you can choose which one

[39:42] you want.

[39:43] You know, we'll do a deep dive on Bally some other day and talk about Knight Rider.

[39:48] Orbit spinners.

[39:49] Yeah.

[39:50] Yeah.

[39:51] Pretty much most Bally's orbit spinners.

[39:54] Yeah.

[39:55] They didn't change the designs a lot on these games of the air.

[39:58] Yeah.

[39:59] So that was followed by evil, Keneval, which sold 14,000 units in February 1977.

[40:05] And then the one that really matters, eight ball with the fawns.

[40:10] I put that in air quotes.

[40:12] The highest selling pinball ever at 20,230 units was in June of 1977.

[40:18] Yeah.

[40:19] And you should see that Bally's going for the licenses, even when they don't pay for them.

[40:23] Yeah, exactly.

[40:24] So they have unlocked something with solid state technology, haven't they?

[40:27] Most definitely.

[40:28] So their last EM, so they shut off the EM production was June of 1977.

[40:34] That was kick off.

[40:35] They made a few EM bingos after that, but that doesn't really matter.

[40:39] You can see that they started tinkering in 74, late 74, 75.

[40:44] They kind of figure it out.

[40:46] 76, they're getting the groove by 77.

[40:49] They've completely changed the business.

[40:50] They're no longer doing electro mechanicals.

[40:53] Their business model has changed.

[40:55] So next up to the plate was our good old friend Stern electronics.

[41:01] Why do you think that they were next?

[41:04] Because they just ripped off the Bally board set.

[41:06] Exactly.

[41:07] They reverse engineered it.

[41:08] I believe they did have to pay.

[41:09] They paid some kind of thing per game to Bally for this.

[41:13] They didn't get away with it entirely.

[41:15] Plus they did change the CPU a bit, and P you sorry, over time.

[41:20] And they did kind of make it their own, but the basic crux of it is still the Bally board

[41:24] set.

[41:25] Yeah.

[41:26] And you can listen to the Stern electronics episode.

[41:28] That was episode two.

[41:29] You can jump back into the archives to review that one.

[41:32] But their Stern M100 board was really sort of their kind of focus into that area.

[41:38] Stern released their first solid state game.

[41:41] Get this pinball in September of 77 in both EM and solid state version.

[41:50] Yep.

[41:51] And I believe they just they didn't do the multiple games with EM and solid state.

[41:55] As soon as they did pinball, it was off to the races.

[41:57] Everything was a solid state from that point on.

[42:00] They were 100% all in on solid state because they could see the I guess the efficiency

[42:04] cost savings.

[42:05] Their solid state sold 1,650 units and the EM version sold 594 of pinball.

[42:13] And that was the Stern's last of four EM designs.

[42:16] They only did four.

[42:18] They'd follow that up with stingray.

[42:20] And more importantly, six months after that star.

[42:23] Yes.

[42:24] And again, they did the same thing with they had the chime unit in them.

[42:28] The first four, I believe is pinball, stingray, stars and every lane all have the chime

[42:33] box.

[42:34] They want to go crazy.

[42:35] So they started with an ownership change as you can hear in our previous podcast where

[42:39] they're moving from Chicago coin into Stern with that.

[42:42] They just went all they just sort of threw out the old business model moved on to the new

[42:45] business model.

[42:47] Next following them was Williams.

[42:49] So their prototype started in May of 1976.

[42:53] And that would actually lead to what was sort of coined as the Williams system three board

[42:57] set, which would eventually launch into full production in September of 77.

[43:02] So everybody's sort of slightly like four to six months behind Bali when it comes to

[43:07] actually launching into production.

[43:09] But they're all kind of tinkering with solid state all at the same time, which is pretty

[43:13] interesting.

[43:14] Williams, Grand Prix was a big EM seller with orbit spinners.

[43:20] Yeah.

[43:22] And Williams would have approximately five modified Grand Prix's into solid state as prototypes.

[43:30] I assume again that they use Grand Prix because they just had a million of them lying around

[43:36] the office.

[43:37] Actually, it's often said that you couldn't throw a dead cat in Chicago without hitting

[43:41] a Williams Grand Prix.

[43:42] Oh, meow.

[43:43] So this sort of prototype board set is often kind of dubbed Williams system one.

[43:48] You know, it didn't really go into production, but it was kind of the first solid state iteration

[43:53] of that.

[43:54] Where do you think those system one prototype machines ended up?

[43:58] Well, according to IPDB, they spoke with Ken.

[44:00] Ken Fideszna, the executive VP and GM at Williams in 1988.

[44:04] They said that each member of the design team received one machine after they were brought

[44:08] back from test.

[44:09] Oh, can you imagine someone has a Grand Prix system one somewhere?

[44:14] Can you imagine what a solid state version of Grand Prix would be worth if it was one of

[44:19] these machines for history purposes?

[44:20] I'd like to see it in a museum somewhere if we had a pinball museum.

[44:24] Well, we have places called pinball museums, but like a museum museum.

[44:27] That would be pretty, pretty cool for sure.

[44:29] And somebody out there knows where that is.

[44:31] You're probably listening to this right now.

[44:33] So following that experiment, November of 1976, Williams then converted 10 Aztec machines

[44:40] into solid state, which then was sort of dubbed system two.

[44:44] And there was also a machine called argacy in their somewhere.

[44:50] And IPDB isn't quite clear on the dates, which might be an error, but I'm not entirely

[44:56] sure and I'm not doing that much research for a podcast.

[44:59] So you forgot to say Aztec also has an orbit spinner.

[45:02] Oh, Aztec, orbit spinners.

[45:05] Yeah, I think it's just one.

[45:07] I'm trying to remember off the top of my head.

[45:09] I love me some orbit spinners.

[45:11] The Williams board set.

[45:13] So let's just jump into some of the stats there.

[45:15] So the ballet system, the the Stern system, basically the same thing.

[45:19] What does Williams do with their MPU board set?

[45:22] It also runs on a motor roller 6800 series 8-bit microprocessor.

[45:26] Yeah, same one is ballet, same one is Stern.

[45:30] System three relied on like a dip switch control setting thing.

[45:34] So what are like dip switches?

[45:36] Well, they used it on some of the basically ballet and well, Stern, because they're ripping

[45:42] off ballet.

[45:43] They use all dip switches on the the MPU board in the head.

[45:48] And they're just they're just toggle switches off for on.

[45:50] And basically you use those to set the game settings.

[45:54] So you have to the thing about is you have to go into the head to do this.

[45:56] And you have to turn the game off.

[45:57] You set the settings to where you want everything.

[45:59] Turn the game on.

[46:00] There you go.

[46:01] Williams, they used dip switches, but they also started using where you could do it from

[46:06] the coin door, which if you're used to newer games, you know when you open a coin door,

[46:11] usually they have buttons in there and you can go into a menu and do things.

[46:15] Williams was actually the first to do that as far as I know.

[46:18] And it was rudimentary, but eventually they would take most of the dip switches off their

[46:21] MPU board and everything would be through the through the coin door.

[46:25] So if you have like a firepower and you need to change the setting, open the coin door,

[46:28] you can change the setting.

[46:29] Yeah, pretty innovative.

[46:30] It has an advantage over having to open up the back box.

[46:35] Williams also did this on their video games.

[46:37] Most of the video game them, it's like say, ballet, ballet midway.

[46:41] There were video games which usually have dip switches.

[46:43] So you'd have to open the back of the game up to change switches to do different things.

[46:47] The Williams, they use the same similar system.

[46:49] Open the coin door, you could use the joysticks and the buttons from the game and go into

[46:53] a menu and change stuff.

[46:54] Yeah, they're using the same processing unit, but they're sort of leveraging it in a slightly

[46:58] different manner, which is pretty interesting.

[47:01] So their driver board, it handled the lamps in an 8 by 8 matrix, which was 64 controllable

[47:09] lamps total.

[47:11] And the switches were also an 8 by 8 matrix, which was 64 possible switches.

[47:16] That's a powerhouse compared to the ballet system.

[47:19] It's a lot of switches.

[47:20] Yeah, there's a label to kind of do a lot of things if they want to.

[47:25] So Williams solenoid approach was also a little bit different with the system 3 driver board.

[47:30] They can control 21 solenoids and that's three more than ballet.

[47:35] So the first two Williams system three games still again use chimes for sounds.

[47:41] They would then eventually move into the separate sound board, but again, they don't want

[47:44] to upset the Apple cart too much.

[47:46] For the displays, Williams approach was similar to ballet.

[47:49] They used a six digit score display driven by high voltage gas plasma technology.

[47:56] What was their first game, Ron, out of the gate?

[47:58] Well, I'm looking at your notes here and I was right.

[48:01] I said it was hot tip and I was right.

[48:03] Their first production run, Solid State Machine.

[48:06] It says it has the chimes in it and a score reel in the body.

[48:10] They sold 4903 units in the EM version of that also 1300 units.

[48:16] So they're again straddling dual platforms.

[48:21] They still have that EM because they don't want to go too fast.

[48:24] They've still got a Solid State machine which they can see is selling three to one the

[48:29] amount of units that are coming out of the door there.

[48:32] You can see that the market has responded and basically said, oh, Solid State.

[48:36] I'm trying to think, I think their second game was a World Cup which does have sound

[48:41] without the time unit.

[48:43] They kind of, they went for the sound quickly.

[48:45] Yeah.

[48:46] So by mid 1977, Williams completely stopped manufacturing EM machines because the Solid

[48:51] State sales just continued to climb.

[48:54] The last EM that they would make would be Lucky Seven, 67 units in November of 77.

[49:00] So you can see that EM sales just fell off a cliff almost immediately.

[49:04] Now our listeners are probably saying, isn't this about Gottlieb?

[49:07] Yeah.

[49:08] Well, we got to add context.

[49:09] We have to add what is going on in the industry.

[49:13] Isn't this supposed to be a Gottlieb System 1 podcast?

[49:16] I'm sure somebody is saying out there, it's probably you Joe C.

[49:24] So Gottlieb, well, they didn't develop their own board set.

[49:28] They didn't have any prototype machines.

[49:29] They didn't take a bow and arrow or a ground pre and try to change them over.

[49:35] How did they manage their transition?

[49:37] Let's call it to Solid State run.

[49:39] Well, it said that Gottlieb had trouble developing in-house so they contracted an

[49:43] outside firm to help.

[49:44] Rockwell International was leveraged to design and build the Solid State board set.

[49:49] Today's business world, we call this outsourcing.

[49:53] In America, we call it outsourcing.

[49:55] That's right.

[49:56] Gottlieb is a pinball company, not a computer board set company.

[50:02] So why would a pinball company make computer board sets?

[50:05] Right?

[50:06] Well, Rockwell International was known for a lot of things back in the day,

[50:10] from springs and axles to household small appliance manufacturing.

[50:15] They did defense contracts in the Second World War with the P-51 Mustang.

[50:19] And later on missiles, they were a big time manufacturer of technology back in the day.

[50:26] So who are you going to outsource this to?

[50:29] You're going to outsource to somebody big that knows what they're doing, right?

[50:31] That's kind of the philosophy of the leadership team at Gottlieb.

[50:35] I don't know how to do this.

[50:37] Let somebody else do it.

[50:38] Yeah, but see, they're engineers.

[50:41] They're not pinball people and they're making a pinball solid state platform, which is a problem.

[50:47] That creates some inefficiencies.

[50:50] You don't have coworkers in the same building, sort of working on the system together.

[50:54] You don't have a pinball people making a solid state platform.

[50:58] You have engineers making a board.

[51:01] And that's going to cause a lot of weird things.

[51:04] So, you know, Ron, you're in IT.

[51:06] I'm sure you know what project requirements and project scope is, right?

[51:10] Sure I do.

[51:11] I have to do up a document that has the requirements.

[51:14] This is what I require this software or this whatever to do.

[51:18] And here's the scope.

[51:19] It's to make a EM pinball machine into a solid state pinball machine.

[51:23] So anything that sort of falls out of that scope, anything that I forget to put into my project requirements gets missed.

[51:30] Well, the other manufacturers with their prototypes in house,

[51:33] they're able to sort of work together collaboratively where this is like in a different building in a different state halfway across the, you know, the country.

[51:42] Basically, Gottlieb said, take this EM machine and make it solid state.

[51:48] And the design team at Rockwell did exactly that, didn't they?

[51:52] They did.

[51:53] So let's go into the Gottlieb board set, stats.

[51:56] Yeah, the MPU for the Gottlieb system one uses the Rockwell PPS 4.1, a four bit processor.

[52:04] That's not an eight bit like the Motorola.

[52:05] Nope.

[52:06] These are own chip, not the industry leader Motorola.

[52:09] Of course, Rockwell is going to use their own chip.

[52:11] They're making the thing, right?

[52:12] Gottlieb went with a five by eight switch matrix for 40 maximum switches.

[52:16] The system was limited to controlling 36 lamps maximum, about 30 fewer than Bally or Williams.

[52:24] Right out of the gate processing power is half the switch matrix is basically half, you know, and it's heavily customized.

[52:32] They would have in some OK, correct me here, but I believe on those those boards, they have it's like a spider chip.

[52:38] Yep.

[52:38] Like on say you have a, I'll just pick a Williams game.

[52:42] Say you have a hot tip.

[52:45] You know, on the MPU board, there's going to be a chip or chips that have the game code on it.

[52:49] But with Gottlieb did, Rockwell did, they had a, it's called spider chip that's in all the games and it has basic code on it.

[52:56] Stuff that's going to be the same across all games.

[52:59] Like all games are going to have an out-hole kicker, you know, things like that.

[53:03] They would have it on the spider chip and then there would be another chip with the game code.

[53:07] These spider chips are like completely obsolete.

[53:09] Like if they go bad, you're screwed.

[53:12] There's nothing you can do.

[53:14] And I think they're like, aren't you can't even get the code off of them or something?

[53:17] Here's how about solenoid driver was also limited.

[53:20] So how many solenoids could they run?

[53:23] Eight.

[53:23] That's ridiculous.

[53:25] Again, they asked Rockwell to make this EM work on a solid state and that's what they did.

[53:30] So only got eight solenoids.

[53:31] Why would you need more?

[53:32] And that's the major issue.

[53:34] As you see as we continue to go over this, the other manufacturers were more like,

[53:38] what can we do with this new platform?

[53:40] How can we make the games more insane?

[53:43] Do more stuff.

[53:44] Scott Lee was like, how do we get this EM game to work on solid state?

[53:48] Yeah.

[53:49] So if you took away one solenoid for the knocker, one for the horde hole and three for

[53:54] chimes, you've got three solenoids to drive play field functions like drop targets.

[54:01] That's shenanigans.

[54:03] Now flippers and pops, they bypassed the driver board.

[54:08] They operated more like an EM machine which you alluded to a moment ago.

[54:11] And well, how does it work out for them?

[54:16] Right.

[54:17] They're obviously behind.

[54:19] They've stepped on their first rake already.

[54:21] So they released their first solid state machine, Cleopatra in December of 77.

[54:27] So literally the last one of the door selling 7,300 units.

[54:31] That's proof that they are still the kings of pinball and everything worked out perfect.

[54:36] Still a lot of games.

[54:37] Yeah.

[54:38] Proof like they've sold more than everybody else on their first solid state machine.

[54:41] Yeah.

[54:42] Right out of the gate, everything works out fine.

[54:45] Just wrap it up, Ron, we're done the podcast.

[54:49] Nah, it didn't really work out that way.

[54:51] Yeah.

[54:52] So Gottlieb starts to smash their sales numbers.

[54:58] So Gottlieb made 16 system one machines from 77 to 1980.

[55:06] The highest seller was Sinbad.

[55:11] The second system one released with 12,000 units, gangbusters.

[55:16] If we look at this from Gottlieb's viewpoint here, in the EM days, they're selling 3,000

[55:23] units and that is a smash.

[55:26] That is 3 to 1, pretty much what everybody else is doing on a regular basis and they start

[55:30] selling 12,000 units.

[55:32] They have some of their highest sales ever with system one.

[55:35] 15 out of the 16 machine sold had more than 6,000 units.

[55:40] Yeah, for all the grief that people give them for the old system one platform.

[55:45] If you actually look at this sales numbers, they sold a ton of games.

[55:51] That's a dream compared to the EMs which they were producing.

[55:54] Well, Valley made 8 machines with its first sports set which includes the highest selling

[55:58] pinball machine of all time, 8 ball with 20,230 units.

[56:03] Five of the eight sold over 10,000 units.

[56:06] Yeah, it was like, whoa.

[56:08] Well Williams sold five system three machines and only sold an average of 4,700 units.

[56:16] So Williams isn't doing that great, are they?

[56:19] Yeah, but their system four boards had four games, one of which was Steve Richie's Flash

[56:24] in 1979.

[56:25] It sold 19,505 units.

[56:28] They also had Goregar and Firepower with Speech.

[56:31] They also sold a ton of games.

[56:33] Then in System 7, Steve Richie for System 7, that sold 13,075 units.

[56:38] Okay, calm down here.

[56:39] You're ruining my point.

[56:42] My point is that Gottlieb is killing it.

[56:44] Well, and you've just gone and ruined it for everybody.

[56:47] They're third, but they're a strong third.

[56:49] They're not trying to say, like we're not going to say it ruined their whole, I mean, they

[56:53] were around, let's face it.

[56:54] They're around another 20 plus years after this.

[56:58] They made a lot of good games.

[56:59] They made a lot of games, period.

[57:01] But the thing is, they were the Cadillac.

[57:03] They were number one.

[57:04] And by the end of this, they were three.

[57:05] They kept the same platform, really, from the beginning of solid state, really until

[57:10] the system 80 systems of 1980.

[57:13] And Williams continues to refine their system, right?

[57:16] They go system system six system set, or they go from system.

[57:20] They're, they're so weird.

[57:21] Yeah, they go system three, system four, then system, since system five might have been

[57:25] like a puck boulder or a pitch and bat, I always get confused.

[57:30] It had, there was like one game that's a system five, then system six, which is firepower,

[57:35] then system seven, which is black night.

[57:37] Yeah, so they're refining, right?

[57:39] They're always, they're tweaking, they're updating, they're continuing to innovate, where

[57:43] Gotlabe is like, no, no, no, we're good.

[57:46] You know, this is, this is what, this is what it is.

[57:48] This is an EM machine, and this is it.

[57:50] And Bally was refining.

[57:51] Bally was refining, right?

[57:52] They were upgrading their MPU board and adding more things, speech boards.

[57:56] They were, they were also refining their system.

[57:59] Do you, do you think it's because Gotlabe had blinders on, or do you think it's because

[58:04] maybe the leadership, because they were the, they were the old guard, if you will.

[58:09] It has to, it has to start with the leadership.

[58:13] They were too slow to get into it.

[58:15] They probably needed better personnel or personnel.

[58:18] I mean, you have Williams, we're hiring guys like, you know, the guys like Larry

[58:22] Dimar, Eugene Jarvis, these, these kids out of college programmers, getting them in

[58:27] there working on these systems.

[58:29] The grandfathers of solid state code.

[58:31] Yeah.

[58:32] Gotlabe was just, they were just too hesitant.

[58:35] That, it comes down to the leadership, sadly, in my opinion, that they just were too

[58:40] cautious.

[58:41] They were too slow.

[58:42] They didn't want a course correct after a little bit.

[58:44] But again, and we spoke about this at the beginning of the pod.

[58:47] You know, there's leadership changes at the ownership level, right?

[58:50] Like the company itself was being sold and new managers were coming in and making decisions.

[58:56] And so, you know, the whole, the whole company is shifting and it's, it's sad, really.

[59:03] You know, gotlabe also because they're running these parallel systems of, of, of, of

[59:08] electro mechanical and solid state at the same time.

[59:10] You know, they had that massive operator distribution network, right?

[59:14] So if you're sitting down with your operators and your, and your distributors and they're

[59:17] saying like, well, I don't know how to fix any solid state machine.

[59:20] I just want an EM, you know, stop, stop changing things.

[59:25] So they would continue to make both, you know, rather than upsetting the operators, you

[59:30] know, they just continued to run two of each.

[59:34] And their last EM machine was made in 1979 and they were still doing runs of like three

[59:41] and five, three to 500 units.

[59:44] I mean, it must be horrible running an assembly line with two types of technology.

[59:48] We're not talking like different art packages.

[59:50] We're talking about like different internals entirely.

[59:53] What were some of the issues with system one, Ron?

[59:56] Like what were some of the things that were like off-putting?

[59:59] For me, it would be more just things like the sound when they actually started using sound.

[01:00:04] Oh, the sound.

[01:00:05] If you listen to their sound, next to put it next to a flash or even a Goregar or something

[01:00:10] with the background sound.

[01:00:12] Can you do an impression of a Gottlieb system one soundboard?

[01:00:15] Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

[01:00:18] although, how long countdown it works really well.

[01:00:21] Oh, God, it's just, it's something else.

[01:00:25] Like, when they, you know, they didn't go with chimes, right?

[01:00:28] They were like, nope, we're getting rid of chimes, we're going.

[01:00:31] Well, William, you were just, was like, they just did it like the one game and then

[01:00:35] nope, we're going all that with sound.

[01:00:38] It's, it's bad.

[01:00:39] As far as, I mean, I actually think, bought other plate, think about Gottlieb,

[01:00:43] their play fields, I always thought were, were cool.

[01:00:46] They were different.

[01:00:48] They weren't the same like, I mentioned before a lot of the ballet games are hard to

[01:00:52] tell apart.

[01:00:53] You have orbit spinners that go up to a saucer and drop targets below.

[01:00:58] They use that so many times, very similar designs.

[01:01:02] If you see something like Sinbad, Joker poker, yeah, none of these games are symmetric.

[01:01:08] They're like, well, they're, they're best game countdown probably was symmetric.

[01:01:12] But because of the limitations they had, they really couldn't get too complicated with

[01:01:18] the rule sets on these things.

[01:01:20] There's not much they could do.

[01:01:21] It was like basically, you know, drop targets equal this saucer collect bonus, very target

[01:01:29] awesome.

[01:01:30] Like, they were still very e-m-e in design, right?

[01:01:33] Like, when you're getting into things like flash and firepower and...

[01:01:38] Yeah, there's no, there's no flash lamps, there's no cool, continuous background sound,

[01:01:44] there's no insane lighting effects that are going on in these games.

[01:01:47] No trying to be repeatable loops.

[01:01:50] There's no cross the play field plunges, right?

[01:01:55] It's up to the top, bounce and some bumpers down into the, you know, the lanes, the roll

[01:02:01] over lanes.

[01:02:02] And then into some sort of pop bumper.

[01:02:04] Can we, God, can we also talk about the shittiest spinner of all time?

[01:02:08] Oh, the spinner.

[01:02:09] The funny thing is they had, they had good, they had good flippers.

[01:02:13] They had great drop targets.

[01:02:14] They had the best drop targets.

[01:02:16] The best drop.

[01:02:17] The best drop targets.

[01:02:18] They had, they're cool little rototargets.

[01:02:20] They had their very targets, their, their own thing.

[01:02:24] But man, they started using those plastic spinners and they're awful.

[01:02:28] They spin two or three times, you're lucky.

[01:02:30] They turned, nailed it with the spinners.

[01:02:32] Like they understood that people go apetit for spinners and, God, leave.

[01:02:38] It's like, here's another rake.

[01:02:40] Let's go, it's like, it's like psychobob from the Simpsons, right?

[01:02:43] You just keep stepping on rakes and stepping on rakes just repeatedly.

[01:02:46] Like why would you take the spinner that you had in the end and just have this crappy plastic

[01:02:52] thing?

[01:02:53] Now, can you modify a system one to have, to have the same people do it?

[01:02:59] I think it depends where it's mounted and how it's mounted.

[01:03:02] I've seen, for example, I've seen a Sinbad with the, with a regular spinner on it.

[01:03:07] All right.

[01:03:08] So let's jump into some of the machines specifically.

[01:03:11] So let's kind of go through the list of machines.

[01:03:14] Yeah, I got the list up.

[01:03:15] And one thing you'll notice if you look at the system ones, you'll see that probably because

[01:03:18] of the Columbia purchase, Columbia purchasing them, we now have some licenses.

[01:03:23] Yeah.

[01:03:24] The first game itself, Sinbad, was actually a license.

[01:03:29] Was Cleopatra a license?

[01:03:31] I thought that was the first game.

[01:03:33] Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:03:34] You're right.

[01:03:35] You corrected me.

[01:03:36] You should leave that in.

[01:03:37] Yeah, take that, Joe C.

[01:03:39] So for the second game, Sinbad, that was a license off those series, there was a series

[01:03:45] of Sinbad movies they made in the 70s.

[01:03:47] Yeah, it was a big, he was a big property because he was foreign and mysterious.

[01:03:52] Yeah.

[01:03:53] Close encounters, Charlie's Angels, the incredible Hulk, Buck Rogers.

[01:03:59] Yeah.

[01:04:00] So they started, they started again, some licenses.

[01:04:03] Things are changing in the industry.

[01:04:04] So one thing that's kind of interesting about Cleopatra, their first machine is from December

[01:04:09] of 77, 7,300 units.

[01:04:12] This is their first solid state machine designed by Ed Khrinsky, who's an absolute legend

[01:04:17] in the industry and art by Gordon Morrison.

[01:04:20] That's the other thing I guess we should mention with, with Gottlieb.

[01:04:24] Gottlieb had definitely, they, they, I believe this is from within the company.

[01:04:28] They believed in more family-friendly art.

[01:04:30] Yeah.

[01:04:31] You're not going to see like a Paragon like Backglass, you're not going to see like a Goregar

[01:04:35] Backglass on a Gottlieb of this era.

[01:04:39] Yeah.

[01:04:40] That, that, this sort of transitional period, they want to keep things, you know, they're,

[01:04:43] it's, you know, the Cleopatra Backglass is obviously, you know, focused on, you know,

[01:04:48] boys and adolescent, you know, men, like it's, it's obviously that way, but it's not

[01:04:53] a stern sexy.

[01:04:55] It's not Paragon, it's not like Future Spa or any of those insane Christians and like

[01:05:01] art.

[01:05:02] Yeah, which particularly kind of interesting about this is that originally it was designed

[01:05:07] to have a metal cabinet.

[01:05:08] So they wanted to have a metal cabinet rather than your sort of traditional wood cabinet,

[01:05:13] but it ended up being, you know, very noisy.

[01:05:15] I think it was Doc's Roman F. Doc Garbark.

[01:05:19] Oh God, there's no way that's how his name is.

[01:05:21] Garbark, probably saying that wrong.

[01:05:23] A bit of mechanical engineering at Gottlieb idea to use the metal cabinet, but it had many

[01:05:28] drawbacks.

[01:05:29] It was noisy, hard to assemble and needed more room than we had available to do the assembly.

[01:05:34] Yeah.

[01:05:35] So you could see that already they're sort of tossing out kind of new ideas because,

[01:05:39] you know, sometimes they're just not that great.

[01:05:41] I haven't played a Cleopatra.

[01:05:42] I've seen them for sale.

[01:05:46] It's an interesting sort of design in game.

[01:05:49] It's a, it's very EM oriented.

[01:05:51] Oh, yes.

[01:05:53] In the, it, it's very symmetrical.

[01:05:57] It is symmetrical.

[01:05:58] It is symmetrical.

[01:05:59] You know, is there anything you want to say about that?

[01:06:01] It's pretty boring.

[01:06:02] Wow.

[01:06:04] Have you played one?

[01:06:05] How can you make such assumptions if you haven't played the game?

[01:06:08] I mean, if you looked at a countdown, does it look exciting?

[01:06:10] I don't know.

[01:06:12] Not really.

[01:06:13] I'm trying to defend Gottlieb here.

[01:06:14] I'm of the opinion you got to play the game.

[01:06:19] Okay.

[01:06:20] Well, when I see one, I'll play one and then I'll let you know.

[01:06:22] But it just, it doesn't strike me right out of the gate.

[01:06:27] It's something that I want to put my, my nickel in.

[01:06:30] But their next game, Sinbad.

[01:06:32] Now we're talking.

[01:06:33] So Sinbad, this is one that, this is one that I have played.

[01:06:38] And I have, I did really enjoy it.

[01:06:39] Sinbad to me, to me when it comes to system one games,

[01:06:42] and I'm sure we'll get disagreements,

[01:06:44] disagreements, of course, can be sent to silverball Chronicles

[01:06:46] at gmail.com.

[01:06:48] But I see Sinbad is the, one of the big three

[01:06:51] of system one games.

[01:06:53] And we'll get to the other two.

[01:06:54] But this is the first of the big three.

[01:06:56] It's awesome.

[01:06:57] It's got the scissor flippers.

[01:06:59] Now you can scissor yourself on both sides.

[01:07:01] Love it.

[01:07:02] Love it.

[01:07:02] No slings.

[01:07:03] So the danger isn't left or right from the slings.

[01:07:06] The danger is two flippers stacked on top of each other.

[01:07:09] And then when they lift up, there's a huge gap

[01:07:12] where the ball goes right through and into the out hole.

[01:07:15] And it has one of the great, like we said,

[01:07:19] they couldn't do super complicated things with the rule set.

[01:07:22] But this one little thing they did,

[01:07:24] and they did it again with countdown.

[01:07:27] I, it's one of my favorite rules.

[01:07:28] And that is the multiplier is based off the bank

[01:07:31] you have completed.

[01:07:33] Very good.

[01:07:34] Two X, you have to hit the one bank.

[01:07:37] Three X, you have to hit the two bank.

[01:07:39] Four X, you have to hit the, you get the idea.

[01:07:42] And once you get all the banks of targets,

[01:07:44] if you get them all, you get the five X.

[01:07:46] And it's all bonus.

[01:07:48] What's so cool about this game is the way

[01:07:52] that the drop targets are aligned.

[01:07:55] So there's like an orbit on the left

[01:07:57] that goes all the way back up to your lanes,

[01:08:00] your roll through lanes on the top into the pops.

[01:08:02] But it's got like this one drop target kind of in the middle,

[01:08:05] just like on kind of like where a post would be nowadays,

[01:08:09] it's a drop target.

[01:08:10] Or I guess, you know, that would be a stand up target

[01:08:12] in, in, in sort of modern stern language.

[01:08:16] But it's a drop.

[01:08:17] And then there's a space, like there's like a gap

[01:08:19] of about two drop target widths.

[01:08:22] And you can shoot up into the pops,

[01:08:23] but then you've kind of got four drop targets

[01:08:25] on a slight angle to the left of the pop bumper.

[01:08:29] Then if you go back down to the middle field,

[01:08:31] you've got two drop targets, and then that crappy spinner.

[01:08:35] And then you got three drop targets.

[01:08:37] It's such a really kind of neat layout

[01:08:40] of the way it's kind of sitting.

[01:08:41] And it comes with graphics from the Columbia Pictures,

[01:08:44] the spectacular Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger.

[01:08:47] As it says in their flyer,

[01:08:48] I'm looking at their flyer right now.

[01:08:50] The one thing we didn't mention,

[01:08:51] one of the things that is completely different

[01:08:53] in the Gottlieb, than Williams or Bally,

[01:08:56] there's score displays.

[01:08:58] Oh, of course.

[01:08:59] I'm not using the high voltage plasma displays.

[01:09:02] Using those blue displays, which I always thought looked better.

[01:09:06] I always love the look of those displays.

[01:09:08] The, the, the art on this is very cool.

[01:09:12] It's very sort of whimsical.

[01:09:15] There's like a beast man sitting down there.

[01:09:18] You know, there's Sinbad with his curved blade and his turbine.

[01:09:23] And I'm assuming this is all in the movie.

[01:09:25] I guess so.

[01:09:27] I, the only thing I know about Sinbad

[01:09:29] is that he had a sword and he was Middle Eastern.

[01:09:31] I thought it was, you know,

[01:09:32] I think that this is a really kind of a unique

[01:09:35] cool game through and through.

[01:09:38] The sound I think lets it down, right?

[01:09:41] I think if this had chime.

[01:09:42] It does have chimes.

[01:09:43] There's versions of it with chimes.

[01:09:45] Oh, well, that's another thing we got, leave.

[01:09:47] They had, yeah, there's versions of this with chimes.

[01:09:50] There's versions of this with the sound.

[01:09:52] Oh yeah.

[01:09:52] There you go.

[01:09:53] Oh, then they followed it with one home run

[01:09:55] after another home run.

[01:09:57] Joker, poker, again, 9,000 units.

[01:10:00] I mean, these are consistent, high units here.

[01:10:04] Yeah.

[01:10:04] If you were selling 3,000 units and then right out of the gate,

[01:10:07] you're, you're selling triple that.

[01:10:08] You're like, oh man, this worked.

[01:10:10] Who cares what everybody else is doing?

[01:10:11] Exactly.

[01:10:12] That's why I think that the leadership then kind of

[01:10:14] had the blinders on that sales have gone through the roof.

[01:10:18] But if you're looking at the competitors,

[01:10:22] theirs haven't just gone through the roof.

[01:10:23] They are like in a totally different stratosphere at this point.

[01:10:26] This was also designed by Ed Khrinsky,

[01:10:29] art again by Gordon Morrison.

[01:10:31] And he did a lot of the art during this period.

[01:10:34] It's, you could tell because he used a lot of the same

[01:10:36] coin of couples and, and blues and everything sort of

[01:10:40] flowed together.

[01:10:41] It was very cool.

[01:10:42] Masterpiece.

[01:10:44] I have not played a Joker poker and I'm ashamed to say that.

[01:10:48] If you play a Joker poker, and actually,

[01:10:50] if you play any of the big three, what

[01:10:52] I call the big three games I'm mentioning,

[01:10:55] I'm going to say something that's a little different than what

[01:10:58] I usually say.

[01:10:58] I know they're solid states, but put them on five ball.

[01:11:01] Joker poker is designed to be a five ball game.

[01:11:03] If you look at the center of the play field,

[01:11:06] you will see there's just five different rows.

[01:11:08] It's for the five balls.

[01:11:10] It's supposed to be a five ball game.

[01:11:12] On the, the, the flyer, a bright new snappy playing card game

[01:11:18] from the experts of player appeal.

[01:11:21] Gottlieb Rockwell.

[01:11:23] Solid state system is now universally accepted

[01:11:26] as the most reliable, refined and easy

[01:11:30] to maintain electronic pinball controller available.

[01:11:35] Some of that might be kind of correct.

[01:11:37] I mean, it was probably reliable.

[01:11:40] It was so uncomplicated.

[01:11:41] I probably didn't break often.

[01:11:43] In combination with instant visual attraction

[01:11:46] of the electric blue digital score displays

[01:11:50] and superb, fascinating playboard action,

[01:11:54] Joker poker is your key to record high profits.

[01:11:59] I love these flyers.

[01:12:01] Holy moly.

[01:12:02] I love these flyers.

[01:12:03] I like it.

[01:12:04] I want this game now.

[01:12:05] God, I want one of these.

[01:12:07] I can't wait to just leave it in my living room

[01:12:08] and have electrically high profits.

[01:12:11] Card games were a whole thing, right?

[01:12:14] It's like a whole sub-john.

[01:12:16] Steeple of pinball.

[01:12:16] Steeple of pinball.

[01:12:17] That and pull.

[01:12:18] Yeah.

[01:12:19] Space.

[01:12:20] So it's like, I don't know if it's because, you know,

[01:12:22] nowadays it seems like all the popular pinball machines

[01:12:25] are bands and comic books and superheroes and things

[01:12:29] because that's what we grew up as.

[01:12:31] What we grew up on.

[01:12:32] It's like poker and cards and pool

[01:12:37] was kind of like what the kids of the 60s grew up on, right?

[01:12:42] Like usually you were at home with the family playing cards

[01:12:46] on a Sunday or something.

[01:12:48] And if you were out, you were playing pools somewhere.

[01:12:50] Yeah.

[01:12:51] Where's the Darts game then?

[01:12:52] Was there a Darts pinball machine?

[01:12:54] I'm trying to think of some of my hit.

[01:12:55] Yeah.

[01:12:56] So if you know that one, send that over to Silver Ball.

[01:12:58] Yeah.

[01:12:59] I'm trying to think of a Darts related one.

[01:13:01] The best thing that's a winner.

[01:13:02] Sure.

[01:13:03] So the interesting piece about Joker poker

[01:13:06] is that its play field layout is again, series of drop targets,

[01:13:11] the best drop targets in the best ever.

[01:13:15] Whatever patent they had on that must have been rock solid

[01:13:18] because they were awesome.

[01:13:19] They were thin though.

[01:13:21] They did break off in.

[01:13:22] But I mean, you can get the thing is about this.

[01:13:27] It's a got-leab.

[01:13:28] So you can always get the drop targets at pinball resource.

[01:13:32] Yes, exactly.

[01:13:33] Now, remember from our previous podcast,

[01:13:36] the exclusive providers of parts for got-leab.

[01:13:40] Now, something pretty interesting about this.

[01:13:44] You've got a 10 card, two jacks, and three queens.

[01:13:49] Those are in the exact same position as ZinBads

[01:13:54] except turn to the left on an A.

[01:13:56] Yeah, they are.

[01:13:57] No wonder it's so good.

[01:13:58] And it's got a five bank on the upper left, but further up.

[01:14:02] But it has four extra targets though.

[01:14:04] Down on the bottom, right?

[01:14:05] So you got what?

[01:14:06] So there's-so the funny thing is, when you flip open that cabinet,

[01:14:12] there is one huge drop target bank in the middle of this machine.

[01:14:17] Because what they did is they just put a huge one huge bank

[01:14:20] that did the 10 the jacks and the queens.

[01:14:22] And then they just sort of left two spaces in the middle.

[01:14:25] Yeah.

[01:14:25] So then you could use one solenoid to run that one bank.

[01:14:30] So you can see that they're trying to kind of come up

[01:14:33] with ways around their shortcomings, right?

[01:14:37] Yeah, but eventually they would do things like they would run coils

[01:14:41] using lamp drivers with like another like mini board.

[01:14:45] And yeah.

[01:14:47] Yeah.

[01:14:48] Anyway, it's a very cool.

[01:14:49] It's very cool.

[01:14:50] I would love to give this a go.

[01:14:51] Haven't.

[01:14:52] But I would love to go to go.

[01:14:53] So next we have-

[01:14:55] There's not that many of these folks.

[01:14:56] So this won't take too long.

[01:14:58] Yeah.

[01:14:59] Close encounters of a third.

[01:15:01] Yeah.

[01:15:02] Which is basically on the movie.

[01:15:04] And unlike, like if Valley did this,

[01:15:08] it would have probably at least had Richard Dreyfus

[01:15:11] on the back last somewhere.

[01:15:12] But this game, it's got the alien who's

[01:15:17] at the end of the movie for like seconds.

[01:15:21] What?

[01:15:21] It's 20 seconds where you get to actually see him.

[01:15:25] The like stick man guy and he is the main like graphic

[01:15:28] on the play field.

[01:15:30] Now this was Columbia Pictures movie.

[01:15:35] Yep.

[01:15:35] This is how they're able to now leverage that relationship

[01:15:39] with the higher ups in the industry.

[01:15:42] And it is no more apparent than when you look at the flyer

[01:15:46] for this game.

[01:15:47] I saw in the front of the flyer, it says,

[01:15:49] you were dazzled by it on the screen.

[01:15:52] Now-

[01:15:53] And then you flip it over.

[01:15:54] Very dramatic.

[01:15:55] D Gottlieb and company adapts the spectacular graphics

[01:15:59] and sounds of Columbia Pictures close encounters

[01:16:02] of the third kind to a brilliant smash hit four player

[01:16:06] pinball game.

[01:16:07] A new adaption of Gottlie's exclusive rototarget presents

[01:16:11] an irresistible challenge to every player.

[01:16:14] So one thing that I find interesting here

[01:16:16] Ron that it says adapts the spectacular graphics

[01:16:20] and sound of Columbia Pictures close encounters

[01:16:23] of the third kind.

[01:16:24] Now John Williams of course did the score.

[01:16:27] Yeah, that's not in this game.

[01:16:29] So one would say that there is that, you know, there was that tone

[01:16:33] that they played from the desert to the ship in space

[01:16:38] so they could communicate right?

[01:16:39] And that's actually, is that even in the game?

[01:16:41] No, wait a second.

[01:16:42] So I don't think it's in the game.

[01:16:45] What you're saying is that's all bullshit.

[01:16:47] When you started it doesn't go,

[01:16:48] it makes the same noises as the other games, right?

[01:16:55] It has a rototarget which, let's talk about the rototarget.

[01:17:01] Let's talk about the rototarget.

[01:17:02] I assume Gottlieb had patents on the rototarget

[01:17:05] and the very target because they're not in any other games.

[01:17:07] So what is a roto and why is it awesome?

[01:17:11] It is awesome.

[01:17:12] It is great.

[01:17:12] It's a series of targets that are in a circle that spin.

[01:17:16] So you can only see like three of them at a time on the play field.

[01:17:19] And that's in the top right.

[01:17:21] Yeah, on close encounters, it's on the top right.

[01:17:23] So it's got these three targets.

[01:17:26] There's one in the middle and then you hit it and it spins

[01:17:28] or you hit a switch and it spins.

[01:17:29] And the values are different depending on which ones are there.

[01:17:32] It's very cool.

[01:17:33] It's very cool.

[01:17:34] It is very cool and it has a left orbit spinner.

[01:17:37] Which is a total waste piece of crap.

[01:17:40] Oh, it's a plastic spinner.

[01:17:42] See, that would be a good one to replace because it's in the orbit.

[01:17:45] So you could probably get it going really good.

[01:17:48] And when you get that lit for a thousand and you could rip that spinner,

[01:17:52] nope, not happening.

[01:17:54] You're not ripping it.

[01:17:55] You're getting two spins.

[01:17:57] And it's not even going to make a,

[01:17:59] it's not even going to make that, you know, when you spin it

[01:18:01] and you hit it on an EM or something with chimes,

[01:18:04] you know, you get that feedback.

[01:18:07] It's going to go through when you're going to get,

[01:18:09] then it, then it, then it.

[01:18:10] But again, very bright colorful art package.

[01:18:14] Super cool.

[01:18:15] It actually has devil's tower on the play field from the movie.

[01:18:19] And it's got the alien who is in the movie, like I said,

[01:18:22] for maybe 10 seconds.

[01:18:23] But if you remember, it's like, yeah, that's him.

[01:18:26] The backlash is spectacular.

[01:18:28] It's so cool.

[01:18:29] The backlash has the ship with all the scientists.

[01:18:32] It's got like this purples, these blues.

[01:18:35] Yeah.

[01:18:36] But it just, it just falls flat.

[01:18:37] This is Ed Kinsky again.

[01:18:38] This guy's just banging out designs left and right.

[01:18:41] Gordon Morrison on art again.

[01:18:43] Some people like this game.

[01:18:45] Awesome.

[01:18:46] It's a cool game.

[01:18:47] You know, I'm disappointed in the spinner, like I think

[01:18:48] probably everybody else is, but I think it's a very cool game.

[01:18:52] And you can see again, sales numbers do not lie.

[01:18:55] It's almost 10,000 units, 50 short to 10,000.

[01:18:59] And I'm sure having close encounters on it helped.

[01:19:02] So they follow that up.

[01:19:03] So they've gone 12,000 units, 9,200 units, 9,900 units,

[01:19:09] killing it.

[01:19:10] Dragon.

[01:19:11] 6,500 units.

[01:19:13] Their next one is dragon.

[01:19:15] Still, again, if Stern were selling 6,000 plus,

[01:19:20] currently with every game, I'm sure they would be.

[01:19:22] Woo.

[01:19:23] Super happy.

[01:19:24] Yeah.

[01:19:24] Gary Stern would just, he would buy another Harley.

[01:19:27] He'd be so happy.

[01:19:28] Now, I really like Dragon because I love very targets.

[01:19:36] Very targets are awesome.

[01:19:38] What's a very target?

[01:19:40] A very target is when you hit it,

[01:19:42] it goes back to various distances.

[01:19:46] So if you barely touch it, it'll go back to one position.

[01:19:49] If you crush it, it'll go all the way back to the last position.

[01:19:52] And as you said, there must have been some sort of patent

[01:19:55] that got leave head because they were the only ones that

[01:19:57] had these very targets.

[01:19:58] Which must have expired because I believe there's one

[01:20:01] on Ripley's.

[01:20:03] The thing that's kind of cool about Dragon, besides the art

[01:20:07] is stunning.

[01:20:09] Are these two very targets that are really, really close

[01:20:13] to the flippers.

[01:20:14] But they're not symmetrical.

[01:20:15] One's a bit lower on the right side.

[01:20:17] The one on the left side is up a little bit higher.

[01:20:20] And you can kind of hit that target.

[01:20:21] And it clicks back.

[01:20:23] And the further you go back, kind of the more points you get.

[01:20:26] A lot of these games at this time, you know,

[01:20:29] focused on bonus.

[01:20:31] And specifically, it got leave focused on bonus multipliers.

[01:20:36] It was all about lighting a target,

[01:20:38] maxing your bonus, caching out your bonus.

[01:20:41] Again, the one thing that really lets this machine down

[01:20:44] is an awesome spinner, which didn't lead into the pops

[01:20:47] so you could get a good rip on it.

[01:20:49] But it just, it just doesn't spin.

[01:20:50] Our listeners are probably like, we get it.

[01:20:52] The spinner sucks.

[01:20:53] Stop saying.

[01:20:54] Yeah.

[01:20:55] Do you want to talk about the backlash?

[01:20:57] Backless is a attractive woman riding a dragon.

[01:21:02] It's a little more racy.

[01:21:03] It's still for the time.

[01:21:06] This is toned down.

[01:21:07] But yes.

[01:21:08] It's like a red haired woman in a bikini riding a dragon.

[01:21:14] It's very empowered woman, which is really cool,

[01:21:18] because it's not like, it's not like Paragon

[01:21:21] with the woman who's slave laya being saved by a man.

[01:21:25] Or garghar.

[01:21:26] Or garghar, for that matter.

[01:21:27] This is a strong, powerful woman riding a dragon.

[01:21:31] It's so cool.

[01:21:33] One thing I noticed from the flyers

[01:21:34] is they didn't call it artwork.

[01:21:35] It's called graphics.

[01:21:37] Starterling beauty in the beast graphics.

[01:21:40] Graphics.

[01:21:41] It's cool game.

[01:21:42] I would probably own one of these if I could find one.

[01:21:45] I saw one because I love very targets, right?

[01:21:48] They're so, they add such an odd complexity to the shots.

[01:21:54] And there's this risk reward with very targets,

[01:21:57] because they're very dangerous.

[01:21:59] And these ones are really, really close.

[01:22:01] Do you think we will see a game in the next five years

[01:22:04] with a very target on it?

[01:22:05] Oh, we have to.

[01:22:06] Oh, wow.

[01:22:07] He's saying it.

[01:22:08] Originally Keith Ellwyn's Iron Maiden

[01:22:11] had a very target that they took out, right?

[01:22:13] When it was archer, it had a very target.

[01:22:17] So, and he took it out because he couldn't

[01:22:18] where it was in sort of up underneath the ramp

[01:22:22] kind of at the top of Iron Maiden.

[01:22:24] They said it was really unreliable.

[01:22:25] They would get balls stuck in it.

[01:22:28] Well, we have Jersey Jack, we have deep root.

[01:22:31] If anyone deep root might do it,

[01:22:33] they're trying to be different.

[01:22:34] I think Keith Ellwyn would want a very target

[01:22:36] and he just needs to find the right game,

[01:22:38] the right theme in the place to put it.

[01:22:40] I really do.

[01:22:41] David Dennis wants a very target.

[01:22:42] You heard it here.

[01:22:43] He's demanding a very target.

[01:22:45] Instant sale.

[01:22:46] Instant sale.

[01:22:47] That's it.

[01:22:48] You could put me down for the LE and the $600 top.

[01:22:50] It'd be the worst thing ever.

[01:22:51] He doesn't care if he has a very target.

[01:22:53] He's all set.

[01:22:54] Ed Khrinsky again, right?

[01:22:56] Does anybody else work there?

[01:22:58] Charlie's Angels was the next game based off of the TV show.

[01:23:02] There was actually EM1s produced, which are super rare.

[01:23:05] This was, yes, based on Charlie's Angels.

[01:23:10] But what's particularly interesting there

[01:23:13] is that Charlie's Angels was not a Columbia Pictures.

[01:23:18] Is there a spelling, wasn't it?

[01:23:19] Or was it on ABC?

[01:23:21] Is spelling, Aaron's spelling?

[01:23:23] Yeah, so it was done by Aaron's spelling in ABC.

[01:23:26] So it wasn't a Columbia Pictures property.

[01:23:29] What's interesting there is you can see

[01:23:32] that there's a bit of a relationship

[01:23:34] being built with Gottlieb via Columbia Pictures.

[01:23:38] They're getting some doors open for those kind of things.

[01:23:41] At a different level, I would say, then sort of the other manufacturers,

[01:23:46] because they kind of had this referral arrangement

[01:23:48] where somebody could, hey, come over here

[01:23:51] and check out the pinball division that we have, right?

[01:23:54] So it's a bit cool that they were able to do that.

[01:23:57] And now, thinking about this, is this the first Gottlieb

[01:24:00] that actually has likenesses of real people on it

[01:24:04] as opposed to like, the Closin counters just had an alien on it.

[01:24:06] Didn't have Richard Dreyfus or anything on it.

[01:24:08] Even the Sinbad, it just got the character Sinbad,

[01:24:11] which really looks generic more than anything else.

[01:24:15] This has the actual actresses on the game.

[01:24:18] Yeah.

[01:24:19] We probably did not get a cent for it,

[01:24:20] because no one got a cent back then.

[01:24:22] They just would stick people on the stuff.

[01:24:25] Charlie's Angels was huge, wasn't it?

[01:24:28] Like, it was not, when I was a kid,

[01:24:30] it was more, it was more on the reruns

[01:24:31] because I was a kid of the 80s and 90s,

[01:24:33] and I knew what Charlie's Angels was.

[01:24:35] To the point of nowadays, people still do the sort of the pose,

[01:24:40] right, the Charlie's Angels pose

[01:24:42] in, you know, funny pictures that you might take.

[01:24:45] It was such a huge pop culture icon at the time.

[01:24:48] I'm pretty sure everybody had a pharaoh faucet,

[01:24:51] you know, poster in their room.

[01:24:53] She's not on the game, though.

[01:24:54] She already left.

[01:24:55] No, they're using the other three.

[01:24:58] Well, no, the other two with the other third one.

[01:25:01] I can't remember who replaced her with one.

[01:25:02] I'm not super familiar with the show,

[01:25:04] but I remember she left and was replaced.

[01:25:07] It's not designed by Ed Khrinsky.

[01:25:09] It sold 7,600 units.

[01:25:12] It was designed by Alan Edwell,

[01:25:14] and its art was done by Gordon Morrison again,

[01:25:17] but his strength is certainly not photorealism.

[01:25:22] The back glass is creepy.

[01:25:26] That kind of looks like him, I guess.

[01:25:27] It's just not quite right.

[01:25:30] Certainly not Christopher Franchi.

[01:25:32] This is more like a didn't quite come out

[01:25:35] the way that you wanted it to.

[01:25:37] Again, opinions by David Des.

[01:25:39] I think the coolest part of this machine

[01:25:42] is the fact that it is the Charlie's Angels license.

[01:25:46] It doesn't have your traditional sling on the bottom right.

[01:25:50] It's got like this weird bar sling.

[01:25:53] When it goes out the outline,

[01:25:54] you kind of got to nudge it to make sure

[01:25:56] that it goes into the flipper and not down the drain.

[01:25:59] It has a ferrofosite sort of knock off

[01:26:02] in a bikini kind of on the bottom.

[01:26:03] It's not really ferrofosite,

[01:26:05] but you could tell that people could draw their own conclusion

[01:26:08] that that's exactly who that is.

[01:26:09] No Tom Bosley, either.

[01:26:11] No spinner.

[01:26:12] They just went all drop targets and theme.

[01:26:15] You played one?

[01:26:16] Yes.

[01:26:16] The one I played played very easy,

[01:26:18] and we were on it forever.

[01:26:19] This is a machine.

[01:26:21] I'd have to play maybe...

[01:26:22] I like to play multiple examples

[01:26:24] before I make an opinion.

[01:26:25] When you have a machine that's a bit...

[01:26:26] Muh, you got to bring the old Krinski back.

[01:26:30] Get all...

[01:26:31] Come in here, Ed.

[01:26:32] We need you to bang out another awesome machine.

[01:26:34] So he starts out.

[01:26:35] He goes, let's do solar ride.

[01:26:38] 8,800 units again.

[01:26:40] Good solar.

[01:26:41] Killing it.

[01:26:41] And it's like a...

[01:26:43] It's a woman from space.

[01:26:46] Because she's got a space suit.

[01:26:48] She's riding some sort of alien robot horse thing

[01:26:52] on the back glass, which is cool.

[01:26:55] I guess, apparently, by what Gottlieb says here,

[01:26:59] that it's loaded with exciting features

[01:27:01] to stimulate repeat play.

[01:27:03] Solar ride brings back the split flipper

[01:27:07] with the scissor on the side.

[01:27:08] So you lift up that left side.

[01:27:10] It's going down the drain and between those things.

[01:27:12] It has no kicker on the left side or no sling.

[01:27:14] It does on the right side.

[01:27:16] It's play field is wide open,

[01:27:18] which is very cool.

[01:27:19] It's a bit of a different sort of take.

[01:27:21] Everything now, everything so far

[01:27:23] has kind of had a bit of a crowded midfield.

[01:27:25] Drop targets on the left.

[01:27:28] One thing that I don't think we do enough in pinball

[01:27:31] and modern pinball is the gate

[01:27:34] or the lane to get you back into the shooter lane.

[01:27:37] Right, Steve Richie's done that,

[01:27:39] probably the most in the last, you know,

[01:27:41] in the sort of modern era.

[01:27:43] I love getting in back into that shooter lane.

[01:27:46] I feel like that is like a huge reward for some reason.

[01:27:49] And this has it.

[01:27:50] I remember playing at a pinberg.

[01:27:52] Ooh, this seems like a deadly, deadly

[01:27:54] terminant tournament machine.

[01:27:55] It was.

[01:27:56] I was not a fan.

[01:27:57] It killed me.

[01:27:58] You didn't, you didn't have a good time.

[01:27:59] It has a really cool capture saucer,

[01:28:01] which is really neat, but it's very dangerous.

[01:28:04] I had a bad time.

[01:28:06] That's a problem with tournaments.

[01:28:07] They poison your view of games.

[01:28:09] Hmm.

[01:28:10] After seeing how pinball is played in tournaments

[01:28:12] where you just shoot it up and get it into the shooter lane,

[01:28:14] that game is totally ruined for me.

[01:28:16] In the shooter lane.

[01:28:18] So you shoot up the left side of pinball,

[01:28:20] it goes into the pins, and then you can get it kind of to go

[01:28:23] in back into the shooter lane to increase your multiplier.

[01:28:26] Not every time.

[01:28:26] So I mean, this is a cool machine.

[01:28:28] It's, you know, it's sold a lot of units.

[01:28:30] There's probably a lot out there.

[01:28:31] But again, it's crippled by that horrible sound course.

[01:28:34] That sound board or lack thereof.

[01:28:36] Just a bad sound, really bad sound.

[01:28:39] They pretty much all have bad sound.

[01:28:40] But sometimes the bad sound is good.

[01:28:42] Yes.

[01:28:43] When I said the big three, we did the first two,

[01:28:45] Sinbad and Joker Poker saved the best for last.

[01:28:48] Countdown.

[01:28:49] It's got terrible sound, but it's perfect for the game.

[01:28:52] I usually don't like symmetrical games.

[01:28:54] This game's symmetrical, and it doesn't matter.

[01:28:56] It's that good.

[01:28:57] It's such a cool game.

[01:28:59] Ed Khrinsky, again, this is the two player EM version of this

[01:29:03] was 1979 spacewalk.

[01:29:06] It has a very similar back glass to 1971's Astro.

[01:29:10] Yeah.

[01:29:11] It's back glass, again, done by Gordon Morrison.

[01:29:17] Very gut.

[01:29:17] It's got those blues, the reds in it.

[01:29:20] But it's like a space fellow.

[01:29:22] And he's in his space suit inside of his spaceship.

[01:29:26] He's got his tubes all hooked up.

[01:29:27] He's got knobs and switches, and he's flying a spaceship.

[01:29:30] And it's like he's daydreaming.

[01:29:32] And out the window is like this woman

[01:29:34] who's got stars and sparkle.

[01:29:37] It's a space babe.

[01:29:38] Who somehow does not suffocate out in the vacuum of space.

[01:29:42] She's like she's out in space with no space suit.

[01:29:44] Just yeah.

[01:29:45] In space, nobody can hear you scream.

[01:29:48] Super space spectacular.

[01:29:52] That's what the thing says here.

[01:29:54] Now, this explain the rules to this,

[01:29:56] because it is one of those super easy to understand

[01:30:01] impossible to master.

[01:30:02] Four drop target banks, each are a different color.

[01:30:05] Each correspond to a multiplier.

[01:30:07] So to get that multiplier, you have to get that bank.

[01:30:10] But if you get, for example, three X is yellow.

[01:30:13] If you hit yellow, you get the yellow-branked bank down.

[01:30:16] You don't get three X, because you've got to get the 2X also.

[01:30:19] Yeah, you got to do an order.

[01:30:20] You got to do it in order.

[01:30:22] You don't have to hit them in order necessarily.

[01:30:24] And I know a lot of really good countdown players,

[01:30:26] which I'm not one of.

[01:30:27] This is one of those few games that I absolutely love,

[01:30:30] but I always suck horribly at.

[01:30:32] Usually you like games when you're better at them.

[01:30:34] This one, I can never ever play this well.

[01:30:37] But I've been told to go through the four, the two bottom banks

[01:30:40] continuously.

[01:30:42] I've been told that's the secret to more consistent scoring.

[01:30:45] Now, this has one pop bumper in the middle at the top

[01:30:47] and a scoop above that.

[01:30:49] In this day, in this era, it was very common

[01:30:53] to have bonus collect games, build your bonus,

[01:30:56] collect your bonus.

[01:30:59] So you want to max out your multiplier,

[01:31:01] and then you want to put the ball up to the top

[01:31:04] and into the saucer to collect the bonus.

[01:31:06] Or your drain or hit your most of the time to get up there.

[01:31:10] You mentioned this with ballies.

[01:31:11] You kind of go up the orbit into the scoop.

[01:31:13] Well, this game, it's not that easy to get back up there.

[01:31:16] No, require skill.

[01:31:18] You actually have to hit it up in the corners

[01:31:20] and use the mini flippers to try to get it up there.

[01:31:22] What a concept.

[01:31:23] Because it's got that friggin pop bumper right in the middle.

[01:31:25] So you can't kind of, you know, you might be able to squeak it

[01:31:28] by, but it's not going to happen

[01:31:30] from the bottom of the play field.

[01:31:31] And you have the awesome got-leabed drop targets.

[01:31:34] So you don't have to worry about any bricking,

[01:31:35] which you would not want in this game.

[01:31:36] The first time I played a countdown was in Quebec City.

[01:31:40] I was up there for a business conference.

[01:31:42] And my wife was with me and I said,

[01:31:44] hey, let's go.

[01:31:44] I found this place on the pin-side map.

[01:31:47] Let's go play some pinball.

[01:31:48] I went over and there was a countdown.

[01:31:50] I'm like, oh, I've never played a system one at the time.

[01:31:53] I had never played one.

[01:31:54] So I get on that and I played that so much.

[01:31:58] I was like, that's stupid green targets.

[01:32:00] So let me get those green targets.

[01:32:02] And it's got the center post in the middle

[01:32:04] that lulls you into this false sense of security

[01:32:07] where, oh, I can bounce it off the post

[01:32:08] and back onto the flippers.

[01:32:10] But it just never seems to hit the post correctly.

[01:32:12] Yeah, unless you're a pin-berg, which they remove the post,

[01:32:15] I don't know why.

[01:32:16] But the way that it counts down that bonus,

[01:32:18] and you can build that bonus up, and it just goes,

[01:32:21] do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

[01:32:24] you know how I keep saying we hate those sounds?

[01:32:26] Well, this is the exception.

[01:32:27] It fits this perfectly.

[01:32:29] I don't know why.

[01:32:30] It's so gratifying to hear that noise

[01:32:34] with those targets, with the flippers.

[01:32:37] It's there's something special about this game.

[01:32:40] And I, you can't quite put your finger on it,

[01:32:43] but I think that's why it's amazing.

[01:32:44] Yeah, it's one of only two God leaves am I?

[01:32:46] Must have some day list.

[01:32:47] I would definitely have a countdown.

[01:32:49] So if you've got a countdown in Canada

[01:32:51] that you're willing to get rid of, let me know.

[01:32:54] Let me know.

[01:32:55] And being there's 9,000 plus of them,

[01:32:56] there's a lot of them out there.

[01:32:58] There you go.

[01:32:59] Ed Khrinsky, back at bat.

[01:33:00] Good job, Ed.

[01:33:01] Pinball police just designed and things in his sleep.

[01:33:04] So pinball pool is actually a bit of a modern version

[01:33:09] of the four player hot shot EM 1973.

[01:33:13] A lot of people will recognize hot shot pinball arcade

[01:33:18] for your PlayStation Rex box or on steam.

[01:33:21] And it was designed by Ed Khrinsky and Art by Gordon Morrison.

[01:33:25] And it's going to be sort of updated

[01:33:28] and modernized into pinball pool.

[01:33:31] This machine is likely most notable for its back glass.

[01:33:35] Oh, yeah.

[01:33:36] It's like a robot playing pool with this woman in short shorts.

[01:33:42] And it's weird.

[01:33:44] It is weird.

[01:33:45] I had an opportunity to buy one of these.

[01:33:47] My wife vetoed me.

[01:33:49] Oh, my.

[01:33:49] Because of the back glass.

[01:33:51] She did not think I have two young girls who are under five

[01:33:56] and my wife and wasn't necessarily the atmosphere

[01:34:01] that we wanted to bring into the living room.

[01:34:03] So pretty much all ballies are out.

[01:34:05] Yeah, that's kind of what's going to happen.

[01:34:07] There's no me no paragon in this house.

[01:34:09] Its concept is again, another one of these easy

[01:34:13] to understand difficult to master.

[01:34:14] So on the left side and the right side are pool balls.

[01:34:18] Drop targets, two target banks.

[01:34:21] And you knock those down and you get a pool ball in the middle.

[01:34:24] And in the middle of the play field,

[01:34:26] there's a captive ball and you hit the captive ball

[01:34:29] for your eight ball in the original hot shot game.

[01:34:31] There was a scoop in the middle,

[01:34:33] which added a little bit of complexity.

[01:34:35] I think the captive ball is actually much cooler.

[01:34:38] It's more visually appealing.

[01:34:40] Plus it's kind of, you know, you get that feedback

[01:34:42] when you hit the ball right away.

[01:34:43] David Dennis, the pinball pool expert.

[01:34:46] Mm hmm.

[01:34:46] You know way more about this game than I do.

[01:34:48] Joe C.

[01:34:50] It's a very, very neat game.

[01:34:53] Exactly the same sort of basic rule set

[01:34:56] is all of the other games.

[01:34:57] Build up your bonus, get up that multiplier,

[01:35:01] shoot some drop targets, have a couple of beers

[01:35:03] and enjoy yourself.

[01:35:04] Like we're around this time, right?

[01:35:07] This game is coming out in June of 1979.

[01:35:11] What other games are coming out in 1979?

[01:35:14] Flash, Goregar.

[01:35:16] I know I keep saying those, but.

[01:35:18] You know, you put Goregar next to this.

[01:35:20] Goregar, freaking talks, man.

[01:35:22] And this one sort of like, shoot the balls,

[01:35:24] collect your bonus, right?

[01:35:26] There's no shoot the orbit, you know,

[01:35:29] light the, light the, the pit with the snake

[01:35:31] and the magnet.

[01:35:32] Like you can see that, okay, they started out

[01:35:36] out out of the gate really quick.

[01:35:38] Everybody else sort of waited in fairly quick

[01:35:41] and then all of a sudden they're like on this,

[01:35:42] this hockey stick, right?

[01:35:44] They're just, you know, Williams and Balli

[01:35:45] are just on this upward swing

[01:35:47] like you would not believe around this time.

[01:35:49] Got leave is selling more than they ever have,

[01:35:51] but they're quickly falling behind.

[01:35:54] I guess it would be more apparent

[01:35:55] when you have the games next to each other.

[01:35:57] Oh, could you imagine?

[01:35:59] Yeah.

[01:36:00] Whether you'd just be like, and just hearing them,

[01:36:02] you hear like the background sound

[01:36:03] of Flash or the heartbeat in Goregar.

[01:36:07] And then the Gottlieb, you hear nothing,

[01:36:09] but do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

[01:36:11] That would be pretty sad.

[01:36:12] Gottlieb would go with totem next, Ed Khrinsky, Gordon Morrison.

[01:36:17] We'll file this one under sort of racially insensitive, maybe.

[01:36:20] Yeah, Native American themed.

[01:36:22] Yeah, although not.

[01:36:24] Not bad.

[01:36:25] There've been way worse.

[01:36:26] There've been way, way worse.

[01:36:28] But it's, you know, probably wouldn't swing that nowadays.

[01:36:33] It was a decent looking game.

[01:36:34] It was kind of cool because it had three lanes on the left.

[01:36:38] So it had an outlining two in lanes on the left

[01:36:40] and they shifted everything over the right.

[01:36:42] And it had offset flippers, which I'm sure people love that.

[01:36:46] I don't think you noticed it right away.

[01:36:48] You'd probably notice it after you put your, you know,

[01:36:51] your, your nickel in and started to play.

[01:36:53] But the left flipper is a little bit lower than the right flipper.

[01:36:57] And the right flipper doesn't have an inline.

[01:37:00] So it's a challenge to play, right?

[01:37:02] You're, you're on a bit of a type rope when you're down with that.

[01:37:06] This is where they had something that they called selectable

[01:37:09] multi-mode sound.

[01:37:12] And totem was the first game with futuristic sounds.

[01:37:16] Listen, news sounds around town, musical sounds, futuristic sounds.

[01:37:22] And now God leaves totem can bring them to you.

[01:37:25] God leaves selectable multi-mode sound.

[01:37:29] What does that mean?

[01:37:30] It was not very good.

[01:37:31] See, I should know at that.

[01:37:33] I wonder if it's, is an operator selectable thing?

[01:37:36] Yeah.

[01:37:37] It probably is.

[01:37:38] It did, it was like they could tell they were behind.

[01:37:40] They were, they were behind in sound.

[01:37:42] So now we're going to have music.

[01:37:44] So now we're going to try to pretend that we have something.

[01:37:47] And we're just going to slap something together and try to brand it really well.

[01:37:51] I don't know, totem is all right.

[01:37:52] It sold 6,000 units.

[01:37:53] So it's, it's the worst seller so far.

[01:37:56] You know, we're looking at 7,000, 9,000, 6,000, you know, 8,000.

[01:38:01] Now we're back to 66.

[01:38:05] Ooh, things are getting a little, you know, things are changing, right?

[01:38:09] So what do they do?

[01:38:11] Super wide body.

[01:38:12] Not super, super wide, but almost super wide.

[01:38:16] Let's see.

[01:38:17] It's not super duper, but just super.

[01:38:19] Yeah.

[01:38:20] It's a pretty wide body.

[01:38:21] I think I said that, I think we're talking this before we went on air.

[01:38:24] Gottlieb did, they would have the wide body, like haunted house, black hole.

[01:38:31] That was kind of the wide body.

[01:38:32] It was wide body.

[01:38:33] It was wider.

[01:38:34] Then they had games like Genie, like Roller Disco.

[01:38:37] They're even wider.

[01:38:40] Then they had games like Star Race and Circus and they're even wider.

[01:38:44] It was like, oh, the more stuff on there to do or the more things on there to make it

[01:38:49] look like there's more to do.

[01:38:51] Genie's play feels pretty packed.

[01:38:53] Genie is cool.

[01:38:55] There's somebody in town that owns one in their private collection.

[01:38:59] I haven't been over to play it because the world ended, but I did play one also at my friends

[01:39:03] on Prince Edward Island, Sean and his Genie is just gorgeous, very, very nice machine.

[01:39:12] It's kind of interesting because on the top left, it has like a mini play field, like

[01:39:16] a mini upper play field.

[01:39:18] It's not by level, so it's not above, it's just sort of up in the corner, its own sort

[01:39:22] of isolated area that has some roll overs, too many flippers and a row of drops.

[01:39:28] It adds some kind of interesting play that you get up there because then it'll kind of

[01:39:31] roll down the left side into some roll overs and a pop.

[01:39:35] Just kind of like you would have at the top of the play field, but it's kind of in the

[01:39:38] middle and the left, which then leads to inlay and outlaying and then down to your flipper.

[01:39:44] It's got like this sorcerer looking wizard fellow down there.

[01:39:50] It has this gorgeous Genie character who has like that 1970s fit tummy body.

[01:40:02] Which is, wow, you could tell it was marketed towards like teenage boys, even in the

[01:40:08] sales flyer is very apparent.

[01:40:11] Yeah, yeah, you would never get away with this now.

[01:40:13] Yeah.

[01:40:14] It's the picture of the Genie, like it's really super sexist, it's really demeaning, it's

[01:40:20] horrible, but you could, you know, in the context of the time you can understand what they're

[01:40:24] doing.

[01:40:26] There's so much to do on it, but what's the strategy when you play Genie?

[01:40:30] What do you do?

[01:40:31] If you're playing, you want, you want to hit the four bank when it's lit to increase the

[01:40:36] multiplier.

[01:40:37] That's all I know.

[01:40:38] Every so, every so many hits of different things will light the four bank to increase the

[01:40:43] multiplier and then you just have to hit one of the targets and it'll increase the multiplier.

[01:40:47] Yeah, it's got roll over, star roll overs on the way up into the top play field.

[01:40:51] It's got everything.

[01:40:52] It's kind of satisfying if you shoot from that bottom right side and it goes up and it rolls

[01:40:57] over those three roll overs and hits the drop targets on the top.

[01:41:00] It's got the very Paragon-like left area with the death pop bumper.

[01:41:05] Yeah, instant death right into the outline.

[01:41:09] If you see one of these, definitely give it a go and you're probably going to see a lot

[01:41:13] of them because it sold 6,800 units and, you know, and hopefully the flippers can make

[01:41:20] it up to the top of that massive play field.

[01:41:22] Yeah, you got it.

[01:41:23] You're probably going to have to do a flipper rebuild, right?

[01:41:25] Because if you still have those original 1970s flippers, you know, it's not happening.

[01:41:30] Yeah.

[01:41:31] Their flippers were still good at this point, but if they're that old, yeah, you need to

[01:41:35] rebuild.

[01:41:36] One of my favorite God leaves of this time.

[01:41:39] I haven't played one, so I'm just going on visual and theme alone.

[01:41:42] Oh, you've never played one.

[01:41:44] The incredible Hulk.

[01:41:45] The incredible Hulk, yes.

[01:41:48] It's very green.

[01:41:49] October 1979, it sold 6,150 units.

[01:41:53] So sales are tapering off here in the late 70s, right?

[01:41:57] Yes, they are.

[01:41:58] Very obvious, right, that the competitors are way ahead and the purchases of distributors

[01:42:06] and operators, their money is going into what's making them money.

[01:42:11] And what's making them money is Steve Richie, it's Williams, and it's definitely Valley.

[01:42:19] Yes, it's incredible.

[01:42:21] Incredible action, incredible sound, incredible reliability.

[01:42:25] Hulk has some of the most annoying sounds I've ever heard on his channel.

[01:42:28] So it's so funny that would say incredible sound.

[01:42:31] That sound is incredible.

[01:42:32] Yeah, yeah.

[01:42:33] It's actually the same sound as Genie, but in Genie it works better.

[01:42:37] This, it's just, it doesn't fit anything.

[01:42:40] One thing that's interesting about the sales pitches and we've seen this in the last

[01:42:45] couple of flyers, we've only kind of talked about a little bit.

[01:42:48] Their primary focus is reliability.

[01:42:51] They are trying to beat the reliability drum because when you look at the competitors and

[01:42:56] they've got magnets in them now all of a sudden and sound boards in them.

[01:43:01] Well, this has a sound board in it too, to be fair.

[01:43:04] Well, I know what they're saying.

[01:43:06] The other complicated games, they have more crap that can break.

[01:43:09] R's are reliable.

[01:43:10] We're tanks and they did, they did have very good hardware, got it.

[01:43:14] They weren't, they weren't just two in their horn there.

[01:43:16] They, if you ever look at these, these are solidly built machines.

[01:43:20] It's supposed to like, an old stern, sorry, stern.

[01:43:23] And I mean, that was the thing, but of course the competitors knew you've got maybe 12

[01:43:28] months to earn on that machine and then you got, get rid of it.

[01:43:32] So it doesn't matter if it's reliable as long as it lasts 12 months.

[01:43:34] But like things like that Genie we looked at, it has this cool, like when you lift the

[01:43:38] play field up, you know, it has a prop arm.

[01:43:41] It actually had a prop, it was like an H, like it put it, it was a prop on both sides

[01:43:46] to keep the play field up, stuff like that they did.

[01:43:50] They did very solid construction.

[01:43:51] The Hulk's international peel will earn you instant and continuous high profits in all

[01:43:57] locations.

[01:43:59] Thrilling playboard action carries ball repeatedly to the top of the play area.

[01:44:04] Yeah, all new spotting feature can advance bonus multiplier.

[01:44:07] Yeah, you have to go through the lane that's lit, which just moves around.

[01:44:10] What's kind of neat about this game is it's got these kickers down where the slings are.

[01:44:15] Yes, they do.

[01:44:17] Think, think bonds I run.

[01:44:19] Like the one on the left there.

[01:44:20] It's the same thing.

[01:44:21] So it doesn't, it doesn't have those regular, you know, slings where it comes down and bounces

[01:44:27] off.

[01:44:28] It kind of falls into a hole and then gets shot up the play field, which I assume is

[01:44:31] Hulk punching something.

[01:44:33] You know, I never thought of that, but that's probably what it's supposed to be.

[01:44:36] The one is supposed to like go up the spinner, but it's that terrible plastic spinner again.

[01:44:40] So it might spend twice and just dribble down.

[01:44:43] And any other one it usually would go up near the drop target area.

[01:44:46] Now the strategy for this game.

[01:44:48] Balls were not the strong suit here.

[01:44:51] The strategy here was bonus.

[01:44:53] So all about bonus.

[01:44:55] Get up, get that multiplier up and get that bonus.

[01:44:57] Can you explain what shatsing is?

[01:45:00] And that's not after Taco Bell.

[01:45:01] Also known as an alley pass.

[01:45:02] It's in the ball, balls rolling down.

[01:45:05] See, we'll do it from a trap.

[01:45:06] You have a ball trap.

[01:45:08] You release the flipper, rolls down.

[01:45:10] You wait till the ball gets to the very, very tip of the flipper.

[01:45:13] The last possible second and you flip and it goes over to the other side.

[01:45:17] It rolls up the in lane.

[01:45:19] Hits the switch and comes back down.

[01:45:21] The strategy for this game is to just keep juggling the ball up and down the in lane.

[01:45:26] Left to right and max out that bonus and just let the ball drain.

[01:45:31] If you want to play it, it's kind of fun.

[01:45:33] But if you want to have a high score, it's totally broken.

[01:45:36] But man, that art package is stellar.

[01:45:40] Yes it is.

[01:45:41] So good.

[01:45:43] So good.

[01:45:44] Do you remember the TV show The Incredible Hulk?

[01:45:46] I do.

[01:45:47] Did you watch it every Saturday morning?

[01:45:49] With my cousin.

[01:45:50] Oh shout out to Ron's cousin.

[01:45:52] I think it was, I'm trying to remember the, what day was that on?

[01:45:56] Because there was a bunch of other shows that were on like Friday, Saturday, period.

[01:45:59] There was Hulk, there was Fantasy Island.

[01:46:02] Maybe my cousin we would watch, uh, November 77 to May of 82.

[01:46:08] Yeah, I think we used to watch Hulk and then maybe Duke's a hazard.

[01:46:13] Yeah, can't watch Duke's a hazard anymore.

[01:46:15] That's a, yes, CBS.

[01:46:17] That's correct.

[01:46:18] So it would have been Hulk, followed by Duke's a hazard, followed by Dallas, followed by

[01:46:23] Falcon crest.

[01:46:25] Yausers.

[01:46:26] There you go.

[01:46:27] I see I watched this in rerun like I did most of these old shows and every episode was

[01:46:31] like the Hulk would roll our Bruce Banner would roll into town and there'd be some sort

[01:46:37] of issue in this town and Bruce Banner would try to be the nice guy and fix whatever that

[01:46:43] was.

[01:46:45] But then the Hulk would come out and he would get in trouble with the police or smash

[01:46:48] things or get chased around or the bad guy would find out who he was.

[01:46:52] Then he would eventually solve the problem and then he would just pack up his bag and

[01:46:57] hitchhike to the next town, right?

[01:46:59] Wasn't that like every episode?

[01:47:01] Yeah, pretty much.

[01:47:03] So in Canada, we had the show called The Littleest Hobo, which was a dog.

[01:47:07] Did you get the Littleest Hobo in upstate New York?

[01:47:09] Never heard of that.

[01:47:11] Oh, so it was this dog.

[01:47:13] And this dog would just roll into town on the back of a train and he would solve a crime

[01:47:18] or help out a sick child and then he would just get on the road and go on to the next

[01:47:24] thing or he'd get into a hay truck and the hay truck would take him to the next town

[01:47:28] and he'd solve a crime or something.

[01:47:30] It was a big show.

[01:47:31] Every Canadian is listening now knows The Littleest Hobo.

[01:47:33] And I guarantee they have that Littleest Hobo song playing in their head right now.

[01:47:38] The Hulk is basically a cooler version of The Littleest Hobo.

[01:47:42] The game does not play the Hulk theme.

[01:47:44] The game, the game does not play the Hulk theme.

[01:47:47] It does not play the piano thing at the end.

[01:47:49] No, da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

[01:47:54] God, I still remember that.

[01:47:55] Oh, so beautiful.

[01:47:57] He's just, he just wants to be everybody's friend.

[01:48:00] You know, Hey, Lou Fregno found the perfect role for himself.

[01:48:03] In Lurch did the narration if you didn't know that.

[01:48:06] Oh, no, I didn't.

[01:48:07] Ted Cassidy.

[01:48:08] Oh, and then Lou Fregno was the Hulk, right?

[01:48:11] The bodybuilder got.

[01:48:12] That was a big show.

[01:48:13] It was a big get this license, but it wasn't a Columbia Pictures license.

[01:48:17] This was an NBC universal license.

[01:48:20] Again, those relationships with Columbia pictures are paying dividends,

[01:48:24] even though they may not be Columbia pictures.

[01:48:26] The art on the side has got the Hulk and he's got his fist and it's purple and.

[01:48:30] The back glass is good.

[01:48:32] Show some transforming.

[01:48:33] Yeah, but it blinks.

[01:48:34] It's got those blinker bulbs.

[01:48:36] Yeah, it's based, definitely based on more on the comic book than the actual show.

[01:48:39] Yeah, but they're taking advantage of sort of its proximity to.

[01:48:42] Yes.

[01:48:43] Beaking of licenses, their next game will also be a license.

[01:48:46] Yes.

[01:48:47] Our producer, our producer, seducer Dennis Creasel has one of these.

[01:48:51] He will stream it from time to time on the Ecliptic Gamers podcast streaming channel.

[01:48:56] And that game, it's from deep in space, from tomorrow, from Gottlieb.

[01:49:01] Could it be it's the immortal book Rogers?

[01:49:06] My brother when I was younger was a huge book Rogers fan.

[01:49:11] Massive.

[01:49:12] Beauty, beauty, beauty, buck.

[01:49:13] I remember that guy, the little robot dude.

[01:49:15] Twinkie.

[01:49:16] Yes.

[01:49:17] He's in the game.

[01:49:18] I think he's right on the play field.

[01:49:20] Yeah, he's on the bottom somewhere, I think.

[01:49:23] I'm just, we're just looking at some of the photos here in the middle.

[01:49:26] One of the bummers of this game.

[01:49:28] So it is a very target in the middle between, between the lanes.

[01:49:32] So at the top of the lanes, you got BU, CK for book.

[01:49:35] And there's two of them, two on the left, two on the right.

[01:49:38] And then in the middle, there's a very target.

[01:49:40] And Ron, as you know, I love me a very target.

[01:49:44] But it has a captive ball.

[01:49:46] And you hit the captive ball.

[01:49:48] And then that hits the very target.

[01:49:50] But you got to have some really, you know, heavy, powerful flippers.

[01:49:54] And you really got to hit that ball to actually get that target to move.

[01:49:59] Which is a bit of a bummer.

[01:50:00] Because it doesn't quite work.

[01:50:02] Yeah.

[01:50:03] I, I, I reserved, I won't say anything about the play field.

[01:50:06] Because I don't want to anger our producer.

[01:50:07] You don't, yeah, well, you might get fired and I'll end up with somebody like Bruce Nightingale on this freaking show.

[01:50:12] Wow.

[01:50:13] So on the left side of the play field, it's got two sets of drop targets and then a space,

[01:50:21] which goes up into the orbit, up to the top lanes.

[01:50:24] And then two sets of drop targets.

[01:50:26] On the left side of the play field, it's got another set of drop targets.

[01:50:29] It's a, it's a cool kind of layout, but it just, it just doesn't execute.

[01:50:34] It's not quite right.

[01:50:35] Ah.

[01:50:36] In your opinion, I could think it's the greatest game ever.

[01:50:39] I don't, but who was Buck Rogers again?

[01:50:41] I'm trying to remember who played him.

[01:50:43] I'm thinking Lee Majors, but that's the fall guy.

[01:50:46] Also the six million dollar man.

[01:50:47] That's right.

[01:50:48] He played both of them.

[01:50:49] I don't know who Buck was.

[01:50:50] I know who ducked Dodgers in the 24th and half century was.

[01:50:53] Gildger Rard.

[01:50:54] No idea who that is.

[01:50:55] I had, yeah.

[01:50:56] You know, Buck Rogers is a cool, it's back glass is the most notable part of that game.

[01:51:01] It's not very empowered to women.

[01:51:04] No, it has Buck Rogers.

[01:51:06] Gildger Rard with a woman who I don't remember from the show, honestly.

[01:51:11] Is she a prisoner?

[01:51:12] She's something because he's kind of got her arm behind her back.

[01:51:15] Yeah, he looks like he's, he's captured her of some, some way.

[01:51:19] Yeah.

[01:51:20] And it's like in a gold slave bikini thing and she's got some serious makeup going on

[01:51:25] and some sort of hat with horns or maybe those are her own.

[01:51:27] Yeah, maybe I'll have to take back what I said about Gottlieb and its safe artwork.

[01:51:31] Yeah, you can tell that there's been a shift or a change in their style.

[01:51:37] This is Gordon Morrison, right?

[01:51:38] The same guy that's done all the other designs.

[01:51:41] It was, it's a design by John Buris and you'll remember him from our previous Gottlieb

[01:51:46] episode.

[01:51:47] What do you say about that?

[01:51:49] That's, you know, in the context of its time, you can understand it.

[01:51:53] Nowadays, it's pretty racy.

[01:51:56] One that's interesting is there's a hidden set of names within the bathing suit.

[01:52:02] There's a, yeah, there's a hidden name in our top section.

[01:52:05] It says su.

[01:52:06] Su top section.

[01:52:07] That's a very good way to put it.

[01:52:09] So whoever su is, we're not sure.

[01:52:11] So if you get up in there real close, get up real close to that backlash and look at the

[01:52:15] top part, you'll see su written in the, in the art, which is kind of neat.

[01:52:19] No idea who that is.

[01:52:20] Couldn't find any data about that.

[01:52:22] Speaking of that, if John Norris is listening, I have a question for him and it's, it's pertaining

[01:52:27] to names on games.

[01:52:28] The patron saint of pinball.

[01:52:30] Yes, there's several Gottlieb games that have a steffi name on them.

[01:52:34] The car hop, it's the waitress.

[01:52:36] It's in, it's in at least two other games.

[01:52:39] And I have someone who's very curious on who that is because I can't find it anywhere

[01:52:42] with that information.

[01:52:43] So this sells 7,400 units.

[01:52:45] So it's, it's sales are back up slightly by about a thousand units.

[01:52:49] Thanks to the license, probably.

[01:52:51] It's definitely the license, the brand.

[01:52:53] Buck Rogers was really big at the time, right?

[01:52:54] So wasn't it around that time they had, they had a lot of, they had battle start, galactical

[01:53:00] going on.

[01:53:01] Yeah, they had battle start galactical.

[01:53:02] Yeah, yeah.

[01:53:03] So space is kind of a thing, star track, you know, star wars has taken over the world.

[01:53:10] Space things are cool.

[01:53:12] You know, the art probably drove sales as well.

[01:53:16] So Gottlieb for their next game decides to go wide again.

[01:53:20] Things fell off a cliff here.

[01:53:21] This thing sold 2,400 units.

[01:53:23] We're talking about roller disco and why they're doing disco in 1980.

[01:53:28] Disco is an upswing man.

[01:53:29] No, it's not.

[01:53:30] It's quite the opposite at this point.

[01:53:32] Disco is the future.

[01:53:34] Bonnie M is just killing it.

[01:53:35] This game is a, is a, is a mess.

[01:53:38] It's huge.

[01:53:39] I've never seen one of these.

[01:53:41] Oh, I've, yeah, I've seen them.

[01:53:43] The art is like they're on LSD.

[01:53:45] The art is very busy.

[01:53:47] Gordon Morrison.

[01:53:49] His cartoon-esque designs of figures is much cooler than his photo realistic attempts.

[01:53:58] Let's put it that way.

[01:53:59] What does the flyer say for this one?

[01:54:01] I'm curious how they were selling this one.

[01:54:03] Gottlieb, why should I get this game?

[01:54:05] Pinball roller skating disco.

[01:54:08] Gottlieb's newest wide body brings today's hottest pastimes together.

[01:54:12] Oh my God.

[01:54:13] Cool.

[01:54:14] Cool.

[01:54:15] Because you remember there was another roller skating movie that came out the previous

[01:54:17] year.

[01:54:18] Actually, no, that year.

[01:54:20] It's called Xanadu.

[01:54:22] That didn't do well either.

[01:54:23] Oh, do you think it's because it's a bunch of old dudes, old white dudes that are running

[01:54:29] Gottlieb that they thought that that was cool?

[01:54:32] There were a few years behind.

[01:54:33] I mean, 1977, 1978, that would have made sense.

[01:54:37] Like you've got guys like Larry, Demar, Eugene Jarvis and Steve Richie and like those guys

[01:54:43] are like young and hip and cool and rock and roll and drink at beers and go into clubs.

[01:54:51] And then you got like Wayne Nions and Ned Kinsky and wow putting them down.

[01:54:57] I wouldn't say that's putting them down.

[01:55:00] I just expressed or by David Dennis and not by his co-host Ron Allen.

[01:55:04] They're just not as hip and with it.

[01:55:06] You know, they used to be with it, but then they changed what it was.

[01:55:12] They feel it is so wide.

[01:55:13] Like I say, it's not even the widest they did.

[01:55:16] But I'm like Genie, which had a lot of different sections with a lot of different stuff.

[01:55:21] This is almost, it's a symmetrical play feel.

[01:55:23] Oh God, it has the space invaders like pop-up or thing going on up top.

[01:55:29] Yeah.

[01:55:30] And it's got the sucker shot in the middle where it's like, hey shoot these targets and

[01:55:34] they're positioned right to the out lanes.

[01:55:36] So the first in lane, it goes right down to a top flipper.

[01:55:41] And then there's an out lane and then that out lane goes down and there's a post where

[01:55:44] you can bounce it and it can go into another in lane and down to the bottom flipper or down

[01:55:50] the drain.

[01:55:52] So this is a very nudgey kind of out lane style at the bottom.

[01:55:56] But the art is awesome.

[01:55:59] It's probably the second coolest one of this era in my opinion.

[01:56:05] I like the colors.

[01:56:07] The purples, the pinks.

[01:56:10] It's very cool.

[01:56:11] It's very trendy, right?

[01:56:12] You can tell that it's that Gordon Morrison was hip.

[01:56:17] He knew what was cool.

[01:56:19] It's not Genie.

[01:56:20] But it's not Genie.

[01:56:21] No, but it is cool.

[01:56:22] The back glass is a bit of a let down.

[01:56:24] Well, it's got this in the one person green.

[01:56:27] That's the part I don't understand.

[01:56:28] There's two women on there and one of them is actually green.

[01:56:30] That's what LSD does to you, my friend.

[01:56:32] No, she's not green blue.

[01:56:34] It probably started out as green and it's now faded to blue.

[01:56:36] Yeah, it's got a cool machine.

[01:56:38] Kind of see.

[01:56:39] We're kind of pedoring out here at the end of this era.

[01:56:41] It's sold 2,200 units.

[01:56:43] That is a train wreck.

[01:56:45] But we have a recovery game kind of torch torch.

[01:56:48] Oh, torch.

[01:56:50] So this game was originally called decafalon prior to production.

[01:56:55] It's basically like an Olympic kind of thing where there's all these different international

[01:57:01] flags throughout the back glass.

[01:57:03] There's a woman that looks like she's running into caflon.

[01:57:06] Or no, she's got the the Olympic flame without.

[01:57:09] Yeah.

[01:57:10] And if you were an America, there's probably one theme you wouldn't have wanted to make

[01:57:13] a game based off of the 1980.

[01:57:15] Yes.

[01:57:16] Now be the Olympics that we didn't go to.

[01:57:19] What's interesting here is they actually in the original sort of production, pre-production

[01:57:24] game and the one they used for all the flyers, they actually have the East German flag,

[01:57:30] which they then changed in the production model.

[01:57:33] Oh, that was kind of like the bad Germany.

[01:57:35] Kind of like North Korea is the bad Korea, that kind of thing.

[01:57:38] So during the Cold War, Germany was split into two.

[01:57:41] There was good Germany and bad Germany separated by the wall.

[01:57:45] And in the flyer, when you look at the flyer on IPDB in the picture in the top left,

[01:57:51] there is the East German flag.

[01:57:53] Somebody made the decision to take that off of production.

[01:57:57] I haven't played this.

[01:57:58] Have you played this?

[01:57:59] Probably.

[01:58:00] It was that memorable, eh?

[01:58:01] Well, that's a drop target down in the bottom really close.

[01:58:05] No in lanes.

[01:58:07] It's a hold on to your hat kind of game.

[01:58:11] Actually, it looks like they took close encounters, moved the road to target to the other side.

[01:58:15] Yeah, there's a gate back into the shooter lane.

[01:58:18] Got to love those.

[01:58:19] Again, build your bonus, get your bonus multiplier.

[01:58:22] It's a dude running in the middle of the playfield.

[01:58:24] It's really, you can see what they were going for, but it's not.

[01:58:27] Yeah, but again, nothing super innovative on the playfield going on.

[01:58:31] No, it's like they're just limping along.

[01:58:34] You could tell that they fall back on drop targets.

[01:58:37] Like, give them drop targets.

[01:58:38] We have the best drop targets.

[01:58:39] They're reliable.

[01:58:40] They're easy to change.

[01:58:41] People love drop targets, which they do.

[01:58:43] Actually, I don't know if they're easy to change.

[01:58:45] I've heard different views on that.

[01:58:46] I changed mine.

[01:58:47] I thought they were fairly easy.

[01:58:48] Oh, in that case, they got to be easy.

[01:58:49] Yeah, I have no idea what I'm doing and I could change them.

[01:58:53] When I look at those like Williams early Williams ones, they terrifying me to think about

[01:58:57] changing those.

[01:58:58] Oh, like a horseshoe target.

[01:59:00] You don't want to change those suck.

[01:59:01] Yeah, you just burn the machine.

[01:59:02] So then we get to our last system one game where God leave decides to try something.

[01:59:08] Yeah, I don't know if they were trying to try something here or they didn't care.

[01:59:12] So at this time, and we'll get into this on another pod surprise.

[01:59:16] Take a drink.

[01:59:17] If you're playing the drinking game with us here on another podcast, we're going to go

[01:59:21] into the system 80 era of God, and this is kind of like they're starting that transition

[01:59:26] or head started that transition kind of around 1980.

[01:59:32] They're going to change the platform.

[01:59:33] They've realized that they need better sound.

[01:59:36] They need more switches.

[01:59:38] They need more lamps.

[01:59:39] They got to catch up.

[01:59:41] And in my opinion, I think they probably just had a bunch of parts laying around for

[01:59:45] system one, and they just needed to get something out the door to get rid of those parts.

[01:59:49] And I think asteroid Annie is where that came from.

[01:59:52] It would be the first time that happened.

[01:59:54] Valley did that with spectrum.

[01:59:55] It was over parts, so they just did spectrum.

[01:59:59] What's the significant thing about this game is it's a single player.

[02:00:03] Yeah, which we haven't really seen since the wedgehead era really.

[02:00:05] Yeah.

[02:00:06] It's designed by John Burris sold 2011.

[02:00:10] Oh, that's totally wrong.

[02:00:12] 211 units.

[02:00:15] Gordon Morrison doing the arse again.

[02:00:18] It was card game poker, play in card game aliens with Annie.

[02:00:25] Uh-huh.

[02:00:26] This asteroid Annie and the aliens, like what else can you say?

[02:00:30] It's got a really kind of cool back glass with, you know, the aliens playing cards with

[02:00:36] Annie.

[02:00:37] Very reminiscent of a alien poker to me.

[02:00:39] Yeah, it is kind of like alien poker, isn't it?

[02:00:43] It's collecting cards at the bottom.

[02:00:46] The art is very unique, very off the wall.

[02:00:50] It's got lots of blues.

[02:00:51] It's very black.

[02:00:53] It's got two pop bumpers that are on top of each other.

[02:00:55] It's not left to right, but on top.

[02:00:57] And it's got two sets of drop targets with cards on the left and in the right, but kind

[02:01:02] of up a bit.

[02:01:03] It's got that crappy spinner to kind of a mini orbit or a mini rail that goes back up

[02:01:08] to the top lanes.

[02:01:10] Yeah, I think I would really like to play this game.

[02:01:14] It looks kind of, it looks different.

[02:01:16] It looks kind of unique, which I think is because it wasn't designed by Ed Grinsky.

[02:01:20] I only played it at Pinberg.

[02:01:22] What did you think?

[02:01:23] I can't remember.

[02:01:24] I don't think I did well on it.

[02:01:25] So do you think that that that tainted your liking of it?

[02:01:29] No, not that I didn't play well, but that I only played it once.

[02:01:33] Okay.

[02:01:34] Now, fortunately with Pinberg, when they have stuff in the tournament area, you can't

[02:01:37] really play it between rounds or anything.

[02:01:40] So I didn't get to play it again, unfortunately.

[02:01:42] They got the parts out the door.

[02:01:44] They're moving on to system 80.

[02:01:45] I mean, I guess we can wrap it up.

[02:01:47] We've gone through those games.

[02:01:49] And got leave was too late to move into solid state.

[02:01:53] They were two hands off in its development.

[02:01:55] They were too slow to refine the platform.

[02:01:57] And then they were just too far behind to really recover the footing that they had 10 years

[02:02:03] prior.

[02:02:04] Thank goodness they moved to the saving grace, the system 80.

[02:02:07] It's better than the system one.

[02:02:08] The system 80 put them right back on top.

[02:02:10] Not really.

[02:02:12] But I have heard from people who are a lot more technical than me, that system 80, if it

[02:02:17] was used correctly, it could have been better.

[02:02:20] IE, there's actually a lot of horsepower to the system.

[02:02:23] They just didn't really maybe have personnel to take advantage of it.

[02:02:28] That's this person's opinion.

[02:02:29] But I thought that was interesting.

[02:02:31] I really like the system 80 era.

[02:02:33] And that cheesy 80s that they really get into, those non-licensed licenses, I think

[02:02:38] kind of add to its charm.

[02:02:41] It's not overly complex and complicated and it's kind of fun.

[02:02:45] So I look forward to doing that pod in the future.

[02:02:47] There's a lot of good system 80 games.

[02:02:50] Not just the ones everyone knows, like Black Hole.

[02:02:53] But the game's like timeline.

[02:02:54] It's a really cool game.

[02:02:56] Games like Spirit, which hardly anyone's played, but that's awesome.

[02:02:59] Yeah, they really go through a change.

[02:03:01] So that's it.

[02:03:02] That's our topic for Gottlieb System 1 this month.

[02:03:04] Is there anything else you want to add, Ron?

[02:03:05] My throat is so tired.

[02:03:07] I have a sore throat, folks.

[02:03:08] I apologize.

[02:03:09] I'm fading as the episode sucking out Los Angeles here.

[02:03:13] Our episode topic for next month.

[02:03:16] You're going to do a poll?

[02:03:17] I'm not going to do a poll.

[02:03:19] We're going to do Steve Richie, the Mollit Years, the Steve Richie number two in the

[02:03:25] saga.

[02:03:26] I would do my Steve Richie voice, but I can't.

[02:03:27] That's OK.

[02:03:28] We'll save your voice up for next month.

[02:03:31] So there you go, folks.

[02:03:33] If you're looking forward to the Steve Richie podcast, that's next month.

[02:03:37] If you have a topic you'd like us to cover, I've put something up on our Facebook page

[02:03:42] over at facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[02:03:45] Just leave a comment as to what you'd like us to cover.

[02:03:48] So far, a few people have mentioned that they would like us to cover some of those little

[02:03:52] known pinball companies.

[02:03:53] Ah, Sakurai, that's actually the main one I think of.

[02:03:57] Say it at a ton of games.

[02:03:59] Just hankin' for our Australian listeners.

[02:04:02] Yeah, so we'll take a look at a couple of those.

[02:04:05] And I do have a few others in the pipeline.

[02:04:08] I've been working on a Dwight Sullivan episode.

[02:04:11] It's called Blinded by the Light.

[02:04:12] It's a Dwight Sullivan, Mr. multiplier.

[02:04:16] Or if you've got a better name, leave a comment on our Facebook page for the Dwight Sullivan

[02:04:21] first episode.

[02:04:22] I recently picked up a Simpsons pinball party, which I'm actually enjoying quite a bit.

[02:04:27] Still in the honeymoon phase, but makes me want to do a Keith Johnson episode, who I would

[02:04:31] you know, of Larry D'Amarr and Eugene Jarvis of the grandfathers of modern code design.

[02:04:37] Dwight Sullivan would probably be the father of modern code design.

[02:04:41] Then I'd probably say Keith Johnson's the crazy uncle of pinball design.

[02:04:45] So I look forward to diving into a couple of those topics.

[02:04:49] I'd call him like Mr. Stack.

[02:04:51] If he weren't Stackin', you ain't plain pinball.

[02:04:53] Keith Johnson likes it deep.

[02:04:54] Oh, I'll try this one here.

[02:04:58] I'm afraid his failing me.

[02:05:01] As early as he gets any comments, questions, corrections and concerns to civilballcronicles.

[02:05:06] We look forward to all the messages that we read every one.

[02:05:10] Even if they're from your wide.

[02:05:27] David is telling me I need to plug up with a civilball swag.

[02:05:31] Okay, so let's go to civilballswag.com and look for our t-shirts.

[02:05:36] Who was that?

[02:05:58] Who was that, Joe?

[02:05:59] Joe C.

[02:06:00] Kid Rock guy came back from the grave.

[02:06:02] Joe C.

[02:06:03] Oh, maybe.

[02:06:04] What was that?

[02:06:06] Oh, that was cool.

[02:06:09] And I've got to go to the CEO.

[02:06:12] I've got more game than Kaliko.
