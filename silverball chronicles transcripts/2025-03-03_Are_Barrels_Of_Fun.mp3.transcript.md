[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching silver ball chronicles.

[00:15] Sure.

[00:19] Perfect. He's got the clap.

[00:22] He's got the clap.

[00:24] Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

[00:28] Clap, he's got the clap.

[00:31] And ACDC song, I hate.

[00:55] Hello everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is silver ball chronicles with me this month like every month is Ron

[01:11] snowed in hallet how you doing not yet.

[01:15] No, supposedly, whoo. It's been cold up here in the northeast. Yeah, it's been wild for us. We don't have like a lot of snow

[01:23] like we haven't had any of those epic snowstorms where like 40 centimeters falls down in one like two hour period.

[01:30] I don't know what centimeters are.

[01:32] Oh, I don't I guess I got to look that up right that's like a foot and a half maybe.

[01:35] Come on, you got to use the proper terminology.

[01:38] Mayor.

[01:39] 15 inches.

[01:41] Oh, okay. So like a foot.

[01:44] Yeah, like a lot, a lot of a lot of snow just sort of appears and then you wake up and use your snowblower and get out.

[01:51] We haven't had any of those, but it's been cold. It's been like minus 22, which is probably like minus four or five for you guys.

[01:58] So does every Canadian have a snowblower?

[02:01] Pretty much. Yeah, that's sort of like a, it's like a house has come with them, I think.

[02:05] Yeah, it's like so when I moved, I used to live in Toronto.

[02:09] I sold my house there and I moved to Atlanta, Canada.

[02:13] So when that happens, you have a bunch of like Toronto house sell money and you buy a lot of like lower cost East Coast home.

[02:23] So you got some leftover money and I assigned some of that money for a really nice Honda lawnmower and a really nice Yamaha snowblower.

[02:32] I literally took some of the profit from my home and said it aside for that.

[02:36] So you're in the slums of the Atlantic?

[02:38] Yes, the slums of Atlantic Canada. Just brutal.

[02:42] So you just got back to California though, so that must be really tough.

[02:46] I was told that it was cold for California. It was in the 70s the first two days before it kind of went downhill.

[02:53] Wow. Yeah, that was nice though.

[02:56] Yeah, that's like 21 degrees. I'd kill a man for 21 degrees.

[03:01] I'd kill you run for 21 degrees.

[03:04] Oh, bye.

[03:06] Yeah, and how did you finish over there at Indisk? It never drains in Southern California?

[03:11] I finished fourth in the one tournament.

[03:14] Whoa, hey, that's pretty good.

[03:16] And didn't qualify for anything else.

[03:18] Oh, that's fine.

[03:19] Did you win last year? Did you win classics or something?

[03:21] No, no, I was, that was two years ago. I was like second.

[03:24] Wow. Good for you. Good for you. I wish I was that good.

[03:29] I played in a tournament back like the, I can make the last tournament before

[03:34] provincials or something. And it didn't go great.

[03:39] I finished like way out of qualifying.

[03:41] And this is just me just rolling in. It was not good.

[03:45] Preventuals. Where's my podcast mate on my other podcast,

[03:49] slam tilt podcast. Provisions. Provisions.

[03:51] So when we were, so that brings us up.

[03:54] I co-hosted with you guys over there on the slam tilt podcast,

[03:59] which I was told was the highest rated slam tilt podcast in the last two years.

[04:05] Oh, really?

[04:06] Oh, yeah.

[04:07] Yeah. I was told specifically that I popped a number.

[04:11] I am the hashtag the draw when it comes to podcasts.

[04:16] I always draw a big number.

[04:18] And on there, we played a lot of fun games.

[04:21] And I also go back and listen to that. I think it was like what?

[04:26] Episode five hundred and thousand six hundred and twelve.

[04:31] And a half and a half, I think.

[04:33] Just go to slam tilt podcast.com. You'll see it there.

[04:36] Yeah, it's a good one. It's a good one.

[04:38] When, when we were recording that and then Bruce did say provisional,

[04:42] I did hear it and I'm like, I'm just going to let him roll.

[04:45] I'm just going to let it roll with that.

[04:47] And then you named the episode provisional winners.

[04:50] Because I was just like, I think he said that wrong. I'm pretty sure he did.

[04:54] Did you go back twice? Did you hit? Did you like wait a second?

[04:56] Why? Did you do one of those?

[04:57] It's just during the editing process, you know?

[05:00] I noticed that. He said it wrong.

[05:02] So everybody knows we've sold out, Ron.

[05:05] We are huge sellouts, which is why we got into this.

[05:08] You can see us sell out as much as you want over at patreon.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[05:17] And we've had a few new individuals join us on the Patreon since our last episode.

[05:24] So I would love to thank them personally for joining us.

[05:28] And they said, I love that Ron Hallett, but that's David Dennis guy.

[05:31] They're like, I'm here for Ron. Everyone else is dead.

[05:35] He says out in a weird way. I don't get it.

[05:38] That's right. I want to say thank you to Killer Kim for joining us.

[05:41] Thank you for Darby S for joining us.

[05:46] And Brandon L, you guys kicking in.

[05:49] And probably the person with the best name ever, McBane.

[05:55] I'm McBane.

[05:56] They've joined us. McBane has joined us on the pro level, crony level.

[06:03] And if I haven't, he has come here to lead not to lead.

[06:06] That's right. And Nick H.

[06:08] Thank you for joining us.

[06:09] If we haven't thanked you for joining, we have a few people have joined us at the $3 a month crony level.

[06:15] Which is just to say thank you giving us some of your hard earned money.

[06:19] We really appreciate that.

[06:21] Now a few people jumped up to the $6 a month premium crony level.

[06:29] Very original pro premium and elitist.

[06:33] The $6 a month, they get into the chat room and the discord so they can ask us questions

[06:38] and interact and talk about all of the shenanigans that are going on in the world today.

[06:43] And in pinball, we also sometimes will talk about upcoming topics.

[06:48] And the biggest reason to jump up to $6 a month is the early ad free access to silver wall chronicles

[06:54] before it goes live in the general feeds.

[06:57] You also get a sticker after three months.

[06:59] Ron, what did you do with your sticker?

[07:01] I put it in a little area I have in my basement where I just have nothing but stickers.

[07:07] The stickers? Is that on the door?

[07:09] No, it's by the the streaming table.

[07:12] The streaming table.

[07:13] It was just a big slab of wood there.

[07:15] It's like this is a perfect place for it.

[07:17] Stickers.

[07:18] Have you been doing a lot of streaming lately?

[07:21] I have not.

[07:22] No, you should show off those stickers.

[07:24] Show off that silver ball chronicle.

[07:25] Just stream the stickers, guys.

[07:27] That's it.

[07:28] That's it.

[07:29] But if you want to be an elitist, you can jump up to the $20 a month tier.

[07:33] That is our top tier.

[07:35] After three months, you get a silver ball chronicle t-shirt.

[07:38] And we did have a few individuals join us at that level this month.

[07:41] Wow, we thank you so much for that.

[07:44] You can also interact with us on Facebook at facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[07:50] And we always ask that if you can give us a five star review or the highest amount of stars or thumbs up or check marks,

[07:58] that would be very appreciative because it helps other people find us in the algorithm

[08:03] and helps manipulate the masses to somehow enjoy our banter.

[08:09] And hopefully Apple will update the podcast correctly, unlike my podcast lately.

[08:15] The Slantill podcast.

[08:16] Yeah, I'll ask that episode and show off for two days.

[08:18] I open a ticket with Apple and then the next morning, the episode just showed up.

[08:23] And then they responded to the ticket that night, basically saying like,

[08:28] oh, no, your episode's updated.

[08:30] Thank you.

[08:31] And they closed the ticket.

[08:32] Like, what?

[08:33] Why wasn't it updated?

[08:34] Like, what was the issue?

[08:36] That's right.

[08:37] I hate Apple.

[08:39] You can also grab a t-shirt over at silverballswag.com.

[08:42] We have a couple of design choices to choose.

[08:44] I love t-shirts.

[08:45] You do.

[08:46] You got a couple of those t-shirts.

[08:48] Do you wear them to bed, right?

[08:49] Especially the ones that say Ron's name first.

[08:51] They do.

[08:52] I made sure the new one said your name first because I know that keeps you up at night.

[08:56] Our last episode.

[08:58] This one went over a lot better than I had expected.

[09:04] We got a lot of feedback on this.

[09:07] A lot of hankering for hankin.

[09:08] A lot of hankering for some hankin.

[09:11] Like, we legitimately got a lot of feedback on this, both like formally and informally

[09:20] from like, just people messaging us through the Discord channels or messaging us on Facebook.

[09:29] It's been pretty wild.

[09:31] Grant King.

[09:33] He's a regular sort of reacher outer.

[09:36] He doesn't reach around.

[09:37] He reaches out to all of us.

[09:40] I believe he's an Aussie and he sent a How's That Music video to us over from Australia's

[09:50] YouTube, which I assume is the same as regular YouTube except upside down.

[09:59] And he said great to see the recognition that hankin deserves.

[10:03] They put Aussies on the map when it came to pinball manufacturing in Australia.

[10:08] They also had a big play in cocktail and arcade machines here in Australia.

[10:13] And he says thank you for putting out Mr. Pinball because he is a very well known pinball brand.

[10:19] And has a great reputation here in Australia.

[10:23] Anyone in pinball knows that name.

[10:26] We also had some some feedback here from Steve and Cassandra from Down Under.

[10:33] They wrote a lengthy email and provided a bunch of sources.

[10:39] Yes. And their email is literally hankin pinball so you know.

[10:43] It's no, you know exactly.

[10:45] Now they are very good close friends to David Hankin.

[10:50] And then I guess Hankin pinball has played a large role in their life.

[10:55] Now the coolest thing here is Ron the games that you played at Expo were Cassandra and Steve's games.

[11:06] Yeah.

[11:07] Those games to Robert can now it's at past times permanently I believe.

[11:13] They included a couple of photos of them having a couple of pints in front of their cars.

[11:19] They're holdings. That's what I'm looking for holdings.

[11:22] It's a lengthy email. I don't want to read the whole thing but I did take a couple of bits out that I thought were really really cool.

[11:28] Remember that amazing art that we spoke about on shark?

[11:32] Yeah. Well the shark artwork was done by a 19 year old who happened to be the accountant son.

[11:37] Yeah. The accountant Hankin pinball.

[11:40] What an imagination he must have had says Cassandra and Steve.

[11:48] No joke.

[11:49] And they answered a question I've always wondered which is you know Hankin did Empire Strikes Back.

[11:55] And it is licensed. They didn't like just do it illegally or whatever.

[12:00] And I was wondered how the heck did they get the licensing for that and no one else did.

[12:05] Well David Hankin contacted George Lucas personally and just asked him for permission and it was granted.

[12:14] And the payment was a pinball for George.

[12:17] That's it. That was it.

[12:20] Man.

[12:23] Really the North American manufacturers really blew it on that one.

[12:27] I guess they didn't ask because they figured it be too expensive.

[12:31] I mean and literally he got it for a pinball machine.

[12:34] Brutal.

[12:35] So you hear that?

[12:37] Other pinball manufacturers just call the call of a...

[12:40] Well not anymore but just call someone up.

[12:43] Hey can we do this? We'll give you a game.

[12:46] Wow.

[12:47] The funny thing is I think they gave Lucas a game for the Star Wars video game too.

[12:52] He got like one of the the sit down model.

[12:54] Oh yeah.

[12:55] He got his own personalized one.

[12:58] I would be surprised if that's all they needed to give him.

[13:00] Like here you go.

[13:01] Cool.

[13:02] So Dennis Lilley.

[13:03] The How's That Guy?

[13:04] The How's That Guy right?

[13:06] So How's That refers to what a bowler says when they think that they have got the better out of getting the ball past the bat and knocking over the wickets.

[13:17] You know those like wood poles.

[13:19] So they turn to the Empire and say how's that?

[13:22] And the Empire rules it if the player is out or not.

[13:27] It's like getting three strikes apparently in baseball.

[13:30] And that's the Empire.

[13:32] So it sounds like you're saying the Empire.

[13:34] Said the Empire.

[13:36] So what happens is the bowler knocks the wickets down.

[13:39] He turns up and goes how's that?

[13:40] What do you think they're right?

[13:42] And then he said something.

[13:44] And I guess that they say it with such vigor and such umph that it became sort of his thing.

[13:51] Super cool.

[13:52] Man, oh man.

[13:53] Really good feedback.

[13:55] Really good feedback.

[13:56] Now the other thing that you had asked was about the free game calculator built into the software.

[14:03] Yeah, because that was on every flyer.

[14:05] And I'm like how did how did I never hear this before?

[14:07] Yeah, did they rip off or did they invent before?

[14:11] Yeah, before Williams.

[14:12] Did they beat Williams to the punch?

[14:14] So this is what Stephen Cassandra say.

[14:16] They say I met with David yesterday and he confirmed that Hankin did have a free games calculator built into their software.

[14:23] He was completely unaware that he may have been the first to have it or there was any dispute about who came up with the idea years later.

[14:29] Very interesting.

[14:30] He was quite a humble person.

[14:32] How cool is that?

[14:33] He like they invented something and they're like, uh, whatever.

[14:36] But that's just like Australians and Canadians, right?

[14:38] We're just sort of like we don't need to tell everybody when we do something unlike some other nation that I know.

[14:44] Mark.

[14:45] Woo.

[14:46] And Dr. John.

[14:48] Dr. John also reached out.

[14:49] He says thank you for covering Hankin.

[14:51] I've been trying to get David Hankin on a chat for years, but he's quite a shy man.

[14:58] Just a few things to fill in about the Australian things.

[15:02] Cricket, he says, is enjoyed by the majority of the world except for the Americas.

[15:06] Which is changing.

[15:08] So we are having specifically in Canada, we're having a lot of immigration boom and a lot of that is coming from Southeast Asia and Europe.

[15:16] A lot of those countries are coming to, a lot of those immigrants are coming together and they are starting cricket.

[15:21] They're, they're playing cricket.

[15:22] There's cricket in my town and it's like middle of nowhere in like Canada.

[15:27] He's like they're playing cricket.

[15:28] I never understood it. It always confuses me.

[15:30] The guy throws the ball and he kind of, it seems like it's baseball, but it's not.

[15:34] He also describes all the things about cricket for us because quite frankly, we, I don't understand it quite that much.

[15:43] I know there's different types like there's a type that can be played over the course of several days, like a full game, and then there's others that are more timed or something.

[15:52] Now a lot of hold-in cars apparently have two letter abbreviations for their model descriptions, which is like where that FJ comes from, which is of course one of those old iconic cars.

[16:03] And they really don't make much sense, but there are tons of these initials among hold-in cars.

[16:08] Now you know.

[16:09] And you complained about the regulator on scuba diving, right?

[16:15] So we were talking about shark and how they were like this extra thing floating around.

[16:20] Well, I guess scuba diving is more of a thing in Australia than it probably is in upstate New York.

[16:26] Yeah, I've doubt that would make sense.

[16:28] He says that the regulator is the thing you breathe through, which I did know, and this regulates the pressure leaving the tank into you to breathe.

[16:38] And they also have a second regulator for someone else to use if they run out of air whilst diving.

[16:46] And they call it an octopus, which is why that other one in the art was floating around.

[16:50] Remember we crapped on that. We're like, why does it got two regulators?

[16:53] I also love how they use whilst. I don't use that enough.

[16:56] Wiles.

[16:57] Wiles.

[16:58] Yeah, we used in Canada, we just say while.

[17:01] Yeah, while driving.

[17:02] Yeah, we just say it kind of that way.

[17:04] That's what we say here.

[17:05] But I feel like whilst is better.

[17:07] It sounds fancier. It sounds like you're more intelligent.

[17:09] It does. It does.

[17:11] Which is funny for an Australian.

[17:12] Oh, wow.

[17:15] Not very nice, mate.

[17:17] I know it's all about that.

[17:19] Hi.

[17:20] All right. Shall we jump into today's topic?

[17:25] I thought we were just reading mail for the entire episode.

[17:28] No, it was a long, that was long actually.

[17:30] That took a while.

[17:31] So everybody who complains about the banter being too long in the first of the episode, well, you know what?

[17:36] It's not banter, though. This is actually information.

[17:40] This was pretty legit.

[17:41] Like how else would you know that they got the licensing for Empire Strikes Back by just asking George Lucas?

[17:47] Hey, George. Hello. My name is David Hanken.

[17:50] I'm an Australian pinball manufacturer.

[17:52] We'd like to make an Empire Strikes Back game.

[17:54] I wonder if it's okay.

[17:56] Well, what's in it for me?

[17:57] Well, we'll give you one of the games for free.

[17:59] I'm sure.

[18:00] Okay.

[18:01] You had me at free.

[18:02] You had me at free game.

[18:04] All righty.

[18:08] Have you ever heard the saying pinball is hard?

[18:11] Yes, I've heard that.

[18:12] Well, the team at barrels of fun hasn't, and they've decided to smash on ahead and impress pretty much everyone in pinball.

[18:20] It's been just under two years since they launched their company and their first licensed game.

[18:27] Oh, wow.

[18:28] So here's a disclaimer, because I like to be as ethical, and I like to be as above board as possible.

[18:36] You are very ethical.

[18:37] You might be the most ethical person I know.

[18:39] Pretty bad.

[18:40] That's pretty bad.

[18:41] You don't know enough good people.

[18:43] You spend too much time at the Rochester pinball collective.

[18:47] Which is located at 349 West Commercial Street, East Rochester, New York.

[18:51] A sweet number of 2965.

[18:53] Yeah.

[18:54] Okay. Thanks for that.

[18:55] Brian Savage, who is the Chief Business Officer of barrels of fun, reached out to us at Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[19:05] And asked if we would put together an episode about barrels of fun.

[19:11] Naturally, I was confused, but I was humbled that somebody actually cares about us and sees us as a positive voice in pinball or something.

[19:24] But I was skeptical, and I figured I was being played.

[19:28] I did have a chat with Brian as to what he wanted.

[19:30] He was like, let's do an interview.

[19:32] I'd love to get us cemented in the history and the zeitgeist of pinball.

[19:38] And I'm like, it's not really what we do.

[19:40] We don't really do interviews.

[19:42] As I thought about it after our chat, I thought, man, it would be pretty good to add something new.

[19:50] Because we've gone back quite a bit here in the last little while to older brands and things like that.

[19:57] And I thought it would be kind of neat to dive into barrels of fun.

[20:01] I thought it would be a good break.

[20:03] What about you, Ron? Do you feel like we are promoting or selling out or anything?

[20:08] It's pretty early in the company's history to do an episode.

[20:13] I would think that they have a lot more cool history coming up.

[20:17] Yeah, but we usually wait until there's some sort of scandal.

[20:19] We usually wait until the company explodes.

[20:22] That has not happened here.

[20:23] Exactly. We're looking for drama.

[20:25] And Brian is a fan. I met him at TPO.

[20:29] That's right. Actually, was it TPO for Expo? One or the other?

[20:33] But I still think barrels of fun deserves an episode.

[20:37] Especially since it gives us a really cool case study of a startup that has done it very differently than most.

[20:45] And a manufacturer who has zero drama and has delivered all of their games had a schedule.

[20:51] Even more impressive zero leaks. That is the most impressive part.

[20:55] That's pretty amazing. So I figured, okay, let's give it a go.

[20:59] So here you go. If you want to shoot us some emails and tell us we're selling

[21:01] and we're promoting barrels of fun, I've been up front and in honest here in this situation.

[21:06] Of course, we are Mavericks.

[21:08] In pinball, right?

[21:11] I've decided to make this episode with basically zero input from David and Brian

[21:17] beyond asking a few questions for clarity's sake around production numbers and things like that.

[21:23] So you ready to go? I'm ready to go.

[21:25] All right. It's pinball hard, Ron.

[21:28] Pinball is very hard.

[21:30] Pinball is very hard. Why is it so hard to make pinball?

[21:34] It's pretty easy, right? You just design a play field, you screw some things to it,

[21:37] and then you just do that like a thousand times.

[21:40] Pinballs are too complicated. They have too many parts. There's too much stuff.

[21:45] You got to get parts from everywhere. You got to get parts from Asia. You got to get parts from Canada.

[21:48] You got to get parts from the States. You got to put it together.

[21:51] They all have to be the same. You got a physical ball bouncing around.

[21:54] You got to deal with licensors who are apparently terrible in most cases.

[21:58] Pinball is pretty hard.

[21:59] So they always talk about like it's really easy to make one of something.

[22:03] And it's like kind of hard to make ten.

[22:06] But to make like a hundred is exponentially like the end of the world.

[22:10] And then of course it just gets worse and worse and worse as you ramp it up.

[22:14] Which is why I think when we look at like Stern and J.J.P. to some cases.

[22:18] Some cases we're just like wow.

[22:21] You know what they do is actually really impressive.

[22:24] What did you say?

[22:25] I would say.

[22:26] So what does David Van S say about pinball?

[22:30] Who is David Van S?

[22:31] Well before we get into that what David says is pinball is challenging in the best way.

[22:36] It's an intricate mix of art, mechanics, and physics similar to running a film production.

[22:41] The complexity is what makes it so rewarding.

[22:43] Whether you're a creator or a player.

[22:45] Seeing fans from pinball enthusiasts to fans of the IP, experience the game for the first time is the ultimate reward for all the hard work.

[22:54] Oh.

[22:55] It's so nice.

[22:56] And David Van S is Australian but I'm not going to do an Australian accent.

[22:59] Come on.

[23:00] It would just embarrassingly bad.

[23:02] And he's got that like really good Australian like laid back Australian accent.

[23:07] Oh there's different types.

[23:08] Oh yeah man.

[23:09] Yeah it's just like the states right.

[23:11] You got different accents based on where you are in the country and if you're in the city or in the rural.

[23:15] How about Canada?

[23:16] They have different, they have like some places where they actually say out but others where they say out.

[23:20] No it's all pretty much like that.

[23:22] It just depends on how out it gets.

[23:23] Oh how out it gets I got it.

[23:26] So in Atlanta Canada we have hard ours.

[23:28] We're going to the, hey my buddy and I we got in a car.

[23:32] We went down to the bar and we had a time.

[23:34] Oh okay.

[23:35] But I don't, I try to enunciate more for the podcast so you can understand me.

[23:42] Well do you remember hearing about this new company?

[23:45] I remember hearing rumblings about a new company.

[23:47] That was like, I want to say it was like pre, you know just around the pandemic.

[23:52] There was all this like stuff on Pinside about a new, like oh there's this new company and they're ordering materials.

[23:58] But no everybody was really cagey right.

[24:00] Nobody ever gave any specific details which I thought was really really interesting.

[24:04] Did you, did you bump into this?

[24:07] Well the sticker started showing up everywhere.

[24:10] Yeah so that came after.

[24:12] All of a sudden these people received stickers that said barrels of fun and had this really cool logo.

[24:16] I don't think this was like, yeah I don't think it said barrels.

[24:18] They just had the logo and just the logo.

[24:20] Just the logo.

[24:21] Yeah I don't think it said, it said something like an exclamation.

[24:24] Yeah an exclamation like it's coming.

[24:26] It's coming and everyone's like, oh okay.

[24:28] Oh god.

[24:29] There we go.

[24:30] People were burned out from stuff like deep root and all that like come on.

[24:34] This is about the time that deep root was like imploding.

[24:36] I think it's important to get the backdrop here.

[24:39] The debut was so impressive because everyone's just like okay, like stop with the stupid stickers.

[24:45] Just come out what you're going to come out with.

[24:47] We don't want, you know, we're sick of this.

[24:49] Just because you had all these other failures and people were just, I think there was a low level of expectation about any new pinball company.

[24:56] The best part is a low bar.

[24:58] Just show your stuff and whatever it is and let the else stop.

[25:02] Stop joking around here.

[25:04] Because the thing with deep root was they were like they were teasing all the time and this is coming and every house needs a pinball and every pinball needs a house.

[25:11] It's a good revolutionary, you know, the construction and et cetera.

[25:15] Ferrari pinball for Kia prices.

[25:18] Right, it was all like blah, blah, blah, blah.

[25:21] Remember hearing from an individual on pin side who I thought was crazy and pops up on pin side quite regularly rambling, which I think is pretty funny.

[25:34] And he was like oh no, this company is legit.

[25:36] There's this company coming and they're buying things and things are getting underway and everybody's just like you're crazy.

[25:41] Nobody's paying attention to you, crazy old man.

[25:44] And then it sort of came out and it's like oh, he was, he was right.

[25:48] But I mean, everybody, nobody was spilling the beans as to what was happening.

[25:53] It's just things were happening.

[25:55] But we hear it all the time.

[25:57] The two major principles of this company are David Van S and Brian Savage.

[26:04] So you had asked the question who is David Van S, which by the way, kind of a cool last name, huh?

[26:10] Mm-hmm.

[26:11] David of the S.

[26:14] Well, he was known through his association with spooky pinball.

[26:18] Yeah, that was his big thing.

[26:20] And he's a big lover of pop culture.

[26:23] I have a couple of links to some podcasts where David and Brian are guests.

[26:29] They talk about that predominantly, David.

[26:31] And they talk about a lot of this stuff, which is where I gleaned most of this information.

[26:36] I also stole some of this information from their LinkedIn profile.

[26:39] So it's quite possible that they lied on their LinkedIn profile.

[26:42] Oh, it does that.

[26:43] Who does that?

[26:45] But it says that it says there that David has over 20 years of media experience in film production,

[26:52] post-production, branding, product development, marketing, licensing, and project management from start to finish.

[26:59] He originally went to the International Film School of Australia.

[27:04] You're well aware of the International Film School of Australia or ifsica.

[27:08] I'm ifsica.

[27:10] I just like that.

[27:11] I believe he said he was a stuntman.

[27:13] That's cool.

[27:14] I would put that on my LinkedIn if that's true.

[27:16] Yeah.

[27:17] So International Film School of Australia, right up there with the New York Film School.

[27:21] You know, one of the biggest in the, I don't know, that's a lie.

[27:24] It could be pretty good.

[27:26] But after graduation and after goofing around in Australia for a little while,

[27:30] he moved to Boca Raton, Florida, which I mean, who doesn't want to move to Boca Raton, Florida.

[27:36] Is it a Boca Raton?

[27:38] Is that how you say it?

[27:39] I thought it was Boca Raton.

[27:41] Okay.

[27:42] You can write us in at, yeah, Silverwell Chronicles at e-mail.com and tell us, is it Raton or Raton?

[27:47] I thought it was Boca Raton.

[27:48] That's how I always said it, but I'm probably wrong.

[27:51] Well, I'm Canadian.

[27:52] I don't know.

[27:53] I don't know.

[27:54] But our education system is better than the American one, so.

[27:56] Wow.

[27:57] Now, he worked in video production and eventually became post-production producer for a company called

[28:05] The Editing Company, very original name.

[28:08] Now, this was around 2013.

[28:10] David began working with Spooky Pinball as their creative director and media specialist

[28:16] at the same time.

[28:17] So he started to have these two parallel kind of jobs.

[28:21] Hard worker, I would say.

[28:22] Hard worker.

[28:23] He would travel from Texas to Wisconsin on a regular basis in his car there and back, like on weekends.

[28:32] Or on long weekends or vacations.

[28:35] And he would be working with them.

[28:37] He actually spent a lot of time building a lot of relationships with licensors.

[28:43] He was the major reason that Spooky had secured a lot of the license that they have recently released, such as Halloween,

[28:54] the Looney Tunes, Rick and Morty, those other ones that I'm forgetting.

[28:58] Scooby Doo.

[28:59] Probably, probably Evil Dead.

[29:01] But it doesn't mean that Spooky's not going to be able to get licenses in the future without David Van Ass.

[29:05] Now that he has left Spooky, however, he was one of the sort of the people that kind of taught them how to play that game,

[29:10] which I think is really, really cool.

[29:13] But then it was the pandemic that changed everything.

[29:16] Wasn't it, Ron?

[29:17] Yeah, it did.

[29:18] Changed everything.

[29:19] And you remember the pinball show episode 149.5, right?

[29:23] That was the lowest rated one ever, I think.

[29:26] The pandemic revisited episode, I am the hashtag the draw when it comes to ratings.

[29:31] One of the best episodes ever done, where we talked about the effects of the pandemic on pinball.

[29:37] Have you been on that show since then?

[29:39] I...

[29:40] Exactly.

[29:41] Well, for David Van Ass, it was time for a change as well.

[29:44] And there were many changes at Spooky at that time.

[29:46] Do you remember sort of the upheaval at Spooky during the pandemic?

[29:50] Uh, you mean when Bug took over?

[29:52] Yeah, that was like, like, like Bug, who is, who is...

[29:57] Corwin, Emory.

[29:58] Cor...

[29:59] Yes, Corwin Emory, who is the son of, uh, what's his name, Emory?

[30:05] Charlie.

[30:06] Mr. Emory.

[30:07] He had sort of taken over, and there were some changes among some of the staff and other people.

[30:15] I don't know if that's a one way or the other that people are, you know, I don't think there was any hurt feelings,

[30:20] maybe there was, I don't know.

[30:22] But there were a lot of changes at Spooky, and I remember the rumblings, like people were like,

[30:26] David Van Ass left, and people were shocked because he did a lot of the animation on their screens.

[30:31] And quite frankly, Spooky's animation was pretty good.

[30:34] That's when David started planning something big with Brian Savage.

[30:39] And who's Brian Savage?

[30:41] Brian attended Baylor University in Texas, majoring in business administration, and ended up in sales and marketing.

[30:47] Brian, so Baylor University, is that a university I should know?

[30:50] Uh, I've heard of it.

[30:52] Okay.

[30:53] I actually didn't know it was in Texas.

[30:54] I just, I remember it from more of a sports thing.

[30:56] Yeah.

[30:57] That's a whole thing down there, it's like sports in the States.

[30:59] Yeah, sports are great.

[31:00] So he started a thing called FUN!

[31:03] Publications in 1993.

[31:05] FUN exclamation, all capitals.

[31:07] It ended up becoming a multi-million dollar company, specializing in destination marketing events and limited addition collectibles.

[31:16] So is it fair to say that Brian's a bit of a nerd?

[31:19] Uh, because he's into collectibles.

[31:22] Yeah, I feel like that's a nerdy thing, right?

[31:25] So it's being a nerd cool these days.

[31:27] It is.

[31:28] Is it being a nerd is cool?

[31:29] When did that become cool?

[31:30] Like when all the comic book movies came out and all that?

[31:33] Comic Con, all that.

[31:35] Yeah, I'd say like 20, 20, 2006.

[31:38] So all of a sudden nerds were cool, okay.

[31:41] Yeah, kind of around the time.

[31:42] I would say maybe, you know, the dark night Christopher Nolan to Batman, kind of that started it, I think.

[31:48] Oh, I bet.

[31:49] I think that that's around the time.

[31:50] Now they produced over 34 international conventions as destination marketing specialists and they produced over 450 magazine issues on collectibles and stuff.

[32:04] They also developed over 500 limited addition GI Joe action figures and over 150 limited addition transformers action figures.

[32:11] Ooh, I wouldn't mind the transformers.

[32:13] That's really nerdy.

[32:16] More than meets the eye.

[32:18] So when you think about like action figures and stuff like that, I feel like that's a whole other thing.

[32:25] Yeah, I would definitely like some transformers.

[32:29] Yeah, like transformers were really cool.

[32:31] Transformers were really big in the 80s.

[32:33] I missed out on that when I was younger.

[32:36] I had a buddy of mine who had tons of those.

[32:38] Yeah, I'm old.

[32:39] I have the Megatron gun because he's a gun.

[32:43] Yeah, which was like a, which was like a, that was before that was like, woo.

[32:47] And it doesn't even, it doesn't have the orange thing at the end of the barrel to say it's not a gun either.

[32:51] It's, it's that old.

[32:53] So that was really big and GI Joe's were really big in that like late 70s, early 80s too.

[32:59] That was really a big thing.

[33:00] And those had a bit of a resurgence, I would say probably now.

[33:04] But like action figure collecting is, I think really cool in some ways.

[33:08] But that's a whole sub genre.

[33:10] But you can see that he tapped into that sort of generational zik ice to neither was a magazine.

[33:16] And then you'd go to like conventions like I guess like a pinball convention that would be action figures.

[33:20] And then they had these special limited edition GI Joe's.

[33:23] That's cool stuff.

[33:24] But you don't just get those without relationships.

[33:28] And then again ended up coordinating with Hasbro as the licensee for over 25 years for GI Joe and 12 years.

[33:36] For those transformer brands.

[33:38] And he was one or his company was one of the longest continuous license holders from Hasbro for that GI Joe collectors club and transformers collectors.

[33:49] That's, that's wild.

[33:51] Like that's a, that's a big license to hold on to.

[33:54] He's a real American hero.

[33:56] Yes.

[33:57] How to Brian meet David.

[33:59] How did this, this marriage come about?

[34:01] Well, Brian says David and I met because he sold me a doctor who pinball machine from his collection.

[34:07] Actually, I had to talk him out of it because it was one of the first editions with the Dalek moving topper.

[34:12] I shamed him into selling it because my son was a huge doctor who fan at the time.

[34:17] So we had talked about doctor who, the Dalek topper.

[34:21] Yes.

[34:22] Exterminate.

[34:23] Exterminate.

[34:24] We did that in, in our, in our, Max that made us episode probably, right?

[34:29] Like a doctor who's a pretty cool, like original neat design.

[34:32] It's got some really cool bits and pieces to it.

[34:35] And Doctor who was like, if, if Star Trek and Star Wars was not nerdy enough for you.

[34:42] Yeah.

[34:43] Yeah.

[34:44] You watched Doctor who, I actually didn't watch Doctor who.

[34:46] Yeah.

[34:47] See, I didn't know Doctor who existed until like 2000 and like 10, which is pretty wild,

[34:53] considering that it had been on the air for like 40 years at that point.

[34:56] It's neat, but it's weird.

[34:59] It's like British sci-fi, which if like British comedy is weird,

[35:02] just extrapolate that to British sci-fi.

[35:06] So they began a business relationship around this time.

[35:10] It was this whole thing that, I missed out on this.

[35:13] It's called the Re-Import Cray's.

[35:15] Do you remember this?

[35:16] Yeah, you just get all these machines back from Europe.

[35:19] Yeah, so it was like 2000s, 2010, like the industry used to do.

[35:22] 2010, like the industry had collapsed.

[35:25] And what was happening was like people were buying a bunch of pinballs from like Europe

[35:30] and then they'd ship them back to North America and then switch them back over to American.

[35:35] And a lot of that was with the William stuff because if you remember from our Williams episode,

[35:41] who was one of their biggest distributors, the German distributor,

[35:45] and Williams would send a lot of their early production machines,

[35:50] you know, stuff that would have stuff in it that was taken out later,

[35:54] they would go to like Germany.

[35:56] So then a lot of these got re-imported back into the US.

[35:59] So in your coin box, if you ever noticed that you have like a button that has Deutschmarks on it,

[36:04] or any of that stuff, you likely have a re-import machine.

[36:09] I've seen a few of these EM machines that have been re-imports,

[36:12] that have had like European coins on them.

[36:16] What were the ones like Crohn's?

[36:18] I saw a buddy of mine had one that had like a coin slot button for Crohn's.

[36:22] I'm not with Crohn's.

[36:23] I'm trying to think if I still have any re-imports because I used to have my no fear,

[36:26] I think was German.

[36:27] So yeah, they have no fear in the Germans.

[36:29] Yeah, the knocker didn't work because it was disconnected.

[36:32] And then I found out that was a common practice there where they just unplug it.

[36:35] They didn't like knockers for some reason.

[36:37] Everybody knows that the Germans are very skittish.

[36:40] They're skittish people.

[36:41] So what does Brian say about their real brain?

[36:44] I know what a brain says because that's what it says.

[36:46] Oh, that's well.

[36:50] Whoops.

[36:51] That's going to happen, I think, a bunch in here.

[36:53] Don't worry.

[36:54] Well, Brian says, after the first transaction, the Doctor Who,

[36:57] we were talking about how many containers of pins were coming out of Europe.

[37:01] So we bought one thinking that there were lots of people

[37:03] who were looking for games to refurbish.

[37:05] We did okay with the 33 games.

[37:07] That was the start of our business relationship.

[37:09] It's a good idea.

[37:10] And Brain also said,

[37:13] I had retired from running the Hasbro license GI Joe and Transformers collection clubs for 25 years.

[37:20] And David was working in the pinball industry with spooky.

[37:23] Then COVID hit and the world changed and barrels of fun was born.

[37:28] You remember when Deeproot collapsed, right?

[37:30] Yes.

[37:31] And how there was like this, they started liquidating all the assets.

[37:35] They started sort of selling off the prototype play fields and they sold like all the,

[37:42] all of the metal pieces and side rails and.

[37:46] And there's still legal stuff going on with them to this day.

[37:49] Here in 2025, early 2025, fighting with that,

[37:53] which is why we don't have a deep root episode yet.

[37:55] I'm looking for some closure before I, yeah.

[37:57] Yeah, Robert Mueller is still, they're still trying to get money from them.

[37:59] So that literally is still going on.

[38:01] So when it coll, so they had like pinball legs and they had screws and pieces of metal

[38:07] and manufacturing equipment and the pin pods and LCD displays, this we'll find out later.

[38:15] And this all went up for liquidation auction.

[38:18] A bunch of people picked up some of these things.

[38:20] One of those is Turner pinball and you remember them from their Ninja eclipse game.

[38:25] A lot of these companies that picked up stuff kind of remained nameless.

[38:30] Barrels of fun picked up a bunch of the LCD screens.

[38:34] So if you look at their first released pin at barrels of fun, they have an LCD screen under the glass.

[38:40] We'll get into that.

[38:41] We'll get into that.

[38:42] Don't get ahead of ourselves.

[38:43] All right, all right, all right, all right.

[38:45] To be able to build pinball, you need a place to build pinball.

[38:49] And we spoke about how that was such an issue in Australia for a company called.

[38:57] Haggis.

[38:58] Haggis.

[38:59] Good lord.

[39:00] Wow, it's been, I've forgotten about them that quickly.

[39:03] They struggled with scaling up manufacturing.

[39:06] So the first thing that barrels of fun did was they secured a 19 or 20,000 square foot facility in Houston, Texas.

[39:15] Texas, which is pretty big.

[39:17] Here was one of the clarification things that I did ask over to the team at barrels of fun.

[39:23] And I said, why Houston and not Chicago reasons make sense.

[39:28] The reasons make a lot of sense, although reason one, we don't live in Chicago and don't plan to move there.

[39:34] It's too cold there.

[39:35] And besides David is really he far south Texas.

[39:39] Yeah, he's very like he doesn't want to be, doesn't want to be cold.

[39:43] And I get that.

[39:44] I just know she's this morning, Ron.

[39:46] Yeah, I don't want to snowshoe.

[39:47] Houston is also a huge manufacturing facility with a port for import and export of parts and products worldwide.

[39:54] Labor cost is much lower.

[39:56] Finally, we are developing secondary parts suppliers that other pinball companies don't use.

[40:01] So we have multiple supply channels outside of Chicago.

[40:04] And they're not alone.

[40:05] There's lots of companies that move to Texas.

[40:08] Yeah, there's a lot of manufacturing in Texas.

[40:10] So it's not like it's not like they're in the middle of nowhere.

[40:13] They are in a hub.

[40:17] The only issue is the power grid because they have the wrong.

[40:20] So when it goes out there screwed.

[40:22] Yeah, that's yeah, it's the windmills.

[40:25] The windmills are ruining the power grid.

[40:28] They started working on their first machine.

[40:31] I'm really I really like this machine.

[40:33] So let's talk about this.

[40:34] Just to go back in time here, we were talking about the little stickers and stuff that would show up at shows about this new upcoming company.

[40:43] And it was around it was across the country.

[40:46] Like I was I was an Allentown, Pennsylvania for their show stickers would show up.

[40:51] You'd be like in California for stickers, which these things would show up.

[40:54] Texas, they would show up like what what is this?

[40:57] What is this?

[40:58] This weird logo, this company that's coming.

[41:02] And we finally figured out what it was.

[41:04] It's a cool logo.

[41:06] And they show up at T.P.F. with these lab earth games.

[41:09] Ready to go.

[41:11] They had some inboxes ready to go.

[41:13] For I'd say what I'm most impressive debuts I've ever seen.

[41:17] So you were there.

[41:18] You were there for everything.

[41:20] I was Aaron Jersey Jack, down Vale, Wizard of Oz.

[41:22] And it wasn't I say it wasn't as impressive as this.

[41:25] As far as just the amount of games they had ready.

[41:27] They had a whole row of like ten games.

[41:31] With a never ending line to the to the point where I only got one game in.

[41:36] Because it was just such a long line.

[41:38] They had banners.

[41:40] They had stickers and they had merch.

[41:42] And they like it like they legit launched it.

[41:45] And I think part of the reason why they were able to put such a show of force

[41:50] at the Texas pinball festival was because they had money behind them.

[41:55] It wasn't just a small family or a bunch of guys getting together.

[41:59] You know, it wasn't it wasn't like a gal putting up a go fund me or a

[42:05] what do they call those?

[42:07] There was a guy from a multi million dollar company.

[42:09] He's almost a million dollar company.

[42:11] Yeah.

[42:12] Who did manufacture?

[42:13] We did manufacture.

[42:14] We had relationships.

[42:15] So he's a business person first and a kind of collector marketer second.

[42:21] Which is really important.

[42:23] Because most of the people that start up a company in pinball are just regular individuals.

[42:27] Which is fine.

[42:29] But it's a totally different game if you're trying to make something as hard as pinball.

[42:33] And you're just like an enthusiast.

[42:35] They didn't position it as pinball pinball for everybody.

[42:39] They didn't you know they they know that they're not selling a sub $1,000 pinball machine to the masses.

[42:48] They are specifically focused on the collectible market limited addition numbers.

[42:55] And you need certain credibility and the ability to do that.

[43:01] Because people have to believe in your product.

[43:03] And I think they knew right out of the gate that they had to impress.

[43:07] And you were there.

[43:09] Did they impress?

[43:11] Labrath was the first game I remember since probably was a revise.

[43:15] Like from a debut company where you looked at it.

[43:19] And it looked like a pinball machine by a company that had been making it for 10 years.

[43:24] It didn't look like a home brew.

[43:26] You know what I mean?

[43:28] It looked like a professional manufacturer company that had been doing this for years.

[43:32] So when you went up to it and you gave it like a shake, it didn't go like squeeze.

[43:36] Not just that.

[43:38] It's just the appearance of how it looks.

[43:42] You know what I mean?

[43:44] Like the physical appearance of the pinball machine.

[43:46] Like if you go like highway their first game there.

[43:48] Oh god what was it called?

[43:50] The one with the racing theme.

[43:52] The racing theme.

[43:54] I mean you're writhing on the highway in their car right now.

[43:58] I mean you could tell you okay.

[44:00] It came from a new company because it just looked it.

[44:02] At least to me.

[44:04] This looked like it could have been from any you know long time manufacturer putting out a game.

[44:10] It's just what it looked like.

[44:12] Full throttle. I can't believe I can't remember that name man.

[44:14] I'm getting old.

[44:16] Okay so here's the thing.

[44:18] And it was licensed.

[44:20] The first thing they say is they got a license.

[44:22] And nobody wants to buy the collectible of food truck.

[44:26] Nobody wants to buy the collectible of Barry O's barbecue challenge.

[44:30] They want a theme that is collectible around their brand.

[44:34] And I'm gonna have to say I am shocked and surprised.

[44:38] It is not Transformers or GI Joe.

[44:40] Oh after the other.

[44:42] Like that's like his bread and butter right.

[44:44] Brian Savage's bread and butter.

[44:46] Well they already made a Transformers game.

[44:48] And I'm sure they didn't want to just retread something.

[44:50] Yeah that probably went into the calculation.

[44:52] And GI Joe.

[44:54] I mean it could make a team America world police.

[44:56] Oh that would you know if.

[44:58] That's like a modern day GI Joe.

[45:00] Have they ever made a team America world police?

[45:02] Yes I'm in.

[45:04] But that will never happen.

[45:06] So the theme that they chose.

[45:08] Labyrinth.

[45:10] And Labyrinth is the licensed fantasy creepy muffbitt David Bowie bulge team.

[45:14] They have sold I think over 750 units.

[45:18] Although they targeted 750 units.

[45:20] So they're already head of the game.

[45:22] Game was designed by David Van S.

[45:24] The mechanics by Travis Moseman.

[45:26] Software by Eric Prypke.

[45:28] Prypke.

[45:30] Eric Prypke and Phil Gramaldi.

[45:32] Artwork by Jonathan Bergeron.

[45:34] Who's a name you should recognize.

[45:36] He goes by Johnny Crap.

[45:38] Mm-hmm.

[45:40] Up here in Canada.

[45:42] Yeah he did Jurassic Park for Stern.

[45:44] Animation by Trent Armstrong.

[45:46] Now I remember somewhere around the Rick and Morty time.

[45:52] When that came out at spooky.

[45:54] There were rumblings that David Van S was designing a play field.

[45:58] And he was really he really wanted to jump into doing more than just the marketing animation.

[46:06] And then it never happened.

[46:08] Well what happened with that?

[46:10] And then you know kind of a year or six months after kind of those rumblings came out.

[46:14] It was working on a play field.

[46:16] And it was you know he was very excited to release it.

[46:18] He was gone from spooky.

[46:20] So him becoming the game designer of labyrinth I think is kind of interesting.

[46:26] So let's talk about let's talk about the theme.

[46:28] Yeah what about labyrinth I've never seen labyrinth.

[46:30] Okay you've never seen labyrinth.

[46:32] It's I remember seeing this when I was a kid.

[46:36] I want to say probably like 678 kind of in that age range.

[46:40] And it has this creepy scary childhood feeling in my in my chest.

[46:48] It's like you remember who framed Roger Rabbit please Eddie.

[46:52] No I don't remember it at all.

[46:54] So that movie has the same nostalgic terror in my in my background.

[47:00] Like it was so terror.

[47:02] Yeah with the park when he gets rolled over with the steam that's all right at the end.

[47:06] You find out he's a tune.

[47:08] To this day creeps me right out.

[47:10] Oh well.

[47:11] Oof frame Roger Rabbit game that's what I want.

[47:14] It's good old Jim Hansen.

[47:16] So you know it's going to be decent at all times.

[47:20] I love Jim Hansen.

[47:22] So it has this it creates this feeling in me of like this creepy exciting fantasy.

[47:28] It's got Jennifer Connelly and it's just it's so fun.

[47:32] And it reminds me of being a kid but it also has this just this level of of creepy weird.

[47:36] That makes it so interesting.

[47:38] And I think that's why David Van S was such a big fan as well.

[47:44] He has the same feeling.

[47:46] Labyrinth is the 1986 musical fantasy film directed by Jim Hansen.

[47:52] I believe his last movie directed many of the stars in the film were muppets created by Jim Hansen's creature shop with collaboration of Brian Fraud.

[48:04] And he was and this was actually executive produced by George Lucas.

[48:10] Back when that meant something.

[48:12] So after George Lucas made all that Star Wars money he worked on the executive producing of a lot of films.

[48:18] And this was one of them.

[48:20] And how are the duck was another one.

[48:22] People forget that one.

[48:24] The Indiana Jones films.

[48:26] He was a producer.

[48:28] This film starred a young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie and tight spandex pants where he played the goblin kids.

[48:36] I remember that part of it.

[48:38] After Jim Hansen made the dark crystal in 1982.

[48:42] I like dark crystal.

[48:44] This is Gene Simmons from Kiss.

[49:14] Then afterwards you can swing on over to kissonline.com.

[49:18] See I have not seen dark crystals.

[49:22] Yeah.

[49:24] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:26] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:28] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:30] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:32] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:34] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:36] I have seen dark crystals.

[49:38] It's well, it's kind of dark.

[49:40] And it's not a musical.

[49:42] I remember I saw that Jim Henson documentary on Disney Plus.

[49:46] That's very well.

[49:48] It's very good.

[49:50] Definitely worth it to watch.

[49:52] So Henson and Fraud began thinking of a new film concept after dark crystal.

[49:58] Dark crystal did not do very well in the film.

[50:02] Critics were thought it was okay.

[50:04] Yeah, it's so I was okay.

[50:06] I love that movie.

[50:08] Your feelings of dark crystal are the same feelings that I have for lab.

[50:12] Now the film was written by Terry Jones,

[50:14] who was originally one of the members of Monty Python.

[50:18] Originally he was always a member of Monty Python.

[50:20] That's right.

[50:22] Until he died.

[50:24] Yeah, exactly.

[50:26] As you had mentioned, this was really one of the last major projects for Jim Henson,

[50:32] who was a crazy, nutty, workaholic guy.

[50:34] I believe it didn't do particularly great at the box office.

[50:38] It did.

[50:40] And he never got to direct it on their movie.

[50:42] The last thing that Jim Henson directed,

[50:44] the last project he worked on before he died of a cancer untimely was a cancer.

[50:50] He had like some issue and then he didn't get it looked at immediately and died.

[50:56] Yeah, but I thought it was in cancer.

[50:58] I don't know.

[51:00] It was something that if he'd just gone in earlier,

[51:02] that probably would not have been a problem.

[51:04] Just 53 years old.

[51:06] That's brutal.

[51:08] It just totally robbed, right?

[51:10] We robbed a more cool shit.

[51:12] Having trouble breathing, blah, blah, coughed out blood, might be dying.

[51:16] But he didn't want to take time off from his schedule to visit a hospital.

[51:20] Then he finally goes to the hospital.

[51:22] Multiple abscesses and both of his lungs that was all previous,

[51:26] something that he apparently had for the past few days.

[51:28] But basically he had a really bad,

[51:30] a really bad infection.

[51:32] He had a really bad infection.

[51:34] And he just didn't get it looked at where he would have been fine.

[51:36] So one of the last projects,

[51:38] the last project that Jim Henson worked on before his death was,

[51:42] yeah, was at Hollywood Studios in Disney World,

[51:46] Muppet Vision 3D,

[51:48] which is one of my absolute favorite places in Disney World,

[51:54] which unfortunately is being closed down

[51:56] and they're changing it over to...

[51:58] Is that the one where you go in to the stage and what Waldorf and what's the same name?

[52:04] Yeah, they're in the top. Oh yeah, I did that.

[52:06] It's awesome. It's so great.

[52:08] Now they are changing that over to Monsters Inquiry.

[52:12] Quite frankly, Disney has completely mishandled the Muppets

[52:16] except for like one film in the entire relationship they had

[52:20] since Jim Henson's passing, which is pretty upset,

[52:22] which is pretty sad for me because I'm a huge Muppet fan.

[52:24] This fan is pretty good at destroying franchises.

[52:26] They specialize in Muppets,

[52:28] Star Wars, Marvel, they're great.

[52:30] I hate Disney, by the way, if you haven't noticed.

[52:32] You and I, we're going to Disney World.

[52:34] No, I've been there once that was enough.

[52:36] We'll go and I will be the power hungry guide,

[52:40] walks you through the entire process and manages everything

[52:44] and you just go along for the ride and you will have a great time.

[52:46] So this had a $25 million budget back in the 1980s

[52:50] and it grossed $35 million of the box office.

[52:52] So it did make money.

[52:54] It did get 77% rotten tomatoes, which is less than the dark crystal.

[53:00] However, it took on some serious cult classic after that.

[53:04] In fact, I love this movie so much.

[53:06] I thought, you know what, I'm going to buy this on like Google TV

[53:10] so I can have it.

[53:12] So I've put it on the Google TV.

[53:14] Okay.

[53:15] And I started watching it with my six year old daughter

[53:18] and when the, when the, at the beginning of the movie,

[53:21] David Bowie steals the little baby brother of Jennifer Connelly.

[53:27] And my daughter freaked out and didn't want to watch the rest of the movie.

[53:32] It was pretty great.

[53:34] David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992 that every Christmas

[53:38] a new flock of children comes up to me and says,

[53:40] oh, you're the one who's in Labyrinth.

[53:42] You're not, you're not like David Bowie,

[53:44] the legendary frickin' absurdly rich musician.

[53:48] Right.

[53:49] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said that,

[53:51] I still can recognize for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places.

[53:54] I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie.

[53:57] It's on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same.

[54:00] Which is pretty great.

[54:01] Good for you, Jennifer Connelly.

[54:02] Yeah, she, she looked good and maverick.

[54:04] So we talk about location, location, location.

[54:07] Right, all the time.

[54:09] Well, you know what, in pinball and some people still don't get this,

[54:12] it's IP, IP, IP.

[54:16] That's what sells pinball.

[54:18] What is it saying?

[54:19] We talk about choosing IP a lot.

[54:22] Tom Neiman, you remember him?

[54:24] We spoke about him long, long ago back in the archives

[54:27] over at SilverBallCronicles.com, right?

[54:29] Valley episode.

[54:30] Yeah, he was the bali licensing guru back in the 1970s.

[54:35] You mean games like Wizard, Captain Fantastic, Kiss,

[54:39] Harlem Globetrotters, Dolly Parton, Rolling Stones?

[54:44] Yeah, the good Rolling Stones.

[54:46] Ooh.

[54:47] Yeah.

[54:48] This was like, this was forever ago.

[54:52] And we still have not learned marketing and IP is everything.

[54:57] Tom Neiman says, I kind of became the licensing guy for a bali corporate.

[55:01] I work with amusement parks trying to cross promote with some licensing deals.

[55:05] There it is.

[55:06] Cross promote.

[55:08] The licensor promotes you because they want their brand out there.

[55:13] You promote the brand because you want people to have an emotional connection to that.

[55:20] That is why David Bowie's bulge is so important to selling pinball

[55:26] because I remember that as my childhood and it brings back that emotion.

[55:32] Neiman explained on a few older podcasts back in the day in a couple of interviews

[55:37] and in the pinball compendium book, I'll link it in the show notes.

[55:41] He explained that he was able to get licenses through directly contacting those relevant parties,

[55:47] movie studios, record labels, celebrities, and negotiating deals where bali would provide

[55:52] a certain number of pinball machines as payment rather than upfront cash payments.

[55:59] Now of course, I'm sure that is significantly changed nowadays unless you're George Lucas

[56:03] and you'll do anything for a pinball machine.

[56:06] But this allowed bali to produce very successful licensed pinball games

[56:11] that sold significantly more units than their unlicensed counterparts.

[56:17] When licensing is too expensive, you go to your own white label kind of branding things.

[56:24] But having a license is not the only thing you need, right?

[56:27] According to Roger Sharp, as he stated on Topcast episode 17,

[56:32] he feels that the key is blending the design team's ideas with the license

[56:36] rather than just doing a work for higher license gain.

[56:39] You believe the quality of the game design and creativity was more important than just having the license.

[56:44] That's right. So back in the 70s, right?

[56:46] You just had a play field and slapped some art on and it was kiss.

[56:49] Right now it's sold more than if it would be like fire banned 2000s.

[56:54] It could have been any design. It could have been any theme.

[56:57] But because it was kiss, it sold more.

[57:01] Now we get into the 1990s where Roger Sharp is like the licensing guru over at Valley Williams.

[57:08] And it's become more about theme immersion and how the actual design team melds with the license.

[57:15] So plenty of people back in the day would make a game and then they would slap a design on it.

[57:21] Well, that doesn't work anymore in the 90s.

[57:23] We'll bring it back to Labrath. Brian Savage says,

[57:27] Our company vision is from the collector fans perspective.

[57:30] We first decide if an intellectual property is interesting to us.

[57:33] And will it make a great game? Some IPs are great, but may not translate well to pinball.

[57:38] The world is everything. If it doesn't scream the IP to the player, we will have not done our job.

[57:44] We want people to purchase our games because they love the world we have created and they find the game very entertaining.

[57:51] I mean, a great example of IP integration is something that is sometimes hit or mess over at JJP.

[57:59] Kind of look at Toy Story 4 and it's sort of like that could almost be any game with just art on it.

[58:05] But when you look at something like their latest release, Avatar, that is like,

[58:11] that screams world under glass. But that's what Brian and David Van S want to have is they want everything to scream IP.

[58:23] Well, as far as it so since you're a Labrath guy, did they do it?

[58:28] They really like really nailed it. It is Labrath through and through.

[58:32] It has all of the characters and little bits. Let's talk about the flyer first.

[58:38] Because we love our flyers.

[58:40] Because we love it. And they did a great job. There's no puns, which makes me a little sad.

[58:44] They got David Bowie right on there, which was a good idea.

[58:47] They knew exactly what to do. It's an all new pinball adventure.

[58:52] Yes, return to Jim Hansen's most iconic world of Goblins, Maze's, Boggs and more as you venture on your own quest to escape the Goblin King's Labyrinth.

[59:05] Featuring the music of David Bowie from the Labyrinth soundtrack.

[59:09] Yes, Magic Dance. That's the one that everybody knows.

[59:12] Underground, chilly down as the world falls down. Also very good one within you.

[59:18] But the like the back glass with David Bowie and his teased hair and eyebrows.

[59:24] It's just awesome.

[59:27] I like with the modern licensing. You need two paragraphs of credits at the bottom of all the license.

[59:34] Yes, it serves. Who owns what? Can we zoom in on that?

[59:37] Let me see if I can zoom in and see if I can actually all game elements barrels of fun.

[59:42] Jim Hansen trademark and logo, Labyrinth trademark and logo.

[59:47] Jim Hansen company motion picture, Labyrinth Enterprises, Magic Dance, all the music is owned by WC Music Corps.

[59:57] Probably a David Bowie license for his likeness or something.

[01:00:01] There's a lot of like fine print down there, which is pretty funny.

[01:00:04] When we look at the backside of this flyer, it is Labyrinth.

[01:00:09] So Labyrinth is, it's all, it's, so this girl, she gets sucked into this maze that's always shifting and changing.

[01:00:17] And it has all these weird, strange, you know, muppety characters down there.

[01:00:22] And those characters along with the Labyrinth themselves are just the core of that entire film.

[01:00:30] Each one of those little details are in this pin.

[01:00:34] This is why I wanted to do an episode on it because I love Labyrinth and this screams it.

[01:00:40] The little worm dude that's sort of the guide that she meets when she first enters the Labyrinth.

[01:00:45] His name is I think L.O. which is short for hello, pops up over by the skill shot area.

[01:00:51] And then they have the pop up sculpts that are the, what the heck do they call those guys?

[01:00:58] They're like these little like, and they tease you and harass you and bother you.

[01:01:02] All I know is they had me when I, you drain on the left side and the little guy pops out of the apron.

[01:01:07] It marks you. If the game is mocking me in any way, I'm immediately a fan.

[01:01:12] It has Sir Dinnimus, which is the little dude on the horse.

[01:01:15] Sir Dinnimus, okay.

[01:01:17] I think that was his name, yes, Sir Dinnimus.

[01:01:21] The wise man who's like this creepy like weird like guy.

[01:01:27] It's just, ah man.

[01:01:30] And if you, so good.

[01:01:31] And if you look at the play field in the back panel, we see an LCD display.

[01:01:37] So we alluded to this earlier that that is one of the, the pick offs from, from deeper.

[01:01:44] And what happened was they had an opportunity to buy all these LCD screens.

[01:01:48] So they just bought them cheap.

[01:01:49] And we should say they are different.

[01:01:51] They're longer and thinner. And that's what Deeproot was going to use in their games.

[01:01:54] So they found that they would be perfect for the back panel.

[01:01:58] So they stick it in the back panel.

[01:02:00] And then under various scenes, it'll change.

[01:02:03] It'll show some detailed information in the background.

[01:02:06] But there's like one of the most famous scenes in the film is when they're in this head row.

[01:02:11] And in the head row, there's these goblins that are trying to chase them down.

[01:02:15] They have these like little sticks with, ah, like a nipper on the end.

[01:02:20] And it bites people.

[01:02:22] It's sort of like instead of having a sword or a spear, they've got a stick with a nipper on the end.

[01:02:26] And you can just see these nippers kind of bouncing above the head rows because the actual goblins are super short.

[01:02:34] And it's hilarious.

[01:02:36] And you can actually get this nipper shooter rod, which is really cool.

[01:02:40] It's just that they knew what they had to do and they hammered it right out of here.

[01:02:45] It's so good. So beyond that though, we've got three flippers, two major ramps, we've got spinners,

[01:02:52] we've, you got everything. Everything you need, got drop targets.

[01:02:55] They nailed what they needed to nail when it came to the look and feel.

[01:02:59] So hats off to them for knowing that.

[01:03:01] They actually delivered one of these games to Henson Studios in Los Angeles, which is kind of neat.

[01:03:07] And then there was the topper.

[01:03:09] So toppers have gotten pretty wild here in the last little while.

[01:03:12] Right? So the first, like I think crazy kind of cool topper after that valley will, like toppers disappeared,

[01:03:19] but valley Williams disappeared.

[01:03:21] Cool, cool toppers.

[01:03:23] Yeah.

[01:03:24] Technically stern had the one that's a tournament pinball on it.

[01:03:26] Yeah, that's not that doesn't even know it's literally a topper that doesn't count.

[01:03:30] Yeah, okay. It doesn't count.

[01:03:32] Just because it sits on the top of the machine, where a topper does not make it a topper.

[01:03:37] Yeah, I think the first major milestone in the new age of toppers was the Ghostbusters topper,

[01:03:44] which was just this cheap kind of crappy plastic thing that went on top of it.

[01:03:48] It looked like the lights from the Ghostbusters car, Ecto 1 or whatever.

[01:03:53] Then the next I think major topper milestone was probably what, like black night.

[01:03:59] Black night was good.

[01:04:00] Or it's this animatronic black night that moves left and right and up and down.

[01:04:03] Some Chicago gaming had all their cool toppers, attack from bars and monster bash and all that.

[01:04:10] Hey guys, as a quick heads up, I wanted to let you know that in my real life, I'm David the advice guy.

[01:04:16] At Dennis Financial, we aren't investment advisors or insurance agents.

[01:04:20] I always thought that sounded terrible.

[01:04:22] We want to provide you with sound financial advice.

[01:04:25] In fact, we want to provide you with investment and insurance advice for light.

[01:04:30] And we take that honor very seriously.

[01:04:32] Do you know individuals who received financial advice for 10 years have two times the financial assets of unadvised individuals?

[01:04:39] For example, we've got mortgage insurance at the bank, right?

[01:04:42] What's you know, a 40-year-old non-smoker can save $30 a month every month for 20 years just from shopping around for a more competitive rate.

[01:04:53] Now just imagine what a pinhead like you could do with that extra money.

[01:04:56] Toppers and shooter rods anyone?

[01:04:59] If you're looking for a more human dimension to your financial advice, Dennis Financial Inc. has you covered with advisors licensing-based Canadian provinces.

[01:05:23] Now the next biggest, I would say, escalation in the top of wars is definitely this Jim Henson's labyrinth topper.

[01:05:32] This is the three goblin interactive topper.

[01:05:35] You can see this on YouTube and it is worth it to take a look.

[01:05:39] So not only is it like a pieces of plastic stuck together and animatronics and lights in eyes,

[01:05:46] this is like full rubbery kind of faces that move and almost like move their jaws and stuff.

[01:05:54] It is like something that you would see.

[01:05:57] Let's call it animatronic, right?

[01:05:59] Like it is like almost Disney-esque.

[01:06:01] Now are these characters from the movie like do they have names?

[01:06:05] These characters are from the movie.

[01:06:07] Their name escapes me at the moment.

[01:06:09] But they are specific characters.

[01:06:12] They are modeled after those specific characters.

[01:06:15] And this was done by an individual whose name escapes me who I should have looked up but I am not going to because we are already recording and I am lazy.

[01:06:22] And he worked for Peter Jackson's production company or it does work for Peter Jackson's production company called WetaFX.

[01:06:31] And that is part of I think wingnut films or something.

[01:06:35] And he is a friend of David Van S, likely from the Australian film school days.

[01:06:42] And he is a sculptor.

[01:06:44] He loves Labrith.

[01:06:45] And as soon as he heard about Labrith, he was like, oh yeah, let me do a sculpt for you.

[01:06:51] And he came up with this topper and it is unbelievable.

[01:06:55] What do you think?

[01:06:56] I think I just played a Labrith last weekend.

[01:06:58] Yeah, and didn't have a creepy topper.

[01:07:00] Yes, yes it had the topper.

[01:07:02] And they like harass you, right?

[01:07:04] They do talk a lot, yes.

[01:07:06] Yeah, and then their eyes glow like red.

[01:07:09] Very creepy, keeps you up at night, I'm sure.

[01:07:11] Then it's got the shooter rod that's like enormous.

[01:07:14] The end of it, the nipper shooter rod.

[01:07:16] Yeah, I'm not a fan of shooting.

[01:07:18] Yeah, I like just the regular shooter.

[01:07:20] If you have to hit a skillshot or something having this huge thing at the end of it.

[01:07:24] See, the thing is with me, it's not, it has nothing to do with skillshot or whatever.

[01:07:28] It has everything to do with the weight.

[01:07:29] I just grab it.

[01:07:30] I don't like it being this big chunking.

[01:07:32] I just like the regular stern style, kind of just, boom.

[01:07:35] Well, it's that stern, you mean regular plunger style.

[01:07:37] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:07:38] That's better since like the 30s or 40s.

[01:07:41] You can also buy an alternate back glass, which is like the mirrored glass.

[01:07:45] Yes, back glass.

[01:07:46] Basically, if you don't want big David Bowie head, they have the other back glass that doesn't have David Bowie on it.

[01:07:53] Personally, the David Bowie's words that might be.

[01:07:56] Yeah, I've seen, I thought more people would be into the alternate back glass than.

[01:08:00] Nope, but most people seem to want Mr. Bowie out there.

[01:08:03] That's because it's, it screams hilarious 80s.

[01:08:06] The puffy teased hair, the David Bowie makeup, it's just, it's so iconic.

[01:08:13] Did you know they're going to make a new labyrinth film?

[01:08:16] Oh God, no.

[01:08:17] Yeah?

[01:08:18] I can't think of anything original.

[01:08:20] Because nobody has any original.

[01:08:23] Nobody has any talent.

[01:08:24] Hollywood has been done again.

[01:08:25] Oh God.

[01:08:26] Yeah.

[01:08:27] Whatever.

[01:08:28] Don't get me going on that stuff.

[01:08:29] So they actually started shipping those toppers in January of 2024.

[01:08:34] You know, pretty close to production.

[01:08:36] Stern can't seem to get their accessories out within a 12 month period, which is pretty wild.

[01:08:41] Do we go into the big debut?

[01:08:43] I mean, they debuted at the 2023 Texas Spinball Festival.

[01:08:47] I think I had to talk a little about that.

[01:08:49] They had, I don't know, a 10 of them there.

[01:08:51] They had other ones available for sale.

[01:08:55] They had a huge line, a cool display.

[01:08:59] It was one of the more impressive debuts I've seen.

[01:09:03] And they actually worked like I've seen impressive debuts before.

[01:09:07] But you know, I remember the alien debut and it kept breaking.

[01:09:11] I remember Big Lebowski and the thing broke while I was playing it kept breaking.

[01:09:18] These were pretty, they worked pretty well the whole show.

[01:09:23] I didn't see play fields up in the service position at any point, which is pretty great.

[01:09:27] And then people left the show with something they bought, which to my understanding are still working.

[01:09:31] Yeah. And other people were like, yeah, I'm putting my order in.

[01:09:34] That's where if you're a distributor, you were hoping that you, uh, you're a distributor for barrels of fun.

[01:09:39] They also, we got to talk about the name.

[01:09:42] This is the first time we find out what the name is of this company too.

[01:09:45] Yeah, because they just boom. They just appeared.

[01:09:47] Yeah. And now it's just barrels of fun.

[01:09:49] What was your reaction to the name?

[01:09:51] Uh, I thought it was fine.

[01:09:54] I thought it was fine.

[01:09:55] I'm not a fan.

[01:09:56] No.

[01:09:57] It's like, uh, it's got to have a better name than that.

[01:10:00] No, I thought it was fine.

[01:10:02] It doesn't really say what, there's no pinball in the title.

[01:10:05] But I guess the idea is and that's the other thing.

[01:10:08] It's supposedly they're going to make more than just pinball.

[01:10:10] Yeah, it's just, it's going to be manufactured collectively.

[01:10:13] Yes. So I guess from that perspective, okay, you don't put pinball in the title, but I don't know.

[01:10:18] It's just, it's never crazy about the name.

[01:10:20] It's not, it's not, um, it's not as good as ramps.

[01:10:23] Oh, God.

[01:10:25] Ramp, ramps pinball manufacturing that new name that was just announced.

[01:10:29] Like, I mean, it's not that good, but I mean, it's, it's cool.

[01:10:32] Uh, you know, it's fine. It's a bit different.

[01:10:34] We'll see it. We'll see where it goes.

[01:10:36] Let's talk about some of the milestones.

[01:10:37] So it blew up, right?

[01:10:39] Oh, yeah.

[01:10:40] Like it won the Twippy Award in 2023 for top-er, Toys and Mechs.

[01:10:45] It won a People's Choice Award at Modern Pinball,

[01:10:48] at the, uh, for Modern Pinball at MGC, which is the mid one gaming classic for those who don't know what that means.

[01:10:54] Yes.

[01:10:55] Yes. It won Best in Show at the Modern Pinball, uh, for Modern Pinball at the Brisbane Masters in Australia in 2024.

[01:11:03] It said Brisbane, right? Very good.

[01:11:05] Yeah.

[01:11:06] It became the main sponsor for the return of Pinburg.

[01:11:09] Yes.

[01:11:10] In July of 2024.

[01:11:11] It did not last the whole tournament though.

[01:11:13] No, I have to be, I have to be truthful.

[01:11:16] It didn't last.

[01:11:17] It was, it was, it was kicked around a lot.

[01:11:19] It was, it was played a lot, but yeah, it didn't last to the end of the tournament.

[01:11:22] They did, it's not all rainbows and unicorns though.

[01:11:24] They, they, they did struggle a bit.

[01:11:26] You gotta have growing pains as you scale up, because you know, most of the, I think they spoke about set, you know, 750 was like the number they were going for.

[01:11:33] But I think they were actually like limited to like 1100 units worldwide.

[01:11:36] They've kind of blown through that number.

[01:11:38] It's, they've, they've really pushed a lot of units out and haven't had a lot of, like there's no...

[01:11:43] Like there's no angry...

[01:11:45] No.

[01:11:46] I haven't seen too many angry Pinsiders complaining about a zillion broken servos or stuff not working under game.

[01:11:52] Yeah, or they call up for support.

[01:11:54] There's nobody there.

[01:11:55] They had, they didn't renew the contract of all their employees and now they're just going to start again, again.

[01:12:00] Well, David Van S says,

[01:12:02] growing the company from a small team to over 25 employees has been a huge learning curve for me.

[01:12:07] Adjusting our production goals to meet the overwhelming demand has been both exciting and challenging, impacting logistics, HR, quality control and development.

[01:12:16] Managing rapid growth and navigating supply chain issues has been a head spinner.

[01:12:21] But the support of our team, distributors, customers, fans and family keeps me focused.

[01:12:26] I'm determined not to let them down.

[01:12:28] These hurdles have taught us invaluable lessons and strengthen our foundation for the future.

[01:12:33] Right, it's like a duck on the water.

[01:12:36] Okay, the duck is just kind of cruising.

[01:12:38] You just see it, you're like, oh, look at the ducks. They're so cute.

[01:12:41] But then under the water, it's like these legs are going like a million miles an hour.

[01:12:44] I wonder where you were going there with that. I've never heard the duck analogy.

[01:12:47] You've never heard the duck.

[01:12:48] So we talk about the duck all the time.

[01:12:50] Duck in Canada is the whole thing.

[01:12:52] It's all about the duck, duck in the beast.

[01:12:54] Is that your like national animal?

[01:12:55] No, it's the, our national animals, the beaver.

[01:12:58] Cool.

[01:12:59] Yeah.

[01:13:00] You can also make a lot of jokes.

[01:13:01] Yes, we could, but not on this war eyebrow.

[01:13:03] We're not like the slam tilt podcast or other pumpkins.

[01:13:07] That's what's happening, right?

[01:13:08] Is they're talking about all these challenges and issues they have scaling up.

[01:13:11] But I mean, I'm completely unaware of these issues.

[01:13:13] You know what I mean?

[01:13:15] Like underneath the surface, all this stuff is going on crazy.

[01:13:18] Like the ducks like.

[01:13:19] I think they're most...

[01:13:20] Positiveness, they probably did not expect the amount of demand that came.

[01:13:24] I think you're probably right.

[01:13:26] Especially after things like deep root happened, you know, people might be a little...

[01:13:30] So our new companies and just going all in, but that was not the case at all.

[01:13:35] I think the pinball audience has shown like they have no memory.

[01:13:38] Yeah.

[01:13:39] And if you put a good product out there, it's just, they're gonna go for it.

[01:13:43] Especially if it's not like all the money's up front or something.

[01:13:46] Like I can just pay and get my game.

[01:13:48] Like it'll, it's actually ready.

[01:13:50] Yeah, no down payment.

[01:13:51] Wow, that'll be great.

[01:13:52] No kick starters.

[01:13:53] That's the way you don't have to wait 12 months or two years.

[01:13:56] Although Spooky has been able to make the deposit system work.

[01:13:59] But here's the thing, okay.

[01:14:00] As you're scaling up, a lot of stress, a lot of worry, a lot of back and forth.

[01:14:04] Well, how do the team members of David Van S and Brian Savage work together?

[01:14:08] Well David says, we are the epitome of Ying and Ying.

[01:14:11] Our strong personalities challenge each other to improve and to double check ourselves.

[01:14:15] There are so many moving parts in this business.

[01:14:17] It's not about I, it's a Wii company.

[01:14:20] His experience in guidance has been instrumental in our success.

[01:14:23] And I value his contributions deeply.

[01:14:26] Oh.

[01:14:27] What does Brian say?

[01:14:28] Brian says, our partnership has been fantastic as we work extremely well together.

[01:14:33] David is focused on building machines and I'm focused on building the back end of the business.

[01:14:39] Each is totally, each is a totally different task.

[01:14:42] Since I work remotely, David is the one who has to manage all the people and the day-to-day business.

[01:14:48] His inside the industry contacts are stellar as is his reputation in the industry.

[01:14:54] I dare say neither of us could have done it without each other.

[01:14:57] So we can see there's a separation of powers here.

[01:15:00] Well, it's very, yeah.

[01:15:02] David is the creative force behind the games and Brian is like the money man with the facilities and all that.

[01:15:10] Right. He's the George Gomez. He's running the studio.

[01:15:13] He's dealing with all that stuff. I'm sure.

[01:15:15] Brian is the Gary Stern.

[01:15:16] Probably a little taller, a lot less glasses.

[01:15:19] More hair.

[01:15:20] Does, does Labruth pass the Ron Hallett test?

[01:15:23] As a game I would buy it. As a theme I would not buy it because I just never seen Labruth.

[01:15:28] You should watch it. You would enjoy it, I think.

[01:15:31] Labruth is the kind of 80s movie that I think you would enjoy.

[01:15:34] But just knowing the kind of licensing or the licensing success David Van Esses had, I am very curious to see what the next game is going to be.

[01:15:44] I mean, you figure if he has any kind of relationship with Hanson, like what else could you do?

[01:15:50] You could do a dark crystal. I don't know how that would sell. But you could just make a plain muppets.

[01:15:55] Oh my god, if there was a muppets.

[01:15:57] Everyone wants, that's the one I hear all the time. Everyone wants just a regular muppets pin.

[01:16:01] Yeah, man. If there was a muppets pin, that would be a hard thing for me to like pass up.

[01:16:08] And the whole trade war conversation between Canada and the US at the moment, which we have not touched on, buying US products from US companies is very faux-pots.

[01:16:19] But I'll tell you what, man, a muppets pin from like a barrels of fun.

[01:16:25] With a stadler, warthol... How do you say it? Stadler and it's up to the hotel.

[01:16:30] Waldoarth.

[01:16:31] Waldoarth, topper.

[01:16:32] Ooh, and I'm a trotnik and they both insult you.

[01:16:34] Oh, man. Could you imagine?

[01:16:36] Hey, what happened to the ball? It disappeared.

[01:16:38] Ha-ha-ha!

[01:16:39] All the pig jokes.

[01:16:41] Pigs in space.

[01:16:43] Oh my god.

[01:16:44] Bloody birdie, put the bird in the bird.

[01:16:46] I want one now. Make it happen.

[01:16:49] Pairals of fun. I can't imagine a muppets machine.

[01:16:52] Dune, people have mentioned...

[01:16:54] Dune was another one.

[01:16:56] Dune would be pretty cool. That's kind of fun.

[01:16:58] I don't know. Like if it's the new, new dune or the old dune, which is also itself kind of hilarious.

[01:17:02] I think... Oh god.

[01:17:04] If it's the old dune, is it gonna have like, sting on there with like no clothes on?

[01:17:08] Saying, I will kill you!

[01:17:11] Sting with a bulge. Also a big DS.

[01:17:14] You know, there's been rumors of...

[01:17:16] Fifth element was a rumor for a while.

[01:17:19] Yes.

[01:17:20] Which is a good one. I love Fifth element. That's a nostalgia.

[01:17:22] If they follow their pattern, it's gonna have to be something that can really be the world under glass.

[01:17:28] It's gonna have to be something...

[01:17:29] Leave, multifas.

[01:17:30] Like in its own world.

[01:17:32] I'm excited to see what's going on with barrels of fun, which is why I think we jumped into this episode.

[01:17:37] Because I'm impressed with what it's...

[01:17:39] And I would think it has to be announced this year.

[01:17:41] Yeah, surely.

[01:17:42] It's like we were a month and a half away from Texas.

[01:17:46] You know, they built their 750 labyrinths.

[01:17:48] It's been two years.

[01:17:50] In addition to that, actually.

[01:17:52] So when I was doing the research of this episode,

[01:17:55] sort of December, January, early January of 24-25,

[01:18:02] the barrels of fun website was down for a while.

[01:18:06] And they were doing some changes in modification to their website.

[01:18:10] So I don't know if that's like hiding stuff in the background.

[01:18:14] Yeah, the gun suppliers are already ready.

[01:18:16] See if you can hack the site and get it all you've got.

[01:18:18] Right.

[01:18:19] I don't know if that's like setting up a new e-commerce website component.

[01:18:24] I'm only kidding, barrels of fun. Don't do that.

[01:18:26] Don't be like Stern, where there's just a link in you.

[01:18:28] You find it and like, oh, look at that.

[01:18:30] A flyer or something.

[01:18:31] Or, hey, a video.

[01:18:33] Hey, there's the trailer.

[01:18:34] Yeah, exactly.

[01:18:36] Don't do that.

[01:18:38] What was that?

[01:18:39] Was that a JJP error a few years ago?

[01:18:41] They've all done it.

[01:18:42] They've all done it where they have the link.

[01:18:44] It's like, it's unlisted, but it's not private.

[01:18:47] So if you just stumble on it or it can find it, boom, there it is.

[01:18:52] And there's plenty of nerds and pinball if you haven't noticed.

[01:18:55] Jump on the barrels of fun Facebook page.

[01:18:58] I got some milestone information just to wrap it up here.

[01:19:01] They shipped their first 100 labyrinths by February 21st.

[01:19:05] Then they were at 270 on June 14th.

[01:19:08] 400 by August 16th, so 2024.

[01:19:12] And 500 as of September 24th, 2024.

[01:19:16] And then 559 games on their first anniversary of October 13th, 2024.

[01:19:22] I guess they consider that their first anniversary.

[01:19:25] They started full production, I assume.

[01:19:27] Yeah.

[01:19:28] And as of December 16th, 2024, they have built over 750 labyrinths.

[01:19:34] And made even more in the last weeks of the year.

[01:19:37] Yeah.

[01:19:38] And now we're in February.

[01:19:39] So they got to be.

[01:19:40] They got to be.

[01:19:41] What is, let's see, what is David Van Essay about?

[01:19:44] What's next?

[01:19:45] He says, and what's next?

[01:19:47] We are currently planning three to five years ahead in facilities

[01:19:50] intellectual property with a vision that extends into the next decade.

[01:19:55] The planning process is dynamic, and it hopefully allows us to remain agile

[01:20:00] in the short term while staying aligned with our long term goals.

[01:20:03] Wow.

[01:20:04] A lot of very business he speak there.

[01:20:06] Yeah.

[01:20:07] Yes.

[01:20:08] Yes.

[01:20:09] And he has the process in there.

[01:20:10] Gotta hate that.

[01:20:11] Yes.

[01:20:12] Synergy.

[01:20:13] We have dynamics.

[01:20:14] The planning process.

[01:20:15] You mean planning.

[01:20:16] Planning.

[01:20:17] Yeah.

[01:20:18] You're just planning.

[01:20:19] Yeah.

[01:20:20] Exactly.

[01:20:21] We're going to onboard all of these IP.

[01:20:23] I think you have to talk this way now.

[01:20:25] It's some kind of law.

[01:20:26] Otherwise, you don't seem like you're professional enough or know what you're doing.

[01:20:30] Exactly.

[01:20:31] Now here's the thing.

[01:20:32] One of the most important things about this is that you're planning 10 years out.

[01:20:37] You plan 10 years out and then of course 10 years out is like a crap shoot.

[01:20:41] Lots can change in a year if you can see it.

[01:20:44] So you got your three to five year plans, you got your 10 year vision, and you just sort of

[01:20:48] navigate the waters of which you go out of there.

[01:20:52] The other thing is if the US starts a trade war with the rest of the world.

[01:20:56] That's going to cause a lot of issues when it comes to importing parts from other countries.

[01:21:02] So if they're in a place like Texas where they can maybe manufacture more of those parts with the expertise they have,

[01:21:07] hopefully that'll keep their prices down.

[01:21:09] Because if they're fighting off tariffs, that's going to be a problem for the pinball manufacturing industry.

[01:21:12] You'll literally be able to tell which pinball manufacturers import more stuff.

[01:21:16] Yeah.

[01:21:17] Because I know companies like Spooky likes to make as much of their own stuff as possible.

[01:21:22] They could be in a better position.

[01:21:24] Like, hey, our prices haven't changed.

[01:21:26] Yeah.

[01:21:27] Do they want to take down Stern?

[01:21:29] Is this what they're doing?

[01:21:30] No, because Brian Savage says, we don't want to be the biggest.

[01:21:34] We just want to do the best job that can be done for our customers.

[01:21:37] That means selling 500 or a thousand machines.

[01:21:40] But then being like collector, collector-ish items, that's a big deal.

[01:21:44] That's what they're focusing on.

[01:21:45] Which is pretty much the Spooky model.

[01:21:47] Yeah, which is why Spooky has been successful, I think.

[01:21:49] And they have several other employees from Spooky that are there.

[01:21:52] A prep key.

[01:21:54] Well, a prep key has been, he's done games for different companies.

[01:21:58] I'm trying to think which one he did.

[01:22:01] I think he did the original cactus canyon container,

[01:22:03] whatever it was called back in the day.

[01:22:06] So, barrels of fun.

[01:22:07] I am looking forward to whatever their next game is.

[01:22:10] Please be modest.

[01:22:11] That would be great.

[01:22:25] Hey, that's great.

[01:23:25] And when we were recording that and Ron did, when she did that again, when we were, uh,

[01:23:52] then the typical LCD screen, they're longer and thinner.

[01:23:59] That's what she said.

[01:24:01] That had it.

[01:24:04] I don't know.

[01:24:06] When they just did a Muppet theme, maybe they want to kind of space that out and have a non-muppet theme.

[01:24:13] And then go back to a Muppet theme.

[01:24:15] Um, Tommy Douglas.

[01:24:17] Tommy Douglas.

[01:24:19] Former member.

[01:24:22] Oh God, 1904.

[01:24:24] User-ratherly from England.

[01:24:28] Scottish-born Canadian politician.

[01:24:31] Uh, let's see.

[01:24:33] Uh, okay, here we go.

[01:24:34] In 1930 Douglas married Irma Dempsey and music student.

[01:24:38] They had one daughter, actress Shirley Douglas.

[01:24:41] His daughter Shirley married actor Donald Sutherland.

[01:24:46] Together they had a son named Keifer Sutherland.
