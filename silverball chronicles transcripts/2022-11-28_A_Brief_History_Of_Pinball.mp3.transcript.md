[00:35] The Pinball Network is online.

[00:37] Launching.

[00:38] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:46] Cut my banana.

[00:47] Mmm, mmm, mmm.

[00:48] Mmm, mmm.

[00:50] See the key to the banana is to eat it all in one bite.

[00:54] Mmm, mmm.

[00:56] No!

[01:26] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[01:32] With me this month is Ron Master of the Sanctum Hallet.

[01:37] What's up, fella?

[01:38] Hello.

[01:39] Hello.

[01:40] How was your trip to the Sanctum?

[01:43] Does anyone know what the Sanctum is?

[01:45] It's a place in Connecticut.

[01:47] That's a lot of games in it.

[01:48] And I have a 24 hour tournament that I played in.

[01:51] You played 24 hours.

[01:52] Your legs must be so sore.

[01:56] No, I sat a lot.

[01:57] And there was 100 different players.

[02:00] 100 different players.

[02:01] 24 hours.

[02:03] Yeah.

[02:03] And you finished top 10?

[02:07] No, 31st.

[02:08] 31st?

[02:09] That's still pretty good.

[02:10] I'll take it.

[02:11] And it's still pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.

[02:15] Pretty good.

[02:16] And on your other podcast, the slam tilt podcast

[02:19] with Bruce Knight and Gail.

[02:20] Where did Bruce Knight and Gail finish?

[02:22] I don't know.

[02:24] I'd have to look that up.

[02:26] I'm sure he'll say where he finished in our next episode.

[02:30] Okay, well, you can check that out.

[02:31] Mm-hmm.

[02:32] In your pod catcher.

[02:34] Because we gotta mention that.

[02:36] We gotta mention that as part of my contract.

[02:37] It is indeed.

[02:38] That is indeed.

[02:39] And Bruce yells at me if it doesn't get mentioned.

[02:40] On our last podcast, it was just about pinball expo time.

[02:45] How's that long ago?

[02:46] Yes, it was.

[02:47] It wasn't like the week before.

[02:49] Are we released like when everybody was traveling to Chicago

[02:52] to give them something to listen to?

[02:54] Ah, smart.

[02:55] Yes.

[02:57] So they all thoroughly enjoyed that.

[02:59] And you had a good time.

[03:01] Yeah, it was good.

[03:02] You played James Bond?

[03:03] I did.

[03:04] I played your dream theme game.

[03:06] What do you think?

[03:07] I think it's way too early to say anything about it.

[03:10] Okay, but the shots, it's past the first tier.

[03:13] It shoots fine.

[03:15] Fine.

[03:16] There was nothing like, oh my god, what were they thinking?

[03:19] This is horrible.

[03:20] There was nothing like that in the game.

[03:21] So it just have to see how it develops from here.

[03:25] Great.

[03:26] Good to hear.

[03:27] Good to hear.

[03:28] I'm very excited.

[03:29] I haven't heard almost anything from my distributor.

[03:31] Mr. Dennis here, if you don't know, if you're a new listener,

[03:35] Bond is like his super dream theme, although they did the correct bond,

[03:40] but which would be the incorrect bond in your VA.

[03:42] Your view, yes.

[03:43] Oh, man, they're all great.

[03:44] Oh, they're all great.

[03:45] Every one of them?

[03:46] They're every single one of them.

[03:48] Every single one of them is great.

[03:50] Exactly.

[03:51] Even Roger Moore.

[03:53] Even George Lassenby?

[03:54] George Lassenby was awesome.

[03:56] Not so much nowadays, but he was awesome back then.

[03:59] He's Australian, you know.

[04:00] Roger Moore was like the first actual Englishman to play James Bond.

[04:03] When you think of that, he had a Scottish guy and Australian guy and finally an English guy.

[04:08] Good for him.

[04:09] Good for him.

[04:10] Comedy Bond.

[04:11] Nothing wrong with a little comedy bond.

[04:12] I've been spending a little bit of time just sort of watching what's going on in that

[04:15] James Bond hype thread on Pinside.

[04:17] And the amount of people that say like Roger Moore is their all time favorite James Bond.

[04:21] I had no idea he had such a following.

[04:23] I like the car he had with the anti theft device.

[04:27] You break the window, it explodes.

[04:29] Snip it much.

[04:30] Good stuff.

[04:31] Well, last month we mentioned that we had sold out Rod, we had joined Patreon.

[04:36] And since then, we've actually had quite a few people join us on Patreon.

[04:41] Dennis K. Jonathan K. Rodney C. Robert G. Sully D. Dan L.

[04:49] Some fella named Trampansky.

[04:52] Scott E. David S. J. Sonic the Kid.

[04:56] Tony V. Adam D. Garrison T. N. Brian D.

[05:01] Thank you all for joining us on Patreon.

[05:03] As mentioned last month, you get early ad free access to the podcast in the Patreon

[05:11] app and in your pod catcher of choice.

[05:13] So everybody got to listen to our last episode on George Gomez about a week and a half, almost

[05:19] two weeks early compared to the free feeds.

[05:22] Are they like platinum cronies?

[05:24] So like, plonies?

[05:26] Yeah, we're not going to go with plonies.

[05:28] But the pro cronies, $3 a month, you just basically want to say thank you with no big

[05:33] commitment.

[05:35] Patreon takes a cut of that and then we get, I don't know, like two bucks.

[05:39] But thank you so much if you if you wanted to do that.

[05:42] What do they get at $6 a month, Ron?

[05:44] That's the big tier.

[05:46] They get a free sticker after three months.

[05:48] Access to our private discord chat room.

[05:51] We have one of those?

[05:52] Yes.

[05:53] The discord chat room.

[05:54] That's where I post in speculation corner, the second best rumor corner in pinball.

[06:01] Anything that I hear rumblings about rumors or speculation goes into speculation corner.

[06:08] Well, for $6 a month, you also have your questions take priority on the podcast.

[06:13] You can also vote on upcoming topics and early ad free access to silver ball chronicles

[06:19] before it's posted to the general feeds.

[06:22] Yes.

[06:23] $6 a month is where you get that ad free access.

[06:25] The top tier, the elitist crony.

[06:28] That's the top level perk you get all of the perks from the $6 a month.

[06:34] And you also get a free silver ball chronicles t-shirt after three months.

[06:40] I have been in contact with a pinball artist who's going to hopefully do a shirt for us.

[06:50] We may not get it in time for the first three months, but we're going to get it out

[06:54] there for you.

[06:55] We do have some elitist cronies in our Patreon.

[07:01] Thank you.

[07:02] Thank you so much for those individuals.

[07:04] I had no idea anybody would actually join us at $20 a month.

[07:08] Thank you so much for that.

[07:10] Thank you.

[07:11] Yeah.

[07:12] If you want to chat with us outside of the Patreon or outside of the discord, you can

[07:16] make a posting on our Facebook page.

[07:18] We're fully active there.

[07:20] And remember to leave us a five star review wherever you found us in your pod catcher on

[07:24] the Patreon app or in the this week and pinball promoter database.

[07:29] That way more people can find us and we can enlighten the unwashed masses.

[07:35] If you wanted to just say thank you, you can also just pick up a t-shirt over at silverballswag.com.

[07:42] And even though we don't get the names of the individuals who purchased shirts, we just

[07:46] get an order number where the shirt went.

[07:48] We want to say thank you to the individual in Jackson Heights, the individual in Sacramento,

[07:54] and the person in Vienna all the way over there in Italy.

[07:59] Really?

[08:00] No, it's Virginia.

[08:01] Oh.

[08:02] It's Vienna, Virginia.

[08:03] I would have been cool.

[08:04] That would have been cool.

[08:05] But thank you so much to a few of the individuals that also sent us some emails, Tanner.

[08:13] He sent us an email to silverballcronicles at gmail.com.

[08:18] And he wanted to ask about doing an EM episode specifically and Ron, we get a lot of emails

[08:24] asking for an EM episode.

[08:26] I guess we'll have to do that for them, right?

[08:28] I mean, they're the only affordable games left in existence at this point.

[08:32] Yeah.

[08:33] And even at that point, they're still ridiculously over-priced.

[08:37] But you can check out Tanner over on thepinballscientist.com.

[08:42] He is a bit of a genius when it comes to EM score keepers.

[08:48] So it's actually a micro LED display that you can stick on the apron of your EM machine

[08:56] and it keeps track of all that cool stuff.

[08:58] You can actually use the flipper buttons to enter your high score.

[09:03] So go ahead and check that out.

[09:05] That's some pretty cool tech, especially on an EM.

[09:09] And he's as good with names as we are.

[09:11] Mm-hmm.

[09:12] Because I'm Rob.

[09:13] I didn't know I was Rob.

[09:15] Hi Rob and Davis.

[09:16] That is.

[09:17] So you can call me Rob for the rest of the podcast now.

[09:22] There you go.

[09:24] We also have a couple of new comments over on the Twit Promoters database.

[09:28] Check these out Ron.

[09:29] Oh, you're going to give me this one.

[09:30] I'm going to give you this name.

[09:32] Um, let's K.

[09:34] Oh yeah.

[09:35] Cohen, Lowart.

[09:37] Lowart.

[09:38] It's got a W.

[09:39] Okay.

[09:40] Lowart.

[09:41] Lowart.

[09:42] Lowart.

[09:43] Yeah.

[09:44] It's like a, I'm assuming you're from Europe Cohen.

[09:46] Um, good old K L.

[09:47] I'll call it.

[09:48] Good old K L.

[09:49] Oh my god.

[09:50] And the Twit Promoters database says, because I'm quite new in this fascinating hobby.

[09:55] Fell in love with pinball in the first part of the Corona pandemic.

[09:59] I have much to learn about the history and the important people who made pinball to

[10:03] what it is today.

[10:04] Ron and Dave, love your podcast.

[10:06] Thank you for all your time and effort.

[10:08] Thank you so much.

[10:09] We've also got Mr.

[10:11] I'm sorry, sir machismo over on Pinside that says I like their podcast so much.

[10:18] I actually bought one of their t-shirts size large, not a bad shirt, true fit and very

[10:25] soft.

[10:26] Ooh, there you go.

[10:29] Everybody's favorite critic, POMC over on Pinside.

[10:34] Yeah, he says heads up 10 minutes to skip at the beginning of silver balls.

[10:39] Seriously.

[10:40] Perfect.

[10:41] There you go.

[10:42] We've been at a time this right to make sure it's exactly 10 minutes of fluff at the beginning

[10:44] before we get to our subject.

[10:46] Exactly.

[10:47] Last episode we went long because we went with that Patreon BS for everybody.

[10:51] Oh.

[10:52] So let's get into the topic here.

[10:53] We've rambled on too much.

[10:55] We don't want to make POMC upset over on Pinside that he had to use the skip forward button

[11:02] on his app.

[11:03] Well, we had the other listener.

[11:05] I think they said if it was what any more than 45 minutes is just a no go for them.

[11:10] It's a no go for them.

[11:11] They made sure they let us know that.

[11:12] Yeah, check out pinball party.

[11:15] That guy's under under like an hour under 45.

[11:18] There you go.

[11:19] That is a killer podcast.

[11:20] It's just a little bite size, little nugget.

[11:22] Is that also on TPN?

[11:23] It is.

[11:24] You've listened to it.

[11:25] You've listened to it.

[11:26] I have listened to it.

[11:27] Very good show.

[11:28] I thoroughly enjoy it.

[11:29] It would be better if I had been on it, but it's how it goes sometimes.

[11:33] Almost as good as slam till podcast with Bruce Dink-Gale and Ron Hallett.

[11:38] This is a little bit of a different topic this month.

[11:40] Ron, with all of these requests for an EM episode or a deep ancient history of pinball,

[11:49] I decided to mix it up a little bit with what I call a brief history of pinball.

[11:57] This is a great place to begin when it comes to where pinball came from.

[12:02] We're going to wind the clock back away back with like, who was the dog and the kid?

[12:10] What was that?

[12:11] A Hannah Barbarra?

[12:12] Cartoon.

[12:13] Yeah.

[12:14] That was from, it's the same one that Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends.

[12:17] They were some of the friends.

[12:19] They were the friends.

[12:20] Yeah.

[12:21] It's like, did the kid have glasses on and the dog and they went to the time machine and

[12:24] all that.

[12:25] Boomers are shouting at the screen right now.

[12:27] You're idiots.

[12:28] How do you not know what they're saying?

[12:30] Mr. Peabody and Sherman.

[12:33] Sorry, anybody who just crashed their car.

[12:36] So we're going to jump in a time machine just like Mr. Peabody and Sherman.

[12:40] We're going to go all the way back to the beginning of where pinball came from and we've

[12:45] picked out some very specific bits and pieces of what makes pinball pinball today.

[12:54] What was the first machine it was on?

[12:56] Who was the inventor if we know that and any first-hand knowledge that we can get from

[13:02] those individuals?

[13:03] And why it's called pinball?

[13:05] Which could be kind of confusing.

[13:06] I mean, I don't see any pins.

[13:09] Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

[13:11] Any sense.

[13:12] This is outrageous.

[13:13] This episode really came from an article that a listener named Ben emailed into silverball

[13:20] chronicles at gmail.com called the history of pinball.

[13:22] I've included it in our show notes.

[13:24] And then when I took his, I took that, read the article and then I sort of said, okay,

[13:29] let's beef it up and expand it out.

[13:31] And then I did some searching and looking around.

[13:34] Very, very important, Ron.

[13:35] I didn't just look up the Wikipedia page like some people do when it comes to history.

[13:41] It's super easy to make a YouTube video with a bunch of flashy stuff or some sort of

[13:46] article by looking up the simple Wikipedia page and click it on some links and copy and

[13:52] paste.

[13:53] And so I actually did some, some particularly serious research this month.

[13:57] And I want to talk about Thoughtco who is the premier reference site with over 20 years

[14:03] focused on expert created education content.

[14:06] That's the original article that this was based on.

[14:09] They are proud to be one of the top 10 information sites as measured by commscore, who the heck

[14:15] that is, a leading internet measurement company.

[14:18] I thought you were just going to say you went to the library and everything.

[14:22] I used those, those micro films like a 1980s James Bond movie.

[14:28] Yep.

[14:29] In 2018, Thoughtco received a communicator award in general education category and a

[14:36] Davey award in the education category.

[14:39] So that's kind of where it all started.

[14:42] In the beginning, Ron, there were lawn games.

[14:45] Do you know what I mean by lawn games?

[14:48] I do.

[14:49] And I want to see if you can pronounce this one word.

[14:51] This one word.

[14:52] The one I'm looking at right now.

[14:54] Continue, continue.

[14:56] lawn games are games played outdoors with rolling balls or stones on grass courses such as

[15:04] bachi or balls that eventually evolved into various local ground billiard games played

[15:12] by hitting balls with sticks and propelling them through targets.

[15:17] This is often seen as a way to avoid obstacles and go around obstacles and through gates.

[15:23] A very popular and modern version of a lawn game would be croquet.

[15:30] That of course is an early variation on golf.

[15:34] Paul Mall eventually derived into ground billiards variance.

[15:40] You said bachi.

[15:42] I'm surprised.

[15:43] I am surprised.

[15:44] You got it right.

[15:45] As an Italian, I have to make sure that's set correctly.

[15:47] Yes.

[15:48] And a bachi and the balls.

[15:49] So like lawn bowling, right?

[15:51] That's like a lawn game.

[15:55] So fancy like rich folk back in the day in the 1700s, the 1600s, they would play lawn

[16:03] games.

[16:04] You'd come over.

[16:05] You'd be all dressed up.

[16:06] Your servants would come give you tea and you'd be playing croquet or you'd be playing

[16:11] lawn bowling or there would be lawn bowling clubs that you would have.

[16:16] And that was like the big thing.

[16:18] That is really where pinball originated from.

[16:23] Not only that, other modern games kind of were derived from these lawn games.

[16:29] Golf being probably one of the most obvious ones.

[16:33] The evolution of outdoor games finally led to indoor versions of that because Ron, it rains

[16:39] outside sometimes.

[16:40] Yeah, it does.

[16:41] Is it raining there right now?

[16:43] Not right now.

[16:44] It was yesterday.

[16:45] You got to play those indoor games on a table.

[16:48] It was on the floor of a pub and then quickly tabletop variations of these games became the

[16:54] ancestors of modern pinball.

[16:57] Some French soldiers actually carried some of their favorite tables with them to America

[17:04] while helping fight the British in the American Revolutionary War.

[17:10] So it's like it was like a big briefcase, right?

[17:12] You kind of folded it and you would carry this game, which is a variation on a lawn

[17:18] game.

[17:19] And that's how it was more or less imported from Europe in to North America and became

[17:24] so popular in America, even Abraham Lincoln was featured playing in a political cartoon.

[17:32] I did get that one from Wikipedia actually.

[17:34] Oh, after it developed into bar billiards with influences from the French and Belgium

[17:41] game, billionaire, russ or Russian billiards.

[17:45] So let's take a look here, Ron.

[17:47] What do you see?

[17:48] So I've got a picture of a billionaire russ.

[17:53] And what do you see here?

[17:55] When you first look at this, what do you see?

[17:56] I see a really long play field with a cue.

[17:59] It's like a pool table kind of.

[18:01] It's like a pool table, but the dimensions are more what I would say are like a play field.

[18:06] Yeah, like pinbally play field.

[18:08] Yeah, even the top has an arch.

[18:10] So it's pretty neat.

[18:11] It's got a set of balls on the left.

[18:13] It's got a like a ball, line or a foul line.

[18:16] It's got the billiard cue.

[18:17] And then there's like numbers on the other side that you would shoot the ball into.

[18:22] So you can see that we're kind of coming together here.

[18:25] It's not a pool table like really big, right?

[18:29] Like pool tables were fairly large, but this was kind of the beginning of that.

[18:33] In France, during the long 1643 to 1715 reign of Louis the 14th, billiard tables were

[18:42] narrowed with wooden pins or skittles.

[18:46] Really?

[18:47] Yes.

[18:48] With pins or skittles at one end of the table.

[18:52] The player would shoot the balls with a stick or a cue from the other end in a game which

[18:59] very much would inspire bowling billiards.

[19:04] So when we talk about the pins and the play field, so the most important thing of pinball,

[19:10] right?

[19:11] The creation of that.

[19:12] Well, the pins took too long to reset when knocked down.

[19:18] So you've got this play field basically.

[19:20] You kind of put the pins up these little bricks or whatever.

[19:25] You knock them down, you got to pick them up, you got to put them down.

[19:27] And then if you're drinking, you know, you're putting them up like dominoes and you knock

[19:31] it over.

[19:32] Terrible.

[19:33] Terrible.

[19:34] So they came up with the idea to eventually fix the pins in the table.

[19:40] The holes in the table became the target.

[19:44] Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve more challenging, scoreable holes.

[19:53] So now with fixed pins, you can do like bank shots.

[19:56] How does that sound?

[19:57] Sounds like pool.

[19:58] Sounds like pool.

[19:59] Bank shot.

[20:00] Well then there was this thing called bagotel.

[20:03] You're familiar with bagotel, everybody.

[20:05] This is where everybody's like, oh, I know bagotel, right?

[20:08] Well, do you really know bagotel or do you just kind of know the name and kind of the

[20:12] general understanding of it?

[20:15] What do you think, Ron?

[20:16] Well, I think bagotel is a billiard derived indoor table game.

[20:20] The object of which is to get a number of balls past wooden pins, which act as obstacles

[20:26] into holes that are guarded by wooden pegs.

[20:29] Penalties are incurred if the pegs are knocked over.

[20:32] There's your pins.

[20:33] So here we go.

[20:34] We're starting to see it come together, right?

[20:36] Well, the name bagotel was first used to describe the game in 1819.

[20:42] So when most people think of bagotel, Ron, they think of the variation using the metal

[20:49] pins.

[20:50] So when people say, oh, bagotel, they think of the square wooden machine with the arch at

[20:56] the top that has metal pins that look like nails.

[20:59] Now that's actually called billionaire japon, which is Japanese billiards.

[21:04] Even though it was invented in Western Europe and had nothing to do with the Japanese,

[21:08] this would eventually lead to the development of Pacinco and pinball.

[21:16] You're a big penchinco collector?

[21:19] Not at all.

[21:22] So what's Pacinco?

[21:25] What is Pacinco?

[21:26] Is that a game on the prices, right?

[21:29] So it's like the Japanese vertical pin dropping game that's kind of like the game on the

[21:35] prices, right?

[21:36] It's kind of like that.

[21:39] That's got a whole weird collector community.

[21:42] And I'm sure there's some listening to this podcast, but it gets weird, just like all

[21:46] sort of anime, Japanese culture things.

[21:49] It's a bit off the wall, but there are some pretty cool little bits and pieces with that.

[21:54] Well, who sort of gave birth to pinball as we know it?

[22:00] Montague Redgrave.

[22:02] Yes.

[22:03] Montague.

[22:04] That's a very fancy name.

[22:07] The father of our hobby.

[22:09] Exactly.

[22:10] He was born in a Lambeth Surrey, which is in England, and he emigrated to New Jersey,

[22:17] where he worked as a grocery manufacturer.

[22:20] Wow.

[22:21] New Jersey.

[22:22] Well, he was baseball invented there, but it said that it was invented to Cooper's town,

[22:26] which it wasn't.

[22:27] Now pinball.

[22:28] Yeah.

[22:29] Isn't it just New Jersey is the key here.

[22:31] So they got baseball.

[22:32] They got pinball.

[22:33] They got not showering.

[22:34] They got everything in New Jersey.

[22:36] Oh, yeah, he said that, not me.

[22:39] In 1871, Montague Patten, the first game that resembles modern pinball, calling it

[22:45] improvements in baguattels, where his design introduced the spring-loaded plunger for

[22:50] launching the pinball.

[22:52] There it was.

[22:53] That is the pinnacle improvement right there.

[22:56] A spring-loaded plunger.

[22:59] So no longer do you have to pick the ball up and put it behind the line and shoot it up

[23:03] with a cue.

[23:05] You take it.

[23:06] You put it in the shooter lane.

[23:07] You pull the little plunger and there goes the ball up to the top of the baguettelle.

[23:13] But as usual, there's some discussion whether he was actually the one to come up with this.

[23:17] But he's the one who patented it.

[23:19] So whoever patented it, patented it.

[23:22] Is the one who came up with it.

[23:24] Now the game also shrank in size to fit on a bar counter.

[23:30] The balls became marbles instead of billiard-sized balls.

[23:35] And the sticks became these metal pins.

[23:40] So the vision of baguettelle that most people have of the little plunger and the dark wood

[23:48] machine with the pins in the ground in the holes is Moniqueu Redgrave's variation on

[23:57] baguettelles.

[23:58] Redgrave popularized this new baguettelle design and he had the manufactured in Cincinnati,

[24:05] Ohio, the capital of pinball.

[24:08] So it's not in Jersey, Cincinnati, Ohio.

[24:10] Yes.

[24:12] He died in 1934 in Montclair, New Jersey.

[24:17] Or I guess it's American, so it's Montclair.

[24:20] Probably.

[24:21] Ugh.

[24:22] Now we're getting into some different stuff here.

[24:25] Now we're, now we're, the funnel is gone from very wide.

[24:29] It's now coming down into more what we know today of pinball.

[24:34] The first pinball games were one balls.

[24:39] In the 1930s, pin games gained attention when the coin up mechanic was invented.

[24:44] The original games used mechanics to change coins into ball play, which unlocked a whole

[24:49] world of possibilities.

[24:52] It's the coin door.

[24:53] Basically the coin door was created or the variation of what would be the coin door.

[24:58] The coin Mac.

[24:59] Yeah, you put your, you put your money in and it allocates the balls automatically.

[25:04] There's no more change in the things.

[25:06] You know, you got to give the guys some money and they've got the balls or he's got a

[25:09] watchis or you're not sneaking balls.

[25:12] Pinball's allowed for multiple coin play.

[25:15] It also meant that the player had one ball to achieve their goal and the object was to

[25:21] win more replays in return.

[25:26] Now there were two original models that were created of this first pin game with a coin

[25:32] Mac in it.

[25:34] The replay version, which contained a three digit replay counter and the payout version.

[25:42] Which paid the player in nickels directly upon winning.

[25:47] Hmm, and the whole payout thing will come to hurt pinball in the future.

[25:52] Yeah, that sounds like gambling.

[25:53] It does.

[25:54] You know, you've got lawn games and lawn games kind of split off into billiards and baguettele

[25:59] and pinball and then it kind of splits off into gambling devices and you know, what would

[26:04] eventually become video lottery terminals.

[26:07] You know what I mean?

[26:08] Again, that funnel was really wide.

[26:10] It's now come down and you can see that it's other things are spinning off of it over,

[26:17] you know, this this three, four hundred year period.

[26:19] Well, it was baffle ball that was a serious watershed moment.

[26:26] Baffle ball was invented in November 1931 by D. Gottlieb and company.

[26:32] It was designed by a gentleman named David Gottlieb.

[26:37] Of course, the artist is unknown.

[26:39] It sold 50,000 units.

[26:43] Yeah, people think like Adam's family with all their units was there's nothing compared

[26:48] to what these things sold.

[26:50] 50,000 units.

[26:51] It's like, that's like 80s, that's 80s arcade game sales.

[26:55] In 1931, David Gottlieb's baffle ball became the first hit of the coin operated era.

[27:04] It sold for $17.50.

[27:08] The game dispensed five to seven balls for a penny.

[27:13] An important thing to remember is the time period.

[27:16] What's going on in 1931?

[27:18] The worst time in North America in the world, the great depression.

[27:22] People don't have money.

[27:24] They need cheap forms of entertainment and a penny is pretty cheap.

[27:28] Penny, a penny is pretty cheap and $17.50.

[27:32] Now today, you're like, oh, $17.50 is like nothing because of inflation, which we've

[27:38] all become very aware of over the last 24 months.

[27:42] That today, with an inflation calculator from 1931 to 2022, is only $330.

[27:51] So it's still cheap.

[27:52] It's still cheap.

[27:53] So I have included a link in the show notes to all of the pin games we're going to talk

[27:58] about.

[27:59] Baffle ball is in there.

[28:01] What are we looking at here, Ron?

[28:03] It's a tabletop.

[28:04] It's got the plunger.

[28:05] When you look at it, you see all the pins.

[28:07] Look at those pins.

[28:09] But it looks a little bit like a field almost, right?

[28:14] Almost like a baseball field.

[28:15] It looks like a baseball field.

[28:16] You know, it's green.

[28:17] It's got baffle ball.

[28:19] It's got a diamond on it.

[28:21] Five balls for a penny.

[28:23] It's got these four little holes to fall into.

[28:26] They're like gobble holes, but they've got metal flaps on them.

[28:30] It's not very large, though, is it?

[28:31] What is this like the size of a 24-inch computer monitor or something?

[28:35] It's not very big.

[28:36] It is not big.

[28:37] But it's pretty, right?

[28:39] It's cool.

[28:40] It looks neat.

[28:41] It's very fancy.

[28:42] Now, have you seen a baffle ball before it, like any of these shows?

[28:45] Yes.

[28:46] What's it like in person?

[28:47] Is it kind of impressive?

[28:48] Well, it's usually in the pre-war section.

[28:50] So there'll be lots of games that look a lot like it.

[28:53] Cool.

[28:54] Some of the pictures here are some restored ones on IPDB are just.

[28:58] It's just beautiful, right?

[28:59] It's real wood that's lacquered, beautiful design.

[29:03] It's got that coin mech on the front.

[29:05] So the best way to describe the coin mech on this thing is kind of like a washing machine

[29:09] back in the day where you'd put the coin in and you'd shove it in and then you'd get

[29:14] a credit to...

[29:15] They're not used that anymore?

[29:16] I mean, I don't know.

[29:18] It's been a long time since I've...

[29:19] Yeah, that's why I think of a laundry mat.

[29:20] You put the coin in and you just push the thing in.

[29:24] You shove the thing in and it goes, and then your laundry is clean.

[29:28] It's very cool.

[29:29] It starts up, but there's that plunger, right?

[29:31] On the right side, it's got the shooter lane that goes up to the arch.

[29:35] So your kind of object here is to gauge how far you pull the plunger to bounce off the

[29:40] pins and then into these like guarded circles.

[29:45] They're guarded by the pins.

[29:47] Take a look at the picture.

[29:48] It's hard to describe, but it's kind of beautiful.

[29:51] It's kind of neat.

[29:52] Now the game resonated with people because they wanted this cheap entertainment, as you

[29:56] mentioned in the Great Depression.

[29:58] And drug stores, particularly, and of course taverns in the US, would operate these machines

[30:05] because the locations were busy and they would recover the cost of the game very quickly.

[30:13] Baffle Ball was also manufactured by Keenean Sons in a separate Chicago facility under

[30:20] the direction of David Gottlieb because they couldn't keep up with production.

[30:25] They needed much more manufacturing might.

[30:28] This is the best part, the flyer.

[30:31] There's a flyer.

[30:33] There's an ad.

[30:34] Oh, good.

[30:35] There's an original flyer.

[30:36] 1930s in IPDB.

[30:39] Can you read this in your old, timey voice?

[30:42] Baffle Ball, the greatest value ever offered.

[30:44] Absolutely.

[30:45] The finest pinboard game made.

[30:47] No bugs in this game.

[30:49] So we're bugs in the game and issue back there.

[30:51] I don't know.

[30:52] Like literally bugs.

[30:53] But I wonder if that means that these games had issues.

[30:57] And they're saying like this game has no issues.

[30:59] Oh, OK.

[31:00] OK.

[31:01] Oh, so many for a five set play.

[31:04] Meas at the big show Hotel Sherman Booth.

[31:07] 45 and 47, which was where it was unveiled.

[31:10] Ellie and that's in his untouchables.

[31:12] No, that's, I'm sorry.

[31:14] It looks like this ad is actually for a distributor, the distributor itself.

[31:19] They're saying they also sell, they sell Baffle Ball, Bingo Ball.

[31:23] Buster Ball and Planet Ball.

[31:26] This is great.

[31:27] I love this one too.

[31:28] I love the Planet Ball.

[31:29] I wonder if they look like planets.

[31:31] The aces in pinboard games.

[31:34] Rockola manufacturing co.

[31:36] Rockola manufacturing.

[31:37] They're aces.

[31:38] They're aces.

[31:39] That's, that was the terms right back then.

[31:42] A, like it's very cool.

[31:43] I really love it.

[31:44] Now Baffle Ball came in sort of a couple of variations.

[31:48] One would be the one you'd put on the bar, right?

[31:50] You'd set it on your own table for 1750, but you could buy one for 3750, the fancy model

[31:59] that has own legs and it had intricate details on the sides.

[32:05] Very, very nice.

[32:06] They called that the senior version.

[32:08] Ellie, like how it says, Nuff said.

[32:10] Yeah.

[32:11] I would think is that is a more contemporary expression, but no, this is from like the

[32:15] 30s.

[32:16] Nuff said.

[32:17] It's some really, really neat history stuff here.

[32:19] This is from March 19th, 1932.

[32:22] It's got the breakdown of what it is.

[32:23] This would be the show flyer.

[32:25] Wonderful.

[32:26] Wonderful machine.

[32:27] So 1750, how many pennies is that?

[32:29] So 1750?

[32:30] So you'd have to get 1750 plays for this to pay itself back.

[32:37] I might up it to the old 5 cent model.

[32:39] The old 5 cent.

[32:40] You want to go with the 5 balls?

[32:41] Yeah.

[32:42] I'd put a top around it and make it 5 cents.

[32:44] Yeah, yeah, you put it, but at that time the top would be what?

[32:47] Like $7.

[32:48] Yeah.

[32:49] Because it's got to be half the price of an actual pin.

[32:51] Well, godly was not the only one's doing this.

[32:53] What came next?

[32:54] Ballyhoo.

[32:55] Ballyhoo.

[32:56] Oh, okay.

[32:57] So this is the one people know about.

[32:58] Ballyhoo.

[32:59] January of 1932.

[33:01] This is the Bally Manufacturing Corporation.

[33:04] Well, they weren't called that yet.

[33:05] They weren't called that yet.

[33:06] They were designed by Raymond T. Maloney.

[33:10] And it also sold 50,000 units.

[33:14] Link is in the show notes.

[33:16] When we look at the play field on this one, what stands out?

[33:20] It looks a lot like the other one, but bigger.

[33:22] Bigger.

[33:23] And fancier colors.

[33:26] Like it's got a lot more, it's like a lot more attention grabbing.

[33:29] Yeah.

[33:30] They just, they got the art going where it's like, you know, we could make a little fancier

[33:34] art.

[33:35] It might sell better.

[33:36] It actually says Ballyhoo on it and the play field, it's multi-colored.

[33:41] It's beautiful.

[33:42] That would looks not, yeah.

[33:44] It's really well done.

[33:46] So the Gottlieb distributor, Raymond Maloney, found it difficult to obtain more baffle

[33:54] ball units to sell.

[33:56] It was so difficult to buy baffle ball because they were selling so quickly that in his frustration,

[34:07] Ben founded Lion Manufacturing and produced his own game design, Ballyhoo, named after

[34:14] the popular magazine.

[34:16] Ferria Jersey Jackass there.

[34:19] He could not get a distributor watch the form their own company.

[34:24] So he did that.

[34:25] This game became an even bigger smash hit.

[34:29] It's larger play field and 10 pockets instead of four made it more challenging than baffle

[34:35] ball.

[34:37] In seven months, it sold those 50,000 units.

[34:41] Maloney eventually changed the name of Lion Manufacturing to Bally to reflect the success

[34:50] of this game.

[34:51] According to the encyclopedia of pinball volume one page 29, total production was approximately

[34:57] 50,000 units in the January 1953 issue of Ballyhoo.

[35:03] The monthly newsletter from Bally, it states 50,000 were sold.

[35:08] So it's not like the 1990s of pinball where they had to like report how many units they

[35:14] sold to stockholders.

[35:16] This is kind of what they said they sold.

[35:18] So maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

[35:20] The same thing goes, I guess, for baffle ball.

[35:22] Check out this advertisement, Ron.

[35:24] Uh oh.

[35:25] You need the magnifying glass.

[35:27] I can't.

[35:28] There's no magnifying glass on this one.

[35:31] Ballyhoo never successfully imitated.

[35:35] So if you wanted to buy lots of five, so if you wanted to buy five Ballyhoo's, they

[35:40] were $18 each.

[35:41] If you wanted to buy 10, they were $17.

[35:45] But if you just wanted one, as what they call a sample, it was $19.

[35:51] Comes complete with wood legs.

[35:52] And they're like the fancy spindle wood legs.

[35:55] Those look like staircase legs from the 1930s.

[35:58] Very fancy stuff.

[35:59] It's ready for immediate delivery.

[36:02] It's the game sensation of 1932.

[36:04] A smashy success.

[36:06] You can get a seven day free trial.

[36:08] You want to try it out, stick it in your bar, see how it goes, put it in your pharmacy.

[36:12] Bally manufacturing company.

[36:14] I was wonder, it's got the air address.

[36:16] I was wonder, like, what's there now in some of these places?

[36:20] You want to just go and look and it's like still a pharmacy.

[36:25] Imagine.

[36:26] Have you seen it?

[36:27] You've seen a value.

[36:28] This one seems to be the most popular one that you see.

[36:29] If you're going to see like the original sort of pinball machines, for some reason, Bally

[36:33] who was always the one you tend to see in the pre-war sections of shows.

[36:38] Because they made a lot of them.

[36:40] A lot of them.

[36:41] So your people are finding these like an old storage units and barns and they're just

[36:46] everywhere.

[36:47] But these were all no electrification.

[36:51] You just sort of put the ball in the thing and you pull it and it pops up, right?

[36:55] You push the coin mac in, all the balls fall down into the chute and into the lane eventually.

[37:02] Like there's no electrification in here.

[37:04] There's no solenoids.

[37:05] There's no real moving pieces that move unless you're physically hitting them or pushing

[37:11] them, isn't that right?

[37:12] Mm-hmm.

[37:14] But that brings us to 1933 with contact.

[37:17] A Pacific manufacturing company or Pamco designed by Harry Williams.

[37:24] We, Harry Williams, we've brought up Harry Williams in our stern electronics episode.

[37:30] We brought up Harry Williams in our Williams episodes, right?

[37:33] Harry Williams is the Williams of Williams and he is the man.

[37:39] He's the king of pinball.

[37:40] Over at patreon.com slash silver ball chronicles, I asked our patrons who is on their Mount

[37:49] Rushmore of pinball and everybody said Harry Williams.

[37:57] Scott E said Harry Williams, Gary Stern, George Gomez, David Gottlieb.

[38:02] That is a heck of a Mount Rushmore.

[38:05] Robert G said Harry Williams, Gary Stern, Roger Sharp and George Gomez.

[38:14] So we had some engagement, some conversation there around that.

[38:18] They all said Harry Williams, myself included.

[38:22] Why was Harry Williams such a big deal, Ron?

[38:24] Not only was he designer, him, he started his own company.

[38:26] Yeah, he started multiple companies.

[38:29] He was an inventor.

[38:30] He was a creative guy.

[38:31] He was doing things left and right.

[38:32] And he was designing games from the threes into the 80s.

[38:36] Into the 80s.

[38:37] I know people think people have a lot of long careers, but that's good Lord.

[38:43] 50 years as a long time.

[38:47] Contact was his first game design.

[38:51] Now we're going to do a whole Harry Williams episode.

[38:54] We'll talk about that later on.

[38:57] But contrary to popular belief, contact was not actually the first game to use electricity.

[39:05] According to Dick Bushell, his notes in pinball one of a book on the history of pinball,

[39:11] there were some games and baguettelles in the early 1900s with electricity that rang

[39:18] bells and flashlights and kick balls around in all directions.

[39:21] Although I specifically could not find any information or any credible sources about those

[39:30] pins.

[39:31] But what I could find is that contact was the first or is generally perceived to be the

[39:37] first modern style pin game with electricity.

[39:43] It sold 28 to 33,000 units.

[39:48] Contact was an enormous success and prompted many copycat versions by other manufacturers.

[39:52] You're going to find that a lot.

[39:53] There was a lot of manufacturers in this era that would try to make the games that, I mean,

[39:58] they just copy the games that were out there.

[40:00] They changed something just very slightly.

[40:02] It's success transform Harry Williams into a major player in the industry.

[40:07] So in an interview with pinball historian Russ Jensen from April 7, 1982, Harry Williams

[40:14] estimated the production of the four cabinet models.

[40:17] There's the senior that would have the legs.

[40:20] There was the junior that sat on the counters.

[40:22] There were a couple of, there were four major variations sold between 28 to 33,000.

[40:28] Now the next two innovations were added after the first 100 units were built.

[40:33] The first one is the tilt.

[40:35] And Harry Williams says, I was testing the machine.

[40:38] I had a gate on this machine.

[40:39] This is the first machine that moved the ball.

[40:42] There was a little mechanical gate that a ball fell in front of the gate.

[40:46] And then by putting the ball through a hole at the top of the machine, it would raise

[40:49] this gate, allow this ball to roll down into a highest scoring area.

[40:54] And it could accept all 10 balls, which was getting three or four or 5,000 points.

[40:59] Then I put it on location to test that in a drugstore.

[41:02] And I saw these fellows lifting the machine and hitting it underneath to make the gate

[41:06] bounce up because it was mechanical and it was on a counterbalance.

[41:10] Then they could get the balls to go in without any skill.

[41:13] So I said, what the hell, they're cheating.

[41:16] So I went back, took the game off location and I put nails all through the bottom of the

[41:21] machine, little fine nail.

[41:23] So when the guy hit underneath the table, he wouldn't do it a second time.

[41:26] Now there's something you can't do anymore.

[41:30] They're banging the machine.

[41:31] I'm going to put sharp nails underneath.

[41:33] So they learn they won't do that.

[41:36] That's why the plungers that have the little pointy tip at the end, that ball he did,

[41:44] that's what that was for, to prevent people from slamming into.

[41:48] Yeah, you can't do that kind of stuff anymore.

[41:51] I mean, come on.

[41:52] People nowadays are such snowflakes.

[41:55] Back in the day, we used to put fine dangerous nails and razor blades on something so you

[41:59] wouldn't hit it.

[42:00] Nowadays, the nanny state won't let you do this.

[42:03] So after you put the nails in, then I thought that's a very unsophisticated way.

[42:08] That's some emergency treatment.

[42:10] I got to think of a way to stop them from doing that.

[42:13] That's when I made this little tilt.

[42:15] The one with the little pedestal and a ring and a little ball that if they shook the machine,

[42:20] it fell off the little pedestal down on the ring and it was tilted.

[42:24] However, I called it a stool pigeon.

[42:28] So when I put the machine and took it back to the same location, one of the fellows

[42:32] that was a regular player of the machine says, oh, look, I hit it now.

[42:36] I tilted.

[42:37] I thought, my god, that's a more sophisticated name instead of stool pigeon.

[42:41] So I immediately went back and had the castings changed to tilt.

[42:45] So that's where the name tilt became associated with our games.

[42:49] That's how the tilt was invented.

[42:51] So some dude called it tilt.

[42:53] Some random guy that got like, where's his money?

[42:55] This quote has come from these old Roger Sharp tapes, which I have been able to get a hold

[43:02] of from Josh Sharp.

[43:05] These were all used with creating pinball Roger Sharp's book.

[43:11] So he sat down with Harry Williams in a coffee shop and recorded for a very, very long

[43:17] time asking him various questions.

[43:20] When you get to listen to the voice of the Harry Williams, which threw me because he is

[43:26] a West Coast, generally knows a West Coast guy.

[43:29] That's where he was.

[43:30] That's, but he could not have been from the West Coast originally because he had a very

[43:34] distinctive New York Northeast accent.

[43:37] Very, very neat.

[43:38] So these old recordings are phenomenal.

[43:42] Some of the issues though, especially with the Harry Williams one, is there in like a

[43:46] diner?

[43:47] Yeah, and you can hear a lot of that very busy time.

[43:49] So I had to put this like into AI software and the AI software has extrapolated the words

[43:57] and who's talking.

[43:59] And then that has taken some actual cleanup to create a transcript.

[44:02] It's been, it's been a kind of annoying, but I am working on the transcript of this.

[44:08] So we'll probably, I don't know if I'll put that up on the Patreon somewhere or I'll

[44:11] give it back to Josh and do what you must, but it'll certainly help a person as they

[44:16] follow along, listening to the Harry Williams interview.

[44:21] And it is Ron from somebody who's like me, I have a history undergraduate hearing the

[44:27] actual individual telling the story of how the tilt was made was like, it was like I was

[44:33] looking into some sort of time machine window.

[44:36] It was, it was amazing.

[44:38] I know that's very nerdy.

[44:39] Yeah.

[44:40] And the other part, there's parts of the conversation where he's drawing stuff for Roger.

[44:44] Like, let me show you what this looked like.

[44:46] You can't see it, obviously.

[44:48] Yeah.

[44:49] You can hear him draw on the table and you can hear the people on the table next door,

[44:53] like ordering coffee or getting sandwiches.

[44:55] It's hilarious.

[44:57] But this brings us to the second innovation which was added to contact about a hundred

[45:03] units into the run.

[45:05] Harry Williams would say the phone was ringing off the wall.

[45:09] We had a contact to show operators while they were waiting to pick up their machines that

[45:14] they could play in the showroom.

[45:17] Jack McCullen's desk was right there because the phone was constantly ringing off the hook.

[45:23] Who's Jack?

[45:25] Jack was the business partner for Harry Williams that helped him create and manufacture contact.

[45:32] He was part of Pacific manufacturing company.

[45:35] Again, West Coast.

[45:36] So Harry Williams said, I had a good joke.

[45:39] I got a whole of a doorbell and I put it in one night.

[45:42] So every time the ball fell into the contact hole, not only would it jump the ball, but it

[45:45] would also bring the bell.

[45:47] So Jack kept hearing the bell go off over and over.

[45:50] So he keep going to the phone, thinking there was the phone ringing.

[45:53] And he got to the point where he said he's going to call the phone company to find out

[45:58] why the phone keeps ringing for no reason.

[46:00] But several operators were there in the showroom standing around and they gave it away that

[46:05] it was the machine that had the bell.

[46:07] Then one of the operators said, I've got a spot that can take two contacts.

[46:11] Let me try this one with the bell alongside the one without it.

[46:15] So we did because I thought, maybe it was a playing feature.

[46:18] We put them side by side, two identical machines, one with the bell, one without the bell.

[46:24] One without the bell took in half the money the one with the bell took in.

[46:28] Needless to say, we had to order doorbells.

[46:31] That's when Jack got angry.

[46:32] He said, geez, we can't raise the price.

[46:34] Now we got to go out today and buy 27 cent doorbells.

[46:38] But it didn't increase the play on the machine.

[46:40] Barry Williams accidentally added the bell to the machine and it increased the amount

[46:47] of earnings because people wanted to shoot it in the contact hole and hear the bell.

[46:52] So the bell created more plays.

[46:55] But of course, his business partner, Jack McCauley was very angry because it added to the overhead

[47:01] or build of materials of the pin.

[47:04] 27 cents, Ron.

[47:06] Yeah, it's kind of bankrupt.

[47:07] Well, 27 cents multiplied by 50,000 units or actually was a 28 to 33,000 units.

[47:14] Yeah.

[47:15] Now we're getting into trouble.

[47:16] Yeah, that's kind of putting right out of business there.

[47:20] So let's talk a little bit about Harry Williams.

[47:22] I'm just going to give like a brief review here.

[47:25] Mr. Williams really started in the coin op industry in 1932 as an operator of a game called

[47:31] a, I see their JLI or high LI.

[47:34] And it promised earnings of $2 an hour after struggling to make money.

[47:39] He designed his own game called advance in 1933.

[47:45] This was the start of automatic amusement company in Los Angeles, California.

[47:51] During the Second World War, all major manufacturers of coin operated machines, they turned their

[47:57] focus to wartime manufacturing.

[48:00] So in a period of less than a decade, Harry Williams actually founded three game producers

[48:06] in the West Coast.

[48:08] So another legend in the industry is Wayne Nions.

[48:11] And he always had wonderful things to say about Harry Williams.

[48:15] He says Harry was a great idea man.

[48:18] He had ideas, ideas coming out his mind all the time.

[48:22] He didn't like to turn the crank.

[48:24] He didn't like to draw the circuit up and he didn't like to wire the game up.

[48:28] Those kind of things were below him.

[48:30] He had another idea that he wanted to work on.

[48:32] That's what made him so good.

[48:33] He had so many ideas going all the time.

[48:36] That's why he was a great designer.

[48:38] Harry Williams was an ideas guy.

[48:40] It wasn't really a doer.

[48:42] Right.

[48:43] So the reason he's coming up with all these manufacturers, he's trying to improve this.

[48:48] He's coming up with the tiltees, creating the bell.

[48:51] He's doing all these things.

[48:52] He's just off in all directions all the time, coming up with ideas.

[48:55] He's innovating.

[48:56] We spoke a little bit about that in our in our Stern electronics episode.

[49:00] Didn't we run where he didn't want to own or run companies?

[49:04] He didn't want to deal with accounting.

[49:05] He just wanted to create and innovate and have fun.

[49:09] Well, Harry would pass away on September 11th, 1983 in his home in Palm Springs,

[49:14] California, where he succumbed to cancer at age 77.

[49:20] We'll do a whole episode on Harry Williams.

[49:24] Later on down the road, once I get through the editing of that transcript,

[49:28] there's a lot of phenomenal first hand accounting of what Harry Williams was doing on the

[49:33] West Coast when he came to Chicago, what he was doing, who he was working with.

[49:37] It was fantastic.

[49:38] But I don't want to get this episode to go too long because it's a brief history of pinball.

[49:42] It's a shame he couldn't have made it in other few years.

[49:44] He could have made it to the first expo.

[49:47] That would have been nice.

[49:48] It would have been amazing for him to see that.

[49:50] The next major innovation in pinball with the onset of electrification,

[49:56] which created the tilt and the bell was not the tilt.

[50:01] I don't think the tilt is actually electric because the ball would just be sitting on a

[50:04] thing and you shake it and the ball falls off and hits a ring.

[50:07] It was skyscraper in 1934, a Valley manufacturing corporation pin.

[50:14] This is designed by Edward J. Wohfeldt,

[50:19] art by Roy Parker, who is a name that will come up.

[50:21] It sells 6,500 units.

[50:23] So we're not talking like crazy innovation of all time,

[50:27] Ballyhoo stuff here.

[50:29] But this is the first pinball machine that is credited to have lights.

[50:34] Now, until this point, they actually didn't have lights on the play field.

[50:37] Yeah, it didn't actually have lights.

[50:40] Now, you'd have to have a light to see what you were doing,

[50:42] but it didn't have something that turned on a light bulb.

[50:45] Because there was such a race on the innovation in the coin op world in this pre-war time,

[50:52] there's really a difficult time to, you know, we have,

[50:56] we have a very difficult time to really definitively say this is the first machine.

[51:03] Now, it's objectively the first machine.

[51:06] God knows somebody in their garage created something with 25 units,

[51:12] or 100 units, but this, you know, we're trying to tie a bow.

[51:15] It's similar to the thing we've, we've said on the show before where

[51:20] in the 90s, there'll be some innovative thing on a game,

[51:22] but it turns out it was used in some EM in the 40s or something.

[51:26] It's similar in that.

[51:27] It looks like this is the first game that had it,

[51:29] but there might have been some, some other manufacturer you've never heard of before,

[51:34] who did a one off that had this feature before.

[51:37] Yeah.

[51:37] And this is the general understanding of the pinball machine

[51:42] that has the lights in the play field that we can point to that people have referenced

[51:48] in other popular media.

[51:50] Some people talk about a flashball by great states manufacturing company, for example,

[51:56] but we're going to go with this one because quite frankly,

[51:58] Ron, you and I are the definitive experts of pinball history because we have two microphones

[52:03] and Google.

[52:05] Okay.

[52:05] What do you think is play field?

[52:07] This is sky scrape.

[52:08] It has an actual sky scrape on it.

[52:10] It has a building in the middle of the play field.

[52:15] And then the art on the play field are the buildings in the background.

[52:18] And then there's the capture holes and the pins in the play field.

[52:23] It's very, very cool.

[52:26] Yeah.

[52:27] So it's the object of this just like all the other sort of pin games at the time

[52:32] is to use the plunger, shoot it up to the top into the rounded arch.

[52:36] And then it'll fall down Pachinko style from the prices right into a hole or into a

[52:41] capture spot.

[52:42] If you land in one spot, you get 200 points and land in another, you get a thousand,

[52:46] you land down here, you get a free.

[52:47] Yeah.

[52:47] 1934.

[52:48] We're already starting to get we have we have lights.

[52:51] We have we're looking at the picture right now.

[52:53] We have a ball feeder.

[52:55] That's below the actual, um, the plunger captures the ball and pushes it in.

[52:59] Pushes it up to the shooter lane.

[53:00] So you can actually shoot the ball.

[53:02] And we have a tilt.

[53:04] We can see the little tilt mechanism, which is really just a ball that sits on, um,

[53:10] it's just like on a, I don't know what you would call it, podium or thing, like a curved

[53:14] thing.

[53:15] So if you shake it, it falls off.

[53:17] So you could tell it tilts.

[53:19] When you start a new game, it would generally when you push the coin,

[53:22] mac in, it would re center the ball in the tilt location.

[53:26] So it's now not tilted anymore.

[53:27] The center of this, the lights in the building is almost like a bonus, right?

[53:32] It keeps track of how many, um, points you have by the, by the holes you've fallen into.

[53:39] So it lights up in the middle.

[53:41] So, you know, you land on a 100 points, it, the 100 lights up.

[53:44] If you land on, you know, two 100s, it'll light the 200.

[53:48] But if you land on two 100s and a 200, it'll go to the 400 and that will light up.

[53:52] And it's like you're going up an elevator in a skyscraper.

[53:56] Remember about a lot of these games.

[53:57] You had to have some math skills because you would, you would hit them in the pockets

[54:02] and you would have to add them up after your game was over to know how much you have

[54:05] because they had no, you know, back box with a scoring display on it.

[54:09] Yeah.

[54:09] So we'll tell you what scoring display is in a couple of minutes.

[54:12] We'll just leave that tease on the table before we have a scoring mechanism.

[54:17] We're going to need a back box.

[54:20] And the reason I include the first pinball with a back box is because quite frankly,

[54:25] the back box of a pinball machine is pretty iconic.

[54:28] You can't have a pinball machine without a back box.

[54:31] Yeah, pretty well.

[54:32] Yeah, pretty much.

[54:34] I'm trying to think of anyone who tried that or did that at the top of my head,

[54:39] other than a home, it isn't a home brewer too that I've seen without a back box.

[54:43] I don't know.

[54:43] Yeah, I can't have it.

[54:44] I can't have it without a back box.

[54:46] People even get angry when the back box is too crazy.

[54:49] It's too different.

[54:50] Oh my God.

[54:51] The sides of the back box have a design on them.

[54:53] That's crazy talk.

[54:54] What are you doing?

[54:56] It's supposed to be square.

[54:57] Well, the first pinball with a back box was World's Series from 1934.

[55:04] This was by Rockola manufacturing corporation because there's a million different

[55:08] manufacturers at the time.

[55:09] There's no credits for designer art or how many units sold.

[55:12] Want to be fair, Rockola would kind of make their name in two boxes.

[55:15] Oh, yeah, but they're a big deal.

[55:16] Rockola is a big deal.

[55:18] The back box though, it didn't have any lights.

[55:21] It didn't have a scoring wheels.

[55:24] It didn't have anything.

[55:25] It was only designed to be advertising space, which is actually pretty smart.

[55:31] So you got this machine.

[55:33] It's up against a wall.

[55:34] It's on the legs.

[55:35] Well, the that you can't really put a shelf above it.

[55:39] You can't really put anything around it, you know, vertically on top of it

[55:44] because that's going to cover the play field.

[55:45] So you stick this thing on there and you could put advertising on it.

[55:49] And then you can sell the advertising to people because there's a bunch of kids.

[55:53] They're all the time playing this game or 20 somethings.

[55:57] And they're going to be looking at your ad.

[55:59] That is brilliant.

[56:00] If you ask me, it was a baseball game as you can tell by the name world series.

[56:05] But the problem with putting a back box on the back run is lighting.

[56:12] Well, the first pin game with a light hit back box is rock light.

[56:20] 1935 by Balli Manufacturing Corporation.

[56:23] I couldn't find any design credit, any art, any unit sold.

[56:27] But this is the first pin game with a light hit back box.

[56:33] Rockalite.

[56:33] But it had these score lights on the back.

[56:37] So sort of like on the play field with the skyscraper game.

[56:42] You'd fall in the holes.

[56:43] It would light up the circles in the back of rockalite.

[56:48] It had the points that would light up in the back.

[56:50] But it's very small.

[56:51] It's not big, right?

[56:52] It's tiny.

[56:53] Yeah, it's like what is that?

[56:54] Six inches, eight inches.

[56:57] It's not very high.

[56:59] It's cool though.

[56:59] Game kind of looks like crap.

[57:00] Hey, what does the ad say?

[57:03] The ad tells us how great it is.

[57:05] Hold on.

[57:05] Let me zoom in here.

[57:06] So we're looking at a, actually, this one has several games.

[57:09] This ad is this is from the billboard from March 30th, 1935.

[57:14] It's advertising for traffic.

[57:16] Here's a good example.

[57:17] You have this game on the left traffic.

[57:19] It's by Harry Williams.

[57:20] It has no, no back box, nothing on the back.

[57:23] Then you look at rockalite.

[57:25] And it just looks different.

[57:26] I mean, like, whoa, what's that thing in the back?

[57:28] The other thing doesn't have that.

[57:30] This one must be better.

[57:32] I like it's got anti tilt.

[57:34] It says light up, anti tilt without going near the machine.

[57:38] You tilted it.

[57:39] The tilt.

[57:40] Look at this little cartoon over here.

[57:42] Yeah, it was like a cartoon of a guy in a bar who's playing the game

[57:46] and the bartender has a word bubble that says, you tilted it.

[57:50] The tilt is lit because then it like I said,

[57:53] it just had the ball that would fall off the podium.

[57:56] You wouldn't be able to see it unless you're actually looking at it.

[57:59] This had a light that told you tilt.

[58:02] So your game is null and void.

[58:04] This is the only game on the market, which permits merchant to check the score

[58:08] and anti tilt just by glancing up from his duties behind the counter.

[58:13] Light up anti tilt on the backboard is visible clear across the store saves

[58:18] the merchant time and trouble and increases your net profit by absolutely

[58:25] eliminating payouts on tilted machines.

[58:28] And you'll be tickled stiff with this.

[58:31] Wow.

[58:33] Whoa.

[58:34] And you'll be tickled stiff by the way, rock a light takes your money,

[58:39] order this great light up sensation from your job.

[58:43] Or today, like wrestling terminology for some reason,

[58:48] light up sensation from your job or an April.

[58:51] It's absolutely stunning.

[58:53] I like how they call it anti tilt and they call it backboard.

[58:56] No backbox.

[58:57] It's a backboard.

[58:58] Oh, wait a minute.

[59:45] Yeah.

[59:46] That's how much one of these machines.

[59:47] Yes.

[59:48] And remember, what was it?

[59:49] That was at $17.50 for the.

[59:51] 17.50 for the Ballyhoo.

[59:54] And it's just two years later.

[59:56] Or is it three years later?

[59:57] It's not that much later.

[59:59] And where we're already inflation.

[01:00:01] These schemes are getting more expensive.

[01:00:04] Now we're up to $837.

[01:00:08] $837 for the cost for this.

[01:00:10] It's almost $1,000 now.

[01:00:12] This is this is some serious stuff all of a sudden here.

[01:00:15] There's some money to be had by manufacturing all these.

[01:00:18] It was probably why there's a million of these manufacturers at this time.

[01:00:23] What was the next huge leap forward now, Ron?

[01:00:26] So we're in 1935.

[01:00:28] Let's see.

[01:00:28] We got we got pins on the play field.

[01:00:32] That wasn't really we got the spring loaded plunger.

[01:00:35] That's a big one.

[01:00:36] Lights.

[01:00:37] We have a back box called the backboard, at least by them.

[01:00:41] What are we missing?

[01:00:44] What's what's going to make it really pinball?

[01:00:47] What do we need to make it actually?

[01:00:48] We got tilts, but that's not cool.

[01:00:52] You know, some way to actually hit the ball.

[01:00:55] Something to yeah, somehow if we could flip the flip.

[01:01:00] Flippers.

[01:01:01] Oh, geez.

[01:01:03] It was right there right on my notes in front of us.

[01:01:05] How did I not see that?

[01:01:07] The flippers and this one seems to be universally agreed that this is the first game.

[01:01:12] I've never heard anyone say no.

[01:01:13] There was something before that.

[01:01:14] Oh, there was the Jones and co.

[01:01:17] It sold 220 units in Britain in 1932.

[01:01:22] But no, no, there's there's there's generally no him and Han over this one.

[01:01:26] This is Gottlieb's Humpty Dumpty, introduced in 1947.

[01:01:32] It is the first game to have player controlled flippers to keep the ball in play.

[01:01:40] The low power flippers required three pairs around the play field to keep the ball moving

[01:01:47] and get it up to the top of the play field.

[01:01:52] But why are we going from 1935 where there was like, you know, a lot of innovation in the early

[01:01:59] mid 30s.

[01:02:00] Now we're into like 47, which is almost like 19, which were almost in the 1950s.

[01:02:07] What happened?

[01:02:07] Oh, right.

[01:02:08] Germany took that vacation in Europe.

[01:02:12] Yeah.

[01:02:12] So everybody was busy doing something else.

[01:02:15] Yeah, in the 40s.

[01:02:17] In the early 40s, yes.

[01:02:20] All the innovation sort of went into the war effort as opposed to amusement games.

[01:02:25] All the manufacturers, like I mentioned kind of in that brief Harry Williams,

[01:02:29] but you know, biography there was that all the sudden they've all moved to the war effort

[01:02:34] as opposed to the innovation within pin games.

[01:02:36] But a lot of that innovation in the war effort has created the flipper.

[01:02:42] So this was created.

[01:02:44] This was the company was D Gottlieb and company.

[01:02:47] So again, Gottlieb, you know, in the center of the manufacturing world here in the pinball world.

[01:02:54] This was designed by Harry Mabbs, art by Roy Parker, it sells 6,500 units.

[01:03:01] But Ron, I am going to play around here a little bit.

[01:03:05] This is the first game with a electro mechanical flippers.

[01:03:10] Cause flippers were already used on many games prior to 1947, but they were non-electrical,

[01:03:15] entirely mechanical.

[01:03:17] Humpty Dumpty is the first pinball machine manufactured to flippers that were electro mechanical.

[01:03:22] So again, people are going to me like, what about this?

[01:03:25] No, these are electro mechanical.

[01:03:28] So I'm going to draw that distinction.

[01:03:30] So if you had a button and you push that button and it flipped the ball, totally different,

[01:03:35] totally, totally different.

[01:03:38] Here's a quote from Wayne Nions.

[01:03:40] He says, in enable the pin game to become an amusement device before that,

[01:03:44] no one really knew before that, no one knew how to really make an amusement device.

[01:03:50] It wasn't any fun to play.

[01:03:52] You shot a ball and oh, yeah, there was a little fun to it, but the flipper that made the game.

[01:03:57] It just, it changed the industry overnight.

[01:04:01] This also brings up an individual named Lynn Durant and Lynn Durant is, is sort of an integral

[01:04:06] person around this time who's working with Harry Williams, creating these different

[01:04:12] companies, very, very important and poignant person.

[01:04:16] I don't have a lot of information in this episode, but he will pop up later on and he will

[01:04:19] pop up in other episodes, but he actually said at the time that he would never put a

[01:04:24] flipper on a pinball machine because it was terrible.

[01:04:27] And of course, he was not working it got me at the time.

[01:04:30] He was working at a, I believe it was rock hola.

[01:04:33] Then within a couple of months, boy, oh boy, he put flippers on his machines because he

[01:04:39] couldn't sell a single one that didn't have flippers changed everything.

[01:04:45] Well, why didn't got Lee patent the flipper?

[01:04:48] Yeah, they could have made tons of money, right?

[01:04:50] Nobody could use a flipper unless they paid D got Laban co.

[01:04:55] Dave got leave would say what was good for the industry was good for got leave.

[01:05:00] So he didn't patent it.

[01:05:02] What a, what a, what a man.

[01:05:03] What a magnanimous man or they just forgot to patent it.

[01:05:07] What a legend.

[01:05:08] But apparently, you know, he would say there were a lot of innovations that got

[01:05:14] Lee but created and they didn't patent any of them in this time because he figured

[01:05:18] if it would grow the industry, got Lee would grow as well.

[01:05:22] All rising waters, rise all boats, which is funny because now out of all the

[01:05:27] manufacturers, they have the most stringent.

[01:05:30] Like you can't, you can't even get a manual online without going through proper

[01:05:35] channels and stuff.

[01:05:36] Yeah.

[01:05:37] David got Lee would roll over in his grave.

[01:05:40] Well, when we look at Humpty Dumpty,

[01:05:44] okay, so I brought up the photo here, going to bring up the flyer to start.

[01:05:48] And the other thing about this innovation, they would, they would come out with

[01:05:53] retrofit kits for older games to just stick flippers on them.

[01:05:56] Like they need flippers on everything now.

[01:05:59] If you didn't have a flipper on your game, your game was just done.

[01:06:03] Like you, you're done.

[01:06:04] You need flippers.

[01:06:07] Got Lee, Humpty Dumpty.

[01:06:08] You know, this is the greatest triumph in pin game history.

[01:06:13] You know, I know that's a marketing thing, but

[01:06:16] as is close to true, as you could probably ever be in one of these.

[01:06:21] Yeah, that's not hyperbole or silly puns that we end up getting stuck with.

[01:06:25] Humpty Dumpty with the sensationally new, not just new, but sensationally new

[01:06:31] player controlled flipper bumpers.

[01:06:34] That's what they call them.

[01:06:36] They call them flipper bumpers.

[01:06:38] The unique flipper bumpers are motivated by sensitive finger tip control buttons

[01:06:45] on each side of the cabinet with ski.

[01:06:47] Look at this arrow over here on the cabinet.

[01:06:49] It says super sensitive control buttons on both sides with skill and timing.

[01:06:55] Player can control balls and send them zooming right back up to the top of the playing field

[01:07:00] for additional scoring.

[01:07:02] The combination of controlled flipper button action.

[01:07:05] No, the combination of controlled flipper bumper action and controlled ball action

[01:07:10] provides amazing earning power, a proven shot in the arm for any location.

[01:07:17] There is something new under the sun.

[01:07:21] Get this game of skill and timing on location now.

[01:07:28] I'm sold.

[01:07:29] Humpty Dumpty also features high score sequence bonus and kicker pockets.

[01:07:34] The whole cares.

[01:07:34] It's all about those flipper bumpers.

[01:07:36] Yeah, this is pretty cool.

[01:07:38] This is pretty cool stuff.

[01:07:39] So if we look at the play field, right, we're an IPDB here.

[01:07:44] Well, it's not quite.

[01:07:45] It's not quite what we would expect.

[01:07:47] So if you think about the pin games as we have seen them here prior, you've got all

[01:07:53] these pins in the play field.

[01:07:55] The ball goes into the plunger lane into into the into the ball trough.

[01:07:59] You shoot it.

[01:07:59] It goes up the lane up to the arch and then it falls down using gravity where it bounces

[01:08:06] in these pins and into a hole.

[01:08:08] Well, this is this is kind of totally different, right?

[01:08:10] Well, other things have evolved over time.

[01:08:13] Now instead of the pins, we got things like dead bumpers that you just hit and get points.

[01:08:17] We get saucers, gobbles, stuff like that.

[01:08:22] Yeah, we got now we've got like these rubber posts, these posts with rubbers on them

[01:08:26] that the ball bounces in.

[01:08:27] But even the flippers don't look like we would expect them to.

[01:08:30] The flippers are two inch flippers and they're facing, they're along the left and right

[01:08:36] sides of the play field, not in the usual and they're anchored on the inside of the field.

[01:08:41] Backwards, if you would, how would you would usually see them?

[01:08:44] But there's six of them.

[01:08:45] There's six of them and they all fire at the same time.

[01:08:47] You hit the right button, all three fire.

[01:08:49] You hit the left button, all three on the left fire.

[01:08:52] And they're not that strong, which is why there's six beautiful back glass with a bunch

[01:08:57] of like fairy tale kind of thing.

[01:09:00] It's something dumpedy.

[01:09:01] It's Humpty Dumpty.

[01:09:03] Huh, what about the first production game with two flippers?

[01:09:07] Right, because that's kind of a little more like today's modern pinball, right?

[01:09:10] Two flippers at the bottom of the play field.

[01:09:12] That would be triple action made in 1948 by Genco, designed by Steve Cordeck,

[01:09:18] art by Christian Marsh.

[01:09:20] So three thousand eight hundred and twenty eight units.

[01:09:24] So when it comes to triple action, this, this is the game that had, like we said,

[01:09:30] two flippers at the bottom of the play field, very similar to modern pinball today.

[01:09:35] But there's still something up with these flippers.

[01:09:37] They're facing the other way.

[01:09:38] They're still, they're still backwards.

[01:09:40] So they're anchored in the center of the play field.

[01:09:42] So they, so they pivot on the outsides.

[01:09:45] So they kind of flip upwards.

[01:09:48] You're kind of focused on the outside of the play field, right?

[01:09:51] If you're flipping.

[01:09:53] Takes a lot more skill to kind of get it in the middle of the play field.

[01:09:56] But the major innovation that Steve Cordeck did here was that he added the more

[01:10:01] powerful direct current or DC power supply, which made them stronger.

[01:10:07] So the two, could do the two flippers could do the same thing that the six on

[01:10:13] Humpty Dumpty.

[01:10:14] Yeah, Genco was primarily known, not for pinball, but they made a lot of the arcade

[01:10:19] equipment like the baseball games, the pitch and baths.

[01:10:22] Or, or like a basketball that guy throws a basketball into hoop games and all

[01:10:26] that and they used DC current a lot.

[01:10:29] And this era is all about sort of massaging the ideas and making them better.

[01:10:35] Where the previous pre war era is very much the innovation creating era.

[01:10:40] If you ask me, well, this post war era was dominated by God,

[01:10:45] Leab for its innovation.

[01:10:47] Game designers like Wayne Nions and Ed Krensky were the big hitters.

[01:10:51] Our artists like Lee Roy Parker, they produced some of the games that collectors

[01:10:56] considered to be the best classic pinball games of all time.

[01:11:03] Triple action costs $279 and 50.

[01:11:08] Oh, goodness.

[01:11:09] This is the equivalent to $3,500 in two days, 20, 22 dollars.

[01:11:17] So the first game that had the modern flipper arrangement.

[01:11:21] So we're talking anchored in the center of anchored on the outside of the playfield

[01:11:26] and flipping upwards in the center of the play field was spot bowler,

[01:11:32] 1950 by D Gottlieb and co.

[01:11:36] What about the active pop bumper, the jet bumper, Ron?

[01:11:41] This one took me a little bit of search and a little bit of looking to find.

[01:11:46] So before it had what did you call it a dead pop?

[01:11:49] Dead bumper.

[01:11:49] Dead bumper.

[01:11:50] And what was what did that do?

[01:11:51] It looks like a bumper, but you hit the switch on it and it just gives you points.

[01:11:55] It doesn't actually fire or do anything.

[01:11:57] Yeah, it just kind of hits the thing.

[01:11:59] It kind of goes clunk and goes, I'm trying to think of some newer games that might

[01:12:03] have something equivalent if, well, Meteor has one right now.

[01:12:05] I was trying to think of something newer, but yes, Meteor has a few of them.

[01:12:09] So does Nimball.

[01:12:11] Steve Kirk liked his dead bumpers, obviously.

[01:12:13] This was Sarah Toga from 1948 by Williams manufacturing company,

[01:12:19] designed by Harry Williams, art by George Molten.

[01:12:24] And we don't know how many units were sold, but Sarah Toga is to consider to be the

[01:12:28] first machine to feature the active bumper.

[01:12:32] That's the type with the metal ring that when the ball would hit it,

[01:12:36] it would depress the switch, which would then pop or thump.

[01:12:41] And it would hit the ball.

[01:12:42] A lot of people call them thumper bumpers.

[01:12:44] A lot of people call them jet bumpers, but they're pop bumpers.

[01:12:47] So it's whatever the company decided to call them for Williams.

[01:12:51] It was always jet bumper.

[01:12:53] The this sort of style in Sarah Toga was eventually sort of replaced with the ones

[01:13:01] that we use nowadays with a spoon that would, you know, compress the metal ring

[01:13:06] that then sort of pops the switch.

[01:13:08] So it's it is the same thing, but it is slightly different.

[01:13:12] It's a stoners 1938 super Zeta, which has the sort of the new design.

[01:13:17] The new is it. No, that would have the old design.

[01:13:19] I'm confused.

[01:13:20] Well, the well, the current style of design, this style of active bumper would

[01:13:26] soon replace the older ones like the use that can press spring.

[01:13:30] You said the opposite way.

[01:13:31] That confused me.

[01:13:32] That's right.

[01:13:32] I'm saving.

[01:13:33] Yes, right.

[01:13:34] What Ron said, Pope, people, Ron said.

[01:13:37] So did Harry Williams design and create the pop bumper?

[01:13:41] Looks like it existed beforehand, but so Charlie Castaker was the actual designer

[01:13:50] of the pop bumper.

[01:13:52] Now Charlie was a supplier of plastics for the whole pinball industry in Chicago.

[01:13:59] His company was called American molded products.

[01:14:02] And he created two types of pop bumpers and he gave them to all of the manufacturers.

[01:14:10] The idea was if he could get the manufacturers to use these plastic pop bumpers,

[01:14:17] he would make the plastics for them and he would make a bunch of money, which is smart marketing.

[01:14:22] So Charlie, it was said by Wayne Nions and others at the time was a very smart business

[01:14:29] person.

[01:14:29] In 1936, he was a spring salesperson.

[01:14:34] He would sell springs.

[01:14:36] Then plastics became a big deal after the war and he bought an injection molding machine

[01:14:42] and he made posts for the pinball machines.

[01:14:46] Then he would sell them to the Western manufacturer and company and other amusement

[01:14:51] manufacturers.

[01:14:53] So he was a marketer at hand.

[01:14:56] He had some money, had some capital.

[01:14:58] He had injection molding machines when that was kind of the up and coming cool new technology

[01:15:04] after the war came up with the idea of the pop bumper and he created a molded plastics

[01:15:08] and all that stuff.

[01:15:08] He gave it away to the pinball machines.

[01:15:11] So you can thank Charlie Castaker for creating the pop bumper quite frankly, Ron.

[01:15:17] If a pinball machine doesn't have a pop bumper, is it really a pinball machine?

[01:15:21] Shadow says yes.

[01:15:23] Yeah, but it's, you know, no fear says yes.

[01:15:26] But it's still iconic.

[01:15:27] The pop bumper is iconic.

[01:15:29] Without a pop bumper, it's hard to be like, oh, it's pinball.

[01:15:31] Most people like most pinball models play pinball and they're like, I want to get

[01:15:36] it in the pop bumpers because it's doing something and I'm scoring points, even though

[01:15:39] that's completely useless.

[01:15:40] And they're probably putting themselves in danger.

[01:15:43] Pinball pop bumpers are probably one of the most iconic things out there.

[01:15:47] It was also in the 1940s that something very popular was created.

[01:15:52] The bingo or bingo's, I don't get this.

[01:15:57] So we're going to go through it kind of kind of bingo's you bingo's are

[01:16:03] mechanically extremely complicated.

[01:16:06] They dwarf the pinballs when it comes to complexity.

[01:16:10] It's not even close.

[01:16:11] So there's kind of two parallel tracks at the moment, right?

[01:16:13] There's like the there's the flipper games that are being created now that are like

[01:16:19] kind of games of skill or fun and amusement.

[01:16:23] And then down the other path, we've got bingos and bingos are more kind of

[01:16:28] math oriented gambling payout hybrid machines.

[01:16:33] I've included the beginners guide to bingo pinball from Nick Baldridge.

[01:16:39] And this is an article in this week in pinball.

[01:16:41] Nick Baldridge is the host of for amusement only EM and bingo pinball podcast

[01:16:47] and is probably the ultimate expert in all things bingo.

[01:16:52] Nick Baldridge knows this stuff.

[01:16:53] He's created like his own, you know, brand new modern bingo machine.

[01:16:57] This guy goes nuts for bingo's.

[01:16:58] I guess if we do a bingo's episode, like I'll just get Nick Baldridge to do it.

[01:17:05] I had a collector's house I was at who also had a bunch of bingo's and just

[01:17:10] listening to him describe the rule set.

[01:17:12] It sounded like a modern stern or something.

[01:17:15] It was so complicated.

[01:17:17] I don't get it.

[01:17:18] And maybe it's because I haven't played enough of it or maybe it's that I don't

[01:17:22] have the quick mental capacity to deal with those things because my brain has been

[01:17:26] destroyed by modern video games and toys and max and things.

[01:17:30] But the idea of a bingo is that it's got the play field.

[01:17:34] It has a bunch of holes.

[01:17:36] All those holes have numbers on them and you plunge a ball and you kind of nudge

[01:17:40] it around and it falls in the holes.

[01:17:42] And then you've got like bingo cards on the back box that you're trying to match

[01:17:47] up certain numbers and get certain scores and matches and things in a row.

[01:17:51] And it's really, really complicated.

[01:17:53] We'll get to that in a second.

[01:17:54] The big problem with bingo's was the Johnson act of 1951, which I've included in the

[01:18:00] show notes.

[01:18:01] What was the Johnson act of 1951?

[01:18:03] Well, 1951 Congress enacted the transportation of gambling devices act.

[01:18:09] The act more commonly known as the Johnson act has been amended several times

[01:18:13] during the intervening years.

[01:18:14] Most notably the act makes it unlawful to knowingly transport a gambling device to

[01:18:19] a state where such a device is prohibited by law.

[01:18:22] One ball machines, which we talked about earlier, were now illegal because they were

[01:18:26] now deemed as gambling devices.

[01:18:28] Bally was the first to switch gears and find ways around the new legislation.

[01:18:33] So Linda rant, who is the sort of the genius that we had mentioned before that

[01:18:37] worked with Harry Williams.

[01:18:38] Well, he worked for a united manufacturing company and he came up with the concept

[01:18:42] of the bingo.

[01:18:44] His original design didn't really catch on because the play field created a style

[01:18:49] that was to random and it was too difficult to actually create scoring.

[01:18:55] It was Don Hooker, who is a genius engineer who spent all of his time at Bally

[01:19:01] in the engineering department.

[01:19:03] He came up with the bingo machine that we sort of know today.

[01:19:07] The play field had spring steel.

[01:19:10] It had hidden lamps and it had position posts where the ball would bounce around.

[01:19:15] And it also had 25 trap holes for the ball to fall into.

[01:19:20] Now those holes on the play field matched the bingo card on the back glass on five

[01:19:26] by five grids.

[01:19:27] Nick Baldrige says the first game from Bally called bright lights had six cards.

[01:19:32] Each card could be bought in order for one nickel.

[01:19:35] The game proved extremely popular and got around the primary issue with the one

[01:19:39] balls on the new bingo pinball player could win with only three of five balls

[01:19:44] played properly.

[01:19:44] You only had to line up three numbers on the card to win a small amount of replace.

[01:19:49] Four in a row earned about four times the amount for three and five in a row

[01:19:53] earned a hundred replace.

[01:19:55] So a lot of the time these replace you build these replays up and then you

[01:20:00] would cash them out at the bartender or the you know the the owner of the drug

[01:20:05] store or whatever.

[01:20:07] So it wasn't quite gambling because you were buying you were getting replays.

[01:20:12] You weren't buying a payout, but there was like an unwritten sort of rule.

[01:20:15] So to get around this Johnson Act about gambling devices, they had to create a new

[01:20:20] skilled based sort of replay bingo machine.

[01:20:25] United in Durantwood after three games changed their design to almost mirror that

[01:20:30] of valleys.

[01:20:31] If you can't beat them, join them.

[01:20:33] And the bingo's rising complexity, you know, they had some of the bingo cards

[01:20:37] in the back of the box, back boxes, they would have like, they would rotate so they

[01:20:41] could rotate and they would change the numbers that you needed for the ball to

[01:20:44] fall in on the play field.

[01:20:46] There were buy-in options.

[01:20:47] They were player controlled kickouts where you hit a button and it would kick

[01:20:51] it out to maybe, oh, I didn't want to land in that one.

[01:20:53] I got to land in something else.

[01:20:54] What's so attractive about bingo's though, Ron?

[01:20:57] I don't again, I don't really get it.

[01:20:58] I think they're for smarter people.

[01:21:00] I think they are for a it's, it's, yeah, you need some brain power.

[01:21:03] Like I said, when I had, I heard someone explaining the rules to one of these

[01:21:07] to somebody, I'm like, oh my God, I'm already lost.

[01:21:11] Well, here's what Nick Baldridge says is the appeal of bingo's.

[01:21:14] He says there are several aspects of playing a bingo pinball machine that really

[01:21:18] attract players.

[01:21:20] The risk reward of how many coins to play in the betting phase, the constantly

[01:21:25] changing goals and reaching a point in the game where you have two sets, two sets

[01:21:32] of two rows with a single number in between with only one number needed.

[01:21:38] You have to make the shot in that specific hold.

[01:21:42] Otherwise, you get nothing.

[01:21:43] Well, Ron, that sounds great.

[01:21:45] It's a couple of kids.

[01:21:47] I don't know.

[01:21:47] I don't get it.

[01:21:48] I don't get it.

[01:21:48] And I know Nick Baldridge is probably freaking out here and other people that get

[01:21:53] bingo's and I know I'm going to get a bunch of hate mail.

[01:21:56] It's going to happen.

[01:21:57] I think they're cool.

[01:21:58] I think they're fun.

[01:21:59] I understand where they fit within the realm of the history of pinball.

[01:22:03] It's just not for me.

[01:22:05] Hate mail can be sent to silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[01:22:08] But I figure if you can fix a bingo machine, you could probably fix any

[01:22:11] EM to force.

[01:22:12] Oh, yeah.

[01:22:13] Oh my goodness.

[01:22:13] Could you ever?

[01:22:14] One of the, I think, coolest innovations that really helped is the mechanical

[01:22:20] score real.

[01:22:22] So before you have a back glass with art and then behind the art was a light bulb.

[01:22:26] And when you would get to 100 points, the 100 point light bulb would turn on.

[01:22:29] If you got to 1000 points, the 1000 would, would light up 1200.

[01:22:34] It would be the 1000 and the 200, right?

[01:22:36] It would just light up.

[01:22:37] Well, the mechanical score real was in Army Navy.

[01:22:42] Army Navy made in 1953 by Williams manufacturing corporation designed by

[01:22:48] Guess who?

[01:22:49] Harry Williams, art by George Molten, unknown number sold.

[01:22:53] Yeah.

[01:22:53] So, so Army Navy, I don't know what this is, but apparently this is like a big

[01:22:57] deal football thing in the States.

[01:22:59] Yeah.

[01:23:00] The Army Navy football game.

[01:23:01] Yeah.

[01:23:02] So that's what the theme is.

[01:23:03] It's got three active pop bumpers in the middle.

[01:23:06] I totally, I totally forgot you were Canadian there for a second.

[01:23:09] I just like, how do you not know this?

[01:23:10] Like, oh, yeah.

[01:23:11] Yes.

[01:23:11] It's not the, it's not the winter classic hockey game.

[01:23:14] We all know what that is.

[01:23:15] Or do you have like Canadian football game between like the, I don't know,

[01:23:20] the Royal Mounted Police and some other.

[01:23:22] No, no, we don't.

[01:23:23] What is the thing?

[01:23:24] No.

[01:23:24] Back, back years ago in the, in the, in the Canadian football league,

[01:23:27] we used to have the Ottawa Rough Riders versus this is SCATUEN Rough Riders.

[01:23:31] Really?

[01:23:31] They had the same team name.

[01:23:32] Yeah.

[01:23:32] And it was only like five teams in the league.

[01:23:35] Wow.

[01:23:36] That's pretty bad.

[01:23:37] So we got, we got score reels now.

[01:23:39] Yes.

[01:23:40] So this is the first game in the back.

[01:23:42] It has a window that's got like a million, you know,

[01:23:46] points that you can score.

[01:23:48] And it's got art in the back where the advertisements, you know,

[01:23:51] where you'd think the advertisements were or the images.

[01:23:53] And it's, it's particularly neat.

[01:23:55] So they rotate, right?

[01:23:57] They click and make dings and, and the numbers come up.

[01:23:59] So you know, when you usually put money in an EM and everybody can, can hear the,

[01:24:03] the reels all resetting, right?

[01:24:05] The click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, ding, right?

[01:24:08] That's the beginning of this.

[01:24:11] What does the flyer say?

[01:24:12] How are they promoting this wonderful new feature?

[01:24:14] I noticed it's, it's seven digits, but I wouldn't be surprised if three of them don't move at all.

[01:24:17] Oh, yeah.

[01:24:18] Totally.

[01:24:18] Look, look at a million supposed to be super fancy.

[01:24:21] First five ball with three D scoring.

[01:24:25] Wow.

[01:24:25] So that's what they call it.

[01:24:26] It's three D scoring.

[01:24:28] How cool is that?

[01:24:30] Big bold illuminated score indicator.

[01:24:33] Let's play or see his score at a glance.

[01:24:36] Okay.

[01:24:37] That's cool.

[01:24:38] It has three thumper bumpers.

[01:24:40] See, they didn't call him jets yet.

[01:24:42] Even Williams.

[01:24:43] Interesting.

[01:24:44] So I am, I am corrected.

[01:24:47] They weren't always jets, I guess.

[01:24:48] Yeah, kick out pockets, automatic rubber kickers, special rollovers, and they are called flippers at this point.

[01:24:55] Beautiful art on here.

[01:24:58] Very sort of post war, you know, fancy football guys, cheerleaders on there.

[01:25:06] You know, very, very, you know, American nostalgia on here, for sure.

[01:25:11] Post war green, very green.

[01:25:13] It's got the actual field at the grid.

[01:25:17] Yeah.

[01:25:17] Grid iron.

[01:25:18] Isn't that what they call that?

[01:25:19] Grid iron.

[01:25:19] That's what it's called.

[01:25:20] I only know that because there's like a movie.

[01:25:23] What was that?

[01:25:24] Who is in that?

[01:25:25] I have no idea.

[01:25:25] No.

[01:25:26] If you know who that what movie that was, grid iron, who was in that movie?

[01:25:31] Silver ball Chronicles, Gmail.com.

[01:25:33] Well, the first multiplayer game.

[01:25:35] Super jumbo 1954.

[01:25:38] So same year, this is D gotlib and company Wayne Nions, Roy Parker on art, and only sold 500 units.

[01:25:45] Ron, when you think pinball, you think multiplayer.

[01:25:49] You think plan with your friends in a bar, plan with your family at home or your buddies.

[01:25:54] You couldn't do that.

[01:25:55] Yeah, you couldn't do that yet until 1954.

[01:25:57] Dollar games.

[01:25:59] Super jumbo was the first production multiplayer EM, flipper pinball machine.

[01:26:04] And the first game from gotlib to use the score reels.

[01:26:07] Operators were not a big fan of this game, Ron, because it cost more.

[01:26:15] It was obviously expensive for all of those extra scoring units.

[01:26:20] And they were f**king heavy.

[01:26:22] Wayne Nions says distributors came in and looked at it.

[01:26:26] And of course, they all cried so much money and all that.

[01:26:28] We sold a few and then they kept crying about the money.

[01:26:31] So we went to two players.

[01:26:33] Four players seems like a great idea though, doesn't it, right?

[01:26:35] Like all the buddies hanging around playing the game.

[01:26:38] Well, Wayne Nions also says, my thought was if you could get four guys playing the game,

[01:26:42] one of them would win a free play.

[01:26:44] And if one of them won a free play, the other three couldn't walk away and leave without,

[01:26:49] you know, joining in.

[01:26:50] So they put more nickels in.

[01:26:52] He says, I met her the play on that game for a long period of time.

[01:26:55] And I found out the majority of the time one player played in the amount of time

[01:27:00] before we're playing was very, very small percentage of the time.

[01:27:03] I was shocked.

[01:27:04] That's crazy.

[01:27:05] So they're using data.

[01:27:06] He's, you know, Wayne Nions is using data to back this up.

[01:27:09] He had a hunch.

[01:27:10] You get four players.

[01:27:11] Four people are showing up.

[01:27:13] More money's going in there.

[01:27:14] They're bantering back and forth and harassing each other.

[01:27:18] Nope.

[01:27:18] Turns out it was just one person lonely playing by the same.

[01:27:21] Just in reality, it looks interesting.

[01:27:23] Isn't that cool?

[01:27:26] Well, what was another major innovation?

[01:27:28] When you think of pinball, what do you think?

[01:27:31] Oh, we got flippers.

[01:27:32] We got pop-upers.

[01:27:33] We got, we got real scoring.

[01:27:35] We got multiple players now.

[01:27:38] What do we, what do we have?

[01:27:40] A multi ball.

[01:27:41] Yeah, multiple balls.

[01:27:43] But I thought that was invented in like the 80s.

[01:27:46] No, no.

[01:27:48] I remember when I first started in this hobby.

[01:27:49] That's what I heard all the time.

[01:27:50] Firepower, the first game with multi ball.

[01:27:53] Yeah.

[01:27:54] Steve Richie invented multi ball.

[01:27:55] It's like, no, it's not.

[01:27:58] There's lots of games that multiple other than that before that one.

[01:28:01] Yeah, balls are popping.

[01:28:03] One of the most hilarious names for a pinball machine.

[01:28:07] I love this game.

[01:28:08] 1956, this is manufactured by Balli, manufacturing company,

[01:28:12] but there's no designer credit.

[01:28:14] And it's just to think Balli wasn't really doing a lot of pinballs in this era.

[01:28:17] They would, they would pick it up later.

[01:28:19] But in this era, this is one of their few games pinball machines they had.

[01:28:24] Yeah, at this time, they were kind of off-do in the novelty thing, right?

[01:28:27] Actually, I don't know what they're doing, but I know Centaur is based on this.

[01:28:31] The rules to Centaur pay homage to this game, which is basically you build up a count of,

[01:28:37] in this game, it's called the, I think, wild ball count.

[01:28:39] You build up a wild ball count and then you hit a saucer in the center of the game.

[01:28:45] All the balls come out.

[01:28:47] And I mean, all the balls come out.

[01:28:49] This, this sells 750 units.

[01:28:52] That doesn't seem very good at all.

[01:28:54] It didn't make many of them.

[01:28:55] It was probably expensive.

[01:28:56] It's a wide body.

[01:28:58] And it had another variant too.

[01:29:00] There was two of these that Balli did.

[01:29:02] It balls up pop in and then there's the second one, like the same year.

[01:29:05] I can't remember the name.

[01:29:06] I'd say balls up pop is the first one.

[01:29:07] We got a preface it.

[01:29:09] There's an early, flipperless, electro mechanical pinball machine that features

[01:29:15] multi-ball.

[01:29:16] It was manufactured by Dudley Clark Coase company in 1934 called live power or live power.

[01:29:24] Or live power.

[01:29:26] So here's the, here's the flyer.

[01:29:27] Get your novelty spots back on a money making basis with balls up popping.

[01:29:33] The new type of novelty game by Balli.

[01:29:36] It has six ball multiple.

[01:29:38] It's like they went all out.

[01:29:40] We're not just doing two balls.

[01:29:42] We're doing it.

[01:29:42] It's, it's amazing.

[01:29:45] It has the balls come out.

[01:29:46] The balls come out from the left side.

[01:29:49] Like when you hit it in the saucer, it'll just start firing balls out from the left side.

[01:29:52] And just to see a game this old, but that many balls go on at the same time is, is something.

[01:29:58] It's like an auto plunger on the left side.

[01:30:00] It literally is an auto plunger.

[01:30:01] It fires them out by itself.

[01:30:03] You don't do it.

[01:30:04] It's a wide body for that reason.

[01:30:05] They had to fit everything in there.

[01:30:07] And it's a two player game.

[01:30:09] Yeah.

[01:30:09] But it's, they just didn't sell a lot, which I find really like kind of a bummer.

[01:30:14] It doesn't have the real scoring either.

[01:30:16] It's all just back box lighting.

[01:30:17] Yeah.

[01:30:18] So they're trying to find other ways to maybe save, you know, build a material.

[01:30:22] So instead of the, you know, the rotating mechanisms in the back box, they went back to the lights.

[01:30:26] Now in 1963, Williams beat the clock was the first multi ball machine to have a ball lock mechanism,

[01:30:34] which is a little bit more like multi ball as we know it today.

[01:30:38] My favorite innovation.

[01:30:41] In my opinion, you can't really have pinball without pop bumper.

[01:30:44] Can't really have pinball without multi ball.

[01:30:46] You can't have pinball without drop target, Spron.

[01:30:50] Hmm.

[01:30:51] Williams Vagabond.

[01:30:53] Vagabond 1962.

[01:30:56] This is Williams manufacturing company.

[01:30:59] Steve Cordica on design.

[01:31:00] It sells 600 units.

[01:31:04] Not really great.

[01:31:06] It's kind of a bummer.

[01:31:07] Well, as well as deals are, it's the first to have a drop target as we know drop targets.

[01:31:12] See if they advertise.

[01:31:13] They do.

[01:31:14] And they call it a drop target in the flyer drop target.

[01:31:19] Incorporated for the first time in Williams Vagabond.

[01:31:23] How about this cool art?

[01:31:24] It's like a, it's like a, like a, like a dude on a cart.

[01:31:29] Interesting.

[01:31:30] They have now, they are now calling them jet bumpers.

[01:31:33] So some point Williams decided, thumper bumper, not what we want.

[01:31:37] We want jet bumpers now.

[01:31:39] Yeah.

[01:31:39] Because jets were fancy in the post war world.

[01:31:42] So now we're up here into the 1960s, right?

[01:31:45] So.

[01:31:46] Okay.

[01:31:47] So Vagabond was the first pinball machine to have a drop target.

[01:31:50] The familiar type that we would know today where the ball would strike the target

[01:31:56] and the target that the ball would hit would fall below the play field.

[01:32:01] Now, in 1951, there's a game called minstrelman sells 1800 units.

[01:32:07] This is designed by Harry Mab's.

[01:32:10] And it would actually have a target, which you would hit.

[01:32:15] Then behind that stand up target, a target would drop.

[01:32:20] So it's not quite a drop target, although it is a target that you would hit also a game with black face.

[01:32:27] Yikes.

[01:32:28] What about this one, Ron?

[01:32:29] This would be my favorite innovation.

[01:32:31] This is your innovation, right?

[01:32:33] Well, they're then flippers.

[01:32:33] Oh, well, yeah, that goes without saying.

[01:32:36] Hey, pinheads.

[01:32:37] I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not making cheesy jokes to make Ron laugh,

[01:33:45] The first spinner or spinning target game was swing along from 1963.

[01:33:52] I think it's funny that from D Gottlieb and company Wayne Nions design art by Roy Parker.

[01:33:59] It's I think it's funny because at one point Gottlieb had some of the worst spinners when they had their plastic spinners.

[01:34:05] Yeah.

[01:34:05] And Williams has to game with the first drop target yet Gottlieb was like the kings of the drop target had the best drop target.

[01:34:11] So just because you invented doesn't mean you're the best at it.

[01:34:15] Yeah.

[01:34:15] Canadians very much remember Blackberry, right?

[01:34:18] We were all oh my god.

[01:34:19] We invented the smartphone.

[01:34:20] Canadians invented the smartphone.

[01:34:21] And then it just went off a cliff.

[01:34:24] It's not who invents it.

[01:34:25] It's who perfects it.

[01:34:26] Exactly.

[01:34:27] Now this sells 4,710 units in 1963.

[01:34:32] That's a lot of units considering that some of these other previous innovation games are like six, 700 units.

[01:34:39] So what does the flyer say to promote this new feature?

[01:34:42] I love this one.

[01:34:43] Love it.

[01:34:43] I love because because the marketing's got to promote this brand new thing.

[01:34:47] What do they say?

[01:34:48] Man, it's not.

[01:34:50] It's it should have been bigger.

[01:34:52] It's not a big thing.

[01:34:53] It's not a huge thing.

[01:34:54] They did take a picture of it to show it novel swinging targets give a brand new high five

[01:35:01] sound to scoring.

[01:35:03] So they're advertising it more like the clicking.

[01:35:06] It's going to make when you hit it than the actual spinning target itself.

[01:35:10] There's something about spinners, Ron.

[01:35:12] And you know it when you hit it and you see the thing flip and it's ding in the points,

[01:35:16] especially in the EM.

[01:35:18] It's like, oh, it's so good.

[01:35:20] This is the best.

[01:35:20] You know, this game has a double size cash box.

[01:35:23] I guess to get all those earnings big time to play a game.

[01:35:28] It's like a it's like a dance hall theme, right?

[01:35:32] It's like a lady in a dress kind of kind of dancing.

[01:35:36] Mm hmm.

[01:35:37] Do do do do.

[01:35:38] But look at this down here on the bottom left.

[01:35:40] New hard coat finish extends playboard life to an all time high.

[01:35:44] Oh, diamond coat.

[01:35:46] Yeah, no, it's probably just lacquer, but it also has a diamond on it.

[01:35:50] And that's true.

[01:35:51] It actually has a diamond on it.

[01:35:54] Look at that.

[01:35:54] Hey.

[01:35:55] Wow.

[01:35:56] See again, you thought diamond coat was invented by Williams?

[01:36:00] No, it was invented in their 60s by Gottlieb.

[01:36:02] They just didn't call it that.

[01:36:04] Yeah.

[01:36:04] They had a diamond literally.

[01:36:06] It shows a diamond on it's it.

[01:36:08] This is a really neat machine, not because of the theme or what it is,

[01:36:13] but the marketing in general, the invention of the spinning target.

[01:36:18] So it's got a drum on one side, a saxophone on the other.

[01:36:21] No, no, they're no, they're all different.

[01:36:23] It's got multiple, multiple spinners and they're different.

[01:36:25] Instruments, a trumpet, a drum and a saxophone.

[01:36:28] There's so there's these three targets in the middle as they rotate.

[01:36:32] Then you go up into the pop bumpers above them.

[01:36:34] As we look at this, we're getting more and more like pinball as we kind of know it today.

[01:36:39] Like the flippers are in the usual spot.

[01:36:42] I mean, we don't have in lanes.

[01:36:43] We just have out lanes.

[01:36:45] Yeah.

[01:36:45] We have spinners.

[01:36:46] We got bumpers.

[01:36:48] We got targets.

[01:36:49] You know, by the 1960s, we're kind of we figured we're perfecting it here, right?

[01:36:54] It's coming together by the 1970s.

[01:36:56] We invent the solid state pinball machine and Valley was the first one out of the gate

[01:37:02] with a solid state prototype pinball machine in 1974, bow and arrow.

[01:37:07] Also one prototype of flicker and one prototype of boomerang from Valley, Doug McDonald's.

[01:37:14] He was the Valley engineer in the 1970s and he did a lot of work on the boards and the design of the solid state thing.

[01:37:22] In fact, his initials, D and B are etched into all of those original solid state machines.

[01:37:30] If you look on them, it's printed on there.

[01:37:32] Valley was actually beat to the punch by the first actual solid state pinball machine.

[01:37:39] It was like micro something or other.

[01:37:42] Yeah.

[01:37:42] So it's spirit of 76, not the spirit of 76 from Gottlieb.

[01:37:48] This is totally different one.

[01:37:49] And it is by micro games incorporated from Phoenix, Arizona, the pinball capital of the world.

[01:37:57] And I've got a link of this in the show note.

[01:37:59] It was the first micro processor based pinball table.

[01:38:03] It was from July the 4th, 1975.

[01:38:08] It's probably why it was called the spirit of 76.

[01:38:11] Yeah, because it's getting ready for the next year and it's July the 4th, which is, you know, your

[01:38:15] America birthday, right?

[01:38:16] Yeah, it is.

[01:38:17] It's a very, very America pinball machine.

[01:38:20] This one, the play field is very unattractive.

[01:38:24] It looks terrible.

[01:38:26] And it's probably why so few were actually sold.

[01:38:29] So what you're saying is they had the right idea technology wise, but the, not the play

[01:38:34] field might out of in the best.

[01:38:35] Yeah, they're just just in general, small company, middle of nowhere, didn't get the units

[01:38:40] out. They didn't quite get it right.

[01:38:43] But we're going to we're giving them their due here now, right?

[01:38:47] So it was debuted, it had debuted 1975.

[01:38:51] The music operators of America exposition, MOA held in Chicago on October 17th and

[01:38:57] 19th of 1975.

[01:38:59] Remember, it's not who advanced it.

[01:39:01] It's superfix it.

[01:39:02] So it was October of 76 when Bali launched Fireball, which sold 10,000 units.

[01:39:08] And it was their first non commercial home model game.

[01:39:12] So it wasn't actually a, it wasn't the 1970, what is one or two fireball?

[01:39:16] This was the whole model.

[01:39:18] So they're, so they're waiting in kind of on the home model thing.

[01:39:21] They also made an evil, con evil, Captain Fantastic and a galaxy, Ranger home model.

[01:39:26] So it was like the kind of test in the waters of, of this before they went whole

[01:39:30] hall into production.

[01:39:31] And then they tried to, to trademark it patented.

[01:39:34] So no one else could use it.

[01:39:35] Meaning no one else could make a solid state game, except them didn't work.

[01:39:41] No, that went to court.

[01:39:42] And the judge said, no, that would have been interesting.

[01:39:46] If they, if they had gotten, if they'd won that case, because then everyone

[01:39:51] would have had to have used their system.

[01:39:54] If they wanted to make solid state games, or had to pay them a cut, could you imagine?

[01:39:58] Yeah.

[01:39:58] That would be terrible.

[01:39:59] Well, that's what Stern electronics did.

[01:40:01] But that was, that was another story.

[01:40:02] That was a whole other thing.

[01:40:04] You can check that out in our Stern electronics episode back in the archives.

[01:40:08] You can check that out on your pod catcher or at silverballcronacles.com.

[01:40:12] If you want to check out the archive, it wasn't until December of 77, where the

[01:40:16] actual first commercial pinball machine was released.

[01:40:19] It was 1500 units of ballies freedom, which is a previous EM design.

[01:40:25] So they were very careful not to really screw anything up.

[01:40:29] The first major production, the first game that had like a lot of units that made

[01:40:34] was Knight Rider, which was by ballet.

[01:40:37] And it was a trucking theme with orbit spinners.

[01:40:40] I think I need to could never understand is the original freedom.

[01:40:43] Their first production one they did.

[01:40:46] It does the Stern thing where if you tilt before any switches are activated,

[01:40:50] it doesn't count as a tilt.

[01:40:51] So you can't do tilt-throughs.

[01:40:53] Yeah, which is cool.

[01:40:54] And they only did it in that game.

[01:40:57] That was it.

[01:40:58] I have no idea.

[01:40:59] I remember you mentioned that previously.

[01:41:01] I'm like, that's a really good idea.

[01:41:02] If anyone listening knows, I would love to, I would love to hear from an engineer.

[01:41:07] Why they capacity on the chips or something?

[01:41:10] It's not. It's literally just code.

[01:41:13] Like the first switch can't be the first switch activated can't be tilt.

[01:41:17] That's all they wanted it to tilt through.

[01:41:19] Because then you screw your buddy over to get more.

[01:41:20] I guess so.

[01:41:21] Maybe that's it.

[01:41:22] So that had 7,000 units that were sold, which is a big deal.

[01:41:27] That was followed up by evil,

[01:41:28] con evil with sold 14,000 units.

[01:41:31] Then you've got 1977 in February.

[01:41:34] They released eight ball, which is the highest seller until Adam's family

[01:41:39] with 20,230.

[01:41:41] Oh, that was in June.

[01:41:43] And this is all in our, we had a solid state episode.

[01:41:46] Didn't know. Yeah.

[01:41:47] Yeah. It's in that one.

[01:41:49] Yeah. Back in, I think God leaves system one episode.

[01:41:51] We go, we go in a really in depth of all of this stuff, which is kind of why we're glazing over it now.

[01:41:56] What about, what about the next thing?

[01:41:58] Continuous background sound or digital sound.

[01:42:03] The first game is flash 1978 from Williams,

[01:42:07] electronics incorporated designed by Steve Richie, art by Constantino and Jeanine Mitchell,

[01:42:13] programming by Randy Fyfer.

[01:42:15] It sold 19,000 505 tonne and other huge seller.

[01:42:19] Yeah. And it's one of those confusing ones that says 1978, all the playfields say 1978.

[01:42:24] But I think it started coming out the beginning of 79.

[01:42:26] Now this flash is one of the original games where I played when I kind of got into pinball.

[01:42:31] I'm like, oh, this is a cool game.

[01:42:33] Very, very cool game.

[01:42:34] We go into great details of flash in our pilot episode, by the way, that episode kind of rough.

[01:42:40] It's not that greatest, but check that out in the archives as well.

[01:42:43] What does Steve Richie say about background sound? Who invented background sound?

[01:42:48] Well, Steve says he did. That was humble.

[01:42:51] I invented background sound at Atari, but management wouldn't have it.

[01:42:54] So I asked Randy Fyfer to create a continuously cycling, complex sound that I creased in pitch and speed of cycling.

[01:43:01] And he did both.

[01:43:02] That changing background added attention and excitement that was never present in earlier games.

[01:43:06] That sound also broadcasted how well the player was doing.

[01:43:09] If you heard the only game that made a background sound in an arcade at a high pitch and a fast cycle,

[01:43:14] all eyes were on you, sometimes gathering a small crowd in those days.

[01:43:18] Very cool, right? We're getting into it something there.

[01:43:22] Well, then the next major intervention, where are we going to now, Ron?

[01:43:25] Well, the game's got to start talking, don't they?

[01:43:27] Yes.

[01:43:28] What's the first talking game?

[01:43:30] Everybody knows this.

[01:43:31] Gore Gar, 1979 from Williams, designed by Barry Ausler, art by Constantino Mitchell,

[01:43:40] probably the maybe the best artwork of any Williams game of that era.

[01:43:45] The sound is by Eugene Jarvis.

[01:43:47] He's the genius.

[01:43:48] He is the genius.

[01:43:49] They would use his sound set for the next four or five years at Williams on their games.

[01:43:54] And it's all 14,000 units.

[01:43:57] Do you remember?

[01:43:57] That's a lot.

[01:43:58] And it only said seven words.

[01:43:59] Do you know what they are?

[01:44:01] Gore Gar.

[01:44:02] No, that's one word.

[01:44:03] Is it?

[01:44:04] Yes.

[01:44:04] Gore Gar.

[01:44:05] Okay, Gore Gar.

[01:44:07] Eat.

[01:44:08] You.

[01:44:10] Me.

[01:44:10] There's no eat.

[01:44:12] He doesn't eat anyone.

[01:44:13] Let's see if I get right.

[01:44:14] It's Gore Gar speaks.

[01:44:17] Me got you.

[01:44:19] Oh, God.

[01:44:20] Yeah.

[01:44:20] Hurt.

[01:44:22] It says me hurt.

[01:44:24] And whatever the seventh one is, I fail.

[01:44:27] There you go.

[01:44:28] There you go.

[01:44:29] Eugene did all the effects, but not the programming.

[01:44:32] The programming itself was done by Paul DeSau or DeSalt.

[01:44:36] I guess if you want to say it that way.

[01:44:39] Steve was actually waiting to finish the fire power layout because the other programmers

[01:44:45] wouldn't work with Steve.

[01:44:46] Yeah, he was waiting for Eugene.

[01:44:47] That's why.

[01:44:48] Yeah.

[01:44:49] So that would sort of be why it got stuck on on Gore Gar ahead of the time.

[01:44:54] One of my favorite quotes ever is from Barry Houselor.

[01:44:57] He says that the AMOA show, it was so loud that Sam Stern came over to tell us to turn it down

[01:45:03] because no one could hear his games back in November of 78.

[01:45:06] Can you imagine like angry Sam Stern coming over your whipper snappers turn that down.

[01:45:12] Nobody can hear my pinball machines.

[01:45:14] No, but I can think about it in November of 79 because that's what happened.

[01:45:17] Whatever.

[01:45:18] Ah, come on.

[01:45:19] It's history.

[01:45:20] You got to get the years right, man.

[01:45:22] It's a brief history of pinball.

[01:45:23] It's not the definitive.

[01:45:24] He knows what Sam Stern should have done.

[01:45:25] He should have just cranked meteor up to full volume.

[01:45:28] Oh, he got that background sound.

[01:45:31] That would have been louder than the speech from Gore Gar.

[01:45:33] It totally, totally would have been.

[01:45:35] It would have been awesome.

[01:45:36] What do you want to say?

[01:45:37] Like the next big thing is dot matrix DMDs?

[01:45:40] Yeah, I guess.

[01:45:40] Well, we could have said Alphanumeric displays.

[01:45:43] And then we have to talk about Aftor because it's the first time it let you put your initials

[01:45:47] into a game as a high score.

[01:45:50] You couldn't do that before.

[01:45:51] You can't do that without letters.

[01:45:53] Yeah, before it was just numbers.

[01:45:55] Numbers.

[01:45:56] And I think Aftor was one of the for I'm sure someone will say there's one earlier,

[01:46:00] but Aftor was in 84, 83, 84.

[01:46:05] Yeah.

[01:46:05] Aftor is not by a popular manufacturer.

[01:46:10] Well, no, they are popular.

[01:46:11] WICO, they were popular for parts.

[01:46:15] They made tons of replacement parts for years and years and years.

[01:46:18] But this was their one game.

[01:46:19] WICO, it's got a metal back box.

[01:46:22] It's very interesting, but it has Alphanumeric's display.

[01:46:25] But then someone will say, well,

[01:46:27] Valley experimented with it, which they did with eight ball deluxe.

[01:46:30] They had like 10 prototypes that used Alphanumeric displays,

[01:46:34] which I've seen.

[01:46:35] I've seen two of them.

[01:46:36] Doesn't count.

[01:46:37] Wasn't production.

[01:46:37] The only thing they really did with them though is they just say, play eight ball deluxe or something.

[01:46:44] Go play eight ball deluxe.

[01:46:46] Like good use.

[01:46:47] Gorgar hurt.

[01:46:49] It counts as talk.

[01:46:51] I guess even beat me.

[01:46:53] Oh, B, B might beat might be the one I forgot.

[01:46:56] Yeah.

[01:46:57] Yeah.

[01:46:57] There you go.

[01:46:57] Me got you.

[01:46:59] So checkpoint was the first DMD game back in February of 1991 by data east.

[01:47:07] Yeah.

[01:47:07] They beat everyone else.

[01:47:08] They got the small little guy.

[01:47:10] The big, innovative, always amazing data east pinball.

[01:47:14] The designer of this game was Joe Kamenkau, art by Paul Ferris.

[01:47:17] The programming was Reeman Merchant and sells 3,500 units.

[01:47:24] I hesitate to say this is actually the first DMD machine, even though it is unquestionably is,

[01:47:31] but the DMD was very small and they basically just did Alphanumeric stuff on it.

[01:47:36] They didn't go and push the envelope and really chill.

[01:47:39] It's still a DMD.

[01:47:40] Yes.

[01:47:40] I know.

[01:47:41] I totally agree.

[01:47:42] But it's a bit of an, a bit of an aspect.

[01:47:44] Well, Joe Kamenkau told the internet pinball database that the previous game,

[01:47:49] the data east, the Simpsons, was to be their first game to have a DMD.

[01:47:54] However, president and CEO Joe Keenan worried that development of the DMD might not be

[01:47:58] ready in time for that game.

[01:48:00] And problems occurring had they rushed it into production,

[01:48:03] could put the company out of business.

[01:48:05] Yeah.

[01:48:05] So they wanted to be very careful with the Simpsons license that they probably,

[01:48:09] with the Simpsons license.

[01:48:10] They paid a good penny for.

[01:48:11] Yes.

[01:48:12] Yeah, you don't screw that on.

[01:48:13] And this was 1990 Simpsons.

[01:48:14] They were the hottest thing.

[01:48:16] It's been around so long now, people don't realize when that came out.

[01:48:19] 1990, that was the hottest stuff out there.

[01:48:22] Now the first large size DMD was in May of 1991, shortly there,

[01:48:29] absolutely normal size.

[01:48:30] What were you used to?

[01:48:31] Yeah.

[01:48:32] What you would expect.

[01:48:33] And that was in midway manufacturing or as it was actually part of those Williams,

[01:48:37] like the MMS.

[01:48:37] Yeah.

[01:48:38] It was designed by word, Pemberton and Dan Langloy.

[01:48:41] What game?

[01:48:42] Where did you see?

[01:48:43] Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:48:44] Gilligan's Island.

[01:48:45] Gilligan's Island.

[01:48:46] Yes, folks.

[01:48:47] That was the first one actually released.

[01:48:49] Yep.

[01:48:49] Mike Boone, Dan Lee sells 4,100 units somehow.

[01:48:54] Hey, it's a good play field.

[01:48:55] I still think that's a good play field with a cool toy.

[01:48:57] Was the first DMD dot matrix display,

[01:48:59] rich done by Williams, Balli midway?

[01:49:03] When most people think DMD, they think Terminator 2 judgment day, right?

[01:49:07] By Steve Rich.

[01:49:07] They always think that's the first and they're partially right.

[01:49:10] It was the first game designed to use the DMD, but the production,

[01:49:13] the design cycle was much longer.

[01:49:16] Yeah.

[01:49:16] It was the standard sort of dot matrix display that we would expect,

[01:49:20] which was what, like, four inches by six inches or something.

[01:49:23] It was the dimensions they always give, like, 128 by whatever the pixels.

[01:49:26] I can't remember what it is.

[01:49:28] It was also the first game to feature a video motion.

[01:49:31] That's very demo.

[01:49:32] Yeah.

[01:49:32] They're pushing the DMD,

[01:49:35] you know, dots of having images and pictures and things,

[01:49:38] not just sort of information or letters or something more to it,

[01:49:43] which is again, why I sort of asterix the checkpoint one,

[01:49:46] because there's no dot art in that until they change to the larger DMD at daddy East.

[01:49:55] And then we had the super DMDs, the big one said, uh, at Sega.

[01:50:00] Yeah, Sega used.

[01:50:02] So it's like hook.

[01:50:03] I think hook head one of the, I'm not hooked.

[01:50:04] No hook, uh, Baywatch, uh, Maverick.

[01:50:07] Maverick.

[01:50:08] I think Maverick was the first one.

[01:50:10] Yeah.

[01:50:11] Now the next sort of huge leap in pinball, pinball 2000 attack from Mars.

[01:50:17] No, revenge from Mars.

[01:50:19] I'm sorry, revenge from Mars where the projection screen goes down onto the glass.

[01:50:24] You got images on the back designed in 1999 by midway manufacturing.

[01:50:29] Or is it part of the apparent company WMS designed by George Gomez,

[01:50:34] the art and animation was done by Adam Rines, Scott Shlomany, Jack Linden,

[01:50:39] a Lydon, uh, Scott Sanders and Dave, Dave Muller,

[01:50:43] programming by Lyman Sheets, Dwight Sullivan, Graham West and Keith P. Johnson,

[01:50:47] sell 6,878 units.

[01:50:50] We did a whole pinball 2000 episode, but the reason I put that in here is because

[01:50:54] that is a, you know, a big sort of watershed moment, even though it basically

[01:50:57] killed Williams.

[01:50:59] And they didn't really pursue it.

[01:51:00] So in 2021, the pinball network had the pinball industry awards.

[01:51:08] And one of the machines that we put into the pinball machine hall of fame is

[01:51:13] voted by the public was wizard of Oz by Jersey Jack pinball.

[01:51:19] In April of 2013, Jersey Jack pinball incorporated, launched probably one of

[01:51:26] the biggest leap forwards in pinball, not a fairly gameplay.

[01:51:31] But when it comes to the wow factor and design changes, wizard of Oz is a

[01:51:36] watershed pinball machine because it has an LCD, a huge LCD screen.

[01:51:42] And the thing is this might be the longest period between innovations when you

[01:51:47] think about it.

[01:51:48] Yeah, things are getting further.

[01:51:49] How long were they using, they were using DMDs from 1991 to here?

[01:51:55] That's 20 to 22 years to put a LCD screen in there to change the DMD at all.

[01:52:00] Crazy.

[01:52:02] This is also the first pinball machine to feature RGB color changing LED

[01:52:07] inserts, which was a huge wow factor.

[01:52:11] Yep.

[01:52:11] And an almost bankrupted the company almost bankrupted the company because it

[01:52:16] sold for what was it originally 6,500, which was way more than anything else

[01:52:21] would have cost at the time.

[01:52:22] But it was still probably underpriced for what they put into it because they had

[01:52:27] to develop everything completely new board set, new everything.

[01:52:32] But it is quite impressive when you look at it.

[01:52:33] What was it like when you first saw wizard of Oz?

[01:52:37] It was what I thought it would be because Jack, when are you just kept saying how

[01:52:41] they were this this was going to be this is for high high end pinball machine.

[01:52:45] That's going to have tons of crap in it.

[01:52:47] I mean, you said that for the earliest part.

[01:52:49] So when you look at this thing, one play field, nah, we got three of them.

[01:52:52] We got three play fields in this thing play field and it's too many play fields

[01:52:56] on top. We got RGB lighting.

[01:52:57] We got a huge LCD screen.

[01:52:59] Don't forget the crystal ball, little holographic stuff in there.

[01:53:02] Yes.

[01:53:03] With the LCD screen under it that projects into the ball that looks like there's

[01:53:06] something in the ball, the crazy pop bumper below everything, which I believe

[01:53:11] that was a Dennis Nordman contribution.

[01:53:14] Yeah.

[01:53:14] And then my favorite part of it, honestly, is the rotating house hitting the

[01:53:18] loop shot because I love loop shots.

[01:53:20] So you start looping it in the whole house, start spinning around.

[01:53:23] It's, it's a wonderful, wonderful machine.

[01:53:25] We'll do a deep dive into Wizard of Oz when we do our Jersey Jack episode.

[01:53:29] I'm just waiting for Jersey Jack to release more pinball machines so I can

[01:53:32] pad that out a little more.

[01:53:34] That is true.

[01:53:34] There's only so long we could talk about each game.

[01:53:37] Right.

[01:53:37] There's, I can't fill like 45 minutes with the Jersey Jack episode.

[01:53:41] So I got to come up with some unique way to talk about that.

[01:53:43] But this watershed moment of the Wizard of Oz has led us to what would

[01:53:47] eventually be Stern's Batman 66 with their first LCD screen.

[01:53:52] Now the first actual production LCD screen at Stern was a arrow Smith.

[01:53:59] So there's a lot of really crazy innovation that changed with Jersey Jack.

[01:54:03] And they should, you got to tip your hat.

[01:54:05] I would say, you know, I say it's not who invented it, who perfected it.

[01:54:08] You could argue they perfected it too because they certainly did.

[01:54:11] When you look at Jean Paul to win, yeah, Jean Paul to win.

[01:54:14] He wins the award for best animations like every year for whatever Jersey

[01:54:19] Jack Jack game is out every year.

[01:54:21] Yep.

[01:54:21] It's like zombie Eddie on ours every year.

[01:54:24] Big.

[01:54:24] I actually prefer the smaller one that Stern uses just because I like, you're like

[01:54:28] more art.

[01:54:29] I like the art.

[01:54:29] I like the translate the back class.

[01:54:31] I totally agree.

[01:54:32] I totally agree.

[01:54:33] Well, Ron, that was a brief history of pinball.

[01:54:38] Well, let me ask you a question.

[01:54:39] What do you think the next innovation is going to be?

[01:54:41] Oh, man.

[01:54:43] Well, I mean, online connectivity is probably where in the middle of that right

[01:54:47] now.

[01:54:47] So you've got squirbit who is an independent contractor who's working with

[01:54:51] Jersey Jack and some of the other more independent firms.

[01:54:54] You've got Stern with their insider connected with online connectivity.

[01:54:58] I mean, yes, granted, we're quite a few years late when it comes to online

[01:55:01] connectivity.

[01:55:02] I mean, we talking like DLC to downloadable content.

[01:55:06] So that the next innovation, is there any, is there any more innovations for

[01:55:09] the play field?

[01:55:10] Is there any more?

[01:55:10] I mean, we're going to smoke machines in them.

[01:55:12] Are we going to, I mean, what's, what's next there?

[01:55:15] I hear people all the time say there's only so much you could do.

[01:55:17] In the play field, I mean, have we come up with loading pinball?

[01:55:20] That was a big thing.

[01:55:21] Yeah.

[01:55:21] Have we come up with every possible thing you can put on there?

[01:55:24] I don't think so.

[01:55:25] Oh, I agree.

[01:55:26] The thing is it's got to be cheap enough to be mass produced and not like

[01:55:29] bankrupt the company.

[01:55:30] It comes up with the idea.

[01:55:31] Yeah, which is, which is I think why online connectivity is taking so long to

[01:55:35] come along.

[01:55:36] The price for that.

[01:55:39] I mean, do you want like surface mounted LED boards, right?

[01:55:42] I mean, maybe that was a big innovation we didn't talk about.

[01:55:45] I mean, I mean, you could go through each manufacturer's board set and the

[01:55:50] history of that and, you know, that sounds terrible.

[01:55:55] For the average person for a techie would love that, but things like the

[01:55:58] current systems they're on, like Stern has spike.

[01:56:02] Well, spike two, I'm sorry, at their currently on.

[01:56:06] And they're always in it.

[01:56:07] They're innovating in ways you don't see.

[01:56:10] Let's put it that way.

[01:56:11] Very neat.

[01:56:13] I mean, code nowadays, the innovation in code, the complexity of code,

[01:56:18] you know, toppers now with LCD screens in them, like the Mandalorian

[01:56:22] topper, which I think is just something else.

[01:56:25] Makes me want to buy a Mandalorian way better light shows.

[01:56:28] Way better light shows.

[01:56:31] Pinball innovation is still going along.

[01:56:34] And I guess if we sat down, you know, 10 years from now and if pinball is

[01:56:37] still around, we could probably come up with another really cool, you know,

[01:56:40] couple of additions, at least one thing.

[01:56:43] I mean, it took LCDs forever to come around.

[01:56:46] That's the longest one.

[01:56:47] That's kind of crazy.

[01:56:48] It took that long.

[01:56:50] Absolutely nuts.

[01:56:51] What was, what do you, so you thought you think spinners are your favorite one of

[01:56:54] the episode here?

[01:56:56] Well, forgiving flippers.

[01:56:57] I mean, you got to have flippers.

[01:56:59] Flippers is number one.

[01:57:00] What about flippers?

[01:57:01] And I don't mind playing the early, like the prewar stuff, where,

[01:57:06] because you can nudge this stuff into pockets and stuff, there is some,

[01:57:09] believe it or not, level of skill involved, as long as there's actually a tilt out

[01:57:13] there of trying to nudge thing where you want it to go without tilting.

[01:57:17] That is a skill.

[01:57:18] And how far back you plunge on a lot of these things, like which pockets you

[01:57:22] want to get into and stuff.

[01:57:24] But I mean, obviously once the flippers come in, that changes everything.

[01:57:28] So my favorite thing after that would have to be spinners.

[01:57:31] I just love spinners.

[01:57:32] Absolutely.

[01:57:33] I mean, we didn't talk about ramps.

[01:57:34] I mean, I guess we could have talked about ramps.

[01:57:36] Yeah, first games, whether I just, and a lot of those,

[01:57:39] like people think, well, the first game of the ramp was like firepower,

[01:57:42] two was it like, you know, like no, it was probably some game aid in the 40s.

[01:57:47] That had a ramp guaranteed.

[01:57:48] It was probably game in the 30s.

[01:57:49] It had a ramp over on patreon.com.

[01:57:53] Scott E said that he would love to hear about very targets.

[01:57:58] Where was it's first appearance?

[01:57:59] And who invented that?

[01:58:00] Well, you know, what I did a bunch of research trying to find information on

[01:58:04] very targets.

[01:58:06] Couldn't find anything really.

[01:58:08] And I love very targets.

[01:58:09] Very targets are pretty great.

[01:58:10] I believe Gottlieb did patent that too.

[01:58:13] Yeah, but I don't have a, I don't know who invented it.

[01:58:15] I don't know any of that information.

[01:58:17] So sorry there are Scott E patreon.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[01:58:21] I don't have that information.

[01:58:23] That also said, we, you know, we haven't seen a very target for, you know, a while.

[01:58:29] Last one I saw was on, what was it called?

[01:58:33] Is it monopoly?

[01:58:34] No, not monopoly.

[01:58:35] No, you're right designer.

[01:58:37] His other one after that.

[01:58:39] Ripley's Ripley's.

[01:58:41] Yeah.

[01:58:41] Yeah.

[01:58:42] Which would tell me the patent ran out because started.

[01:58:44] So I mean, I didn't, I didn't go again.

[01:58:46] The other one was roto targets.

[01:58:48] I didn't really find any info on roto targets either.

[01:58:51] Right.

[01:58:52] And I mean, nobody's used a roto targets since like the 60s.

[01:58:55] It's which was kind of cool.

[01:58:56] But I mean, we can't go through everything.

[01:58:58] What I did is we went through.

[01:58:59] I made sure we chose all of the big sort of high points and where I could get

[01:59:02] some primary sources.

[01:59:04] The coolest thing I think we found was the Bell story, the tilt story from directly

[01:59:08] from the mouth of Harry Williams.

[01:59:09] Very, very cool.

[01:59:11] I'm trying to think of it out of all those ones that we didn't talk about or ones

[01:59:15] that were used in an era and not really haven't been used in years.

[01:59:19] Would you like to see any of them return like a roto target?

[01:59:21] Yeah.

[01:59:22] I'd love to see a very target.

[01:59:24] I really would speak easy.

[01:59:26] It's got the, the, the flaps flip up targets.

[01:59:28] Yeah.

[01:59:29] Like something like that.

[01:59:30] It's like a reverse drop target.

[01:59:31] Yeah.

[01:59:33] I don't know.

[01:59:33] Just try, there's stuff you could bring back.

[01:59:36] You could just, we didn't talk about multi-morphic and whatever they're doing.

[01:59:38] Mm-hmm.

[01:59:39] Right.

[01:59:40] I mean, that's kind of innovative.

[01:59:41] It's not for me.

[01:59:42] That's 100% innovative.

[01:59:43] They basically track the ball so they can tell where the ball is at all times and have

[01:59:46] the screen that it's rolling on react to it.

[01:59:49] And they also have some innovations with things like stuck balls.

[01:59:53] If you open the coin, the guy's showing up like,

[01:59:54] it remembers state and things like that.

[01:59:58] Like game state where you could just pause games and then come back later.

[02:00:02] Stuff like that.

[02:00:02] Super cool.

[02:00:03] That was just a brief history of pinball.

[02:00:06] It wasn't the definitive pinball history podcast,

[02:00:09] but it was a brief history.

[02:00:10] We went all the way from lawn games to today's LCD connected online machines.

[02:00:18] Thank you, New Jersey and Cincinnati, Ohio.

[02:01:50] Background sound at a Tory, but management at Tory.

[02:01:53] I got to try to get.

[02:01:56] Why was Harry Williams such a big deal, Ron?

[02:01:59] Just make up some stuff.

[02:02:01] Not, not just.

[02:02:05] 1956 Williams electronic manufacturing corporation.

[02:02:09] So the name has changed.

[02:02:10] That's not right.

[02:02:12] Really?

[02:02:12] There's no way.

[02:02:13] Well, while the popping is a ballet game, I am almost positive.

[02:02:17] Oh, it is.

[02:02:17] Yes.

[02:02:19] And I don't think it's Steve Cordec either.

[02:02:20] No, that's a copy paste thing.

[02:02:22] That's what that was.

[02:02:22] That's a copy.

[02:02:23] That's a copy.

[02:02:23] Pasteur saved you saved you some pain.

[02:02:28] I notice your little calculator there only goes back to 1914.

[02:02:32] Does that mean there was no money before?

[02:02:34] Before?

[02:02:35] Because it measures the consumer price index from 1914.

[02:02:38] So they changed the conversion around that time.

[02:02:42] This is also a Canadian inflation calculator.

[02:02:44] Oh, all that doesn't mean anything then.

[02:02:48] How many beaver peltz in 1914?

[02:02:54] So the pins, right?

[02:02:55] This is the problem.

[02:02:56] The problem was the pins took too long to reset, right?

[02:03:00] You'd knock the pins down.

[02:03:02] Hold on.

[02:03:03] Just to help you with your editing, your peas are very hard right now.

[02:03:09] You may, you, yeah, a little bit.

[02:03:12] You may be a little close to the mic.

[02:03:13] I don't know.

[02:03:14] Just because you'll be in editing table later.

[02:03:17] So how's that better?

[02:03:19] Pins play fields.

[02:03:21] That's okay.

[02:03:22] That's better.

[02:03:24] You could read that one if you want.

[02:03:25] If I could say the name, hold on.

[02:03:27] Monogue Redgrave.

[02:03:29] It is not to get.

[02:03:29] I had that.

[02:03:30] Okay.
