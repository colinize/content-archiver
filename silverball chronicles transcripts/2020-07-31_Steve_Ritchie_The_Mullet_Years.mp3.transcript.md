[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:14] Okay, so so there's like a there's like a

[00:18] just hit myself in the face with a mic.

[00:30] Hello everybody. I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me. This month is my co-host who can't stop being awesome.

[00:47] Ron Hallett. What's up fella?

[00:50] Yep, still awesome. That's me. Can't wait to talk about some Steve Richie.

[00:54] This is this is you we are in your wheelhouse.

[00:56] A favorite designer beauty. Yeah, it looks like our listeners really want to talk about Steve Richie.

[01:01] Steve Richie has had a rabid response for us to make sure that that we squeeze this in. In our first episode our pilot episode we went through Steve Richie's early career.

[01:11] You know, that was sort of a feeling out the podcast in the world. We changed our email address and his pilots usually are. It's a bit rough.

[01:19] We're into episode six now. We're moving right along and I think we're going to settle into a better groove for the second episode for Steve Richie. That's for sure.

[01:28] Well, everyone I've talked to about this podcast asked me when you do in the next Steve Richie episode.

[01:33] Yeah, I had people I had people mentioned that a couple of times as well online or through message or things like that.

[01:39] Like what is it coming up? And what we do is we take this philosophy is that we want them to want it. We want them to crave it.

[01:47] The other thing that we've run into is as I'm writing out a lot of these episodes doing a lot of the research is they become really long and bloated because I'll end up going on rabbit holes and research holes when I went on to some of the research in my spare time.

[02:01] And because of that we've had to break a few of these out. So for example, our Pat Lawler will probably be three episodes just like our Steve Richie episode.

[02:10] I'm pretty sure a Barry Owesler episode that's going to be two episodes. So there's a lot of that happening. There's a lot of rabbit holes and a lot of interesting facts that we can go into as well as there's a lot of folks were on that don't have enough content or enough interviews for their own individual show.

[02:29] So I'll stick them in with somebody else to sort of stretch it out a bit.

[02:33] What people don't know is our typical recording sessions or around three hours.

[02:37] Not a lot of fun to edit, which is a very big cliche. That's it's very true. It's not fun to edit. So what have you been doing?

[02:44] What's since last month? What's going on in the wrong world? Well picked up another game.

[02:49] This is exciting folks. What game is this? Well, it was our last episode. God leaves, right? So I got a godly. I didn't get a system one though.

[02:58] So you didn't get one of the big three from our previous episode? No, I did not get the Sinbad countdown and Joker poker. I did not get either any of those three. I got my one of my probably my main grail godly pen. I was able to acquire pink Panther.

[03:15] No, and it's not forced to. It's not rocky. It is a system 80 game actually system 80 a game, which I'm doing the flippers right now and can't believe I have to try to knock the stupid roll pin out to just do a flipper rebuild. So I'm already annoyed. It's perfect.

[03:31] But the game the game in question is a pop a favorite alien star. Yeah, very cool system 80 a very cool art kind of neat rule set. It's the ultimate do the thing.

[03:42] Yep, it is do the thing. Very good. Well, I've switched out the LEDs in my Simpson Spinball party, which I picked up. I have pinball OCD. So I can't have mixed match bulbs.

[03:53] So by switching out, you mean you you put the LEDs in a better game.

[03:56] Oh. Very pleased with with the Simpson's so fun. It's a you know, it's it's a different kind of game. It's not very flow oriented.

[04:07] It has some of the best call outs I have ever I say I think for me I love the theme. I just hate that play feel. I don't know what it is with Joe bolster, but he can't make a left ramp to save his life.

[04:20] Joe Bolser. I'll never have him on the crusty show.

[04:27] So I mean nobody's released any new games in the last little while. Ninja turtles is still sort of the new kid on the block J. J. P.s.

[04:36] Get gear up their factory. So there's not really much exciting on that round. But if you really want to talk exciting.

[04:42] Ron how it's seen your joins you on the slam tilt streaming channel.

[04:46] Oh, yeah, we did a father and son stream. Because I had I had the week off. So it's like, come on now. We did it during the day. So you were one of the two people watching I think.

[04:56] Yeah, so it was it was Ron how it's senior who's wearing his sombrero playing. He schooled you a few times, particularly on the getaway, which will be one of our topics today.

[05:07] I don't quite remember that, but okay.

[05:10] So go back and watch that. It's slam tilt from twitch.tv and you can see Ron get trounced. He talked he spoke a lot more trash than I expected.

[05:20] Oh, yeah, we do that all the time. He's a he's a better player than me. He's the first pinhead, not me. Yeah, he's a very playing pinball till I was in my 30s. He was playing way before.

[05:31] It's it's shocking. Shocking that he played pinball before then. You know, pinball did exist years ago. That's right. And the 1800s when he started it. The trash talk that he gave you was was pretty funny, especially when you couldn't like quite here.

[05:44] Because he was on the other side of the room. It was wonderful. But go spend some time on the on the slam tilt streaming channel over on twitch. It was well worth your time.

[05:52] At least he could say he never remembers the time where they didn't have flippers.

[05:55] Yeah, because Humpty Dumpty was the year before he was born. So he can say, hey, they always had flippers.

[06:00] We've had a lot of engagement under social media. It's been tons of fun. We're seeing lots of the same characters popping up.

[06:05] But if you haven't joined us over on Facebook, join us. Have a good time. Make a few comments.

[06:11] You know, make some suggestions. Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles. Also over on this week in pinball.com.

[06:19] They've have their twip pinball promoters database. That's where you can leave a comment and find a bunch of new twitch streams, YouTube channels and podcasts.

[06:29] We would love for you to swing over there. Give us a five star review if you enjoy the show. That just helps others find us.

[06:36] So when they're searching, they're googling around for new podcasts that they're able to sort of see silver ball chronicles, which is a little bit different in the podcasting world.

[06:44] All right. So we'll go into our mailbag. This is a from Brian T. He says each episode so far has been a home run. Thank you.

[06:54] I always wanted to dig more into the history of modern pinball. And thankfully these guys are saving me the trouble of doing it myself.

[07:00] Do it yourself, Brian. Don't be so lazy. I love how much research and work these guys put in each show at that. That's all David.

[07:06] Ron and Dave make a great team and play well off of each other. Dave makes me laugh at least a couple of times in episode and Ron is such an engaging historian.

[07:14] This is the podcast that has been missing in my life. Keep up the great work. That's great. Billy. Why? He says the show is great.

[07:21] I listened to it on a road trip and it kept me interested the whole time. There isn't a lot of fluff just a bunch of interesting takes on older pinball companies and personalities.

[07:31] T shirts Ron. I finally got my silver ball swag order. Yes. I've got I'm actually wearing the shirt right now. My old T shirts everything's gone. It's all silver ball swag silver ball chronicle shirts from here on out.

[07:45] I also got a mug and a few stickers. I have to say if I was going to suggest that everybody else go it by one I figured I would buy kind of one of everything and see what the quality was pretty pleased actually.

[07:57] Good quality shirts great printing keeps me warm up here in these cold Canadian winters. Very good.

[08:03] And we don't make much off the swag. But if you enjoy the show and you need a new shirt and you want to support us. Drop over there and pick up a shirt.

[08:12] Yeah silver ball swag dot com just go ahead and click over and grab one corrections from our previous episode Ron and we didn't get a whole lot of corrections to our mail bag which is silver ball chronicles a gmail dot com.

[08:27] But there is one person who had a lot of corrections who spoke to you is that right.

[08:32] Yeah Bruce said our system one episode had all kinds of errors so I told him like we'll send them in we'd we'd love to correct ourselves.

[08:42] But of course he's missed the deadline. He has he said he had a whole letters worth of corrections course he did he's formally typing that up on his typewriter.

[08:52] And by the time he sends them in will be two episodes ahead and everyone forget about the system one episode exactly so we're looking forward all those corrections from him and we'll bring those into another episode if there actually was any corrections which I don't think there was was absolutely seamless and perfect with not an error in sight.

[09:10] So today's episode this is this is a big deal. This is a big one. This is Steve Richie the system 11 and Valley Williams era.

[09:20] Wow there are some classics in this lineup just like our last episode with Steve Richie a major list of first ever innovations in pinball and it's funny you say Valley Williams because this is the around 1988 Williams bought out Valley.

[09:37] So they started producing games with the Valley name but you'll notice there are no Steve Richie games under the Valley name he was a Williams purist he was a will he would not do any Valley games he would not do anything with Valley on it he would only do it.

[09:50] He had that tattoo in his arm which may or may not be true the mid 80s saw a world of social and economic unrest which was reflected in pop culture and of course pinball the baby boomers were entering their 40s and a new generation was coming to age generation X.

[10:06] Music was changing technology was changing home computers had arrived the cold war was still a thing pinball was back in a big way suddenly in the mid 90s home video games became the norm the internet or the information super highway arrived on mass.

[10:25] Jan X sold out went corporate and extreme was spelled with an X instead of an E. Yeah I remember the 90s everything was extreme Steve Richie rode the wave from the bottom of the industry in the mid 1980s all the way to the top again like a Honda dirt bike made of quarters and fueled by pinball players tears.

[10:47] Through this awesome time in pinball the best selling designer ever continued to build his legacy and you'll see in this episode once again redefine the industry as it struggled to survive Steve Richie the mullet years first place to start what is your favorite Steve Richie system 11 memory memory or game well I mean the game is game is stored in OK well if you want to be picky you want to be picky what's your favorite game.

[11:16] Everything well I mean the most significant system 11 memory would be the first system 11 game which would be high speed it pretty much started all of this started the uptick in pinball space shuttle kept the lights on but high speed brought it to the next level yeah I am I have a lot of fond memories of of high speed but those are in sort of the rear view mirror right I wasn't around in the arcades around the mid 80s I was hardly around.

[11:46] All of all of that era sort of me looking at it through the lens of the last couple of years where I've been in the hobby when I think system 11 you know I'm thinking you know Pat Lawler I'm thinking Steve Richie I'm thinking Barry Ausler you know those those those were really big things but something about high speed is pretty cool I really really really like that and it would probably be one of the top three system 11s that I would want to buy and that's probably because I don't have a lot of experience with them but I think I'm going to be a little bit more careful with the game.

[12:16] Do you think Steve prefers his system 11 work to his WPC work I don't know never asked him that yeah I love to find out because we had one person messages on it and he said that Steve Richie's WPC work is his most fun but his system 11 work is his most creative which I thought was a very cool comment so when we left the king of flow in 1982 you take a step back from pinball and began running his own video game company called king video designs.

[12:46] And he continued to innovate in the video game space for a few years pinball has this way of sucking you back in yeah he was working on a game called Devastator should believe it's supposed to have some like 3d elements to it yeah he's Steve Richie's so neat he must have a pretty cool mind I've never met the man it would love to meet him.

[13:04] Yeah you've never really taken any major breaks from pinball DJ not really but I didn't start to much later I mean I was in my 30s before I even played pinball so yeah I think I think somebody is going to be able to do it.

[13:15] I think somebody like like a Steve Richie taking a break from pinball you know he's got all these ideas the technology has changed again I bet you he missed it I bet you wanted to get back and really those mid 80s there wasn't much going on in pinball to be honest you know and we'll get into that maybe a couple of other episodes but he was I bet you he missed it and he wanted to get back but he had this time off to sort of stew and develop and think and create which I think is kind of cool.

[13:41] And for the next really decade decade a little bit he really brought a lot of those ideas ahead to the forefront can you imagine though that the pressure that Steve Richie probably had to continue to design and innovate the way he had done when we speak about his his earlier time at Williams it you know I don't think he I don't think he felt pressure really I think he put a lot of pressure on himself because he's made some amazing games I don't think so I don't think there was corporate pressure I think he might put pressure on himself nobody wants to come back and make a bunch of games it suck.

[14:11] In late 1985 Steve Richie was back at Williams after a three year leave from pinball so what do you do when you get back you're like it's time to get back time to get back get back and place pinball you continue you just play the hits right you just pull out a similar layout or you pull out kind of a you know an old theme that he's done before something like that just to settle back in right no that'll be the part three of the Steve Richie.

[14:36] Oh okay so there's some foreshadowing on that so he's not he's not going Brian Eddie you know he's not laying it out like he's done before something familiar you know just to get back in the groove because I don't know the paper is different they draw on now or something he hasn't even invented the patented car maneuver shot yet that he would use a lot the greatest shot pinball Steve Richie hell no you make high speed so first on the high speed stats it's a driving police.

[15:06] Chase car theme January 1986 it's a solid state system 11 the first system 11 which you mentioned before standard body machines sells 17,000 80 units smash software by Larry Dermar black night Adams family those are some of his artwork by Mark Sprencher and of course a little bit by Python Angelo which you can hear about my Python Angelo episode sound by Larry Jammar Larry Dermar Eugene Jarvis and Bill Praud so Jarvis you'll remember him from things like that.

[15:36] Like Space Shuttle firepower Gorgar Praud he was very very big in the system 11 era with some of the games on the forward one of his most famous ones being pinball once again Steve Richie creates a bunch of firsts how does he keep doing that Ron how does he keep developing these ideas just stuffs innovative mind boggling mind boggling so here's the list of the first I'm just I'm just going to go down through the firsts and you let me know what you think about each one okay.

[16:04] First pinball game to play a complete song. Okay, first Williams pin to use alpha numeric displays which let them do a lot more it specifically you could put your initials in now. Yeah, you could have real high scores real high scores first use of auto percentageing in the solid state game which is for replace scores.

[16:23] That is the single biggest first as far as an operator.

[16:27] Because that's who's buying these machines right today you and I are buying machines years ago people with bars did I take Tim Arnold of the Las Vegas pinball museum.

[16:35] I mean he was an operator he operated his own place pinball pizza like a Michigan for years and years and he said this was the biggest innovation.

[16:44] So how does auto percentageing work basically the issue they always had is if you got a pinball machine you would set what the score needed for a replay and usually there'd be a couple of different tiers maybe.

[16:55] You know one million in the next one might be two million the promise was a set it was a set number like you you said it and that was it so if you put this game on a location with a bunch of good players they just be getting replays all over the place.

[17:08] So if you if you upped it then your lesser players would never get a replay so they wouldn't be happy so just like it says it auto percentages you put it in a location if it's in a location with a bunch of good players it'll keep raising the score required for a replay.

[17:24] If it's crappier players it'll lower it so every time you sort of smash a high score it just sort of raises that bar a little bit higher and then if a bunch of people come in and starts lowering again at all at the same time.

[17:36] Yep and you just set the percentage you want how often do you want people to get replays very common place now but that was a big deal.

[17:43] Oh every game has it now but that until that game that didn't exist.

[17:47] It's the first jackpot available only during multi-ball the first use of broken switch compensation programming fancy and the first solid state game with an operator report.

[17:59] Yeah a lot of those like the operator report switch compensation playing a full song that all has to do with the new platform this system 11 platform.

[18:08] Although maybe Steve Richie didn't come up with all of these some of this is probably Larry tomorrow.

[18:13] It's interesting to point out that it was it was sort of the working relationship between the two that actually got it into the system 11 system and Steve Richie being the first one there.

[18:23] It was the first one in the next of the changing board set what's the major differences between the board sets of like the previous system and this which is I mean really system nine right where was the previous one.

[18:37] Well system nine was only for three games and that was kind of a transition that was the comet.

[18:45] Comet space shuttle and sorcerer yeah with a three system nine games system seven you had a separate MPU and driver board that were connected with a 40 pin interconnect with this was problematic.

[19:01] So system nine and then later system 11 they just put everything on one board now I hear system 11 is a super pain in the ass to work with the use multiplexing for for the vlashers and coils it got more and more complicated as the games got more and more complicated they kept having to put more.

[19:22] They first see the added different boards and the originally they had a lot of mini boards underneath the play field resistors on them and then they eventually had a they just did an interconnect board at the bottom of the back box that had all the resistors on it they just it kept getting more and more complicated until they just did away with it and started WPC yeah which is on the second half yeah which these the longest period of time I haven't played a lot of system 11's I played a few kind of in passing.

[19:49] The most machines for some reason that I've played are the earlier system seven's first I don't know why system six system seven I played a lot of those and of course the Valley Williams era when I think system 11 I think flashers because man they love flashers they used so many flashers and system 11 I love it so much so much light so much light and I mean I think we can agree when it comes to pinball history and system 11 specifically high speed has been a lot of time.

[20:18] High speed has the greatest story about the background story of it yeah it's tough to beat that Steve Richie tells the story of billion times we're going to go through it.

[20:26] In summary high speed is is in my opinion pretty epic and it's based on Steve Richie's real life police chase in a nineteen seventy nine Porsche nine twenty eight.

[20:38] He's finally caught in low D California in your state five and accused of speeding at a hundred and forty six miles an hour and in the correct format for everybody else to understand that's two hundred and thirty four kilometers an hour which is insane which I believe it's low die I think load it's a credence killer create is clear water revival song he says low die so well here we go Dave mispronouncing all the time less John Fogarty is wrong.

[21:05] John Fogarty is wrong about a lot of things his pronunciation of low dies probably correct basically he goes he gets in trouble he has to go and go to court and things like that basically he wanted to see how fast this new Porsche will go and he's speeding along the highway eventually the police catch up to him and give him a rest it's pretty funny when you hear Steve talk about it but we everybody's heard it a billion times he literally tells it every time he can because it's the greatest story in pinball history.

[21:35] And basically he got off for the most part he just he couldn't drive anywhere but to work for a period and that was about it yeah nowadays people give us millennials crap for the world that we live in but if you give if I got caught right now driving my oh god driving my Nissan Marano down the highway here the trans candidate highway at two hundred and that will take my car I'll never get car insurance ever again I have to take my kids to school on a bicycle like it would just be the worst back in the nineteen

[22:05] eighties are like you shouldn't do that your punishment is you can only drive to work which I'm sure Steve totally ignored he might have high speed also had some budget and cost concerns at Williams right so his first game back got all these great ideas what did they actually call high speed well it's another funny thing Williams they would have non flattering names for almost every game they did and high speeds non flattering name was high cost Steve Richie would say this is not a big deal.

[22:35] Nickname around Williams for high speed was high cost wasn't really that much more expensive than all the other games that were being developed at the time I don't get it which I assume means it was actually probably very expensive and he just didn't want to admit it.

[22:49] It could just be the long development cycle they had for it yes Steve says I think we put a lot of new things is the whitewoods progressed at one point Larry and I were so disgusted after three months of work that we decided to throw everything out and start over was one of the smartest moves we made.

[23:04] The game became much more refined and progress further than other designs that I worked on in the time allotted the funny thing is if you want to see that whitewood the one that they threw away after three months there is a picture of it on the internet pinball database IPDB dot org they brought it to pinball expo one year and they put a very on flattering sign on it that I cannot read.

[23:29] It was somewhat familiar right it has a figure eight on it which we will see later on another game very good.

[23:40] God the foreshadowing you're on the foreshadowing today you're just you are you are roping in the audience right now see on the top it says hello my name is.

[23:50] It's interesting it's still interesting Scott the drop targets on the sides to the standups that would have been more fun it's got all dropped Scott tons of drop targets.

[24:00] Yeah Steve Richie loves his drop targets like can you imagine today that George Gomez or or John Borg just after three months was like yeah throw it all out that's not happening.

[24:12] That did happen that happened to start a certain designer who got arrested for certain thing and they kind of had to restart.

[24:20] Yeah but I mean if you thought of just one designer one person you're you're working on you're working on Ninja Turtles John Borg's working on Ninja Turtles and then he's just like a quarter of the way through is like this is crap we're throwing it all yeah they wouldn't do that.

[24:33] Yeah that would not happen so this is I guess this is a good spot to maybe chat about Larry Demar since I don't think.

[24:39] I'm gonna get the opportunity to do it Larry Demar is awesome yeah he had the greatest timing ever.

[24:47] He came to Williams worked on their board set video games got hot him and huge Jarvis realized there were only a few people there knew how to do video games because they had done I believe defender.

[25:00] So they both quit left started their own company called Vid Kids and came back to Williams and said hey we'll make video games for you.

[25:08] So they did that and when everything crashed I think Jarvis went back to college.

[25:12] They learned Amar was away for a while then he came back developed their WPC system worked on a ton of awesome Pat Lawyer games became like head of whatever he was higher level executive there.

[25:25] And then when pinball 2000 he was working on the development of that then when the writing was on the wall he actually left before the Star Wars one came out and started his own company working on slot machine software.

[25:38] Wow so he is timing was always good he would get out just at the right time.

[25:43] Yeah pretty brilliant Chris Granner would say that Larry Demar and Eugene Jarvis were literally geniuses.

[25:49] They really got on the simplest level what coin up was.

[25:54] I would agree things like auto-percentaging right like according to Steve he said he came up with that but he's that he didn't implement it.

[26:01] No he told yeah he said he came up with it but Larry tomorrow coded it.

[26:05] That kind of stuff is pretty nuts so Larry Demar he went to MIT in the 1970s from 1980 to 1999 he was director of engineering at Williams electronic games.

[26:15] Slot machines for Williams in the 1990s founded a company called spooky cool designs which you had mentioned which did social mobile gaming which was a very big thing sort of at the beginning of those Facebook games for God's sakes that would pop up all the time.

[26:31] That company actually became part of Joe Kamenkao's Zingha company which also does a lot of those sort of mobile gaming apps.

[26:41] Also had his own company it's called that LED leading edge design which was also kind of a play on his initials.

[26:48] I think it's like Larry Eugene Demar which was always if you play it in any Williams games of the era you usually see a LED in the default high score table that's him.

[26:57] And now he's working as a consultant for gaming in the casino industry so now he just charges people to tell them what to do which is pretty cool.

[27:06] So you come to me pay me some money I tell you what to do and then if it works it works it doesn't it doesn't a matter here.

[27:11] It's great. This guy is awesome.

[27:13] Would you say that that marriage of Larry Demar and Steve Richie was one of the best creative collaborations around?

[27:22] Well they did two games black night and high speed pretty much as it all right there they had a very until mulch-uess relationship.

[27:29] Yes the word in the industry was that Steve has a lot of passion and this often results in a lot of arguments.

[27:35] Steve says he meaning Larry did much more than the normal output and imaginative contribution than any others I've worked with.

[27:42] We had knock down dragout fights and the game always won. At the end of the project we weren't speaking to each other.

[27:48] We patched up and forgot about it and remain good friends today.

[27:51] There's some funny stories that you hear about Steve Richie getting in arguments with Dwight Sullivan through the WPC era.

[27:59] Him getting into arguments with Lyman Sheets. Good times good times.

[28:04] Now there's some interesting items about Larry. This comes from a Steve Richie interview in 2005.

[28:09] Larry actually invented the jackpot feature which is crazy.

[28:15] Those fantastic alpha numeric displays which you mentioned before which do numbers and letters and a hell of a lot of rules over the years.

[28:23] Those were all Larry's. Larry himself is actually a very is an excellent player and at one point Steve Richie would say I think he lost touch with the average player.

[28:33] And I had to beg him. Can we please win an extra ball on my own play field?

[28:38] Yeah and when I heard that story there might have been an F bomb somewhere in that sense.

[28:43] That's one thing about the Steve is toned down a lot of the stories throughout the years.

[28:49] Yeah it's funny because he's tame them down as opposed to most people to print them down.

[28:53] I heard the original versions which were probably the true versions.

[28:58] The artwork we've we you know I'm for some reason I always get pulled back to artwork.

[29:03] It's probably because I'm not a very good player. It's also probably because I'm due to the industry and I have no idea what I'm doing.

[29:09] So we usually default to artwork. So pretty cool stuff on here by Mark's Bringer and he told IPDB that if you look at those cars on the play field.

[29:19] So it's like a oh god cliche time world under glass right there's a car chase going on with highways and streets.

[29:26] And there's some squad cars down there they have written on top of them a eight W 11 and S81 which are the initials for the birth date of his son.

[29:38] He told IPDB that Steve did not want the color green used anywhere on the play field calling it bad luck.

[29:46] Mark used green anyway and included a good luck small four leaf clover near the top of the traffic light.

[29:54] Because you know that that last green game that we talked about was a sale success quick solar.

[30:00] Oh hideous with the success of this game he believes the clover was responsible for finally breaking the dreaded green curse.

[30:09] Another interesting thing about the game is the fact that you as the player are running from the cops and the cops are actually the bad guys and you're trying to get away.

[30:16] Look what kind of message is that sending that is not with children growing up in a good household should be doing.

[30:22] That's probably another reason why it was so popular like I get to run from the cops and get away.

[30:26] Yeah. Yeah.

[30:27] So if we you know if we tie this back our Python Angelo episode we spoke a little bit about the Steve Richie Python Angelo collaboration here.

[30:37] Python Angelo did the backlash which I think is probably one of the best back glasses ever in which as we said I think in the Python episode if it's known as the zombie cops from hell is what it was called within Williams.

[30:50] It's all about bringing bringing everybody down a peg when they're working is pretty funny.

[30:54] You know the lot of arguments there between Steve and Python about should we be running from the police should we be chasing the the car etc etc but I think really when you look at it.

[31:05] It comes together very very well a good marrying of code art and sound and play field like no other this is really where Steve starts to develop that upper right flipper into a side ramp is really where he starts that.

[31:22] It was the first game with the I was called the car maneuver but basically it is a left or a bit from the lower right flipper comes around to the upper right flipper and you hit it up a ramp or another loop or something else but he is used this is the first game he used it and he has used it a lot.

[31:39] His first game at Williams back in the flash days kind of had the beginning of this as well as somewhat repeatable.

[31:47] It had somewhat repeatable loop.

[31:49] Back then I guess it's he's learning to sort of the geometry but he's really starting to dial that in now and this is a heck of a fun shot when you shoot that from that flipper goes up that ramp into kind of these two metal ramps and it'll either divert left or right.

[32:05] They're actually plastic.

[32:06] Well it's plastic to a metal ramp very very cool very satisfying shot and something completely unusual because this is the time where sort of ramps are becoming kind of they've moved from that by level black night style kind of design around 83 now with a couple of years out from that and now we're moving into what we would notice as the ramps of today very cool.

[32:31] Yeah more molded ramps that actually curve into things like that that you can actually rev the engine of the car which is pretty cool with the flipper button one thing that you brought up in our python episode is that you are not so much a fan of the play field and the back glass and the side of the cabinet all sort of being different designers.

[32:52] Yeah and more more along the we'll get more to that with get away that's why I really have an issue with it once again.

[33:00] Richie comes out of the gate and just smash some sales right out of there 17,000 80 units.

[33:08] I guess a big driver for those sales would be something things like those auto presenting the the bookkeeping features and stuff in the system I think that would be a huge driver for sales more so maybe then kind of the play field design or art which I'm sure helped.

[33:24] As an operator you would be like wow look at all these great innovations which are going to help me and you forgot one of them what's that the beacon the rotating beacon.

[33:33] Oh yes the flashing light on the top which does says look at me look at me they fired off during a track mode I mean how can you miss that the Steve Richie loves loves to flash people.

[33:45] Well after another smash hit another pinball theme just at a nowhere Steve Richie is just ready to play the hits right he's like okay that's that's enough I've shown everybody that I can reinvent reinvest let's just go back let's slack off a little bit and do the same sort of theme I've done before incorrect you can't have any more original ideas incorrect we're going to have a vertical up kicker we're going to have tons of habit trails no let's go back to the well.

[34:14] No it's just in proven invas we're going to make it even more expensive we're going to have F14 Tomcat this is a good one which Steve Richie has said this was purposely over done it's it's a call war theme classic USA versus Russia.

[34:29] Yagoff is the bad guy the Russian dude but where high speed at three flippers this is four where high speed had one beacon this has three this has like an obsc number of flashers and it is loud in your face.

[34:43] I think it the tagline was like it's fast it's furious and it fights back I think that's what the flyer said man that's cool and it has a kicker basically the same same act they would use for kickback except it's pointed at you so if you hit this thing it just fires it right at you.

[35:01] This is a jets aviation cold war theme March 1987 this is a system 11 a standard body 14,502 units software by Eugene Jarvis and Ed Boone who's a new name artwork by Doug Watson who we're going to see a lot of.

[35:19] And he's done a bunch of the stuff in the 80s and 90s at Valley and Williams and sound by Chris Granner and Bill Praud.

[35:26] Have you seen Top Gun?

[35:27] I have never seen Top Gun it's released 1986 with Tom Cruise Val Kilmer goose Maverick directed by Tony Scott produced by Jerry Brockheimer.

[35:39] Pretty decent movie it's a 55% rotten tomatoes.

[35:43] Take me take me the danger zone.

[35:46] Yeah I just remember Kenny Lagan's danger zone and there's a volleyball scene absolutely all I know about the movie.

[35:51] Yeah greatest volleyball scene in movie history.

[35:54] Anyway that movie totally unaffiliated by that 14 times.

[35:58] No this is a cold war not anything like it at all.

[36:01] This is a cold war theme of course Steve Richie is the Russian in this game he is Yagoff.

[36:08] He's pretty much a Russian in almost every Williams game.

[36:11] Steve Richie's always the bad guy.

[36:13] He's always the bad guy the Yagoff kicker is it's called that fires the ball back at you.

[36:18] I mean for years after that whenever I see a game with that feature I just instinctively call it a Yagoff kicker no matter what it is.

[36:26] Now I mean I could see how people could see the similarities between F14 Tomcat and Top Gun.

[36:32] I mean jet fighters Russians, Marca, you know music.

[36:39] There's Russians in Top Gun so I never stop.

[36:41] I think so isn't that Top Gun at the end there's a Russians or something?

[36:45] There's Russians in Indian, in your American movies.

[36:48] Not to be outdone.

[36:51] This was another pinball machine with a bunch of firsts.

[36:53] You mentioned it the kickback that fired the ball right back at the flippers.

[36:57] Yagoff kicker.

[36:59] Yeah because Steve Richie is a sadist.

[37:01] And it's also the first machine with an auto save which in this game they call it flight insurance.

[37:06] Yeah because they I guess realize that it was almost impossible and they should give you your ball back a little bit.

[37:12] Yeah that was made specifically because of the Yagoff kicker just so if it threw the ball down the center like the first time.

[37:18] You know like okay you get that back.

[37:20] Yeah I mean Steve Richie obviously would feel bad if he punched some child in the face so he'd give them their quarterback.

[37:26] Unless he was the black knight then he would ask for their money.

[37:28] That's right so a listener of the show, Michele Gorbachev says,

[37:32] America Week.

[37:34] The Russian Meg 25 fucks bet faster pinball machine.

[37:38] Much better.

[37:40] This flesher to play our face and kickbacks Russia strong.

[37:44] So thank you Michele for that for that feedback.

[37:48] May or may not be legitimate.

[37:50] Steve Richie has said in the past there were actually 10 prototypes for this game.

[37:56] Can you believe can you imagine that's crazy to be moving stuff around that much and to have the amount of time available to just do that.

[38:05] It was poor guys that got leave at this time are banging stuff out in like three weeks and he's making 10 prototypes over at Williams.

[38:11] I think the quality of the games are all you need to know about which was the better option.

[38:17] Yeah some of the items that were changed on his designs were the cabinet art design was deemed to plain so they changed that for production.

[38:27] There was actually a second pop bumper up at the top so there's only one pop bumper kind of in the middle of some stand up targets

[38:34] where the two two upper flippers are there was two pop bumpers that didn't play well so they took one out.

[38:40] I can tell you the next two we're not just on prototypes they were on production games.

[38:45] So clear flashing lamp domes along with a back wall of play field were too blinding so they changed them to red.

[38:53] The beacon on the top of the back box was deemed too bright so they had the domes changed.

[38:59] Yeah they changed a lot of stuff. F14 had a really long production run and they changed a lot of stuff throughout the run.

[39:07] Earlier F14s they used the same flipper coils for the two upper flippers then they used for the two bottom flippers which is insane because they're way too strong.

[39:18] They just like break things but what they also did is if you played a F14 Tomcat you may notice that there are flasher domes on the top two target banks like just a flasher dome sitting over the target bank but with no flasher in it which seems kind of odd.

[39:35] Well if you had one of the first couple hundred or however many of the number maybe 500 you would have had flasher in there.

[39:42] And what would happen is the flasher because the flippers were way too strong they would pound the targets and the target would get thrown back into the flasher which would short the flasher voltage into the lamp matrix and just blow up the game.

[39:57] So they removed those flasher and they put weaker coils for those upper flippers and then they had a service bulletin that went out to tell people this is how to remove the flasher and how to change the wiring and all that.

[40:13] I know this because I reversed the bulletin on my game to put the flasher back in.

[40:19] Only Steve Richie would design a game that tears itself apart from playing tears itself apart but it's it's in the back panel it had all clear flasher domes originally they changed into red and then the the beacons on top it was red clear and blue so they change it to red white and blue.

[40:42] Now this is a big game for for tournament players and stuff right like this is a very popular sort of tournament game what doesn't play very long it's got a very difficult strategy.

[40:53] It doesn't have any real bad like mystery awards like a got leave you know get your opponent score tight stuff that has to be removed.

[41:02] Yeah they used it I think one of the pop off finals the final game was it was decided on a 14 time cat.

[41:09] Now it's strategy right it's you start try to start multi ball and then lock in your jackpots by shooting back up into so the ball comes down you got to shoot around the orbit which goes into a vertical up kicker which kicks it up into a ramp right.

[41:27] Yeah like a plastic ramp to further thingy that diverge the balls various ways there's a ton of habit rails in this game has the up kicker in the back.

[41:38] Most of the game is just hitting the right orbit because it will spot your top cat letters so you can kind of get away with doing that but it also has many orbits you can use the end will always.

[41:49] When the ball is locked in a position and it ejects it will always eject it to the flipper you need to go to which I appreciate you know to get a Tomcat target.

[41:59] It also has the other cool thing you can try to do in it which no one ever does is try to max the bonus out because it has 8x and you can go up to 8x bonus.

[42:10] The left the left mini orbit when it's lit it gives you a multiplier 2x up to 8x and if you max the bonus which is on the right orbit again you can get over like a million just in bonus and it counts up forever it's awesome.

[42:25] It's extremely obnoxiously loud flash there's so many flashers in this game they paired them up to they'll have like one one transistor one like four four flashers and just you're everywhere and when you start multi ball you know you start multi ball.

[42:43] Plus if you have the track mode music and stuff on the game will just come on every few minutes with the beacons will just go and start playing music like play me play me.

[42:52] Steve Richie he did the voice of what is his name?

[42:58] Yagoff the bad guy.

[42:59] Yagoff right and his brother Mark did the voice talent of the protagonist.

[43:05] Yep.

[43:06] And Mark Richie of course will go on to do other designs and have somewhat of a career in pinball completing the high score gets the navies and the anchors away.

[43:16] Yep.

[43:17] Which I guess you Americans all know more than us can 80 well the funny thing is I believe you get one version of anchors away if you are like second third fourth place.

[43:27] You get a slower version of it a special version of it if you get first place a little bit of special little something something for you there.

[43:35] Or I might have been totally wrong on that it might just play the slower version if you get your name up that's what I think it is because it plays that at the end of every game.

[43:42] And if you know please send us an email and silver ball chronicles at cheemail.com.

[43:48] So I think it's time to slack slack in black.

[43:53] It was 1989 when Richie decided to slack off and take it easy on his next title.

[43:58] He didn't have to spend all that effort on a new story and a new character.

[44:03] Of course I'm talking about black night 2000 now because it's 2020 we realize that 2000.

[44:11] Back in the 1980s meant the future.

[44:14] If you had 2000 after your name that was a big deal.

[44:17] Do you have any memories of black night 2000 greatest multi ball intro sequence ever made.

[44:23] Wow.

[44:24] That's a hot take.

[44:26] Tell me one better.

[44:27] I dare someone.

[44:29] Please send it to silver ball chronicles at cheemail.com.

[44:32] If you can name me a game that has a better multi ball intro.

[44:36] Maybe ghost busters?

[44:37] No.

[44:38] No.

[44:39] Sorry.

[44:40] Oh and I didn't even count the there's also the ransom intro which is also incredible.

[44:46] Yeah.

[44:47] Here's a funny black night 2000 story.

[44:50] When they were debuting this game for one of the European distributors.

[44:55] So this was in Europe.

[44:57] I don't remember which country.

[44:58] Maybe Germany.

[44:59] I don't know.

[45:00] But the distributor was going to do this huge presentation for black night 2000.

[45:07] And he had this idea.

[45:08] He was going to have a actual night on a horse come out on the stage as they introduced the game.

[45:15] So they did that.

[45:17] Except the horse kind of how do I say this let loose if you know what I mean.

[45:23] All over the stage.

[45:25] And they had to get everyone out of the room because of the smell and clean up the mess the horse made.

[45:32] And then everyone came back in and they were able to debut the game.

[45:36] Yeah.

[45:37] So give me your stats at black night 2000.

[45:41] It's fantasy.

[45:42] It's like a castle battle theme.

[45:44] That's from April of 89.

[45:46] It is a system 11 B.

[45:49] It's a standard body only sells 5,703 units.

[45:54] Sound by Dan Forden.

[45:57] Brian Schmidt.

[45:59] Software by Ed Boone.

[46:01] And artwork once again by Doug Watson.

[46:04] So our friend Carrie Hardy from Carrie Hardy YouTube channel.

[46:08] He's a restore an enthusiast pinball commentator.

[46:12] He recently sold a machine to buy a black night 2000.

[46:15] And he said this.

[46:16] Oh man, I wish I could do his charming Texan accent, but I can't.

[46:21] One of the best soundtracks of the era.

[46:24] Heavy on the right flipper.

[46:25] Although it is overall a simple game code wise, the speed and flow keeps me entertained.

[46:32] Why revisit black night?

[46:33] Well, because the Steve puts it, people are always asking me,

[46:36] when are you going to make another black night?

[46:38] I had a vision for a two level game and black night just fit.

[46:42] Speech and music have come so far.

[46:44] And they did.

[46:45] So it's the same thing, right?

[46:47] You look at sort of rage now, which we'll cover in our next Steve Rift show episode.

[46:51] People will just ask you, when are you going to do black night?

[46:53] When are you going to do black night?

[46:54] He's just great idea.

[46:55] Okay, why not?

[46:56] So Carrie, he alluded to this.

[46:58] The music of black night 2000.

[47:01] Music has always been and apparently always will be a big deal for Steve Ritchie in his games.

[47:07] Steve says, I want a music that made me feel energized and excited,

[47:10] laced with urgency and drive.

[47:12] I wrote most of the music as chord progressions first.

[47:15] Then added some leads and riffs to the main songs of the game.

[47:18] I wanted the music to be fast and furious to inspire players.

[47:21] I also wanted the sound and music package to stand out and allowed arcade.

[47:25] And that's sure, sure did.

[47:27] Ryan Schmidt added great bass lines that transform the music.

[47:30] So they do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

[47:34] Dan Fordon wrote a bunch of lead lines and sampled my 72 Les Paul custom through a Marshall 100 watt lead amp

[47:40] and a Marshall cabinet with a four or 12 Celestian speakers.

[47:44] Probably saying that wrong.

[47:46] Some musician make fun of me now.

[47:48] Dan laid out my guitar scale electronically for playing throughout the game.

[47:52] Dan created an engineer the entire sound package including the sound effects and enhancing and coaching my voice as the black night.

[47:58] Dan Fordon deserves a lot of credit for his spectacular work on this game.

[48:02] You can read this.

[48:04] This this originally came from an old IRC chat conversation interview that

[48:11] that Steve had way back in the 90s and it's funny because you can see the

[48:18] passion and the detail and the memory that he has around specifically black night 2000.

[48:25] He knows the guitar.

[48:26] He knows the amp.

[48:27] He knows the he knows who did what it's he has such passion for the music in his games, particularly black night 2000 that he can remember exactly what was what going into that game.

[48:37] That is pretty pretty cool.

[48:38] The other thing I'll the other shout out I'll give to black night 2000 Joe Joe's we talked about in our Stern episode our classic Stern by this point he was at Williams.

[48:48] And he was it was his engineering that designed the upper play field and how it pivots so it's easily serviceable.

[48:58] The upper play field is insanely packed on black night 2000.

[49:02] Yeah, which is which is sad when you look at sort of rage.

[49:06] Sort of rage has a loop in a lock shot.

[49:10] The black night 2000 has three lanes on the top three lanes on the bottom three pop bumpers one flipper a loopable orbit shot a motorized three bank that goes up a ramp to another lock area that's pretty packed.

[49:26] It's insanity now you can see that it's a bit of a niche title right it only sells.

[49:32] You know far less than the other Steve Richie games at the time it's only selling about you know a third of those games at five thousand units you can see it's more of a

[49:41] Passion project and it went through it went through some changes to with the plastics the original black night 2000s had more futuristic looking

[49:50] Plastics and then they changed it to a more medieval looking plastic set.

[49:56] Yeah, so depending on when you got yours you'll have one plastic set or the other very cool.

[50:00] I think if you took out the sound package if you took out that sort of iconic black night 2000 song I think it would be a

[50:09] Turd no it's got a great upper play field the biggest issue is when it comes off the upper play field it's just so easy to trap way too much control.

[50:18] It was a better exit and it less bright flipper only it would have been a better game well carry mentions that right it's right flipper all day so

[50:26] flipper all day so it comes down off of the top play field kind of into almost like a drain if you will down into a ramp into the inside lane down by the

[50:36] Flippers and then you just sort of trap it and then shoot it back up it doesn't go in the lane actually goes it goes past the

[50:42] Slingshot and just right to you so you can move it around a little bit but the most you're going to do is you'll have to hit

[50:49] it on the fly back up top which if you get the timing down you just keep doing that over and over.

[50:53] It's one of those games that I I owned really loved it and then when I got better a pinball the games got longer and

[51:00] longer and longer and then I had to sell it.

[51:02] Yeah, but I still missed that multi ball intro sequence it's the greatest of all time.

[51:06] It has that really cool sort of insert wheel at the bottom there's sort of like a lightning bolts lightning wheel the

[51:13] lightning and it's so it just looks so cool which you'll learn about in episode three of Steve Richie because he's going to use it again.

[51:20] So after all these hits you got to lay it egg right.

[51:23] That was roller games Steve Richie says I used to hate it well I used to hate it a lot more I played it more lately and it's a good game it's fun.

[51:32] He's lying he hates it I could tell you for fact he hates this game he says he says I certainly I can certainly point out that my

[51:39] least favorite game is roller games.

[51:42] I'm saying because I have one downstairs so it pains me.

[51:47] Roller games he says was depressing in that the show went off the air before even producing the game the show was that bad.

[51:56] No, maybe it isn't apparent to play the game but all the wind went out of the sales towards the end of the project it was the

[52:03] only project that didn't get us progressively higher as the project moved forward.

[52:08] Yeah what happened is the production company that actually made the show went bankrupt.

[52:13] The ratings for the show were actually they were about what American gladiators was doing.

[52:20] So roller games is like a roller skating thing right.

[52:27] It's all wrestling on roller skates so there's like a there's like a course like a circular course.

[52:33] It's a circular it's a figure eight.

[52:34] Oh it's a figure eight okay so there's a figure eight course you roll a blade around it yet and knock people off of it.

[52:41] There's the wall there's the they had all these crazy things on the show then they had like they had bands that

[52:48] would play during intermission.

[52:50] Oh yeah I actually see a few episodes back in the day which made you want to get a pinball machine so that's why you got roller games.

[52:57] Actually I didn't realize it was the same show.

[53:00] Wow you can tell that Steve was disappointed though right.

[53:03] Yes he was disappointed and oh said you have a roller games it isn't that bad is it no.

[53:09] But what they did with roller games unfortunately is they kind of stopped working on the software.

[53:15] It isn't overly polished.

[53:17] Yeah so you could see that like he said it that the wind came out of the sales.

[53:20] Yeah they kind of just like and they cost cut the hell out of it.

[53:24] And what I mean by that is roller games probably has some of the most different versions of a game for the run it had.

[53:31] How many how many did it have we have the stats up on the screen here they 5,000 units.

[53:36] Yeah I like how it's an even number it's just like we had to do 5,000 we weren't going to do a single one more.

[53:42] So roller games early in the run like the first 100 couple hundred they're actually diamond plate.

[53:48] Which is a clear coat that Williams was experimenting with which would go into production later on a SeaVritchy game.

[53:54] But this was actually I think the first SeaVritchy game where they used it at all.

[53:57] So like the first couple hundred had this clear coat on it.

[54:00] They started cost cutting I don't even mention like system 11's have tons of flashers.

[54:05] Well they decided they saved money if they removed all the flashers from the back box.

[54:10] So there's actually three different insert panels for roller games depending on where it is in the run.

[54:15] The insert panel being where all the lights are mounted behind the back box the thing that swings open.

[54:20] There's the original one that has all the flashers in it.

[54:23] Then there's the second one that has all the holes for the flashers but there are no flashers.

[54:26] And then there's the third one that doesn't even have the hole for the flashers anymore.

[54:29] And they removed a bunch of flashers from the play field also.

[54:32] Again all cost cutting.

[54:34] They removed the in speaker panel.

[54:37] They removed the W's the Williams logo from the speakers because I guess that was an extra cost.

[54:42] So it just has regular speaker grills.

[54:45] I know I did a lot of research on roller games and I actually have a really early one probably one of the first couple hundred.

[54:52] So mine has all the flashers in it from the factory.

[54:55] It's like a hack and slash.

[54:56] It's just like whatever I can pull out of it.

[54:58] Basically whatever they can pull out of it they just stop developing the software.

[55:02] Just get it to hell out and move on.

[55:05] Which is what they did.

[55:06] And that's a shame.

[55:07] It's from June of 1990.

[55:09] So we're into the 90s.

[55:10] We're in the 90s but it's very 80s.

[55:12] It's trashy 80s all the way.

[55:15] It's awesome.

[55:16] It's a system 11c standard body software by Mark.

[55:21] Mark.

[55:22] Penicco.

[55:23] Penicco.

[55:24] Penic.

[55:25] Penicco.

[55:26] I have to say the name right to silver ball chronicles at you mail dot com and tell us how to say his name right and he will come up again.

[55:32] Sound and music Dan Forden and Pat McMahon did the artwork who did a tale of the Arabian ice dirty Harry, Popeye and junkyard sort of that those WPC games.

[55:43] The biggest disappointment of roller games is the multi ball start because you you came off a black night 2000.

[55:48] The greatest multi ball start ever.

[55:50] And on roller games when you lock a ball it does super cool like dims the lights and does a bunch of cool flash her facts.

[55:55] So you're like, oh this is going to be freaking awesome when multi ball starts and then you start multi ball

[56:00] And it just cuts all the lights on the game and just flashes on the alpha numeric.

[56:03] Roller games.

[56:05] Roller games.

[56:06] Roller games and then you just get all the balls like that's it.

[56:09] Lame.

[56:10] Yeah, that's where you can tell that they were like, nope, that's it.

[56:12] That was one of the last things.

[56:14] If you finish sudden death though you get a crazy awesome light show, but that's like the only time you get one.

[56:19] So you know, during this time licenses, this is licensing for some reason is such a strain to sing in pinball.

[56:25] I don't get it.

[56:26] Yeah, they could have had American gladiators, but they pick roller games.

[56:29] Dad at East, Gary Stern's new company with Joe Kamenkow around this time.

[56:34] They really see licensing as the go forward and everybody else in the industry got leave.

[56:42] Balli or Balli Midway at the time.

[56:45] Williams, they're all kind of trying to figure out licensing.

[56:49] But one of the dangers of licensing is you could go American gladiators or you go roller games.

[56:56] Both of them weird.

[56:59] Both of them, you know, not lasting very long and pop culture.

[57:04] But yet one of them sort of lasted a few months and did fairly well.

[57:08] The other one was just a train wreck.

[57:10] American gladiators lasted way longer than a couple months.

[57:12] It was not for years.

[57:14] Years.

[57:15] Still horrible.

[57:17] Yeah, but didn't they like that in Canada?

[57:19] It is.

[57:20] With no, I mean, I guess.

[57:23] I remember seeing it, but I remember being like, oh, this is kind of fun.

[57:26] Daddy East was smart and they knew that their games were not as good as Williams.

[57:30] So they got licenses.

[57:32] So they had to figure out a way to make them better.

[57:34] And that's how you make them better.

[57:35] You slap something like Star Wars on it.

[57:38] Boom.

[57:39] It's better.

[57:40] Yeah.

[57:41] I mean, I kind of like roller games.

[57:42] The game because it's, it is so obnoxiously 80s, right?

[57:47] It's, it's almost like those system 80B era games.

[57:50] They're just, they're just, they just ooze 80s like you would not believe.

[57:55] But it's Steve Richie and as a third flipper and a magnet that will catch it and feed it to that third flipper.

[58:00] And it has the Bacarbonuver.

[58:02] It hits that second.

[58:03] It hits that second.

[58:04] It hits the second game that he did the left orbit to the upper right flipper up the ramp.

[58:08] So we, we should count.

[58:09] We should keep a count between episodes two and three.

[58:12] So that's two.

[58:13] If you're, if you're writing them down at home, that's right.

[58:16] If I could get a roller games, I would be pretty pleased.

[58:20] I think I would be pretty happy because it's not an outrageously priced game.

[58:23] It's still a system 11 game.

[58:25] It screams 80s pinball.

[58:27] It's kind of fun.

[58:29] It's got that stereotypical 80s guy in a gene jacket muscle up fighter guy on the play field.

[58:36] Not even muscle.

[58:37] They're on Royates.

[58:38] They're ridiculously over large.

[58:41] Yeah.

[58:42] It's got the, the lady roller games people and they're in there.

[58:46] Yeah, I guess really bright.

[58:47] The twins were actually on the show.

[58:50] It was supposed, some of them were supposed to be people were actually on the show.

[58:53] Oh, yeah.

[58:54] Well, there he go.

[58:55] There you go.

[58:56] That's something.

[58:57] I think he wants to ask what he would have liked to a made roller games theme wise.

[59:01] And he said, the beige knight, you know, he's a good guy.

[59:05] He doesn't want to start trouble.

[59:06] He's happy.

[59:07] He's baking cookies tonight.

[59:08] That's showing once again how much he hates that game.

[59:11] I know he hates it.

[59:12] I bet you his high standards really, I think they really hurt him, right?

[59:20] Like he seems like the kind of guy.

[59:22] I don't think he's a perfectionist.

[59:24] But I think he likes to win.

[59:26] I think he likes awesome things.

[59:28] I think he likes excitement.

[59:30] One thing is that roller game song in there, right?

[59:32] Like you could tell that's a Steve Richie game, especially after Black Knight, right?

[59:36] Yeah.

[59:37] Well, that song is actually from the show.

[59:38] Oh, my God.

[59:39] Rock, rock and roll.

[59:41] Oh, yeah.

[59:42] That game, that game is just a train ride.

[59:43] And the roller games, like when you get into multi-ball, that's from the show.

[59:46] Oh, there are games.

[59:47] Roll, there are games.

[59:48] Roll, there are games.

[59:49] Okay.

[59:50] I think people are sick of roller games at this point.

[59:52] One other thing, just in closing.

[59:54] The play field has like thermos and Pepsi.

[59:58] Yeah, probably one of the last times.

[01:00:00] Yeah, the speaker panel has all these advertisement, all these different products on it.

[01:00:04] Slice, I think is on there.

[01:00:06] It's like that would be the worst part is if a repro company wanted to reproduce that play field to save a bunch of machines.

[01:00:13] It's never going to happen.

[01:00:14] No, I'm trying to remember, it's a lot on the play field.

[01:00:16] I thought it was just on the speaker panel.

[01:00:18] I'd have to go downstairs.

[01:00:19] Some of it's on the play field because it's got those inserts.

[01:00:22] It's got those inserts in the middle of the play field.

[01:00:24] I thought they were all for the different teams.

[01:00:26] Like team thrash, the violators.

[01:00:29] They had great names.

[01:00:30] Oh, it's so trash.

[01:00:32] Are you telling me that this machine didn't sell?

[01:00:35] I'm sorry.

[01:00:36] So if you're following at home on your IPDB database, you're probably thinking we're going to talk about Terminator 2 next.

[01:00:43] However, to do a correct timeline, we must say the actual next game that Steve Richie was going to do after roller games was going to be another sequel.

[01:00:53] Yes, he decided to slack off again.

[01:00:56] It was going to be Getaway, high speed too.

[01:01:00] And an opportunity just falls from the sky.

[01:01:03] Could not turn down, which was basically Williams got the Terminator 2 license.

[01:01:08] And Steve was completely on board.

[01:01:11] But here's where it gets interesting.

[01:01:13] For roller games, his programmer was Mark, who we can't say his last name right, Penicill.

[01:01:19] They had a major falling out.

[01:01:21] And they were not on speaking terms.

[01:01:23] Not on speaking terms.

[01:01:24] Can you imagine it was bad enough that I would talk to the man?

[01:01:26] Enter Dwight Sullivan would end up being Steve's main programmer for probably most of the rest of his wins run in a good portion of his turn run.

[01:01:35] Yeah, the only person that can separate angry arguments Steve with regular Steve and reconcile those at the end of the day.

[01:01:44] Yeah, and so they got the Terminator 2 license, which that was a big deal.

[01:01:49] This machine, this is a machine that I that I want.

[01:01:52] And it drives me crazy that they made so many and the price has continued to rise and rise and rise for this machine.

[01:02:00] Really? How many, how much are they now?

[01:02:02] In Canada, these things are selling for 5,000 loonies.

[01:02:06] Mine was like 14,500.

[01:02:08] But that's it.

[01:02:09] Originally when I got it, I don't have it anymore.

[01:02:12] I saw one in Canada, I want to say last year, for about $3,000 US dollars.

[01:02:18] And I was like, oh man, that's way too much.

[01:02:21] Now they're like 36, 3700 US, which is like, and it just keeps escalating.

[01:02:27] And it drives me crazy because man, I want one of these machines, but I'm not paying that much.

[01:02:31] Not doing it. This is the machine run from my childhood.

[01:02:35] So I used to travel every multiple times every summer.

[01:02:40] For my province of New Brunswick, there was the island of Prince Edward Island, which is just one of the most beautiful places in the world.

[01:02:47] It's a vacation, just mecca.

[01:02:51] It is amazing.

[01:02:52] Now you can take a bridge.

[01:02:54] You just drive on a bridge and you pay a toll.

[01:02:56] It is the longest bridge over frozen water in the world.

[01:03:00] At the time, you used to take a ferry.

[01:03:02] You get on a ferry and you go.

[01:03:03] And of course on a ferry, you'd have a cafeteria and an arcade to keep the kids away.

[01:03:07] And there was a Terminator 2 on that boat.

[01:03:10] And man, oh man, I love that game.

[01:03:12] Just love this.

[01:03:13] Just bubbles with nostalgia for me.

[01:03:16] This is the game that I remember.

[01:03:18] I would drop quarters into it.

[01:03:20] I'd pull the gun handle trigger.

[01:03:22] I double-flip that machine.

[01:03:24] Just smash those buttons until the ball drained out.

[01:03:26] You can still hear the match screen sequence.

[01:03:29] The crushing noise that the thing would do to come up with the number.

[01:03:33] Do you have a memory like that for T2, Ron?

[01:03:36] Yes, it was in the bowling alley.

[01:03:39] It's probably one of the first times I played pinball.

[01:03:42] But I was just playing it to kind of appease my dad because he wasn't going to play me in any of the video games.

[01:03:47] Because that would have been painful for him.

[01:03:48] So they had a Terminator 2.

[01:03:50] And that's the first time I ever saw it.

[01:03:52] That machine was everywhere.

[01:03:54] Oh yeah.

[01:03:55] And they also had the arcade Terminator 2 with the stand up with the guns and you should do this.

[01:04:00] Yeah, Williams got both licenses.

[01:04:02] They're midway, they're video game division.

[01:04:05] They did the video, the gun game.

[01:04:07] And then the pinball division did the pinball machine.

[01:04:09] Everything associated with that movie made just tons of money.

[01:04:12] That was so huge.

[01:04:13] There was nothing better.

[01:04:14] I remember seeing the coming attraction for that.

[01:04:18] It was one of the coming attractions.

[01:04:19] I went to see a movie, I don't remember what the movie was, but that was one of the coming attractions.

[01:04:23] And it was the trailer where they just show them building Arnold.

[01:04:27] They show the Endoskeleton, then they put the skin on him, then he looks at the camera,

[01:04:31] and it just goes to black and says Terminator 2.

[01:04:34] This summer, I'll be back.

[01:04:37] And I'm like, oh my god, this is going to be huge.

[01:04:41] Even the Terminator, the original one was awesome.

[01:04:43] I actually like the original Terminator more.

[01:04:45] I'm in the minority.

[01:04:46] You're a weird fella.

[01:04:48] Terminator 2.

[01:04:49] We'll get into that in a minute.

[01:04:50] But one of the reasons I love YouTube is that you can find some really cool stuff.

[01:04:56] And we're getting into this 1990s era of pinball.

[01:04:59] And there's some really cool stuff.

[01:05:02] I'm going to throw this up in our show notes.

[01:05:04] You can see the original distributor sizzle reel or sales pitch from the VHS tapes that they would send out.

[01:05:12] We started doing these, I think, in 91.

[01:05:15] Somewhere around, I think Partizzo might have been one of the first ones they did.

[01:05:18] They got more and more heavily produced as they went along.

[01:05:21] Yeah, they realized these VHS cassette tapes of pitching the game would actually sell the game just as much as going to a show and sort of schmoozing folk.

[01:05:31] But the crazy thing about it is the game came out at the same time the movie came out.

[01:05:35] Yeah.

[01:05:36] And it never happens anymore.

[01:05:38] Like they had access to everything as the movie was being made as we're going to talk about when they get Arnold to do the voice of callouts.

[01:05:47] He was in his trailer on set doing the calls.

[01:05:50] There is a lot of risk to that if you ask me like nowadays, Stern particularly is very risk adverse, right?

[01:05:58] They are not taking the next step.

[01:06:00] They all need to do a movie if it's already been successful like the second one's coming out.

[01:06:04] Like Guardians of the Galaxy, it's based on the first movie, but they waited till the second movie to play it safe, etc.

[01:06:11] But I mean, this is an exception.

[01:06:13] This was James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator.

[01:06:17] This couldn't possibly suck.

[01:06:19] It just, there's no way.

[01:06:21] There's no way.

[01:06:22] The YouTube pitch video for this, I've included in the show notes.

[01:06:26] Steve Richie has one proper monetist.

[01:06:29] In his business in the front, it is party in the back.

[01:06:32] And he's wearing a suit and he's describing all of the innovations and features within, within Terminator 2.

[01:06:39] And it is awesome.

[01:06:41] It is so funny and so cool to sort of see this.

[01:06:44] And it's, it's like peak prime Steve Richie, right?

[01:06:48] Like this, he is, he is loving showing that machine off.

[01:06:52] It is cool.

[01:06:53] Let's bring it, let's bring it into the movie here.

[01:06:55] So we'll give some people some context.

[01:06:58] Man, this Terminator franchise has been a train wreck since, you know, after, after T2.

[01:07:04] It's just been a bit of a mess.

[01:07:06] The movie still exists in my world.

[01:07:08] Right. It's, it's, it's a whole thing.

[01:07:11] And I think that's a shame because there's a lot of people coming into the hobby, into their, you know, maybe, maybe early 30s, mid 30s, the, you know, the 20s,

[01:07:19] sort of the newer generations coming into maybe tournament play.

[01:07:22] They don't know the phenomenon that was the Terminator 2 world.

[01:07:27] So it was written, directed and produced by James Cameron in 1991.

[01:07:31] And this is well before Titanic, well before the Avatar series.

[01:07:36] But it's like everything, yeah, when he made good movies, everything that James Cameron touches like turns to gold.

[01:07:42] And this is really the first one where when he touched it, it turned to like triple platinum.

[01:07:48] It was, it was amazing.

[01:07:51] Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the biggest action film star at the time.

[01:07:56] He's doing Predator, he's doing, he's just, he's just the biggest star ever at the time.

[01:08:02] Like it is, it is him and Sylvester Stallone are the biggest stars in action.

[01:08:06] And who's the other guy?

[01:08:09] Bruce Willis.

[01:08:10] Bruce Willis. It's like the three of them, man, if you're making an action movie, those are your three guys.

[01:08:14] So this is the follow up to the 1984 film the Terminator, which is an awesome movie.

[01:08:18] You should definitely see that one.

[01:08:20] It has a $102 million budget, the most expensive film ever made at the time.

[01:08:26] It did $520 million at the box office.

[01:08:29] Now if we, if we put that into today's dollars, so if you, you use inflation, that's a billion dollars.

[01:08:36] So that's basically a marvel or star wars movie kind of box office.

[01:08:41] But like 30 years ago, right? Like it's a, this is huge.

[01:08:45] It was for the longest time.

[01:08:47] One of the top three movies of all time and adjusted for inflation is still amongst the top earners.

[01:08:53] And it has a 93% rotten tomato score.

[01:08:56] So it is actually a good movie based on the critics.

[01:08:59] So seven percent of the people are dumb.

[01:09:02] Okay.

[01:09:03] I, this movie, I used to pretend I was a Terminator.

[01:09:06] I used to play Terminator with my friends.

[01:09:09] We used to play the video game.

[01:09:11] I had this probably a Canadian knockoff Terminator movie somewhere.

[01:09:15] Yeah. Yeah.

[01:09:16] Yeah, where he's, he's just like a lumberjack.

[01:09:18] And he's just walking around looking for a mullson.

[01:09:21] So, so come with me if you want the stats.

[01:09:25] It's space, time travel, sci-fi war theme, July of 1991.

[01:09:31] So 12-ish months after roller games.

[01:09:34] It's, it's a WPC, which the big difference here.

[01:09:37] We're talking totally new board set, but it has a dot matrix or DMD display.

[01:09:41] Totally new board set developed primarily by Larry DeMar.

[01:09:45] So we'll bring him up again.

[01:09:47] Yeah, standard body sold 15,202 units.

[01:09:51] Music by Chris Granger, some of the best music he's ever done.

[01:09:54] Software to white Sullivan.

[01:09:56] Nobody's ever heard of that guy.

[01:09:58] And art by Doug Watson again.

[01:10:00] Killer backlash.

[01:10:01] Oh my goodness, iconic backlash.

[01:10:04] Which you have to thank Arnold Schwarzenegger for that.

[01:10:07] He just wanted his face.

[01:10:08] Because the original backlash they had like his face, he demanded he had to be in sunglasses on the backlash.

[01:10:16] So, so he had to rejigger the thing around.

[01:10:19] If you remember like there's a fault, there's a Terminator, Endoskeleton, then he's half Terminator, you know, half human looking and then he's human looking with the sunglasses.

[01:10:27] Yeah, gotta keep it on brand.

[01:10:29] Let's go through again. A bunch of firsts.

[01:10:32] This guy, he just comes up with stuff. It's amazing.

[01:10:34] The first machine with an auto plunger.

[01:10:36] And it also had like a gun handle, which was pretty cool, right?

[01:10:40] So instead of a plunger.

[01:10:41] A high quality gun handle.

[01:10:43] You could kill someone with that thing.

[01:10:44] It is so hot.

[01:10:46] That thing is like a tank.

[01:10:48] Chrome.

[01:10:49] Oh yeah. You could grab that thing and pick the whole game up and it'll be like, no problem.

[01:10:52] Oh man.

[01:10:54] Oh man.

[01:10:55] It was so cool.

[01:10:56] It's the first machine with a fan quote unquote, air quotes.

[01:10:59] I don't want to say Steve Richie invented the fan layout.

[01:11:03] No, he perfected the fan layout.

[01:11:05] But this, the reason I have the sort of the air quotes in the question mark here in our show notes is because it is perfected here.

[01:11:14] Everything is pushed way back.

[01:11:16] It's left to right.

[01:11:18] It's combos.

[01:11:19] It's repeats.

[01:11:20] It's an orbit.

[01:11:21] Like it is perfected.

[01:11:23] He might not have been, you know, if you know who had the quote unquote first fan layout, you know, I'd love to know over it.

[01:11:29] Silver ball chronicles gmail.com and I'll put that in our next episode.

[01:11:32] But I mean, I think this is the first fan layout.

[01:11:35] I think this is the first time I've ever seen a fan layout.

[01:11:37] I think this is the first time I've seen a fan layout.

[01:11:39] You know, I think this is the first time I've seen a fan layout.

[01:11:42] And this is the first time he's starting to repeat at this point.

[01:11:48] Is the three bank in the center just like flash and the five bank on the left just like flash and also just like roller games.

[01:11:57] Five bank on the left.

[01:11:59] Three bank in the center.

[01:12:00] Yeah, he's kind of falling into kind of the he's going to start getting into a certain group.

[01:12:05] He's going to start using reusing his elements.

[01:12:08] Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

[01:12:09] But that causes some issues when you've been in the industry so long.

[01:12:13] It's the first machine to feature a cannon or an on-playfield ball-launching mechanism.

[01:12:20] That's a cannon, I guess, because technically you have things like taxi, big guns, they use

[01:12:27] catapults to fly the ball through the air.

[01:12:29] Yeah, I guess.

[01:12:30] Yeah, it's a thing that moves that shoots the ball as opposed to catapult.

[01:12:36] And we're not including hyperball, another game he did, which literally had a cannon

[01:12:41] that fired balls.

[01:12:42] Right, which is probably the same, Mac.

[01:12:45] The first game with a video mode.

[01:12:47] Thank you, Dwight Sullivan.

[01:12:48] Yeah, no, because it's Dwight Sullivan and he loves video modes.

[01:12:52] He's got a series of firsts.

[01:12:54] Very, very cool.

[01:12:55] But I would say one of the greatest, if not, maybe it's the second greatest story in pinball

[01:13:01] history.

[01:13:03] The high speed story's pretty great.

[01:13:04] I think the comedy in the branding and licensing adventure that was Terminator 2 and getting

[01:13:13] Arnie's voice in here is probably one of the greatest ever.

[01:13:17] They went all in here with this one, right?

[01:13:19] They had noticed what was going on with the data east of the world.

[01:13:23] The branding meant a lot.

[01:13:25] Chris Granger says, what Roger and our people offered, and Roger, I would assume he means

[01:13:30] Roger Sharp, who was the head of licensing for Williams.

[01:13:35] What Roger Sharp and our people offered, Carol Co. Pictures and Arnold, I don't even remember.

[01:13:40] It wasn't about money.

[01:13:41] It was more about, let's teach Hollywood about another version of the product placement.

[01:13:45] That's all we were offering.

[01:13:47] A pinball shop didn't have more to offer than some sort of cash A.

[01:13:50] Yeah, it's all about, it's all about, let's build some relationships, right?

[01:13:55] Let's kind of, let's get your face on a pinball machine.

[01:13:58] Let's get you in every piece of shop.

[01:14:00] Let's get that branding out there in another way.

[01:14:03] Now the branding is very different, right?

[01:14:05] The branding now is, how do I sell the machine?

[01:14:07] I need to have branding on it.

[01:14:09] We're back then, it was like, how can we sort of marry the two and get your product, Mr.

[01:14:14] Movie Maker, out in the field?

[01:14:16] I'm sure the guys with Guardians of the Galaxy and Marvel don't care about having a pinball

[01:14:20] machine, as much as I, David Dennis, care about having a branding of Guardians of the Galaxy

[01:14:26] in my house.

[01:14:27] There's also a DMD, but it's the first DMD with an asterisk.

[01:14:31] It was the first Williams DMD.

[01:14:34] Checkpoint actually had the first DMD.

[01:14:36] Dad at East beat him.

[01:14:37] It had the little tiny dot matrix.

[01:14:38] But it was, it was so not even cool, it was so small.

[01:14:42] It was so small, it was like half the, totally uniting.

[01:14:46] It was basically Alphanumerics really, it was me.

[01:14:49] Terminator 2 was the first Williams game they designed with the dot matrix display, but

[01:14:54] it had such a long development time, Gilligan's Island, beat it out, as the first one actually

[01:15:00] released with a DMD.

[01:15:01] So we're all about asterisk, because we would say this is the first one with a DMD.

[01:15:05] It's somebody be like, well, technically, Gilligan's Island came out three months before that,

[01:15:11] but I get it.

[01:15:12] It was in production earlier than this, but this was actually developed before that.

[01:15:16] So asterisk is all around.

[01:15:18] Since they were developing the game, while the movie was being made, if you've watched

[01:15:23] Terminator 2, it's based around the T1000, the new Terminator made out of liquid metal.

[01:15:31] So the T1000 was not included in the artwork of the game, except for a small image of

[01:15:36] Robert Patrick, the guy who played him, because of the pre-release secrecy of the movie.

[01:15:41] The character was only included in the display animation, because when the DMD programming

[01:15:45] was finalized, the liquid metal character was already public knowledge.

[01:15:49] There was nothing cooler than the T1000.

[01:15:51] No.

[01:15:52] Man, it was so good.

[01:15:53] That's so cool.

[01:15:54] It still holds up to this day in that movie, it's made 30 years ago.

[01:15:58] It was so good, and the character was played so perfect that even today, 30 years later,

[01:16:05] are struggling to try to come up with a cooler Terminator.

[01:16:08] Look, it's brutal.

[01:16:09] I think we're fan-boring a little.

[01:16:11] I love going a little on this, it's terminator.

[01:16:14] This weekend we're going to win watching it.

[01:16:15] Hold on, we're going to watch it again, yes.

[01:16:17] So good.

[01:16:18] Let's talk about that cannon.

[01:16:19] The first, you know, oscillating moving cannon.

[01:16:24] Steve Richie says, the cannon idea I had in Atari, that's a lot of time.

[01:16:28] I just didn't have the vehicle to make it happen.

[01:16:30] It's a simple thing.

[01:16:31] It's a kickback mounted to a motor that pivoted back and forth.

[01:16:33] And literally all it is, it's literally the kickback mechanism just moving.

[01:16:38] So people talk about Scott Dinesi and his Dinesi lock in TNA about taking stand-up targets

[01:16:44] and stacking balls on those targets, and just how like you're taking something and changing

[01:16:50] it and converting it into something totally different.

[01:16:53] So Steve Richie uses a kickback on the outlane of firepower.

[01:16:57] And then he takes that kickback in F14 and says, well, what if I turn it and face it

[01:17:01] towards the flippers?

[01:17:03] And now he's like, well, what if I just put it on a mount and rotate it and shoot?

[01:17:06] Like he's taking something that's been done before and just changing it into something

[01:17:10] new.

[01:17:11] So about the gun handle, Steve Richie said one time, I'm going to try this, that gun handle?

[01:17:17] Yeah, I don't know.

[01:17:19] I own a 45 and I like shooting.

[01:17:22] We just put it on.

[01:17:23] People like to shoot guns.

[01:17:24] Yes, they do.

[01:17:25] Yeah.

[01:17:26] Being a Canadian, I mean, I kind of get it, but you guys, you guys love your guns.

[01:17:31] Arnold Swartz and Edgar versus Williams.

[01:17:33] Arnold was really tough to get on board to do the callouts.

[01:17:37] And if you go back to the Head to Head pinball podcast, episode 71, Chris Granner, the legend

[01:17:44] of sound, tells an amazing story.

[01:17:48] This was really James Cameron's Big Breakout movie.

[01:17:51] Like he did some awesome, awesome movies.

[01:17:53] He did aliens and now T2 will just launch him into space where he is now.

[01:17:59] This was a juggernaut project.

[01:18:01] Arnold, who was at the point making successful movies over and over again.

[01:18:06] He was making a lot of money for his movies.

[01:18:09] He was really a celebrity at this point, but this was really sort of on the upswing of

[01:18:14] his celebrity.

[01:18:15] So he was in a totally different category at the time.

[01:18:18] And Chris Granner would say, Arnold was practically the first big celebrity that we had to

[01:18:22] deal with.

[01:18:23] We wanted to go and get stuff from the movie, but the movie hadn't been released, so we

[01:18:27] couldn't go in and get the dialogue from the movie.

[01:18:29] We had to write the script and assume we get Arnold to speak it.

[01:18:32] And they were like, wait a minute, Arnold's going to have to go to recording session for

[01:18:35] you guys?

[01:18:36] And we were like, yeah, we're bossy enough or naive enough to think we could even ask

[01:18:41] that question and not get laughed off the lot.

[01:18:44] They're like, give us an example of all the speech.

[01:18:47] Oh, like a sound I like to do it and send it over to us.

[01:18:51] So we send the tape off to them.

[01:18:52] And a couple of days later, we hear back and Arnold's like, not only am I not going to

[01:18:55] do this, you're not using a sound like we're not doing this.

[01:18:59] You're not putting my voice in this game.

[01:19:01] Steve Richie looks at Roger Sharp and says, if we don't get his voice, then what are we

[01:19:05] buying exactly?

[01:19:06] And Roger Sharp says, let me do something.

[01:19:08] Let me pull a rabbit out of my hat.

[01:19:10] The producer talks to Arnold says, we'll come to your trailer.

[01:19:13] We'll do it on a break.

[01:19:14] It'll take you 15 minutes.

[01:19:15] It'll be easy.

[01:19:16] Just do this.

[01:19:17] It's good PR on the film and it's good for us.

[01:19:19] So Arnold says, okay, so they did it and they did the recording in Arnold's trailer.

[01:19:24] He did every line twice.

[01:19:26] Everything sounds like the Terminator because he was the Terminator.

[01:19:29] So the back and forth between sort of Chris Granger and his engineering team in LA doing

[01:19:35] the shooting is epic, right?

[01:19:38] Like the summary that we just did here does not do that story justice.

[01:19:43] Go back to that head to head pinball podcast.

[01:19:45] It's in our show notes.

[01:19:47] The way Chris Granger tells it is a riot.

[01:19:50] He is so excited and funny.

[01:19:54] And in fact, this story is where the so called profanity ROM set for T2 comes from.

[01:20:01] Yeah, there is a profanity ROM, profanity ROM set where if you hit it in the one scoop,

[01:20:07] one of the awards that comes up is a certain quote.

[01:20:11] Chris Granger says the caper to the whole thing was when they're done recording it, all

[01:20:15] the call outs, he has Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[01:20:19] Okay, that's it.

[01:20:20] Anything else?

[01:20:21] Arnold says, yeah, then gets completely out of character and leans down to the mic and

[01:20:26] his voice drops a perfect fourth and says, fuck you asshole.

[01:20:31] We're all sitting in the studio listening to his tape and come back to us and we're like,

[01:20:34] yes, it was epic.

[01:20:36] Arnold said, if you asshole directly to me, directly to me, Chris Granger, my everlasting

[01:20:41] gift to pinball.

[01:20:43] So he was so excited to tell that, to tell that part of the story that you can tell that

[01:20:49] it was such a pain in the ass and they persisted and were really annoying to the point where

[01:20:53] Arnold had to do this recording and he probably didn't want to do it.

[01:20:57] But what's funny is Mr. Schwarzenegger would end up in a lot of other machines and he did

[01:21:03] all the call outs for those.

[01:21:05] Yeah, when he did Terminator 3, he was, he was very accommodating like, do you want me

[01:21:08] to do any more?

[01:21:09] You want me to do any more?

[01:21:10] And he was also in last action hero at Daddy East.

[01:21:14] His career wasn't in the same spot though.

[01:21:16] How true is that?

[01:21:17] So the invention of the video mode, the video mode is basically a mini video game in the

[01:21:23] pinball machine on the dot matrix display, which is controlled with the flipper buttons.

[01:21:27] And in some cases, the trigger or on some games, it was a reward or a mystery award, which

[01:21:33] breaks up the play field gameplay.

[01:21:36] Some people would say that it's actually in the machine to counter the attack that video

[01:21:42] games head on pinball.

[01:21:45] Pinball had been trying for years to sort of meld play field and video game together,

[01:21:50] which has been horrible, very, very bad.

[01:21:56] But they've sort of at least discovered now where there's a bit of a hybrid and it seems

[01:21:59] to have worked.

[01:22:00] Although some people, not a big fan of video mode.

[01:22:04] How do you feel about video mode?

[01:22:05] I tolerate them.

[01:22:06] They're good ones.

[01:22:07] They're bad ones.

[01:22:09] What's the best video mode?

[01:22:10] I always loved fish tails just hitting the jet skier here on the screen.

[01:22:16] Or the shooting the wolves in Dracula.

[01:22:21] Yeah, the Dracula one's pretty cool.

[01:22:23] I don't really mind the one in T2 actually.

[01:22:26] It's pretty simple.

[01:22:27] It's moved the cursor left, moved the cursor right.

[01:22:29] I see worse video modes.

[01:22:32] I mean, the one in Game of Thrones.

[01:22:35] I played that once.

[01:22:36] That was not good.

[01:22:37] I really hate the one in Star Wars.

[01:22:39] Flying the Millennium Falcon.

[01:22:40] Oh, that's okay.

[01:22:41] I don't mind that at all.

[01:22:44] You got to know when to thrust and when not to thrust.

[01:22:47] That's what she said.

[01:22:48] This play field design.

[01:22:49] Is it really the beginning of sort of a high flow era?

[01:22:52] Like, he's head flow before.

[01:22:55] But he hasn't had a high.

[01:22:56] This time he used the payback time feature, which is hitting the alternating ramps because

[01:23:02] each ramp would feed back to the flipper and then you could hit the opposite ramp.

[01:23:07] You crisscrossed back or crisscrossed back and forth and payback time.

[01:23:12] And it was used in that game and he would use it again in T3.

[01:23:17] He would use it for no apparent reason and no fear, which we'll talk about.

[01:23:21] It's in there a very back time.

[01:23:23] But that's major flow.

[01:23:26] And to the point where if I play any game where I can do that with the ramps, I think

[01:23:31] of payback time.

[01:23:32] I'm like, oh, you can do a payback time thing.

[01:23:34] Because other games had the same feature, but they would call it something else.

[01:23:38] Like Johnny Numanik.

[01:23:39] It's called Yakuza Strike, but it's literally payback time.

[01:23:42] It's the same.

[01:23:43] There's games that have that.

[01:23:44] Like fish tails.

[01:23:45] It's kind of the same sort of thing.

[01:23:46] Yeah, they have the mod.

[01:23:47] Yeah, it doesn't metallic.

[01:23:48] I could do that too, I think.

[01:23:49] Yes.

[01:23:50] If you go back and forth.

[01:23:51] It's a lot tighter shot on that line.

[01:23:53] Yeah, it's a lot tighter shot.

[01:23:54] It's the same concept.

[01:23:56] T2 was like the first game I can think of that did that.

[01:23:59] And did it so well.

[01:24:00] Hmm.

[01:24:01] Anywho, if you want to sell me a very, very nice T2 and you want to sell it really, really

[01:24:08] cheap because you feel bad that I don't have one, shoot me an email, uh, silverballcrontacles

[01:24:14] gmail.com 1992.

[01:24:16] It's time to get back behind the wheel.

[01:24:20] Very quickly, the turnaround here is into the next game, which is the getaway high speed

[01:24:25] two, which he had begun working on before Terminator 2.

[01:24:29] But now we're back to it.

[01:24:31] Yes.

[01:24:32] Solid state WPC, standard body sells 13,259 units, which is, which is huge.

[01:24:40] Another hit.

[01:24:41] Sound once again, Dan Forden, software Dwight Sullivan and Doug Watson did the Translight.

[01:24:47] Mark Spranger does the play field.

[01:24:50] Yep, duplicating his play field artwork style from the original high speed.

[01:24:55] Listener to the show Rockford replay from Pinside.

[01:24:58] That's a weird name.

[01:25:00] Rockford reaps.

[01:25:01] So his last name is replay.

[01:25:02] Maybe it's replay.

[01:25:03] Okay.

[01:25:04] In 1996, we traveled to West Bend, Wisconsin for a wedding.

[01:25:08] After the wedding at the hotel, I was combing the hallways in search of ice and vending machines.

[01:25:13] Walking past an open doorway, I peaked in and caught a glimpse of the getaway.

[01:25:17] As a car guy, I stopped, backed up and walked into the room for a closer look.

[01:25:21] Oh, police chase, street light, and a supercharger.

[01:25:25] I only played two credits.

[01:25:27] Back home that game was on my mind.

[01:25:29] Something about the gameplay, shifting gears, supercharger, and running from the cops.

[01:25:33] Over two decades later, a getaway pops up for sale and is located three blocks from

[01:25:37] where I'm employed.

[01:25:38] I'm bringing this one home.

[01:25:40] I actually felt like a loose end in my life had been resolved.

[01:25:43] I'm very thankful Steve created this game and even luckier to have one.

[01:25:46] You have one of these?

[01:25:48] Oh, yes.

[01:25:49] And you love it.

[01:25:50] My dad loves it even more.

[01:25:52] You love it.

[01:25:53] Dan in it.

[01:25:54] And it plays easy top.

[01:25:55] Yes.

[01:25:56] Lagrange.

[01:25:58] Lagrange, which is awesome.

[01:26:00] Yeah.

[01:26:01] So Steve invents another toy.

[01:26:03] One of the coolest toys of all time.

[01:26:04] One of the coolest toys, supercharger, which the funny thing is if you watch any of those

[01:26:08] promotional videos we were talking about earlier for the distributors, they say like how

[01:26:14] great a toy it is because it has no moving parts, which is not true.

[01:26:19] Lies.

[01:26:20] Lies.

[01:26:21] It has a diverter.

[01:26:22] If it had no moving parts, it would go around the supercharger forever.

[01:26:24] Which by the way is super fun.

[01:26:26] It is.

[01:26:27] And it is cool because it really just has the one moving part.

[01:26:31] And all the rest is just magnets.

[01:26:33] And it's integrated into the game very well.

[01:26:36] I had a friend of mine, Sean.

[01:26:38] He had one of these.

[01:26:40] And you just, you know, you shoot it up for a jackpot.

[01:26:43] It goes up into a ramp, which then kind of closes.

[01:26:49] And then it gets shot around in a circle really quick.

[01:26:52] And it's got this like weird grinding noise.

[01:26:56] The way the ball sort of shoots around because of this magnet.

[01:26:59] So the magnet pushes it around this thing and it goes, shh, shh, shh.

[01:27:03] Yep.

[01:27:04] There's three magnets that are positioned.

[01:27:07] You can't see them.

[01:27:08] They're covered up by that plastic piece with the three flashers off.

[01:27:11] Looks like an engine.

[01:27:12] Yeah.

[01:27:13] And then they have just a one little diverter that either makes it go around or makes it

[01:27:18] come out of the supercharger.

[01:27:20] Sometimes on mine it'll go too fast and the diverter will be too slow.

[01:27:23] And it'll just hit the diverter and then come down the ramp and drain.

[01:27:27] It's such a cool toy.

[01:27:29] And it's used so perfectly.

[01:27:30] It's used well.

[01:27:31] And it will move the entire machine.

[01:27:33] The entire machine will move with the supercharger.

[01:27:36] It's coated so well.

[01:27:37] And this is I think Dwight, one of the best things Dwight has ever done is that very quickly

[01:27:42] a player that kind of doesn't know much can toss it into the supercharger.

[01:27:48] It goes around like three times and then it comes out of the supercharger like the ramp

[01:27:52] pops up again and then it kind of zips around.

[01:27:55] Anybody can do that so easily just kind of quickly.

[01:27:58] So awesome.

[01:27:59] Because immediately you're like, oh my god, this is the coolest toy I've ever seen.

[01:28:02] And you don't have to have a lot of skill.

[01:28:04] It's not a bash toy.

[01:28:06] It's so unique.

[01:28:07] It's so cool.

[01:28:08] And like my first reaction to that supercharger was just like, this is awesome.

[01:28:13] Like right out of the gate.

[01:28:14] I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I said.

[01:28:16] So how about Steve Richie on the back glass here?

[01:28:18] Yeah.

[01:28:19] Yup.

[01:28:20] Doug Watson put him on the back glass.

[01:28:21] So he is driving the car.

[01:28:23] So you said there's some issues to the art on this game.

[01:28:27] You have Doug Watson's doing the translate.

[01:28:31] So you have Steve Richie is driving the car.

[01:28:34] And on the play field, it's a blonde guy and the cops are like, he's back or I'm back

[01:28:38] or whatever it says.

[01:28:40] And then on the DMD display, when you see the driver, which is supposed to be you, is

[01:28:47] like a crew cut.

[01:28:48] Yeah.

[01:28:49] So it's not quite.

[01:28:50] Yeah.

[01:28:51] The cop is there.

[01:28:52] He's back and the driver is there.

[01:28:54] Dave Javu.

[01:28:55] So cool.

[01:28:56] There are some really, I think unique bits to this.

[01:29:00] You can see that it is, it is high speed, too.

[01:29:04] It's the getaway, but it is high speed, too.

[01:29:06] It has a lot of the same unique, interesting pieces to it.

[01:29:12] It has the lightning fast orbit loop.

[01:29:15] It's got the third flipper into a repeatable shot.

[01:29:20] It's a top down look of a car chase on a highway.

[01:29:26] It has stop lights so the stand up targets are red, yellow, green.

[01:29:30] It has a stop light.

[01:29:31] You run the stop light.

[01:29:32] You start a multi ball.

[01:29:33] It has the RPMs.

[01:29:34] But one thing that is so cool about this game is he's gone and one up the gun handle

[01:29:42] launcher.

[01:29:44] And it is now a gear shift that you flick up and down like the gear shift of a car,

[01:29:51] which actually uses two switches.

[01:29:54] There's up and down.

[01:29:55] So you'll see a lot of getaways.

[01:29:57] They'll have like a test report and they'll say that one of the switches isn't working

[01:30:02] because everyone always shifts up.

[01:30:04] Yeah, that's the one that gets up.

[01:30:05] When you walk up, you shift up.

[01:30:06] No one ever shifts down.

[01:30:07] So every once in a while you'll get like, shift down hasn't been hit in so many games.

[01:30:11] It may be broken.

[01:30:12] The original high speed in our Python angel low episode, we spoke about how Python, you

[01:30:17] know, drew him drawing like a driving a Maserati, a very fancy sort of car.

[01:30:22] This one he's very much into Lamborghini.

[01:30:24] There's some really interesting features about this game as well because it did get

[01:30:30] cost it.

[01:30:31] There were some things that were taken out of this machine and one of them was a prototype

[01:30:36] mountain, which was mounted in the back of the game.

[01:30:40] So you can actually get these mountains now by the mod makers of pinball that they've

[01:30:46] taken a 3D printer and they've created a mountain that kind of sits back in that right

[01:30:51] corner.

[01:30:52] So you actually have a mountain in mind.

[01:30:53] Does it make it look cool?

[01:30:55] It's not from one of the newer modders.

[01:30:56] I actually don't like some of the newer ones that were out.

[01:30:59] The people who made mine are not around anymore, which I found out because it came with instructions

[01:31:04] that thank God I printed because if you try to go to the website, the website's not there

[01:31:08] anymore.

[01:31:09] It was supposed to be a mountain there and you can see it in the actual DMD.

[01:31:14] When you hit the ball into the one saucer, the DMD shows you going into a tunnel.

[01:31:19] Yes, you're supposed to be going into a tunnel.

[01:31:22] So yeah, that was cost it out.

[01:31:23] There's also a plastic on the top of the supercharger on the far right, which keeps the ball from

[01:31:28] sort of popping out.

[01:31:29] And it has a mountain printed on it as well.

[01:31:32] So you can sort of see the idea was, but it was cost it out.

[01:31:36] One of the great things in this hobby, especially now with 3D printing and all that stuff, are

[01:31:41] the mod makers are able to sort of complete the vision of the pinball machine or hide wires

[01:31:46] that were normally there.

[01:31:47] Another really, really cool mod is that you can get the donut heaven mod.

[01:31:53] You don't like that one?

[01:31:54] No, I don't like that one.

[01:31:56] There's like a ball lock on the right side.

[01:31:58] And it's in my opinion very ugly, the way that the ball comes up and locks into this thing

[01:32:03] and it just sits there.

[01:32:04] Now you can get a cover or in some people you can get a 3D printed house or even just stickers

[01:32:09] for that thing.

[01:32:10] And it looks like a like a Dunkin' Donuts or Tim Wartons, which I think is awesome.

[01:32:15] It's donut heaven and they show all the cops hanging out there.

[01:32:18] Get it?

[01:32:19] Nope.

[01:32:20] You don't get it?

[01:32:21] No, it's an American thing, I guess.

[01:32:24] Cops love donuts.

[01:32:25] No, Canadian police up here, they're just, you know, playing soccer out there with the

[01:32:29] kids and always exercising.

[01:32:32] So you have the Mounties, we have donuts.

[01:32:34] There are two versions of this game.

[01:32:36] So the manufacturer flyer shows the first version.

[01:32:38] So if you look on IPDB, you can see the first version in the flyer.

[01:32:41] But there's two versions.

[01:32:43] So some of the notable differences.

[01:32:44] Yeah, the first, there's very few of the first version.

[01:32:47] It might be only 100.

[01:32:48] I think I've only seen one of them.

[01:32:50] See, the first version is five gear inserts.

[01:32:53] You not have the curved text above them saying red line, RPM, to collect gear value.

[01:32:58] And the numbering below them is first, second, third, fourth, fifth without the word gear

[01:33:02] appearing on each one.

[01:33:04] The second version has the curved text and the original numbering includes the word gear,

[01:33:07] such as first gear, second gear, etc.

[01:33:10] First version has the word supercharger in front of the supercharger ramp entrance.

[01:33:13] The second version does not.

[01:33:15] This one added ball deflector to rear glass channel on later versions to prevent airballs

[01:33:19] from falling into the cabinet.

[01:33:21] That's actually not on a lot of the second version.

[01:33:25] That was added during the run.

[01:33:27] Because the ball fly off the supercharger, go over the back panel and end up in the cabinet.

[01:33:31] See, barcode added to the left return lane under the diamond coat on later version.

[01:33:35] The first version used a standard like smaller coil.

[01:33:40] Like the kind you would see in a kickback for the launch.

[01:33:42] Like the kind that was probably in a Terminator 2.

[01:33:44] But it just wasn't powerful enough to get all the way around the loop.

[01:33:48] So they used a much larger like a flipper size coil.

[01:33:53] The first version had a single playfield hinge.

[01:33:56] It had the old hinging playfield.

[01:33:59] So you couldn't pull the playfield out.

[01:34:01] To imagine trying to work on the supercharger.

[01:34:03] That would have been a pain.

[01:34:06] The early version also had two extra GI lights on the right side.

[01:34:08] The playfield, but they were removed to accommodate the new hinge system, which then

[01:34:12] what you started using for all the games.

[01:34:15] Interesting thing is, Adam's family that came out after Getaway has the pivoting playfield,

[01:34:21] not the new hinging system because their development is like over so long.

[01:34:25] Interesting.

[01:34:26] The first version cabinet front decal shows headlights of the car from the back glass instead of

[01:34:30] saying they get away.

[01:34:32] And really, you don't want to first run one.

[01:34:35] You don't want the original.

[01:34:36] It's not the more fancy collectible one.

[01:34:39] Yeah, well, there's hardly any of them.

[01:34:41] And you don't want the hinging playfield.

[01:34:44] You want the new playfield mount, which was one of the best ever made.

[01:34:49] That's why everyone ripped it off or tried to rip it off.

[01:34:53] Basically, you can just lift the playfield up, actually pull it out and then put it up.

[01:34:59] But it allowed you to get to all the stuff in the back of the game, which would be a big

[01:35:03] deal later on as we started putting more and more crap in the back of the game.

[01:35:07] Yeah, once things get a lot more complicated, being able to get under and out of them.

[01:35:11] And one thing that's stern did is in a costing effort sort of around the financial crisis

[01:35:16] was they put those pegs in instead of service rails.

[01:35:19] Yeah, round.

[01:35:20] I think Ironman, NBA Ironman, Ironman might have been the first.

[01:35:25] I think Ironman had the pegs.

[01:35:28] And then they did the deal where like the pros would have pegs, but the premiums would

[01:35:33] have rails.

[01:35:35] And then they finally like, no, everything gets a rail again.

[01:35:38] Yeah, and that'll be the first to go if something else happens in the industry.

[01:35:42] But you can see that in this time of, you know, they're not so much costing things out

[01:35:50] of the game that make the operators life easier.

[01:35:54] So if it's something that they can, like for example, let's take the mountain out of the

[01:35:57] game and make sure that we change this hinge system, right?

[01:36:00] If it makes the operators life easier, they're willing to sort of put that money in pinball

[01:36:05] is a business and sometimes items get cut from the final thing to cost save.

[01:36:08] And that's just how it goes.

[01:36:10] We're going to do a whole Dwight Sullivan episode.

[01:36:12] I've got more stuff on Terminator 2.

[01:36:14] I've got more stuff on the getaway from Dwight Sullivan's perspective.

[01:36:17] So I want to move on to the next thing here.

[01:36:20] 1993 Steve Richie.

[01:36:21] He's voiced many things in his career.

[01:36:24] He's tons of his games, tons of other things, but one of the most famous things he ever

[01:36:28] did were the callouts for Mortal Kombat.

[01:36:32] If you took Terminator 2 in the amount of nostalgia around that, Mortal Kombat, Mortal

[01:36:37] Kombat 2, it's like 1A, 1B.

[01:36:40] Like Mortal Kombat was so huge when I was a kid in such an awesome big deal.

[01:36:45] When I found out three years ago that Steve Richie was the voice of Mortal Kombat

[01:36:49] Shao Khan, I almost crap my pants.

[01:36:53] Fight, fatality, flawless victory.

[01:36:56] And if you got a couple of drinks in to Steve, he'll do that for you just like he was

[01:36:59] sitting in the studio from before.

[01:37:01] It's amazing.

[01:37:03] So do you have any favorite Steve Richie callouts throughout his career?

[01:37:06] Anything that Skull says, shoot the rap for more time in bigger points.

[01:37:11] Look at that in just a minute.

[01:37:13] Anything is a bad guy.

[01:37:15] Anything laughing at me.

[01:37:17] Oh, like if we want to go one of my favorite early ones, I probably would have said this

[01:37:22] on the first episode, Black Knight.

[01:37:25] If you hit the Magna Save Too late and it drains, you just literally laughs at you.

[01:37:29] The callouts I think for sort of rage are pretty amazing.

[01:37:32] Oh, there.

[01:37:33] Because he's had like 30 years of thinking about what the Black Knight would say or do in

[01:37:40] the next game and it really came out well.

[01:37:44] Give me your money.

[01:37:46] We're stand up and fight the intro, the multiple, stand up and fight.

[01:37:50] Now allegedly Steve Richie came up with the name mortal combat and it was originally

[01:37:56] just called combat before his suggestion of mortal combat.

[01:38:00] Now I don't know how true that is.

[01:38:02] I've heard that.

[01:38:03] I thought I heard it the other way.

[01:38:04] It was going to be called mortal and he added the combat.

[01:38:07] So that's funny.

[01:38:08] So there you go.

[01:38:09] There you go.

[01:38:10] We've reconciled that Steve Richie was somehow involved in the naming of the game, but

[01:38:14] nobody's really sure how.

[01:38:16] Now we've got to move on to something pretty, pretty unique and pretty cool and we're going

[01:38:21] to go where no pin has gone before except those two other machines that did start trek as

[01:38:26] well.

[01:38:27] Heaviest complex machines ever devised.

[01:38:30] Yeah.

[01:38:31] It's time to call Steve Richie.

[01:38:33] I think at this time, you know, the king of the license, right?

[01:38:36] He's the king of flow, but man, he is the king of the license at the moment and he's got

[01:38:39] some big named licenses.

[01:38:42] If you wanted to sell 10,000 units, you put Steve Richie on your license and it might not

[01:38:48] have worked later on in his stern career, but I'll tell you what, start trek the next generation.

[01:38:55] Man, Star Trek was huge in the 90s.

[01:38:58] Huge in the 90s, especially the next generation.

[01:39:01] It was all of a sudden now you're getting conventions and they had their own thing at

[01:39:06] Las Vegas.

[01:39:07] They did movies, potato chip bags, had little trading cards in them.

[01:39:12] Star Trek was massive and they put Steve Richie to make the next generation.

[01:39:16] Yeah.

[01:39:17] The Star Trek next gen license was difficult to get.

[01:39:19] In the first meeting they had, Roger Sharp to set up the meeting, they sat down with

[01:39:26] this, I guess, woman who was in charge of the license and they told them, you know, no

[01:39:31] phasers, no shooting, no fighting, but not nothing.

[01:39:34] You can't do anything like that.

[01:39:35] Yeah, you don't want anything that makes the show fun.

[01:39:37] And Steve Richie was like, you know, I, I, because he was a fan of the show and he's

[01:39:42] like, I'm not going to make it space pirates from Fing hell.

[01:39:45] That was just exactly what I was saying.

[01:39:47] Nice.

[01:39:48] The meeting did not go well.

[01:39:50] Roger Sharp's seat, if he could salvage something, they ended up getting a hold of someone

[01:39:54] else in the licensing department.

[01:39:56] Instead of the initial person they talked to that were much more friendly or they were

[01:40:01] like, sure, sounds good.

[01:40:04] You can really tell that Steve Richie will have some sort of vision and he's, he is part

[01:40:11] of the licensing.

[01:40:13] Like he really, he really is in there.

[01:40:14] Now he's not getting the license.

[01:40:16] He's not supporting license.

[01:40:17] But when somebody comes to him and says, Star Trek, the next generation, he kind of says,

[01:40:20] okay, I need these elements and he's part of negotiating those elements.

[01:40:25] So you can see that he's he's bought in to the Star Trek name and his vision.

[01:40:30] And if you can't get, you know, phasers or aliens or, you know, fighting, you know, what

[01:40:35] else do you want for Star Trek?

[01:40:37] You didn't just play the game.

[01:40:38] You played the show.

[01:40:39] You ever watched an X-Den?

[01:40:40] Yeah.

[01:40:41] Did I ever?

[01:40:42] I was all in.

[01:40:43] That was my Star Trek.

[01:40:44] I mean, I watch the original show as a little kid, but definitely next gen was my, that's

[01:40:50] my show.

[01:40:51] I would watch the original series when I would come home from school.

[01:40:55] It was like Star Trek, the original series or Batman 66 kind of on TV when I would

[01:41:00] come home as a reruns.

[01:41:02] I watched a lot of next generation.

[01:41:04] I enjoyed deep space nine, but not to the level of next generation, but my jam was really

[01:41:11] voyager because it fell within that sort of like 13, 14 year old age, 12, 13, 14, but

[01:41:19] it was also sort of more actiony and more explosiony stuff, which was pretty cool.

[01:41:25] And of course, it had the Borg, like come on, like the post of first contact Borg.

[01:41:31] So yeah, I was, I was all in on Star Trek, for sure.

[01:41:35] Steve Richie would say that Star Trek, the next generation was the greatest collaboration

[01:41:39] of talent on any game I ever did.

[01:41:42] More spectacularly talented people were involved than any other game.

[01:41:46] Great stuff.

[01:41:47] So all hands prepare for stats.

[01:41:50] Make it sound number one.

[01:41:51] Please sci-fi Star Trek theme November of 93, solid state Williams WPC.

[01:41:58] Now this is a DCS WPC system.

[01:42:01] It's a wide body, which we haven't seen Steve Richie do in a long time.

[01:42:05] What was the last wide body game he did?

[01:42:07] Listeners, do you remember from episode one?

[01:42:11] Did you say stellar wars?

[01:42:13] Ding, ding, ding.

[01:42:15] If you answered that correctly, send us an email to civilball Chronicles at gmail.com and

[01:42:19] we'll enter you into a secret draw for a prize which we will reveal next month.

[01:42:25] 11,728 units, Dan Fordon on music, Dwight Sullivan on software.

[01:42:31] He's able to handle Steve Richie, so they probably just keep feeding him to the lion,

[01:42:36] poor Dwight, and Greg Ferris on art.

[01:42:40] The first time Greg has worked with Steve.

[01:42:43] So this is part of Williams' Balli midways, super pin line of wide bodies.

[01:42:50] So what's a super pin?

[01:42:53] It's wider.

[01:42:54] They all of a sudden came up with this concept of retrying the wide body, right?

[01:42:59] The wide body became a big deal because Atari made them and then everybody freaked out

[01:43:03] that they need to make this wide body in case it was the next greatest invention and

[01:43:07] they don't want to miss out.

[01:43:09] And then they kind of disappeared.

[01:43:11] And now they're back.

[01:43:12] I'm trying to remember how much wider.

[01:43:14] These were not paragon wide.

[01:43:16] I always go by the play field glass.

[01:43:18] I think the standard play field glass is 43 by 21.

[01:43:22] So 43 inches by 21.

[01:43:23] I think these were like 23 and 3 quarters or something.

[01:43:27] So as much wider, they were only like two and a half inches or so, maybe three at the

[01:43:31] most wider.

[01:43:32] Yeah, wide bodies, the ball tends to travel further.

[01:43:36] Like if you're shooting the far left, the far right, the very back of the play field

[01:43:41] in the corners, the ball takes a little longer to get back there and it's kind of noticeable.

[01:43:47] It's not off putting.

[01:43:49] It's not like, I'm never going to play that ever again, but it's, it takes a little longer

[01:43:53] and you're kind of waiting for that ball to come back.

[01:43:55] A lot of people describe them as floaty, right?

[01:43:58] So the ball just kind of floats around.

[01:44:01] There's so much wide open space.

[01:44:02] Well, they haven't played any of those old stirons from one of our first episodes.

[01:44:07] Those wide bodies aren't floating.

[01:44:09] That's right.

[01:44:10] Keeping count, that's the fourth time Ron has tried to pump stern.

[01:44:14] They got to go on.

[01:44:17] They made the right choice.

[01:44:19] Stern made the right choice.

[01:44:20] They're a little bit wider.

[01:44:21] They're not huge.

[01:44:22] They also made various play field positioning that made it a lot better.

[01:44:27] Super pins are going to pop up in the Barry Eister episode.

[01:44:30] They're going to pop up in our Pat Lawler episode, you know, the Mark Richey one, whenever

[01:44:36] I start writing something about him.

[01:44:39] But those, they were really popular at this sort of 93 to like 95, right?

[01:44:45] Like all of a sudden it was like, everything was a super pin.

[01:44:47] Yeah, it was twilight zone and the last one was, what was the last one?

[01:44:52] It's a pop eye.

[01:44:53] Yeah, pop eye, pop eye wasn't it?

[01:44:54] I don't have it in front of me, but yeah.

[01:44:56] I mean, the thing is, once again, we have the return of the Picarbonuvershot.

[01:45:02] Yeah, this is where it gets the name.

[01:45:04] The left orbit up to the upper right flipper, up the ramp.

[01:45:08] He does it again.

[01:45:09] Keep in count.

[01:45:10] You can just check that off again.

[01:45:11] Yep.

[01:45:12] Almost a bingo.

[01:45:14] People say this is like the most complicated machine ever built.

[01:45:18] What is a subway?

[01:45:20] Subway is just what it says.

[01:45:22] It's a way to get the ball from one area to the play field to the other, but underneath

[01:45:26] the game so you don't see it.

[01:45:28] Handsome subway.

[01:45:29] It's like it's like a plastic habit trail.

[01:45:33] It goes in a hole, some coils, kick it down, and then it pops up somewhere else.

[01:45:38] It's like magic.

[01:45:39] And on Star Trek, it is insane.

[01:45:43] It has three large ball popper units, each with a set of optos.

[01:45:48] We're going to detect more than one ball.

[01:45:51] Then it has a full subway system with two diverters and six balls, three in the ball

[01:45:57] trough, and then one in each of the three ball poppers.

[01:46:00] So if you put six balls in the game and turn it on, it will fire three of the balls to

[01:46:06] the back and you will literally hear the diverters activate and you'll hear the balls

[01:46:10] load and each ball popper.

[01:46:11] Dwight Sullivan, he was on the special wind lit podcast, which I'll include in our show

[01:46:16] notes.

[01:46:17] He takes a lot, he's all about complexity, and he says that the complexity in this machine

[01:46:22] was more or less his fault.

[01:46:24] So I'm going to try to read this like Dwight Sullivan.

[01:46:27] I said to Steve, I said, what'd it be great if the ball went down here and then popped

[01:46:32] up over here?

[01:46:33] And then it popped up over there or over there.

[01:46:34] Basically it was all my fault.

[01:46:35] He just kept popping up around.

[01:46:37] Does that sound like Dwight Sullivan?

[01:46:39] Pretty much, yeah.

[01:46:40] Jerry Thompson is the main sound guy at Stern right now.

[01:46:44] Pretty much does just about every game's music at this point.

[01:46:48] And he's good.

[01:46:49] And he's good.

[01:46:50] And at a convention, he says he cuts Steve to sign his Star Trek next gen translate.

[01:46:56] And Steve said, you have one of those?

[01:46:58] And I said, yeah.

[01:46:59] He said, does it work?

[01:47:01] He replied.

[01:47:02] And he said, yes, it does.

[01:47:03] And Steve said, oh, that's rare.

[01:47:05] Yeah.

[01:47:06] So that's like the joke.

[01:47:07] The joke?

[01:47:08] Yes.

[01:47:09] Steve pretty much said the same thing to me when I said I owned it.

[01:47:12] So he uses that one a lot.

[01:47:13] When I went to go by my Simpsons pinball party, I went to a collector's home and he had a

[01:47:19] next gen.

[01:47:20] And it was just, it was beautiful.

[01:47:22] Just a beautiful next gen.

[01:47:24] It had been powder coated.

[01:47:25] It was in wonderful shape.

[01:47:27] And I told him this story because I was doing this research for this episode.

[01:47:30] And I said, hey, here's this story that I hear.

[01:47:32] And the joke that Steve Richie has is that it never works because it's too complicated.

[01:47:36] And buddy told me, oh, no, works fantastic.

[01:47:38] It's great.

[01:47:39] It's no problem.

[01:47:40] And then he went to play it and sure shit.

[01:47:42] The ball got stuck.

[01:47:43] I couldn't believe it.

[01:47:45] And I felt so bad.

[01:47:46] I felt so bad that I told him this story.

[01:47:48] And then his Star Trek next gen just stopped working.

[01:47:52] Biggest issue with next gen is just the sheer amount of optos.

[01:47:56] Optic sensors the thing has.

[01:47:58] And if any of them are not working and it doesn't know where the balls are, you'll

[01:48:02] start getting the issue where it just keeps firing balls out.

[01:48:05] It gets confused.

[01:48:06] It ends up in permanent ball search.

[01:48:10] Producer of the show Dennis Kreisel would say, this is the greatest sound package that

[01:48:15] has ever been made ever, ever, ever.

[01:48:17] I don't know, sound package.

[01:48:18] It's the greatest speech package.

[01:48:20] Just in fact that you have every cast member.

[01:48:22] Every single cast member.

[01:48:24] Every single one.

[01:48:26] And if you talk, if you told the next gen fan, like we have every regular cast member,

[01:48:31] maybe like, well, did you get Q?

[01:48:33] Did you get him?

[01:48:34] Maybe yes, we got Q also, which would be John Delancey.

[01:48:37] It's like holy crap, you did get everybody.

[01:48:40] Except Wesley, but you know, he left that time.

[01:48:43] So who cares?

[01:48:44] Who cares about what?

[01:48:45] Who cares?

[01:48:46] Wesley, the stupid turtle neck.

[01:48:49] Shut up Wesley.

[01:48:50] Escapt in Picard would say.

[01:48:53] One of the cool things and very few people know this.

[01:48:56] Each member of the cast that did the voiceovers.

[01:48:59] They each got a machine for doing the voiceovers.

[01:49:02] Yep, and most of them were owned by collectors now.

[01:49:05] Yeah, so what they did is they had special voice roms in them with all of the outtakes from

[01:49:15] their speech.

[01:49:17] So if they were warming up their voice or they flubbed a word or they said something funny,

[01:49:21] most of them were like, we will never surrender unless you pay us enough.

[01:49:25] Yeah, exactly.

[01:49:26] Yeah, exactly.

[01:49:27] Those sound rom chips are different in just those machines.

[01:49:31] They are outrageously collectible, in my opinion, if you can get one of those.

[01:49:36] Well, you can get the roms.

[01:49:37] They're freely of them.

[01:49:38] Yeah, but if you can get the one, the machine that was actually from that individual.

[01:49:42] Yeah, I know two that were sold Beverly Crusher.

[01:49:45] I'm not going to remember their names.

[01:49:47] Beverly Crusher's was sold to.

[01:49:49] It's Mick Fadden.

[01:49:50] He's a Gase McFadden to the, I think his name is Greg Colton.

[01:49:54] He's one of the family guide directors.

[01:49:56] He's on Pinside.

[01:49:57] He bought that one.

[01:49:59] I don't know if he still has it.

[01:50:00] And I know Warf's sold his...

[01:50:01] He was on one of the final episodes of Canadian Spinball Podcast talking about that pin, I

[01:50:05] think.

[01:50:06] Yeah, and he was on, and Warf sold his, sorry, Warf, what's Warf's name?

[01:50:11] I know all the character names I know the actual name.

[01:50:13] It's all that matters.

[01:50:14] Yeah, so Warf sold his also.

[01:50:16] So that's at least two, that's at least two that are owned by collectors now and not

[01:50:20] by the cast members.

[01:50:21] So...

[01:50:22] Yeah, was it Michael Dorn?

[01:50:23] Michael Dorn, yeah.

[01:50:24] Yeah.

[01:50:25] I don't think either of them ever...

[01:50:26] I know Gase McFadden was just like in a box.

[01:50:29] He never opened it.

[01:50:30] That's crazy talk.

[01:50:32] Like she would care though, really.

[01:50:33] Like, nah, she wouldn't care.

[01:50:34] What's better than just one oscillating cannon from Terminator 2?

[01:50:39] 2!

[01:50:40] Now, I personally think that Steve Richie's standards might be too high.

[01:50:46] He always, he will always find something with his machines that he wishes he could improve

[01:50:50] on.

[01:50:51] Well, I agree with him in this case, because Steve says the one thing I've been doing

[01:50:54] is the side arrangement, the slings.

[01:50:57] As soon as I made the decision to put the cannons on the slingshots, it changed the movement

[01:51:01] too much.

[01:51:02] Superman and Stellar Wars, he put those slings exactly where they would be on a standard

[01:51:06] body.

[01:51:07] This one, because he put those cannons on there to shoot the ball, he had to move them

[01:51:11] out a little bit.

[01:51:12] Well, it's the shape of the skeet, too.

[01:51:14] There was just a bizarre shape.

[01:51:16] So it floats weird down there.

[01:51:19] And anything going near the inline out lane is going for the outlane.

[01:51:22] It just gets sucked in.

[01:51:23] It's like a black hole.

[01:51:25] Plus by default, the kickback doesn't start lit on default settings, which I never

[01:51:29] could understand.

[01:51:30] Yeah, it's done.

[01:51:31] That's so weird, because he has it lit on almost every other game at Game Star, but not

[01:51:36] Star Trek.

[01:51:37] If we move on to that, I got some really great stories around Star Trek, the next generation,

[01:51:42] which I want to save for the Dwight Sullivan episode.

[01:51:44] But there's lots of really cool stuff, because it's such an iconic machine.

[01:51:48] It's such a big deal in pinball that there's a lot of stories about Star Trek, the next

[01:51:54] generation that I want to spread out.

[01:51:57] So we're moving into night, Johnny Ford.

[01:51:59] Let's face it.

[01:52:00] Okay.

[01:52:01] Steve Richie is cooler than me.

[01:52:03] And I think he's cooler than most people.

[01:52:06] And on top of that, he actually is like a huge motocross fan.

[01:52:12] He's driven porches by getting caught by the police.

[01:52:17] He's met tons of celebrities.

[01:52:19] He had a mallet.

[01:52:22] Steve Richie is much cooler than I am or ever will be to make him even cooler.

[01:52:27] So if you watch the no fear promo video, Steve goes into detail as to what was the inspiration

[01:52:34] between the inspiration for the extreme no fear pinball machine.

[01:52:40] He says, oh, yeah, there's the missing fingertip.

[01:52:43] A Labor Day 1994, I lost my fingertip, left ring finger and a weird dirt bike accident.

[01:52:49] It went in the rear sprocket and snipped it off.

[01:52:51] Oh, ow.

[01:52:53] Ah.

[01:52:54] I looped it on a cliff jump.

[01:52:56] It wasn't a flying W. I dropped straight down through the air and could not push the bike

[01:52:59] away from me.

[01:53:00] The bars were ripped from my hands when the bike and I landed.

[01:53:03] We slid down the face of the cliff together and I guess my hands were flailing around.

[01:53:07] Man, what a badass.

[01:53:09] Who's that whole heart, that whole quote?

[01:53:12] I'm like, man, he's so much cooler than me.

[01:53:14] I think they found the finger but they couldn't reattach it.

[01:53:16] Yeah.

[01:53:17] My story is the one time I took off the treads on my deck stairs because the treads were

[01:53:29] sort of rotting a little bit and I took it off and then I realized the stringers or

[01:53:36] the runners underneath were all rotten and had to fall apart and then I had to build deck

[01:53:40] stairs.

[01:53:42] That's about as exciting as my life gets here, man.

[01:53:45] Sintillating.

[01:53:46] Are you sitting on the edge of your seat?

[01:53:47] I should have standing right now.

[01:53:49] Man, you're so loud.

[01:53:50] I had to stand.

[01:53:51] Yeah, so hunched over.

[01:53:52] When we move into 1995, it's been 18 months since Steve Richie's super cool Star Trek

[01:53:58] the next generation.

[01:53:59] 18 months is a long time to go for Steve Richie before making a pinball machine, right?

[01:54:04] His next longest stint was really 10 years.

[01:54:08] And one of the reasons for that was at the time when you get around 1995, he actually had

[01:54:14] the George Gomez role.

[01:54:16] That George Gomez currently has a stern pinball.

[01:54:18] He was basically head of manufacturing or head of whatever it's called.

[01:54:22] So he was not doing games.

[01:54:24] So what happened is Williams had a very small little window in their production schedule

[01:54:30] where they didn't have any games that were going to be made.

[01:54:33] So to keep the factory moving, Steve came up with no fear in a very short period.

[01:54:39] It was no fear dangerous sports.

[01:54:43] It's sports, extreme sports, and it's kind of a license.

[01:54:46] And it was his last good art package until sort of rage.

[01:54:51] May 1995.

[01:54:54] It is a WPC-S.

[01:54:58] 4,540 units.

[01:55:00] Dan Forden on Music and Sound Software by Matt Collary and Art by Greg Ferris.

[01:55:07] Now Edward Partridge from Facebook, you'll remember Edward because he's the one that hijacked

[01:55:12] our Steve Richie and Gottlieb System One poll.

[01:55:16] He says, no fear.

[01:55:19] You lost me on this one, Steve.

[01:55:21] So what's the deal with no fear, Ron?

[01:55:24] It's actually a license which I didn't even know.

[01:55:26] No fears, T-shirts were popular in the mid-90s to early 2000s.

[01:55:31] And I did not know this.

[01:55:33] Shirts typically featured existential slogans or quotes that touted the virtues of extreme

[01:55:37] sports, extreme.

[01:55:39] Common themes included fear of death, lack of laziness, contempt for social norms, and

[01:55:43] the law.

[01:55:44] And the other thing is when he debuted this game at one of the trade shows, he did so riding

[01:55:49] in on a motorcycle.

[01:55:50] Of course he did.

[01:55:51] Because Steve Richie is cool with me.

[01:55:53] There's a video.

[01:55:54] He rides in on a dirt bike, comes in, they got the blanket over the machine, and he just

[01:56:02] pulls it like there it is, and then he rides off.

[01:56:06] You know, if I unveiled a pinball machine, we'd do it probably in one of two ways.

[01:56:11] One of them would be Canadian Mounty.

[01:56:13] Would be riding in on a golf cart with a hockey stick, some Tim Hortons donuts, and a six

[01:56:21] pack of Mollsen, and enough Poutine to feed the entire group there.

[01:56:26] Or I would do the next best thing that comes to mind, which would be to take my very expensive

[01:56:32] pinball machine, cover it in garbage bags and tape, and then unveil it to everybody.

[01:56:38] So I remember no fear, because I'm from rural Canada, and no fear was very much a cool

[01:56:48] brand, because it was very extreme sports and hunting, and it was really big in that

[01:56:55] community.

[01:56:58] It also had its knockoffs, like no surrender.

[01:57:01] People and their like Chevy Cavaliers would have the no fear stickers on them.

[01:57:06] It was huge in the sort of mid late 90s.

[01:57:10] It made no sense to me, because I was not of that, it wasn't their target demographic,

[01:57:15] I guess.

[01:57:16] But you were not extreme.

[01:57:17] I was not extreme.

[01:57:19] Like I said, golf cart Tim Hortons and Poutine.

[01:57:22] Having a pinball machine after a clothing company, we're seeing a bit of a decline here

[01:57:27] in the quality of licenses, aren't we?

[01:57:29] Yeah, this particular one.

[01:57:30] So Greg Ferris and Steve Richie, once again, do the voices.

[01:57:35] Greg Ferris, he would be wise guy, one of the characters in the game, Steve Richie being

[01:57:41] Skull, who is in the middle of the play field.

[01:57:45] Steve Richie and Greg actually wrote the scripts together.

[01:57:48] And you say this is your best call out package?

[01:57:51] Well, he used so many quotes from this game on other games, continually.

[01:57:58] Play better, which is just part of, he's used that in multiple games.

[01:58:02] That's in Spider-Man.

[01:58:03] It's in Spider-Man.

[01:58:04] It's in ACDC.

[01:58:05] Pinball is not a spectator sport.

[01:58:07] That's also in Spider-Man.

[01:58:09] He just reused the whole, even the voice he does in ACDC, it's basically

[01:58:14] Skull.

[01:58:15] Yeah, it's the Steve Richie voice, isn't it?

[01:58:16] Play better.

[01:58:17] I love it.

[01:58:18] I'm in a minority here, but whatever.

[01:58:20] Steve says most of my games are pretty rowdy.

[01:58:23] With a name like No Fear, it had to be quick and somewhat dangerous game.

[01:58:26] At least it should feel like that.

[01:58:28] The game comes off like it's very violent me, but I think most people found it pretty

[01:58:32] forgiving.

[01:58:33] Okay, I didn't mind brutal.

[01:58:35] There are breaks in the game if you choose to take them.

[01:58:37] What is wrong with physical play?

[01:58:39] I think that's when you're physically involved in the game, you enjoy it more and will

[01:58:42] remember it.

[01:58:43] And funny thing about No Fear, Steve also says during No Fear it was incredibly difficult

[01:58:47] to design the game and watch over others designs, hence hit the George Gomez role.

[01:58:52] No Fear became a rushed project and probably suffered a little for it.

[01:58:56] I talked with Steve before.

[01:58:58] He wanted to do one more whitewood and he wanted to remove a shot.

[01:59:02] He felt it had too many shots, which if you've ever played it and you start hitting posts

[01:59:07] galore because all the shots are so tight and there's so many of them, you can see where

[01:59:11] it was coming from.

[01:59:12] Yes, we probably wanted to open up something and ramp or an orbit to make it little.

[01:59:16] But then again, he took the shot under the skull.

[01:59:20] It's the same shot that's in Star Wars.

[01:59:23] Yeah.

[01:59:24] He reused that.

[01:59:25] Plus he, he sort of reused the supercharger kind of.

[01:59:30] It uses the same mechanism.

[01:59:31] He go up the ramp.

[01:59:32] It has three magnets.

[01:59:34] Except now, you are the supercharger, what you're flipper trying to keep the jump going

[01:59:39] over and over and over.

[01:59:41] There's no fear.

[01:59:42] It's no fear of bad game.

[01:59:43] Not to me, Nate.

[01:59:44] I mean, it's, it doesn't take long.

[01:59:46] It's not roller games.

[01:59:47] Let's put it that way.

[01:59:48] It doesn't take long to get to the wizard mode, but I almost never get there because it's

[01:59:52] just hard.

[01:59:53] At a friend of mine had a no fear and he enjoyed it.

[01:59:55] I never did get to play it.

[01:59:57] But it was just not, it was not right.

[01:59:59] He just did, I don't know.

[02:00:00] He couldn't get into it.

[02:00:01] The thing to remember is a lot of the modes are rip offs of Star Trek.

[02:00:04] Next gen.

[02:00:05] Oh, interesting.

[02:00:06] Literally.

[02:00:07] Exactly.

[02:00:08] Okay, Skydive is the same as Asteroid.

[02:00:11] Asteroid, you hit a shot and it locks in a value and then all the shots are letting you

[02:00:15] hit them.

[02:00:16] The exact same thing in no fear.

[02:00:17] The next gen has the one mode where you hit the side ramp once and it's over.

[02:00:21] I can't remember which one that was.

[02:00:24] In no fear, it's the skiing one.

[02:00:25] You hit the right ramp and it's over.

[02:00:27] They just copied some of the modes.

[02:00:29] They're literally the same rules.

[02:00:31] What's really cool and unique about the game is the skull character.

[02:00:35] So there's the no fear logo had a skull in it in some of their designs.

[02:00:40] Yep.

[02:00:41] And he comes to life and put this skull in the middle of the play field and his jaw moves.

[02:00:45] He talks and he's noisy.

[02:00:48] That's just so I had to put all kinds of dampening around mind.

[02:00:52] So it's not as loud.

[02:00:53] You don't want to be playing it with the glass off because you'll hear you'll hear more

[02:00:55] of the creaking of the jaw than you well him actually singing or talking.

[02:01:01] The other interesting thing about no fear is I don't know if they did this on any other

[02:01:05] game.

[02:01:06] If you know, please email us at silver bowl chronicles at gmail.com but no fear has a different

[02:01:11] play field mounting system.

[02:01:13] That's what Williams usually used.

[02:01:15] If you look at the cabinet and you're at IPDB right now, you look at the side of the cabinet

[02:01:19] and you notice there's no bolts.

[02:01:22] The two bolts that are usually on each side where the the mounting is.

[02:01:25] Oh, interesting.

[02:01:26] They're not there.

[02:01:28] They actually cut the inside of the cabinet and the play field rides along the cut.

[02:01:34] It actually sucks kind of.

[02:01:36] It's way harder to pull the play field out and push it back in.

[02:01:40] I don't know if they did this with any other games, but I know they do with no fear.

[02:01:45] Yeah.

[02:01:46] And this is we're getting into that sort of period of decline, right?

[02:01:49] It's not right at the beginning.

[02:01:52] It's not right at the end.

[02:01:53] It's kind of right in the middle where we're declining.

[02:01:56] We're declining by 95, 96.

[02:01:58] Yeah.

[02:01:59] Things are, you know, 95 is really where it starts to fall.

[02:02:03] It doesn't fall off a cliff, but it really does.

[02:02:05] You got those big major hits of like 91 to 94.

[02:02:10] And now it really starts to taper off.

[02:02:12] It really is not going to happen.

[02:02:15] Yeah.

[02:02:16] You don't have games selling 10,000 units anymore.

[02:02:17] Yeah.

[02:02:18] Video games and video games really taking over.

[02:02:22] People aren't going out sort of the millennials, the younger generation of the time and Gen X.

[02:02:30] You guys are graduating college university.

[02:02:35] You're getting out into your real life.

[02:02:37] You're too busy to go to an arcade or things like that.

[02:02:40] You're having your kids.

[02:02:42] My generation, I'm in my mid 30s.

[02:02:45] You know, at that time, I'm in sort of middle school, high school.

[02:02:52] I'm here more at home now, right?

[02:02:54] We're playing video games at home.

[02:02:56] Television is really big now.

[02:02:58] Families in general aren't going out for entertainment, right?

[02:03:02] We're being entertained at home, but we're going out for food, where it was kind of the opposite before,

[02:03:08] where you would go out for entertainment and you would eat at home.

[02:03:11] So, you know, society has changed a little bit.

[02:03:14] And pinball has sort of shown that is the people aren't going out and playing.

[02:03:19] And this is where we can kind of wrap up this episode.

[02:03:21] This was Steve Richie's last game at Williams.

[02:03:24] After his second decade of almost non-stop hit pinball machines, brand new original themes,

[02:03:32] the biggest license themes pinball had ever seen, he continued to build on the title

[02:03:41] of best selling pinball designer of all time.

[02:03:44] So around this time, Williams Midway, they basically buy Atari.

[02:03:49] So Atari is now under the Ballet Midway Williams banner.

[02:03:53] So Steve Richie ends up going there, and also gives him the opportunity to move back to California.

[02:03:58] Because that's where Atari, if you remember from our first episode, that's where Atari is primarily based.

[02:04:04] Yeah, Steve has come full circle, right?

[02:04:05] He came in working on the line of Atari.

[02:04:08] Now he's coming back as a bigwig.

[02:04:10] As a senior staff producer, and he would design and produce the racing game California

[02:04:15] Speed, which sold very well.

[02:04:17] So over almost 8,000 units, it sales of over 40 million on a budget of 2 million with

[02:04:23] a crew of 16 video programmers and artists.

[02:04:26] And I have played California Speed before, it's fun.

[02:04:28] It's crazy.

[02:04:29] He kills it at Atari too.

[02:04:30] Like he's just like, you know what, I can't pinball is not doing it.

[02:04:32] I think it'll be better if I just serve Williams, Ballet Midway over in the Atari division.

[02:04:38] And he goes over there and he just kills it right out of the gate.

[02:04:40] So he was never involved in any of the pinball 2000 things or any of that chapter of Williams.

[02:04:45] He was already gone by that point.

[02:04:47] So 1996 was really the beginning of the decline in pinball that would gradually diminish in

[02:04:52] sales.

[02:04:53] And three years later, Williams closed its pinball division and pinball was basically

[02:04:58] declared dead.

[02:04:59] When Atari was bought by Williams, it was over.

[02:05:02] They turned everything off.

[02:05:03] In 2000, it was over.

[02:05:05] They paid me and I went and did some other things, some slot machines.

[02:05:08] Yeah.

[02:05:09] And you could really, I remember in that that going through that, he just really just,

[02:05:15] the wind was really out of his sails when he said that, right?

[02:05:18] You could tell that he was really bummed out by the death of pinball because it had given

[02:05:22] him so much.

[02:05:24] That's the end of our second Steve Richie episode.

[02:05:27] What did you think of that one, Ron?

[02:05:29] I own a lot of the games we went through or have owned.

[02:05:32] You have so many pinball machines in level zero.

[02:05:35] Well, most people will be like, okay, what one seed you keep?

[02:05:38] Are you high?

[02:05:39] So let me get this straight.

[02:05:40] You kept F14 time, okay, that's fine.

[02:05:42] I could see that.

[02:05:43] But you kept roller games and you kept no fear.

[02:05:47] Are you high?

[02:05:48] And you got rid of black night 2000?

[02:05:50] But I do have get away.

[02:05:51] I don't have any Steve Richie games.

[02:05:53] I'd love to own something in this era.

[02:05:54] Oh, that's such a fail.

[02:05:55] I know.

[02:05:56] Probably not the next generation just because I don't want to deal with the headaches.

[02:06:00] And I'm not a big super pin fan.

[02:06:02] But it's really heavy.

[02:06:03] Yeah.

[02:06:04] I like it get away.

[02:06:05] I think it get away would fit in.

[02:06:07] High speed would fit in.

[02:06:08] I think fairly well into my collection.

[02:06:11] Like I said, Terminator 2, man, if I could friggin find a really good Terminator 2, but didn't

[02:06:15] pay a fortune for it.

[02:06:16] Terminator 2 is pretty easy to serve us.

[02:06:18] It's not very complicated.

[02:06:20] If you watch, we've been talking a lot in this episode about those promo videos that the

[02:06:26] Williams did for distributors.

[02:06:27] They're hilarious in that if the game is very uncomplicated, they would say in the

[02:06:33] play field is uncluttered for easy cleaning.

[02:06:36] And then they would show a game like Whitewater and they would never use that comment.

[02:06:40] Yeah.

[02:06:41] It's like, wait a minute.

[02:06:42] This game isn't exactly uncluttered.

[02:06:44] This game will drive you insane.

[02:06:46] This game will drive you insane trying to clean any of this.

[02:06:49] Yeah, but it doesn't have a pop bumper.

[02:06:51] I mean, if Steve Richie called it a career here, right?

[02:06:53] Like, this would be a pretty great run.

[02:06:55] It would be.

[02:06:56] Like if he was just like, ask, ruined, I'm going to go be a, I'm going to go farm transistors

[02:07:01] over here in California or grow some asparagus.

[02:07:05] So would you say our first episode of Steve Richie was like the Star Wars prequels and

[02:07:10] then this is like the original episode worth through, worth through six from your best material

[02:07:17] and now we're going to the, the leader trilogy.

[02:07:19] The last Jedi was good.

[02:07:22] So I guess that's like, that's like Spider-Man.

[02:07:24] Although when he went to Stern, he left there and then came back.

[02:07:27] So it's actually a, is there a, a fourth trilogy?

[02:07:31] Yeah.

[02:07:32] He's an uncharted territory.

[02:07:34] Steve Richie is a chameleon.

[02:07:36] He is an odd fellow.

[02:07:38] He's engaged in the community.

[02:07:40] He's passionate.

[02:07:41] He's fun.

[02:07:42] He holds no punches and he's lasted forever.

[02:07:46] And he will never retire.

[02:07:49] Never.

[02:07:50] From his own, he is no plans on retiring.

[02:07:53] He is probably going to die making a wood white wood.

[02:07:56] He's just, they're just going to roll them into the, into the machine and just bury

[02:07:59] him right there.

[02:08:00] Hey, Harry Williams, design games and thirties all the way into the eighties.

[02:08:05] So there is precedent.

[02:08:07] So I'm really looking forward to our next Steve Richie episode.

[02:08:09] But we're going to push that out a little ways down because we've got some really cool

[02:08:14] other episodes coming up.

[02:08:15] So in our next episode, we're going to, it's going to be entitled Moving Units, the

[02:08:20] Balli Art Revolution.

[02:08:21] And that's going to cover Balli's design, philosophy and art from around 1978, 1979,

[02:08:30] all the way up to about 1984.

[02:08:33] So there's some pretty amazing stuff in there.

[02:08:35] Yeah, when they stopped outsourcing artwork and decided to create their own in-house art

[02:08:40] department, made some of the most awesome backlaces you'll ever see.

[02:08:44] Let me get Stewie for this one.
