[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] You don't know who Macho is, do you? I do not know who Macho is.

[00:17] It's so brilliant. The little jokes if you're paying attention there, they are quick.

[00:21] Yeah, because I figured you would have had a better Macho than that.

[00:24] Just pretend you're on a toilet.

[00:42] Hello, out there everybody. This is David Dennis.

[00:46] This is the pinball chronicles and with me is my charming and good-looking co-host.

[00:51] Ron, hot pants, how you doing, Bala? I'm doing just fine.

[00:56] Yeah, things are good in upstate New York. They're boring.

[01:00] Yeah, I bet it's a boring time for everybody now, but I'm sure all your other podcasts are riddled with discussions of what's going on in the world today.

[01:09] And we're going to try to keep it a little more light and something that helped you sort of get away.

[01:14] But Ron, you've spent a lot of time tweaking, fixing some of your machines the last little while.

[01:20] Just the stars and LED and out some games. That's about it.

[01:26] Yeah, when you put in your LEDs, are you, you're the kind of guy that goes with the sunlight or are you looking to get as much purple and red in there as possible?

[01:35] Warm white. Yeah, there you go. That's what I use.

[01:38] Any sales coming up, anything coming in or out of level zero?

[01:42] Not really. It's not not the sort of a volatile market right now.

[01:47] Let's just say.

[01:48] Now's the time to sort of take a wait and see approach I would say, but I am in the market for a pin, although I don't know if I'll be buying one under the current circumstances.

[01:59] But Mario World.

[02:01] Mario World, yes. Everybody loves Mario.

[02:03] I've certainly been playing a little more of my PlayStation trying to keep my kids from driving me completely insane and working from home.

[02:13] Tons of fun. Ron, I guess we'll start out with our sponsor this month.

[02:16] This episode is brought to you by Stern Star Wars. Stern Star Wars. It's Star Wars. Stop your damn complaining.

[02:23] Exactly. You can complain about the movies though. Well, well, the new ones. Cause they suck really bad.

[02:29] Let's jump into some feedback from our last episode. So if everybody who tunes in, this is our third month jumping into this last month.

[02:36] We did classic Stern Stern electronics, not the modern Stern, of course.

[02:42] And we always get some feedback. We love some feedback.

[02:45] K dog says that he's listened to all the episodes so far. The two person chemistry between myself and you, Ron.

[02:51] Really, he draws him in.

[02:53] Is that his real name? K dog.

[02:55] Probably. I mean, he might have those, those parents, right? It's better than having an umlaut in your name, I guess.

[03:03] I want to say thanks actually. It was Gary. One of our listeners sent over a really great article about Steve Kirk from Pin Game Journal back in the 70s and 80s.

[03:12] That's an article we will be using in the future when we do something around sort of probably Python, Angelo or the downturns in the 80s.

[03:21] That kind of stuff. And it's entitled the creative crisis in pinball. Very good article.

[03:26] Also, besides feedback, we always love corrections. And as you know, we take all of our corrections in our mail bag, which is silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[03:36] So shoot us an email and we read every single one. We often try to respond every single one. We'll collect little bits and pieces from there.

[03:44] One of the corrections here was it was actually a big one. And it came in from a coin op carnival, which is a shameless plug.

[03:53] Have you seen a copy of a coin op carnival? I've one sitting right next to me on my table. So yes. Yeah, what do you, what is that? What is coin op carnival?

[04:04] It's primarily EM based, but it has really cool illustrations in it.

[04:10] And it was a runner up for publication of the year this year, the twippies should have won in my humble opinion.

[04:15] I think it's a great one. I haven't been to a show yet. And if there's one there, I will certainly pick up a copy of it.

[04:23] But the feedback we were given was about our Chicago coin conversation we had, which was the predecessor to stern.

[04:30] We said in there that Chicago coin made bingo pinballs, which was actually a bit of a catch all we just sort of said bingo.

[04:38] But the correction comes and it's actually that Chicago coin never made bingo pinballs. They made flipperless games between 51 and 81 in the US.

[04:48] And still manufactured a lot of those in some other countries. They were typified as a bingo card on the back glass.

[04:54] Chicago coin did make some gambling pinballs, but their participation was fairly limited and coincide with the participation of most other manufacturers, including Gottlieb.

[05:05] It seems that you likely lumped some of these gambling games in as bingos, which is exactly right.

[05:12] There's a lot of alternate coin op games that were really the focus of Chicago coin.

[05:18] And they were really on the ground floor and pin games and they never really got away. They never really caught a lot of fire that way.

[05:25] And they actually shared a factory with Gottlieb at one point. So that's kind of a really cool interesting fact.

[05:30] David M actually he wanted to make a small correction. And that was that when I said Gary Koki, it's actually a soft sea and it's co-sea.

[05:41] So there you go, everybody. Now you know his real name.

[05:44] Also a great resource. This is from David M as well is Tim Arnold wrote what he called an epic corporate history of Williams, Sam Stern, and all the parties involved, which ran in pin game journal number 105.

[05:59] I don't have any access to pin game journal.

[06:03] If you know any resources or places like that, please let Ron and I know because we would love to add those to our reviews.

[06:12] That being said, you know, there are a billion sources out there. We're only two people.

[06:18] You know, it takes a lot to do a lot of research. The more research, the better of course.

[06:24] The sharper that night will get, the better the historical perspective will be.

[06:28] But we're really trying to collect as much as we can and as best as we can.

[06:31] Dave has been to, I believe every expo, all 27, eight of them, however, 30.

[06:38] I've lost track of how many of there's been actually. I'm way off on that. What am I saying? The first one was in 85.

[06:44] So he's been to every one of them. His license plate actually says pinball, like not misspelled and not like a one for an eye or anything, you know, actually pinball.

[06:54] Wow.

[06:56] And Tim Arnold, he used to go to expo and he had a lot of, you used to give a lot of seminars.

[07:02] There were talks there until he couldn't do it anymore because of his Las Vegas pinball museum that he is there full time.

[07:10] I think one of the coolest things about sort of expo as well as the hobby in general is the access that we have to the content creators, to the designers, to the programmers.

[07:20] They love to come and chat and host seminars at big events and there's a really cool wealth of knowledge and a lot of the resources that we're using Ron.

[07:29] We're watching old interviews from expo, things like that. You can catch them on YouTube and things, but really it's kind of cool for us to just try to collate everything together.

[07:37] Our previous episodes have all been about the early solid state area. This is really sort of in the 70s and the 80s where the industry went through a lot of large shifts.

[07:46] Nowadays we call that disruption. That's sort of the exit of electro mechanical pinball machines with the reels and knobs and switches in the cabinet to really moving into the watershed moment, which is solid state and computer boards.

[08:00] That has been sort of the focus so far in the first two episodes. I kind of wanted to take a bit of a jump in this episode. Ron, I wanted to kind of move us into sort of a more of a modern era, more DMD focused and things like that.

[08:13] But I didn't want to go with something easy to do and something exciting like ballet Williams or something like today's modern Stern or Jersey Jack.

[08:23] I didn't want that much pizzazz. I wanted to go with something a little bit different. Some companies excelled in the new market when they moved from electro mechanical into solid state.

[08:32] Some fell almost immediately and they disappeared right away. Well, got leave. They basically became zombies. They just refused to die on and on and on and on. They walked hanging in there somehow by a thread.

[08:47] So today we're going to review the final years in an episode that we call zombie pinball got leave and the system three era.

[08:56] Ron, what the heck happened to got leave after the 1970s? Pain, pain, very good. Yeah, that's it. With no capitals, just pain with three dots.

[09:08] The thing about got leave and as we're going to see they had a very they had a very stable existence from when they were founded up to about the mid 70s and then their ownership kind of bounced around quite a bit for the next 10 years or so.

[09:23] Yeah, that it really was an odd thing. My first game was a system 80 B. My second game was a system 80 B. And the reason for that was they are dirt cheap.

[09:35] They didn't work. So I was able to pick them up took a little bit of fanangling and I was able to actually get them running, which is sort of why they were my first machines. Then I immediately sold them because I realized they weren't really that great.

[09:47] One thing that's very cool about the system three era sort of how robust that era was how sort of it seemed like they were kind of getting their groove back. They moved into licensing. We'll dive into a bunch of that stuff.

[09:59] Listener Scott Charles said that got leave system three was better than you thought but worse than you hoped would you say that that sums it up. Yeah, I'd say that sums it up.

[10:09] I want to talk a little bit about sort of the struggling ownership of got leave. And I want to detail that really deep maybe in another episode will actually go into sort of all of that stuff.

[10:20] I'm just going to give a quick high level summary. You know that what we're talking about today is is actually what we would call premier or premier got leave. So when we say got leave today, please don't send us an angry email that says well, it was actually premier that owned it because yes, it was premier but that got leave name is kind of where the history comes from and where it where they would start using that branding again throughout this era.

[10:47] Yeah, the name is still on large percentage of the games. It usually say like got leave and then it would say the premier name and technology. Yeah, it's like it's like they had originally gotten rid of got leave completely went into chess premier.

[11:02] Then people didn't know who that was so that it was like the premier name in in ball was got leave then they really went whole hog right in to got leave in sort of the system three areas like they sort of I don't know it's very weird. We'll get into we'll get into that.

[11:17] So got leave was actually de got leave in co founded 1927 and of Chicago. It was really the champion in the 60s and 70s when it came to electric mechanicals.

[11:27] We you know, we would joke that it was the the Cadillac of the industry back then it it was taken over by Alvin got leave who is the son of David got leave or D got leave in in the 1970s where after a 10 year there Alvin actually sold got leave to Columbia pictures in 1976 Columbia pictures would then sell that division over to Coca Cola in 1983 where it would be named Millstar.

[11:56] Electronics Coca Cola closed that division down in 1984 and a management group purchased Milestar they would eventually sort of remove the premier name start using the got leave name a little bit more kind of as we had mentioned a few moments ago.

[12:12] Why should we start at system three Ron. Why do you think that that's a good spot to start. Oh, it's going to say because that's the name of our episode. Is it the beginning of the end do you think?

[12:22] It's not the beginning of the end. It's it's the beginning of their foray into the eventually the DMD era newer technology and just keeping up with the other manufacturers.

[12:32] It sort of seemed like they limped around a lot right well the thing about golly is that their system one was just to glorified get an EM game running on solid state technology.

[12:43] They didn't really take advantage of features or they did not go into it with the gusto of say Valley Williams the other company's dead and they got put way behind because of that system 80 when it came out is actually I have a couple of friends of mine that actually say that that platform itself wasn't a bad platform and actually had a little more horsepower to it than some of the other like the other platforms the Valley Williams.

[13:12] They just had very poor programming basically they just did not take advantage they weren't able to leverage it. They were not able to that's they were not able to leverage it.

[13:23] So when we start to get into the late 80s you have the other manufacturers well Valley at this point it's already gotten bought by Williams Williams is in their system 11 platform.

[13:35] Data East is in their their rip off of system 11 platform totally different so got leave has had the system 80 platform now for many years they've gone from 80 to 80 a to 80 B but we're talking is it like eight or nine years.

[13:54] Yeah they had it for an extended period they just kept kind of tack and stuff on to kind of get it to limp a little further which you will see when we talk about other manufacturers it's the same start with the basic system.

[14:04] As they want to add more features look he putting more things in it until it just get so complicated they have to just reengineer it that's happened with Williams it happened with even stern if you look at modern turns when they were on their sam system and they started to.

[14:20] You know they started to do the LED thing they started putting more stuff in there and you see all these acts these auxiliary boards in your game and it just gets more more complicated and then they just they went with a new system.

[14:31] Yeah you got you got to sort of take a look back and really it was November 1990 when Williams really took that first major step that real real dive into the deep end and they launched their Williams pinball controller WPC system isn't that right.

[14:46] That is correct basically because system 11 got way too complicated right so this so everybody's running into the same issue of of sort of complexity and adding bits and pieces WPC was a huge step forward wasn't it.

[14:59] For Williams they definitely system you'd have to know system 11 to know how much better it was because system 11 they would use things like multiplexing they use the same transistors to run flashers and run coils and they basically just got rid of all that with WPC you have dedicated transistors for the coils dedicated transistors for the flashers.

[15:23] It was much more robust system and actually less complicated if you open up the back box of a WPC game compare to especially a later system 11 game there's way less crap in there.

[15:36] Yeah and that's evolution as it goes I would say that system three was sort of like the realization of like oh we better get we better figure something out here because the competition is seriously changing the way they are.

[15:49] The premier team got leave they had contacted the designer John Burris who had done bounty hunter rack him up he actually had done the black hole conversion prototype of the actual machine for system 80 he was the brains behind system three a system that John Trudeau would call a killer platform with a great MPU system they really were forced to modernize is what he would say another comment here of system three.

[16:17] This is from john norris and his name is going to come up a lot as you'll as you will see john norris says it was night and day from system 80 a catch up system 80 didn't have enough memory or drivers the memory was very bad the memory had to keep track of only basic things we even wanted the machine to call into a computer program and record a report to your game error alerts and broken parts no one wanted to do that yeah wow that's that's some pretty forward thinking stuff for for the late eighties and early nineties right.

[16:46] Like being able to call in with some sort of modem like system like they were really thinking mind the cliche outside the box right I would say so they the other thing that was really cool is John Norris brings up a lot of really kind of these interesting bits one of them was automatic skill detection and that's really that the game looks at the skill of the player so it knew that the player was flipping the flippers at the same time if they catch the ball and stop the ball movement on the flipper it would know it would give players more time.

[17:16] To complete the various tasks that with a wood so it was able to figure out if you were a good player or a poor player and then it would allow you it would allow the system to adjust to that skill level so it would sort of it wouldn't beat you too bad nor would it make the game too easy that would also breathe life into a lot of the catch up features from the system three

[17:38] era which I'm sure you're going to get into when we get a little further on we love the catch up features tournament players love those two yeah the the god awful flippers is what is what I remember these these horrible flippers I've only played a few system

[17:53] threes but when I do they just feel weird can you describe some of why that is why believe they started with the terrible flippers even before system three I think like I'm trying to

[18:05] remember what game it was but I recall they right before system three they started with these wonderful flip the same thing is they had one of the better flippers in my opinion beforehand I love those those system 80 flippers they were beautiful they had they had a tried and true flippers and and they were like 10 years they were they had cool little features like the flipper bats themselves were designed in a way that's hard to explain let's see so if you're rebuilding flippers and you put a flipper bat in you

[18:35] don't want it to bind against the bushing yes and you have to adjust it like if you're doing say Williams game you got you got to adjust it a little bit so it doesn't bind the godly flippers the bats actually came design so you couldn't so they were automatically adjust for you so you couldn't get they wouldn't bind they would they made it easy to adjust yeah I change the flippers in my system 80 for the first game ever had and I had not a single issue and they felt better than than when I had got the game

[19:05] and they had I think they had dual bushings like on the actual flipper plate so everything was just very tight very it just was like one one screw if you had to replace the bad it's a very good system yeah and then we went to the flippers that most people hate they went to a flipper bat that was more like say the Williams flipper bat just the skinnier flippers except they were even a different shape than the other manufacturer

[19:30] they were they were like the shape of a slice of cheese yeah felt about squishy as that and they had the top part that screwed in and it went to a much cheaper like plate that would break and they would put godly they wrote godly bonnet just in case you forgot

[19:45] and the biggest issue is just the flipper travel the got to the point where you can trap anything on these these system three games because of these flippers

[19:54] do you think that was the design like they want to make it easier to trap you know it probably was

[20:01] but in hindsight it just it really hurt a lot of these games in my opinion it just made them way way too easy like you could literally lift up the flipper it could come down the lane and just stop stop every time it's horrible yeah

[20:14] like I mean that yes you know for a for a novice you're like oh I can control a ball but there's there's like a there's a happy medium to that right you don't want to make it too easy

[20:22] yeah make it too hard so here's a quick tip if you have your system three game and you want a little less flipper travel the easiest way is you just get a hold of pinball resource which will be talking about them at the end of the program

[20:35] but steve young pinball resource he sells basically their system one coil stops but they have I think an extra screw hole in them so they will fit in a system three plate and the coil stops are much longer

[20:46] so it travels a little less it travels way less yeah okay that is the most inexpensive easiest way to do it you just replace the coil stop now I've heard some people will actually take Williams flipper mechanics I know someone who did that yeah how does that work you just put the whole

[21:04] Williams the plate all the parts in there the only issue is space because the Williams plates are a little bigger so you may have issues getting it to fit

[21:13] so you kind of got to be choosy of what machine you just can't just take any machine yeah that's why it may be better just to do the coil stop thing because that way you can keep everything else sometimes simpler is better

[21:23] yeah and it works but yeah I believe you he well as we'll find out later if you want certain got lead parts or just about any got lead parts specific got lead part you need to go to pinball resource and steve young

[21:34] yeah certainly not our sponsor this week which is stern star wars but pinball resource will pop up quite a bit I would say specifically in the end here when we talk about what has happened to godly that takes us into the first system three

[21:48] so they were developing this system three lights camera action stats that's lights camera action it's a movie show business theme 1989

[21:58] in December it's a standard body they sold 1700 units it's designed by john norris somebody who's gonna again pop up quite a bit here he did a lot of system 80 bees from the late 80s and a lot a lot of the system threes

[22:12] software by john bureus who did black hole book Rogers raven the epic raven and tx sector which is actually quite good that that's sort of john bureus designing the system three board set as well as the rule set around that

[22:27] and artwork by the constant tino's jenine and uh by the michael's the Mitchell

[22:33] she's here we go that's why i'm here well Brian Johnson of acdc he was a game wow he did the Brian Johnson yes yeah um he did bone

[22:46] busters actually which is another system 80 be which is kind of neat uh sound by david zabrisky and he did tails of the raven night scared stiff bad girls and the epic

[22:57] cactus jacks so you know it's a pretty good all star team here and uh ed robertson from the baron naked ladies once called light camera action

[23:06] wonka ask a unique machine and a quirky got leab system three you'll really enjoy see that marty in teolas we can we can get ed robertson on our

[23:17] podcast too so you know you're not the only big deal my podcast mate bruce who hates most got leabs he loves lights camera action

[23:26] yeah it's quirky it's unique quirky and it's also the the bill materials on that had to be quite large

[23:32] when you if you look at that game it has like a rotating rotating ramp on the play field it just rotates into

[23:38] different positions it has a the back box has back box animation it has these huge like spotlights on the

[23:49] top they're extremely bright because you're supposed to be under the spotlight because lights camera action

[23:54] yeah those those flood lights yeah they're extremely bright they wanted an inexpensive budget back box toy

[24:02] and and of course they've got the toy inside but they figured okay how can we spruce that up a little

[24:07] bit well let's throw on a topper but it had to be super inexpensive which was basically just lights

[24:13] it was approved says john norris because the cost was low surprised and he doesn't know how he got

[24:19] the flood lights on there because those were actually quite expensive most of them are broken I would

[24:24] say most of them were taken off because of ceiling heights it's actually quite huge right it's very

[24:30] tall that's the other thing sister three is always the exception when it comes to will fit my car

[24:35] yeah you you'll see a lot of conversations like I have this vehicle well this game fit well what game

[24:41] is it you know is it a Williams game is it a daddy East game all it's a got leaps system three you

[24:47] might have problems with the back box cuz it's yeah that's the one where you go yeah yeah it

[24:52] it had this really cool like a blue light and a red light right on the flood lights on the top

[24:57] on this topper and whatever the lights on the play field would go out the light of the opposite

[25:02] color would sort of create this weird ambiance it would be a cool effect with you know the red

[25:07] on the play field with the blue artwork then the blue light with the red artwork it was actually

[25:12] quite cool this is sort of like tron tron yes we you know I have to bring that up every episode

[25:19] because it is the greatest game I've ever created if you say so all right so the the the game is

[25:25] actually kind of really neat it's you're a budding director you're working sort of in a summer

[25:31] B movie action flick and you're under the heat of the spotlights you're you're traveling around

[25:37] Sanford Cisco you're trying to wrap up the five big scenes from the movie and you want to finish

[25:43] your blockbuster now that sounds a bit silly but this was actually the first game ever to feature

[25:50] modes really it wasn't it wasn't Adam's family take that Pat Lawler you wow uh so one guy that we

[25:58] are going to run into a lot in this episode like non-stop in almost everything that we do is

[26:05] John Norris so I figured this is a good time as any to jump into who is John Norris and talk about

[26:11] his background so that's not good sounds great John Norris's first memory of pinball was his family

[26:18] traveling to the Santa Barbara arcade it was a flea market when he was around nine or ten

[26:24] arcades were really banned at the time and this was a vacation town so it had a lot of sort of tourists

[26:31] in and out and it was the only place that he could access arcades outside of his county his first

[26:37] job was at a high school bicycle shop where the owner would put pinball machines next to the candy

[26:42] machine an old beat up got leabbe sweetheart was a 10 year old game at the time and it appeared

[26:48] at the bike shop that's when he started to search out his own machine in the 1970s and he wanted

[26:54] one for his own house he went to California state in 1981 working in art and photo at the time

[27:01] the reason he focused on that is because he really wanted to get a job at Atari in California

[27:05] which is as you can remember from our first episode is where Steve Richie ended up we had uh he

[27:12] had a friend at Atari who said they were looking for talent but he could never get him in to get

[27:16] to actually get an interview he got a real job and started to work to be able to actually afford

[27:20] his own pinball collection having your own pinball collection in like the late 70s must have been a

[27:25] big deal a yeah I would imagine that wasn't very common yeah it's really big bit the um at the

[27:31] moment it's it's more or less a home collectors hobby now back then it was like they were in bowling

[27:37] alleys and that was kind of like it in the late 70s he decided when he was collecting games that he

[27:42] really wanted to get to the grass roots of pinball there were no conventions at the time so you had

[27:48] to search out specific collectors and distributors he spent most of his time collecting wood rails

[27:54] which I'm sure were super friggin heavy he worked in a place called underwriters laboratory where he

[28:00] decided to actually make a game and put it on location for fun it was a stern stars which he converted

[28:06] to a game called tour de France he added some steps switches and some relays and a solid state

[28:12] board set so it was actually a hybrid of solid state and electro mechanical so he he and the solid

[28:18] state yeah how amazing is that that he would do that now he he would say in some interviews that he

[28:24] wanted a couple of the features and things like that that you couldn't get in the solid state

[28:29] board set at the time that were originally from a from a m I don't get it but I'll tell you what it

[28:36] took me forever to learn how to solder one simple transistor so having somebody actually modify a

[28:42] solid state machine that's actually really good in stars and put in a m parts and actually have it

[28:47] work and not burn down a building is is pretty amazing really he had heard about this thing called

[28:53] expo which held his first event in 1985 I had the year right yes yeah there you go 10 points for

[29:01] Ron everybody if you're keeping track he made a resume and he had some big designs in his workbook

[29:08] that he had been working on this he saw as his opportunity to sort of get his resume directly

[29:13] into the hands of the manufacturer shake their hands say hello introduce himself as opposed to

[29:17] just send it in the mail he didn't think he'd ever hear back from any of the companies John says

[29:23] my goal at the time was to get materials to build an emulator so I can build a machine where I could

[29:28] just plug in parts and accessories to build the machine I wanted to show off a bunch of playfields

[29:33] and then swap out playfields this way I could show the manufacturers in the future a bunch of

[29:37] designs by shipping one machine to Chicago he's ahead of his time so 14 years before Williams did

[29:43] it within ball 2000 like 30 years before highway was going to do it with the alien platform and

[29:50] and before multi-morphic did it yeah multi-morphic I would say has perfected that it what you can see

[29:56] here is he's just looking for efficiency right he wants to be able to show doesn't want to just show

[29:59] people some stuff on paper you want to say hey here are three designs that I've done but it would

[30:03] cost you a fortune to move three of these machines across the country and then three of them back

[30:07] from California to Chicago it's pretty smart idea so this is like a kind of back in those time I

[30:13] guess I guess it counts even today that your the companies are always looking for sort of like a proof

[30:18] of concept right they being able to kind of come up with a design is one thing but actually being

[30:22] able to put a machine together tweak it and angle it that's really what some people would say is

[30:29] the standard right I I don't want to hire you as a designer unless I know you can actually

[30:34] build something yeah proof of concepts or I mean that's how Pat Lawler guys job at Williams

[30:39] that's a Keith L. Wing has job at Stern just showing him here's this machine I built someone looks

[30:45] at like wow it's pretty impressive boom you get hired I would say designers manufacture sort of the

[30:52] big wigs some big wigs maybe more than others they can sit back and say hey they get these

[30:58] simple little principles of pinball design that the average Joe just doesn't get and they can

[31:05] sort of see those those little details that proof of concept can show where some people don't

[31:10] really have that I think that's pretty cool at at pinball expo John would meet Dale Pollock and

[31:16] he would give him some of his information but Dale would tell him that they actually didn't need

[31:21] any designers at the time a month after expo Dale Pollock would call John and said they needed

[31:27] to sound programmer John would say that he could learn to actually do sound but he wanted to be a

[31:33] junior pinball designer three months after that Dale would call again and wanted him to fly to

[31:38] Chicago for an actual in-person interview and that's when he got the job as a junior designer

[31:44] John Norris would move to Chicago with Godlyb but one of the most painful times of his life would

[31:50] mean that he would have to sell 10 to 15 of his pinball machines and only have to keep 10 of them

[31:56] to move from California all the way to Chicago he more or less started to work as an apprentice

[32:02] on the line making his own machine kind of on his part time the first person he would really

[32:06] help would be Joe Kamikau who would eventually move to a company called Daddy East which we'll get

[32:12] into the future and now days Kapow working with Stern and he would also work with John Trudeau

[32:18] and they would spend most of the time sort of apprenticing with them helping them build their machine

[32:22] helping wire them up and that was in 1986 it wasn't until 1988 that he became a full designer

[32:30] that's where he would start with his first machine diamond lady now we're going to get into that

[32:35] during our system 80 podcast which we'll get into in the future but that's kind of where he sort

[32:40] of got his start in the industry diamond ladies actually a pretty interesting game and I think you

[32:45] see some of the elements of John Norris wanting to try different things because in diamond lady

[32:50] it has a ball saver in between the flippers but it's not a post and it's it's an actual drop target

[32:56] no very cool which is interesting different ways of using the similar tools it's like a

[33:01] Scott Denise is very good at that using sort of the pieces that you currently have in a different way

[33:07] after lights camera action which is sort of the first system three game got leab turned on a dime

[33:14] and they decided to go with a completely different business model with this new board set

[33:18] and the their platform in general that would be known as got leab street level games what the hell

[33:25] is a street level game run street level games specifically are meant to be they're cheaper

[33:30] their single level no ramps no no upper play fields they're actually a little smaller because they

[33:36] didn't have to make the back of the cabinet so deep because there was no ramps they were simpler

[33:41] from an operator perspective there was supposed to be less issues with them you know that would

[33:45] require intervention like stuck balls broken max they were and most importantly they were cheaper

[33:51] and it was supposed to be cheaper for operators to buy like you can get this game it's going to cost

[33:56] you less and that that's the model they decided to go with the only issue with that model my view

[34:01] is at the time they came out with these so you have Williams that's coming out with games like earth

[34:06] shaker whirlwind and they're coming out with games like deadly weapon and in these street level

[34:12] games and and it was not a success yeah it was I understand what they were trying to do

[34:19] um it's almost like they wanted to say hey you remember how easy it was to fix those early solid

[34:25] state machines that that earned money and look how really complicated these new Williams machines

[34:31] are right they've got rotating this and pop up that and eventually we're going to get into subways

[34:37] and all these other shenanigans you know hey look at this thing it's it's super cheap but super

[34:41] easy you put it in your pizza place and and somebody's still going to put quarters in it to kill some

[34:46] time at this time premier was not looking to be the number one pinball manufacturer I I would

[34:52] totally say that they're they were quite comfortable sort of just making some machines and doing okay

[34:57] and they weren't trying to be king of the mountain and street level games were really meant to sort

[35:02] of dramatically change that scope of their operations according to pinball designer john truto

[35:08] premier wanted to target a totally different market segment with street level games they wanted to

[35:13] really focus on that area instead of full-featured games actually midway in 1991 would make Harley

[35:20] Davidson which is sort of a similar sort of test of this kind of alternative market according to

[35:26] john norris the pinball designer who worked on three street level games and stayed with premier

[35:32] all the way until the end of the company he spoke the about the failure of street level and he

[35:36] thought that it had two major reasons for that one of them was the john felt that the major mistake

[35:42] was that got leave went all in on street level like truto norris noted the games were designed to

[35:48] appeal to a different market segment than normal but maybe one or two of these machines a year

[35:53] alongside of a regular full-featured game would have been a better business decision do you think

[35:57] that that would made sense that makes sense yeah so I mean you kind of every you know once a year

[36:02] twice a year you make one of these street level games you mix it in with one of your regular brands

[36:07] you know they thought that hey we're going to go all in on this and then we're going to be the

[36:10] only one making this type of game but that's a pretty high-risk strategy the other thing that

[36:16] john norris would talk about was that premier's distributors were not necessarily required to adhere to

[36:23] the the MSRP they could go over it so norris said many of the distributors actually tried to sell

[36:28] and did sell their street level pins at the same price as a full-featured release so they didn't

[36:33] necessarily sell them for less to get more of them out there and make it up in volume out they

[36:39] actually just tried to sell it for the regular price of what a got leave would be yeah and pocket

[36:43] the extra money themselves so they sort of torpedoed their own their own sort of cow that's a big

[36:48] out right there you could say that they didn't sell particularly well they only made six models and

[36:54] we'll talk about how got leave just turns out pinball machines at a at a nauseating rate so turning

[36:59] out six machines is actually pretty impressive for the amount of time in the you know a year and a half

[37:06] time period of those machines the machines were silver slugger from 1990 Vegas from 1990 deadly weapon

[37:14] title fight from 1990 1991's car hop and the final game probably the best one would be hoops

[37:21] not probably not probably it is the best one 100 percent yep let's see for my memory silver slugger

[37:27] actually has a pretty nice flowy play field it's actually fun to shoot unfortunately the entire

[37:32] game is just mysteries you like hit it in a saucer and wait for a mystery award and you just do that

[37:37] over and over and over it's like a space robots playing baseball and it's it's got like this humongous

[37:44] insert that's what I remember about it and the I think it's in the upper right hand corner we got

[37:49] it up we're looking at it right now but I actually found it very fun to shoot but again as as

[37:55] we're going to see with a lot of these got leaves a lot of them are fun to shoot but the rules may

[38:00] not be stellar it's the it's the hamstring really is is let's just say that the hamstring is my

[38:07] favorite pork string by the way deadly weapon is one that I see come up all the time in Canada I

[38:12] don't know if they sold a million of these up here but for some reason deadly weapon from 1990

[38:17] which is totally different and not remotely in any way the same as lethal weapon which was a

[38:22] popular movie series at the time and a killer daddy's game it just how God so it uh it's a

[38:30] pretty neat game as well again really kind of a neat design one thing that I think that they

[38:35] really got very well with these street level games is spinners the the spinner that gotly

[38:41] been designed man oh man those were awesome spinners at the time yeah they had long since ditch

[38:46] the horrible plastic spinners they were trying and God what did they do that for uh well at least

[38:51] they ditched them and we got some good spinners yeah deadly weapon had this pop bumper down sort of by

[38:58] the by the flippers not like Rick and Warty cool it was like really annoying out of the way it had a

[39:05] it had this really strange guide rail right into the flipper it was an it's an odd odd game and at

[39:12] this time they were all about that third flipper too right they just wanted third flippers everywhere

[39:16] on these god leaps well when you have no ramps yeah you got to create something except left or

[39:21] right movement I got a couple of cool quotes here actually on deadly weapon Keith Johnson who

[39:28] some would say is stack of mode multi-ball everything is lit greatest programmer of all time

[39:33] had some really cool quotes about about some of the street level games Keith says I have a lot

[39:39] of respect for the god leave street level games because those games have a lot of very interesting

[39:43] shots deadly weapon is not very sought after but the shots are unique interesting and offer a lot

[39:49] of different things thanks for correcting that because I actually wrote lethal weapon in the show

[39:53] notes here I know title fight rey tanser would say that he really enjoyed working on the title

[39:58] fight game it's an it the new special mechanism features were the player interactive boxing

[40:03] characters in the back box we also installed four secondary scoring displays in the back box to

[40:09] tally up the punches thrown per player for more competitive play who sounds exciting well

[40:14] Keith Johnson says on title fight title fight as an interesting play field sure they may not be a good

[40:19] tournament game but things can be learned from them the rules are more complex than those types

[40:23] of play feels generally require now Dennis Kreisle from the collect the gamers podcast and our producer

[40:30] here on the pinball network has a fantastic article on the god leave street level games and I'm

[40:38] going to include that in our show notes that you can click on there one of the bits in there are

[40:42] sales volumes of all the major manufacturers from 1989 1990 and 1991 so it breaks it down

[40:50] Williams midway data east and premier and you can really see the sales volumes there Williams

[40:58] 1989 is selling 18,000 units which is significantly lower than of course we talked about back in our

[41:05] first episode where one game alone like flash was selling 19,000 in 1990 they're selling 29,000

[41:13] almost 30,000 machines Williams in 1991 is selling 23,300 units at the same time when premier says

[41:22] hey let's let's go all in on this on this street level strategy and try to corner this unique

[41:28] market they were third in sales volume in 1989 and that was when they were when they were moving

[41:34] from system 80 system 80c probably at that time they were moving into system three they had

[41:41] lights camera action they had bone busters hot shots and big house they sold 8,000 units that year

[41:47] putting them in third place just ahead of data east and behind midway and sales the following year

[41:53] in 1990 they were dead last by half they were only selling 5,400 units that year the closest one

[42:02] was midway selling 10,000 units that east selling 11 they really discovered I would say immediately

[42:09] an extra quick everybody increased their sales except for them they actually decreased their sales

[42:15] significantly yeah it's even worse than it appears because remember midway is ballet and their

[42:19] own by Williams so when we say 29,000 plus 10,000 yeah it's like almost 40,000 games to 5,000 games

[42:27] yeah we're talking like doctor dude game show pool sharks radical yeah radical like one of those

[42:36] four games is is decent the rest of them are just like you fool what a burn but they're they're

[42:42] just destroying by double premier at the time with this new strategy of street level games I think

[42:49] immediately they notice oh my god we've made a mistake and by 1991 they've released two of the

[42:57] street level games and then they move into these newer system three games we'll talk about those

[43:02] in a couple of minutes brutal now do you think street level killed gotley they did not kill gotley

[43:09] especially when they're around for another five years afterwards so this huge mistake that they

[43:13] made really didn't kill them no john norris he would indicate that street level was the worst

[43:19] for premier than what they did before but it didn't sink the company and that the numbers

[43:24] recovered significantly once they abandoned this experiment what was the first machine that they did

[43:30] when they got back to regular pinball machines run cactus jacks the the epic cactus jacks if you

[43:39] love games with dancin cacti this one's for you this is your game this is it it doesn't get any

[43:45] better than this now do you think that this is on the Chicago gaming remake list no why not I don't

[43:52] think I don't think there's a single gotley bomb this Chicago gaming repay that's right so a gotley

[43:59] different cactus jacks they bought a game from an outside contractor that made the playfield and

[44:03] they came actually had daddy esports in it so they had to rip all that out gotley buffiet that's

[44:08] that even a word well that just means dumb down the rules oh so john norris says we finished that

[44:13] game is six to seven weeks most games were eight to ten weeks we didn't have a lot of time to build

[44:19] games the player doesn't care how long you take they care about the games fun but we were at a huge

[44:24] disadvantage with waves we have had a year more to make games that was the difference of making a

[44:29] TV show or making a movie can you imagine pumping out a game every eight to ten weeks no I can't

[44:36] no wonder these were often seen as games that were a little bit short well remember it

[44:43] started the same thing after the the great crash of what 2008 2009 or they were cranking out games

[44:49] I mean some of them were like Iron Man but also a lot of them were like NBA big buck hunter etc poor big

[44:56] buck hunter and they didn't get a lot of time to work on them either yeah cactus jacks it's like

[45:01] this cartoony childreny thing sex appeal it's very weird it's very goofy it's very goofy it's like

[45:12] about a watermelon farm or something there's there's lots of different fruit items yes you throw

[45:17] watermelons you throw things yep cactus jacks yeehaw lets party that's the catch line sizzle in country

[45:25] music add the fruit multiplier by completing the drop targets go for the big thorny surprise

[45:33] let's have a boot stomping good time good time oh my god it's it's kind of fun it's goofy yeah I mean

[45:41] if you take it for what it is right it's a bit silly it's kind of fun yeah if you're looking for a

[45:46] deep rule set and and something that's that you know I think what's really cool of oh god leave

[45:52] that system 80 be era and some and some of the the the system three era is like this 80s 90s

[46:02] cheesy silliness that they had going on like it just it's got its own sort of fun nostalgia right like

[46:08] to be fair all the other manufacturers are similar think of a game like roll or think of a game like

[46:13] roller games that's 80s cheese personified at 14 time cat you know the Russians versus US all that

[46:21] I would say one of the neatest you know system three games was the class of 1812 the stats of 1812

[46:28] where that it is a sort of humor horror supernatural theme that came out in august 91 it was a

[46:35] standard body that was 1,668 units now this is interesting designed by ray tanser and joe camon cow

[46:43] how is that possible he's a daddy east he's actually one of the you know the big time super players

[46:49] at daddy east at the time right so if you go into I am IP DB you look up his information and he's

[46:55] got this one weird gap where he co-designs a game at got leave in the early 90s with ray tanser it's

[47:03] an odd little bit why does he have this one random game well this is one of the neatest stories I

[47:09] think that I found when it comes to got leave at the time yeah per john norris he says ray tanser

[47:15] just went over to the rack and grabbed something to make we might say what does that mean well there

[47:20] was a old rack that they would have a got leave were uncompleted games went when a game was killed

[47:25] were not made it would just go on the rack and people would use it to take parts off

[47:30] re grabbed it and finished it it was originally a game that joe camon cow started called 911

[47:36] Carrera Joseph car guy I think he's been a car guy for years he's got an original bat mobile from

[47:42] the 1966 show he's he's working at got leave early early early and we'll talk about that maybe

[47:48] at a daddy east episode but he he designs this game he gets angry he doesn't like working at got leave

[47:53] and he leaves so they take his game they just sort of throw it on the wall the quote unquote the wall

[47:57] and every time somebody needs like a pop bumper they kind of go over and unscrew it and then like

[48:02] put it on their machine and just test it around they are so desperate to course correct because

[48:06] of the street level mess that they're just like what what do we got and ray tansers like uh well

[48:12] we got this guy over here who's got this uh game that we can buy called cash jacks we just buy

[48:16] that throw our name on it and I got this old uh camon cow thing over here I'll just put some

[48:21] paint on it and make it look good they're all just kind of running around to try to find anything

[48:26] to get on the line crazy class of 1812 is kind of neat because it's the only game that I can think

[48:31] of that has a beating heart and chattering teeth right that is correct it also carries one of the

[48:35] higher prices on pin side for this era especially for a godly you why do you think that is I don't know

[48:41] is that the one that has the chicken yes it is yeah baby that's it people love chickens

[48:48] this episode has now peaked brought to you by Ron Hallett

[48:51] David Moore did the art um and uh there's a quote here that he says my all-time favorite pinball

[48:57] artworks was what I did with godleabs class of 1812 the game's theme and ideas were always

[49:04] determined by the bosses through discussion with the engineering department they would tell me

[49:08] what they wanted to see and I would make the sketches and the marker comps for their approval and

[49:12] their revisions and then the artwork was processed it was just fun to make john norris would say

[49:19] and this is very cool yeah we considered calling it monster mash and licensing it it was deemed too

[49:24] much but it was like three thousand dollars which was super cheap it was management's decision they

[49:30] were just getting into licensing and didn't know what was expensive or not it was a learning curve

[49:35] which is funny because probably seven years later when Williams did monster bash that was supposed

[49:41] to be monster mash and they tried to license it and they didn't they thought it was too expensive

[49:46] so I wonder if godleab asking for it back then and then seven years later another pinball

[49:52] manufacturer asked for it maybe they thought oh this must be a hot property we got to charge we

[49:57] got to ask for even more this time yeah it's uh it's pretty crazy now if you can imagine three

[50:02] thousand dollars for the license you probably get the song along with that I think the class of

[50:07] eighteen twelve if it was monster mash would have sold so much more than if it was what it came but it

[50:13] wouldn't have they definitely wouldn't have the singing chicken eat well yeah you're probably right

[50:19] yeah it is better off with the singing chicken their next game was surf and safari so let's uh

[50:26] surf and stat farry here I'm still doing it I'm never giving up no I see that yes you have any

[50:35] you've started to just not even acknowledge it anymore which means that it's it means that it's

[50:38] really getting surf and safari I feel like I feel like Creosel with the market trends at this point

[50:43] it's just yeah so again another John Norris game very cool it's like this uh surfer theme uh

[50:52] like spring break kind of thing it is actually a license yeah it's it's a license but it's it's like

[51:00] the license to song and uh truth be told this is one of my favorite got leaves of that error I love

[51:06] surf really this is is it the rules what is this it well it is a uh frequently used game at the

[51:13] old pop alternates they would use this all the time because all they had to do with the rules is

[51:17] just disable the skill shot because the skill shot has those wonderful random awards and one of

[51:22] them is a catch up one catch up to your opponent yeah that's not fair so you can't have that so they

[51:27] would just but also had to do is just disable the skill shot the rest of it was just left as is it

[51:32] plays great it's got this horrible toy in the middle of front of some some bash target or

[51:37] in front of a couple of times kind of whatever he's supposed to be what what it looks like a hugging

[51:41] turd but it's horrible but it has palm trees which were actually uh Steve Kirk's idea very cool

[51:49] and it it I did not even know it used the surf it's a fire is a song by the beach boys I did not even

[51:56] know that was in the game because I had never heard this game until this year somebody I know bought

[52:03] it and we we played it and I got to hear the sound for this game for the first time ever and

[52:07] it's awesome and I didn't realize like wait a minute this is playing the actual songs

[52:12] surfants of far so they must have paid licensing for this that's so unlike got Lee this is the

[52:17] first game that was actually designed from scratch so the the the previous games we sort of talked

[52:21] about were like oh my god we need to make a game really quickly and let's just slap something

[52:26] together with what we've got this is the one that actually took them the longest to actually

[52:31] build from nothing to something and they still did it in six months which is just a crazy amount

[52:36] of turnaround it so you could say that it was certainly tweaked more than than like a cactus jacks

[52:43] or a class of 1812 so it had sort of a little more love if you will but that being said right you're

[52:48] looking at Williams and they're doing turn around in 12 months for a game design and they're doing

[52:51] it in half the amount of time now they did license the songs but it wasn't actually like a beach

[52:57] boys license it was just the song and then they named it after the song and then people sort of

[53:03] can just draw the line that it's kind of the same thing now it's got it's got some awesome

[53:08] marketing bits and pieces here these got Lee guys are all in on their marketing posters and branding

[53:15] boom crash splash tickle Rodney the gator okay that's supposed to be an alligator

[53:20] yeah and watch him glow watch him glow take the plunge slowly into mystery score watch the girls

[53:28] and the nine digit score displays for hundreds of millions it's like it's just brutal these are

[53:35] great double everything hit the pipeline and spelled double for massive fun all around so they didn't

[53:42] pay the beach boys for the beach boys not own their own song I'm not entirely sure it's not like

[53:48] it's it's kind of sounds like surfants of art it is the actual song note for note and surfants of

[53:54] by the interview with John Norris was that they licensed a song or two but they weren't actually

[53:59] doing game licenses so they just sort of it's not like a beach boys game yes just

[54:04] has the song just like this a song for the beach boys okay yeah so it's pretty funny that way I

[54:08] wonder if any of the former beach boys half the game that would be a good question to Brian

[54:13] Wilson have a surfants of far in his house can send that in to silver ball chronicles at gmail.com

[54:20] what what actually happened to the real godly but this time so in the 90s the real godly

[54:26] Alvin G godly right they were still around yes and we're gonna and we're gonna go into much more

[54:33] sort of about that in the future but you know some of the bits about them were that so you've got

[54:39] premier godly making games but then all of a sudden you've got sort of Michael and Alvin

[54:46] godly creating their own company like the actual godly from the 70s are actually making games

[54:53] at the same time they weren't able to you allowed to use the godly name so they had to kind of come

[54:58] up with Alvin G and co which is similar to D godly and co yeah so they're they're playing some

[55:05] kind of fun games there but they actually tried to share a factory with premier so they had a

[55:12] working relationship which is really weird now they would make a couple of you know a couple of

[55:16] games really their highlights were punchy the clown we'll get into that some other time that's

[55:21] terrifying Al's garage band goes on world tour which was their biggest seller which only sold a

[55:26] thousand they kind of had this really cool soccer game as well called like soccer

[55:33] well they epistle poker and then he had another one was it something castle was it magic castle

[55:40] it's they had this so that so you can see that there's like this weird thing happening in the pinball

[55:44] market where you know you've got daddy east you've got you know now it's Williams Valley midway

[55:50] you've got you know a a got laben co you've got all all the sudden there's all these people just

[55:57] coming to the woodwork making pinball stuff so you can see there's just a saturation in the pinball

[56:02] market there's lots going on it's kind of it's being reinvigorated it's coming hot again and that's

[56:07] creating like this really weird mess in the pinball industry and then in the mid 90s now so then

[56:13] what happens all of a sudden correction not magic castle I was thinking of the Zachariah mystery castle

[56:20] there so if you've opened up a window to send in some corrections you've now wasted that time

[56:27] sending that email in because Ron has corrected himself I on the other hand do not correct myself I

[56:32] leave that up to Ron or it just never happens really got leabes starts making a big shift into DMD

[56:40] right the whole industry is all the sudden discovered the dot matrix display which is a huge moment

[56:46] in pinball at the time got leab could have been the first company to use a DMD the company that

[56:52] sort of developed that technology and it was able to develop and adapt it to sort of a pinball

[56:57] style machine they originally went to got leab first but they actually would give them if you

[57:03] decided to go with this company with DMD you would get the exclusive rights for 12 months to have

[57:09] DMD in your machine then after that it could go to any manufacturer so what did got leab do

[57:14] oh they turned them down of course why would you want to innovate and make money you know who

[57:20] didn't turn them down Williams didn't yeah so then Williams jumps in and got leab has to wait 12

[57:28] months before they're able to actually make one if that's true how come to have a east had them

[57:33] when did so they headed in that checkpoint right they had they actually had the first one they

[57:39] had the mini the mini DMD yeah you might get some questions on that one the first one designed with

[57:45] a DMD was t2 first one released with it was uh forget now Gilligan silent they're not like the full

[57:53] size lea at least the weapon three has a DMD that's from 92 so maybe that could be true well I'll

[58:00] be horn swagger because I think hook has the small it has the mini DMD is the same one that's like

[58:05] in checkpoint I think Star Trek does too so if you've got if you've got a little further clarity

[58:09] on how that works please send us an email in at silverball chronicles gmail dot com unless I'm

[58:15] right then you can just send something over with paypal as a thank you one of the reasons that got

[58:21] leab turned that down was that it meant more people more staff you had to bring in another person

[58:26] to make the dots you had to bring another person into program they just didn't they didn't want to

[58:30] get into that at that time uh John Norris would actually say it probably added about a hundred and

[58:36] fifty dollars per game and the staff well that would be added to the cost as well it was also a

[58:42] noisy unit and it added a lot of cost above and beyond programming they just really weren't in it

[58:49] for that at the moment I mean you can create a pretty basic DMD system with not like a lot of

[58:55] shenanigans on it but I mean really did you want got laid to be the first one to use that kind

[58:59] of technology anyway like really the track record speaks for itself that's all I'll say

[59:06] comes when uh DMD started up that was like 50 cents a play started coming around a lot more

[59:11] because they'd increased the uh the retail price the MSRP of the pinball machines because

[59:16] there was nobody that was going to just eat the cost of putting this DMD and they were going to make

[59:20] sure that that uh flowed through as they say to the consumer what was the first got laid DMD game

[59:26] the wonderful super Mario brothers it's me the Mario stats

[59:34] I'll just let you marinate on that one this is a video game theme surprise April 1992

[59:40] it's a standard body it sold 4200 units so it was it sold a lot of units and again artwork by

[59:47] constantino and jenny Mitchell David Moore software by Alan Edwell and uh Rand Paulin

[59:55] so very cool uh little game here everybody so you mean licensing may increase sales

[01:00:02] it's it's almost like people realize that if I put a license on it people will play it and not

[01:00:09] only is it a license it's like a proper license right like now when we look at this we're like

[01:00:14] why isn't everybody making Nintendo or video games pinball machines right like for some reason

[01:00:18] the super Mario brothers is like iconic in pinball it's not a great game but yet it's still iconic

[01:00:25] oh it surely is not a great game and it has a really big dot matrix display slightly larger than

[01:00:30] the Williams one that same size is it it's just a picture looks it it makes it look bigger it's the same

[01:00:35] size crazy there was nothing hotter at the time than the Mario brothers this is back when I was

[01:00:41] um fairly young and man Mario was Mario was all in so as Mario riding Rodney he looks like the same

[01:00:49] it's like the same you know he's he's from surface of fire he's made another appearance

[01:00:53] exactly it's like some of the art is just it's you could tell it's on brand but it looks like crap

[01:01:01] yeah John says it took data east to force Williams and us into getting a license

[01:01:06] Joe Kamenkaub and doing it for years it was obvious where it became keeping up with the

[01:01:10] Joneses or whatever positive and negative you give a creativity and some control a license

[01:01:15] people have control over the whole thing every time we had to work on the art we had to submit

[01:01:19] it to Nintendo if the game sells more and earns more that's okay but it may not they had to go

[01:01:24] back and forth with that kind of art like like oh no his his eyes are not crossed enough

[01:01:33] like it's just like they didn't make him chubby enough I don't know he doesn't quite look plumbery

[01:01:39] enough plumbery it's very it's yeah it's very odd but I mean I guess at the time right he's like

[01:01:44] a eight-bit or 16-bit Mario right like he's all blocks and stuff so I guess you kind of don't really

[01:01:49] know more or less kind of what he really really looks like except for maybe the boxes or whatever

[01:01:55] that they had but it's got a warp pipe which is pretty cool that's exciting huh I've played this

[01:02:01] so about and you know what it roped me in because it's like oh it's Mario and you go and you put

[01:02:06] in your 50 cents or whatever and you play it and then you're immediately disappointed and you're

[01:02:10] like well I'll just move on to the next but I can see where kids or whatever would be like oh it's

[01:02:14] Mario and then they play it and they flip it around and they drain and then they put in more money

[01:02:18] is it is super Mario too easy uh well again it's system the system three flippers

[01:02:25] you just wrap everything if I remember it was what you hit you hit a left ramp and then

[01:02:31] another shot just continuously that's all you do the entire game and again suffers from this

[01:02:35] mystery award stuff so Terry and operator from New England says Dave and Ron I love the show

[01:02:42] I won't give you both any dumb nicknames thank you for that uh Terry Mario brother still

[01:02:47] earns everyone has to play it at least once when they see it so I mean there you go right like

[01:02:54] sales numbers don't lie and it's still and it's still to this day it earns right people will tell you

[01:03:01] that that Super Mario brothers earns and South Park earns still to this day yep so how do you

[01:03:08] how do you follow up a great seller like Super Mario brothers well you make it again but smaller

[01:03:14] with Super Mario brothers mushroom kingdom what the hell is that Ron it's a little mini pinball

[01:03:19] machine it's tiny it actually came with two sets of legs so like an adult size set of legs and a

[01:03:25] children's set of legs really yeah so you got to play it on your knees yep so I mean once again

[01:03:31] we can see that Gottlieb is certainly behind the eight ball here yeah speaking of of eight ball it's

[01:03:38] time for the cue ball stats of cue ball wizard which is a billiard theme it's October 1992 it's a

[01:03:45] standard body it's sold 5,700 units wow yeah which at that time how all that how how same art team

[01:03:55] same software and designed by John Norris the guy is a machine it's all he does is just pump out

[01:04:01] play fields yes originally it was a street level game but it was changed into a regular pin by

[01:04:06] adding the ramp in the cue ball yeah so so this is one that he sort of had parked off to the side

[01:04:12] and he just sort of was like oh I could throw a ramp in there and there you go done like the slackers

[01:04:17] guy to build in pinball from Gottlieb in the 1990s right it's great this was this was Gottlieb

[01:04:23] premier's best selling game ever this was the game wasn't Mario wasn't any of the license

[01:04:31] themes like barbed wire or Brooks and done well we're talking we're talking cue ball wizard an

[01:04:37] unbranded hillbilly redneck pool theme with some of the worst it it has a a callouts in the some

[01:04:46] of the callouts in the game are are supposed to be if Clint Eastwood or Clint Eastwood like

[01:04:54] and they're so bad like that's a really bad shot what kind of shot is that it's like

[01:05:01] it I think it was obvious that Gottlieb did not believe in hiring professional voice talent

[01:05:08] so I think they would just use people whoever the programmer was or maybe people in the factory

[01:05:13] just to have new voices so would you say that the impersonation of Clint Eastwood in this game

[01:05:19] for the voice is better or worse than the old man and Jersey jacks wonka I'm not familiar with the

[01:05:26] old managers jacks walk you know the I don't know the old man is telling like I have never played

[01:05:31] the game in in a environment where I could actually hear all the callouts you okay so we'll put up a

[01:05:36] pole somewhere I don't know on the internet and you tell us which ones better or worse I'm not

[01:05:43] going to really put up a pole that's a waste of time no don't do that yeah um John Norris said so

[01:05:50] this game has this really kind of unique upper play field right that has it's unique all right

[01:05:56] that has a pool queue which is the stick you hit the ball with and an eight ball up there that

[01:06:02] hits some targets but then on the lower play field it's got this this floating bar if you will

[01:06:08] and inside is a cue ball right like the white ball that you hit and you can hit that with your

[01:06:14] pinball and it bounces around inside of this thing so according to John Norris he says I really

[01:06:20] had to fight to keep the pool ball in the game at first upper management told me that the pool ball

[01:06:24] needed to be endurance tested so he set up a text fixture that shot a ball with our strongest

[01:06:30] kicker coil into the ball for three inches away after three million hits the test fixture gave out

[01:06:36] and the ball was still intact yes well we all know if this was probably a Williams test fixture it

[01:06:40] probably would last a little bit longer right oh hey you know okay to be honest the system threes

[01:06:48] that they're they're built pretty damn good godly was good at the construction if you actually

[01:06:53] look at their max if you look at their max something like like system three I didn't know this till

[01:06:58] recently in a system three game like all the coils are fused like they each have their own fused

[01:07:03] they're not like bunched up so just to say their construction is good I mean the system is a good

[01:07:11] reliable system it's it's just the and the play fields everyone always says like we want more

[01:07:16] innovative play fields it's like you got them they were called godly but you didn't like them I mean

[01:07:20] they're really designed for like they're they're not designed for this hardcore game player they're

[01:07:27] designed for the pick them up flip them you know turn it over 18 months sell it by another one right

[01:07:32] like there it's a different business model than a Williams right like Williams was like let's

[01:07:37] throw everything in there let's pop a huge number but where both of those companies now godly

[01:07:42] and Williams both out at the same time right godly b also wasn't into fixing any software issues

[01:07:48] but we'll get into that so John Norris also says upper management still wanted the pool ball out

[01:07:53] I got them to agree to make two sets of rules one with the ball and one without we would test the

[01:07:58] two versions side by side the winner will be determined by the cash box we ran out of time to do the

[01:08:04] test since the game needed to be at the AMOA show we placed the machines on the AMOA show floor

[01:08:10] one set without the ball one set with the ball I was told that all the games have been converted to

[01:08:14] having the pool ball in exactly so one would say that they it was so popular with this silly pool

[01:08:21] ball in it that you hit with the ball it out earned on the show floor and then they immediately

[01:08:26] called up John and said all right you win like what an odd thing like it seemed like it was like

[01:08:31] this huge fight how much is it to put this ball in the game that it is such a maker break situation

[01:08:37] it's so weird it it definitely makes the game stand out when you see that thing in there like who

[01:08:43] I wonder can you hit that thing I got to try this out and then you do and it moves around and then

[01:08:49] it kind of comes back into the middle and for as much as I bash it it does have one of the coolest

[01:08:53] call outs the rowdy ramp round I think every game should have a rowdy ramp round it just it just

[01:09:00] makes you feel good yep whenever you hear that it's like rowdy ramp round yeah yeah oh my god

[01:09:08] it's like the ultimate jackpot thing so this is it's like the play field is sort of like those old

[01:09:12] pool like pool themes yeah playing pool was like a thing with pinball machines because of these

[01:09:19] things are in pool halls right is that why pools and cards yeah so they only have like the one ramp

[01:09:25] on the side that goes to that upper play field thing you can almost tell you could see the street

[01:09:31] level version of it and then the ramp put on top yeah with a bunch of just random targets in the

[01:09:37] back yeah this is sort of but it's it's funny that they could just sort of turn that around and it

[01:09:41] be the biggest L.R. just like bam right into the gate I have no explanation it's it's funny

[01:09:47] hey like everything about premier got laid was like what the hell it's not it's it's not a license

[01:09:53] unlike their next game yeah so the tale of the tape the street fighter stats video game fighting

[01:09:59] theme it's from October 92 standard body it sells 5,000 550 on a unit street fighter to design by

[01:10:07] this is a group actually to put this one together john norris ray tanser mic vitro's and bill parker

[01:10:13] same art team uh and uh ran pollen as um software this was a big license at the time right like

[01:10:21] street fighter 2 was a huge hit it was massive john norris would say that they actually took this

[01:10:28] license away from data east which i'm sure for them was a huge coup uh john thought that maybe

[01:10:33] it was actually a thumb in the nose from capcom video well daddy east actually had a video game

[01:10:38] department as well so maybe there was like a little bit of a we don't want a competitor to have

[01:10:42] the pinball version of our machine but that's a that's a that's a that was not much in video game at

[01:10:49] that sort of moments in time that was bigger than street fighter 2 maybe maybe mortal combat uh

[01:10:56] wouldn't have been out yet or would have just been out what about that terminator 2 shooting game

[01:11:01] that was huge give it out that was a year before i played a lot of that t2 could game a lot of that

[01:11:07] and street fighter has progressive multi ball yeah so what's progressive multi ball is that like a

[01:11:13] multi ball that is gender neutral uh no it's just multi ball that keeps track of where you were

[01:11:19] okay so so you so if you drain and you go back into multi ball it remembers how many jackpots you

[01:11:25] had right or if you were doing a series of things you had to do it remember where you were

[01:11:30] very cool very cool and this is um one of these innovations the john norris ray tansor would

[01:11:35] often talk about where the system three board was actually pretty smart with the way it was able

[01:11:40] to sort of come up with these uh uses or that they could program these uses into them although i

[01:11:45] would argue if if you're using that concept that it remembers where you were in the multi ball

[01:11:51] something like say a 14 top cat does the same thing it remembers how many

[01:11:56] safe landings you had so the next time you get into multi ball because i think it's every three

[01:12:00] safe landings is a jackpot it would remember that so if you want to be picky as i'm sure

[01:12:06] of people listening might be picky wait a minute there's been multi balls that keep track of where

[01:12:10] you were before but they they were probably more they were probably considering it like it's a

[01:12:15] multi stage multi ball with different tasks and it will keep track of where you are i'm guessing

[01:12:20] that's what they meant by it very cool street fighter was cool it's got that cool car in the

[01:12:24] bottom a little bit right where you can bash the car that's always broken street fighter street fighter's

[01:12:29] terror it is it is a terrible game it's terrible but as far as got leaves concerned it's the second

[01:12:35] greatest game right yeah of course when it comes to sales numbers yeah i mean it's got a cool like

[01:12:40] corkscrew ramp thing which is kind of neat it kind of goes up the ramp and down like a a wire form

[01:12:46] that's kind of cool it's got two ramps i played one once in man those flippers just trap everything

[01:12:52] it's just it's like it's like the baby's first drop catch it's amazing it kills it the the next one

[01:12:58] that we're going to talk about here the second best knockoff to caddy shack teed off right yeah

[01:13:06] after run bashing all these games he will totally put over teed off i love teed off this is the one

[01:13:11] we're going to dive into now this is an obvious knockoff of caddy shack which is one of my favorite

[01:13:17] comedies of all time yeah it sells three thousand five hundred units this is from may of 93

[01:13:23] in other words before no good gophers so take that Williams yeah pat lawler what separates this one

[01:13:34] from the Williams game is the amazing topper that this game has it's like a gofer in a in a bubble

[01:13:41] jl green was a marketing person it got lead and he was all in on the gofer on top and it was an

[01:13:47] expensive unit as john norris say as i recall that there was a lot of opposition to the unit because

[01:13:53] of its cost the money could have been spent on a license or something on the playfield actually

[01:13:58] it's it's it's a full like stuffed gofer and has a motor in it and he moves super he'll move during

[01:14:04] the game and he'll move while it's just in a track mode which could freak you out if you don't

[01:14:09] realize it moves because you'll just hear and the thing starts to move and whoa it may be one of the

[01:14:14] tallest back boxes it's like they got one of those novelty club covers and just sort of stuck it

[01:14:19] on there i love if our listeners want to tell us what is the tallest back box with the topper i

[01:14:25] be curious because this has to be up there i mean i know you have things like um

[01:14:29] the dungeons and dragons which had the ridiculously large topper heavy metal meltdown at a whole

[01:14:33] boom box thing on it then you have like weak lights camera action but this thing is so tall

[01:14:39] yeah it's not it's not wide like the length of the thing it's like straight up and it's in a system

[01:14:44] three back box which are already taller than the other manufacturers back boxes but i have a

[01:14:50] fairly um high ceiling in my basement i think even i it still would be too tall for the topper

[01:14:56] it's a neat it's a neat little game and i again i love caddy shak so you can you know you know if

[01:15:01] you don't want to spend money on a theme how do you knock a theme off well you create a golf theme

[01:15:05] with a gofer there you go and everybody's gonna go oh it's like caddy shak that's close enough right

[01:15:10] but it's not caddy shak it's got so many cool features in there it's got the ridiculous topper

[01:15:17] but it has as roulette wheel underneath the playfield it has just a very unique playfield with a

[01:15:22] cool multi-ball rule set where you're trying to go through the holes one through nine then you

[01:15:26] lock a ball then you can do and this is a cool feature i don't know if anyone else did this

[01:15:31] godly did it i think in more than one game where you lock the first ball then you plunge if you

[01:15:36] can plunge a saucer then it'll give you a third ball if you can't plunge it then it's a two-ball

[01:15:41] multi-ball so you with your skill decide whether it's a two-ball or a three-ball multi-ball

[01:15:46] so this is like the predecessor to the ball hanging on a magnet thing hit the ball off the magnet

[01:15:52] and you get three balls no well yeah i guess so i guess so i know you're saying but this one it's got

[01:15:59] it has a bunch of modes which are little golf balls that go across and honestly most it suffers

[01:16:04] from the usual got leaps off or issues in that you don't really play any of the modes half the time

[01:16:09] because it really not worth near as much as the multi-ball is you want to get in a multi-ball and

[01:16:13] get supers and then you want to get to the wizard modes and that's the game it's got some great

[01:16:17] art oh yes good good art it has the issue with the flippers we can trap everything under the sun

[01:16:21] if you could fix that and it has one of the features i really like it's called skins and again

[01:16:27] they they threw a lot of money in this game which means between the top or the roulette wheel the

[01:16:32] actual apron has lighting in it for the skin so you can see and john norris like to do this this

[01:16:38] was one of his things he liked it progressive thing that would cross over games so on the apron

[01:16:42] there's skins and gofer and i think that gofer one was something that held across games the

[01:16:49] skins one there was there's a mode in there called skins and you try to spell skins and an

[01:16:53] exclamation point it actually counts as a letter if you spell it then you get to make a decision

[01:16:59] and the decision is do you want to double your score you want to try to double your score yes or no

[01:17:04] so as john norris said i did the rule set for this game i really like the enhanced double or

[01:17:08] nothing feature the player with wager tire score on the success of a timed round if the player was

[01:17:13] unsuccessful their score would go to zero but they have the opportunity to recover the score by

[01:17:17] completing a feature so in skins you spell it it gives you the decision and what you want to do you

[01:17:22] want to hold that until later in the game when you have like you could have say i have three billion

[01:17:26] like i've had a killer game and i go for it so double or nothing double or nothing and you say go

[01:17:32] for it it'll give you a random shot on the play field and you have like five ten seconds to hit it

[01:17:36] if you don't hit it your score goes to zero if you hit it and my my score go to like six billion

[01:17:42] so that's how you would get just obscene high scores on the game i saw the jack danger play this

[01:17:46] one time on his twitch and his twitch stream at dead flip he actually lost a three billion score

[01:17:53] and just the reaction was priceless just priceless i think he didn't realize it actually went to zero

[01:17:59] yeah people don't realize like oh wait a minute they actually meant my score would go to zero i

[01:18:04] would lose everything you're kidding yeah and the thing is about got leave unlike the other

[01:18:08] manufacturers got leave did not believe in on grace periods when their timers end they end that's

[01:18:14] it you don't know grace period so that's see lineman saves my skin nonstop grace periods all the time

[01:18:20] well they're they were they were doing it before lineman was there but yeah lineman is known for

[01:18:24] his extremely long grace periods yeah so Ron Hallett from the slam tilt podcast wrote in and said

[01:18:32] one of my favorite system three look at that did i i think i uh yeah he said that to me on a text

[01:18:38] yeah i love that game that in surf and safari will probably be the two system three's i would consider

[01:18:44] owning i know people are saying not stargate no not start next up was wipe out now wipe out was a

[01:18:50] tober 93 ray tanser so kind of offsetting each other it sells 2150 ran pollen on dots in animation

[01:18:59] the you know the michels once again david moron art again you know they're just turn in the

[01:19:04] mouth turn in the mouth turn in the mouth it's amazing wipe out is like a it's like a snowboarding

[01:19:10] extreme sports thing which was all the rage in the mid to late 90s it captures the thrills

[01:19:17] chills and spills of skiing in pinball and it has the path of adventure in it oh before the path

[01:19:23] of adventure existed that sounds like that sounds like a lot of fun um except i don't believe you can

[01:19:28] control it no no it's up on the top left side of the playfield uh sorry the top right the top

[01:19:34] right of the playfield you kind of go up there and it's it's very much that uh lord of the rings

[01:19:40] well it actually it rocks back and forth oh very cool see i've never even seen one of these it

[01:19:45] rocks back if it's this is before the path of adventure so they were again Williams you know what i

[01:19:50] mean they just can't come up with their own original idea a little head of Williams with some

[01:19:54] and playfield innovations Williams just made it so you could control it um in this game it's there's

[01:19:59] a ski lift you go up and it's supposed to be you're at the top and you're you're going to ski down

[01:20:04] and it will rock back and forth to simulate you're going down the hill you're skiing down the hill

[01:20:09] they didn't lack imagination it would ed godly yeah the funny thing about this is we found a

[01:20:14] little bug with this came where if you if you had if you had balls locked in the game ended it would

[01:20:19] release the balls and it would like go down that ski that would it would go down the path of

[01:20:24] adventure it took so long to go down the game would actually go into a ball search oh you after

[01:20:30] the game is over like no balls found because it took so long to clear the balls out but uh yeah we're

[01:20:36] looking at the pictures here it has a working ski lift that actually moves also cool godly did a lot

[01:20:42] of weird cool stuff with the ball it's like it's like if they had again you know if they had

[01:20:47] instead of six months or eight months to get a game out if they had ten or twelve like what could

[01:20:53] they have really really done they had better programming more more time to fix scoring and balances

[01:20:59] which they had a lot of after this is a really cool story type game and not what it actually is

[01:21:06] or the story of the game it actually how this game came to be and uh we're talking about gladiators

[01:21:12] like gladiators it's like Roman Empire fight and thing but according to what you sent me that's

[01:21:19] not what it was supposed to be no according to john norris he says originally it was to be the

[01:21:24] legend of zelda god leaves license with nintendo also gave us a third title i chose zelda because

[01:21:30] it was a popular nintendo title entirely out was completed with this theme in mind then marketing

[01:21:35] decided that an upcoming television series called american gladiators would be a better choice

[01:21:40] so we banned in the zelda theme and changed the game american gladiators was absolutely amazing

[01:21:45] wasn't run it was a great choice it was like it was a huge hit well according to your show notes

[01:21:49] it wasn't but it actually was it was on forever that was a big at least in this country american

[01:21:54] gladiators was if you ask someone when american gladiators is they're gonna know what it is as opposed

[01:22:00] to if you ask them with roller games is they probably would have no idea what that is yeah totally

[01:22:04] uh... now a month or two later the tv series came out and it bombed no it didn't oh it didn't bomb how

[01:22:11] could it bomb it was on for like five to ten years well this is a is a quote from john oh i'm sorry

[01:22:17] john oh i'm correcting john norris i apologize john so as john says a month or two later the tv

[01:22:22] series came out and bombed now management decided to simply change the art to gladiators this

[01:22:27] entire process was a disaster we did not have the luxury of having a year to develop each title

[01:22:32] we typically had eight to twelve weeks for each game while the final art was better than i thought it

[01:22:37] would be yeah so one of his favorite games he ever made he says on on on various sources and it was

[01:22:43] fun but it really really suffered and one of those was a massive scoring exploit on one of the ramps

[01:22:52] you alluded to this sort of previously is how got leaps sort of struggles with code and balances

[01:22:58] and fixing code yep they wouldn't let them fix the code issue even according to john it was two

[01:23:03] lines of code that would have taken to fix that exploit yeah so it really ruined the game for some

[01:23:07] now it had a lot of fun shots it was very flowy some would say uh... john's most flowy um game

[01:23:15] it was a lot of fun it just the theme is a turd super cool shots and it's got this one just brutal

[01:23:21] exploit on the on the ramp when i did my sort of searching through godly did would do this so

[01:23:28] so nowadays everything is like super secret within all machines right nobody ever releases anything

[01:23:34] they all sort of keep it on the down low and then all of a sudden it shows up on the internet or

[01:23:38] it shows up somewhere then the photos come and it's on ordered pre-orders out the door back in the day

[01:23:44] they would put them on location they'd sort of test them out a little bit they'd fix a tweak

[01:23:48] anything and then they would release it because back then you didn't have to worry about people

[01:23:51] posting things on the internet because if somebody saw something in chicago it would be very very

[01:23:56] few people in new york or the california or down south in the u.s. that would actually see the

[01:24:02] machine right which has never happened if they put a game on location let's say like gladiator

[01:24:07] people are playing it you know they're checking the max to make sure things aren't breaking

[01:24:10] in the plastics and stuff the code seems to be fine if they didn't catch it if the programmer

[01:24:16] and the designer didn't catch an issue with the code like it like a great example is gladiator

[01:24:22] it went into production like that and that was it there were no revisions no you were done

[01:24:27] and what i'll say this era around this time gladiator teed off if you want to see a really

[01:24:34] cool little video just open up your browser go to google and search for i think it's um chicago slices

[01:24:40] got leave yeah i'll include it in our show notes as well got leave and you will get a tour by john

[01:24:45] norris himself which is funny because they start to go through the factory a bit but then obviously

[01:24:49] they don't want them in the factory so they end up in the break room at got leave and john norris

[01:24:54] just explains a couple of the games to the guy but you can see john norris doing things like alie

[01:24:58] passing and tap passing and all kinds of stuff and this is like in the early 90s he is like a proper

[01:25:03] player they say yeah it's so it's a very cool video highly recommended another fun story sort

[01:25:09] of at this time and you can see that there's like this in the industry at the time there's

[01:25:13] almost like this rivalry a friendly rivalry if you will between the manufacturers right they all

[01:25:19] generally probably go to lunch together and see each other and have beers at the expose and things

[01:25:24] like that so it's funny to see them sort of poking around at each other and this is a prime example

[01:25:30] of that and this is a game called world challenge soccer that sounds familiar yeah no not the awesome

[01:25:38] game by john poppadook this one is the john norris masterpiece called world challenge soccer well

[01:25:45] according to john six months before the world cup this would be 1994 we went for the license and

[01:25:50] we learned Williams already had it yeah so what they did is they decided to just say uh screw

[01:25:55] him we'll make our own soccer game anyway and we won't call it world cup because they beat us to

[01:25:59] the license we'll just call it world challenge soccer yep so he took car hop the original is the

[01:26:04] street level game car hop he added a couple wire ramps and they made they were gonna originally

[01:26:09] produce 1200 but they actually upped production because of demand yeah it was like so they had like

[01:26:14] they're like oh well what is the one strategic advantage that got leap has over Williams I know

[01:26:19] we can release a game in six weeks so they find out that Williams has the world cup license they go

[01:26:25] we're gonna make our own soccer game around the same time we're gonna capitalize on the same

[01:26:30] market we're gonna build it faster it's probably gonna be cheaper and we're gonna get it to market

[01:26:35] faster and that's just exactly what they did so they have a gap in their line in their production

[01:26:39] line they need something to fill it and they just jam this in and I played this game for the first

[01:26:44] time last year is it is it better or worse than world cup soccer it's not even in world cup soccer

[01:26:51] sleek it's not even in the same dimension no brutal brutal but it's funny that they're just like

[01:26:57] well this is what we're gonna do and then they do it it's just funny right that's just silly

[01:27:01] follow that up with kind of a really unique game with probably one of the coolest 90s toys

[01:27:07] coolest toy which is rescue 911 and that's based on the rescue 911 tv series

[01:27:12] hosted by William Shatner fellow can you yeah so this is the ABC docu drama which aired from 89 to 96

[01:27:20] oh it was on seven years wow it was hosted it was hosted by the chat William Shatner and it had

[01:27:25] these like reenactments of emergencies that were involved 911 calls it was rated really really

[01:27:32] high for this kind of type of show another one at the time was like unsolved mysteries right

[01:27:37] what's all mysteries love that so they would they would air one right after the other I remember in

[01:27:42] the early 90s and this was like must watch TV for at least two seasons because they were on it was

[01:27:47] like prime time it wasn't news it wasn't a Dallas you know what I mean it was like this kind of

[01:27:54] reenactment thing and it was telling stories about you know heroes and and the first responders and

[01:27:59] things who are and this is a really kind of a cool story how this machine sort of came about well

[01:28:05] this was designed by Bill Parker and this was his first design and he actually built the prototype

[01:28:10] for this game in his apartment now he's an interesting character because he knew Python and

[01:28:15] you know it Williams actually really really well and he asked him for a lot of help and support and

[01:28:20] Python said should I do the Python voice of course oh god rescue 911 was not with Bill had the

[01:28:27] Newsy part when he built it I'll help you build it as long as Williams has first kicking the can

[01:28:33] Williams let me use the parts Billy Parker is running lights on the side of the cabinet

[01:28:38] a big helicopter with magnets dropping balls out of the box thinking they're he demolished he saw

[01:28:44] it when they brought it in they were threatened and killed the game at Williams got leap higher Billy

[01:28:48] Parker that is so that is so something that Python angelo would say that they were intimidated and

[01:28:55] they killed it yes so we're gonna we're gonna jump into Python angelo on his own dedicated podcast

[01:28:59] we're gonna call it a bad shit crazy the Python angelo story but the helicopter toy is extremely

[01:29:05] cool but there's the issue is it is so overused every time you hit it there it does the same thing

[01:29:12] it takes forever for it to actually do its thing it grabs the ball it has a helicopter basically

[01:29:16] on like a crane thing and it's the blades on the helicopter actually move and then the whole helicopter

[01:29:21] moves all the way up to the top left hand of the playfield and drops the ball but like it does

[01:29:25] it every time you have to sit there wait for it it's not a good game it's it's almost like it would

[01:29:30] have been cooler if it was a reward right like that was the reward or something like I made the

[01:29:35] helicopter pick up the ball and move yeah it it it becomes like a oh we put the toy in we better

[01:29:40] damn we'll use it and I think I used this story before but when they originally had Adam's family

[01:29:44] on test they made a modification to one of the toys and how frequently it was used what's

[01:29:49] what do you think that would be hand yeah thing it was overused so they they they dialed back

[01:29:55] so you would have more of an effect yeah you then you get into this sort of iron monger thing right

[01:30:00] where the friggin iron monger is up all the time and you're shooting at all the time and it's just

[01:30:04] like go away let me play the game that's the same thing with this friggin helicopter right it's just

[01:30:08] coming in it's picking the ball up is dropping it off it's coming over picking a ball up drop it

[01:30:12] off it's like man stop it iron mongers way more awesome though you can hit it imagine if you could

[01:30:16] hit it imagine if it took the ball and while it was moving you could hit the ball off of the helicopter

[01:30:23] oh yeah there you go and then the helicopter does a similar crash sequence to like the the

[01:30:29] vengeance ship and Star Trek oh that would be awesome you hit the ball off of the magnet and instead

[01:30:34] of a two ball multiple you get a three ball multiple blew your mind yeah so good why aren't we

[01:30:40] where why aren't we making pinball machines because that would probably cost $10,000 per game

[01:30:46] I guess could use lasers maybe they already did that any who if we move on to the next one

[01:30:52] Freddy nightmare on Elm Street I have only played this once you know was nothing more terrifying

[01:30:57] when I was younger than then friggin Freddy and the Elm Street movies for some reason they scared

[01:31:05] the crap at me welcome to prime time oh no I won't say the full line but yeah but I'll tell you

[01:31:12] uh Freddy's nightmare on Elm Street it oozed the nightmare on Elm Street theme it looks good it was

[01:31:17] nightmare on Elm Street the colors the creepy face on the play field of Freddy the glove hand

[01:31:24] even the side art on the cabinet just screamed the theme of nightmare on Elm Street

[01:31:31] which is weird because godly was kind of known for being more uh family friendly to

[01:31:35] accompany with their themes yeah they were they were like as well kind of thing yeah so this is

[01:31:40] kind of weird that they would have done this this license and the actual Freddy Krueger did the

[01:31:45] voice stuff oh Robert um England England whatever's name is yeah they didn't go and they didn't

[01:31:51] get a knockoff wow you know it was an odd bit in this time era right it's not a knockoff it's a

[01:31:57] theme it's horror theme it's not class of 1812 silly horror it's cool I mean it's not a great game

[01:32:04] but it's cool so rate handser on Elm Street said my career as a pinball game designer has allowed

[01:32:10] me to create some games that offer the players new features I enjoyed designing this game as I felt

[01:32:15] it was enjoyed by the novice and the pro player I love the claw ball save I loved the flipper glove

[01:32:23] and Freddy's head super cool although the face you know as realistic as it was the head on the

[01:32:29] play field it was just creepy isn't isn't at the point yeah but it's it's it doesn't look like him

[01:32:36] and it doesn't look really bad it's like in the middle it's it's like even this creeps me like I

[01:32:42] just was something about Freddy I can't remember there was like there was one of the movies there

[01:32:46] was somebody in a basement and he came down that's all of them oh my god yeah it's every single one

[01:32:53] oh even to this day just thinking about it creeps me out then the best one shack attack I don't know

[01:32:58] if I've ever played shack attack I've heard I shouldn't yeah so I mean I guess we could call it

[01:33:03] the the shack attack EA was actually the licensor for shack which is pretty interesting and just like

[01:33:10] how they this time they were doing NBA at Williams NBA fast break right NBA fast break NBA is another

[01:33:19] in another great one hey I like it I'm the only one so NBA fast break is coming so no they're not

[01:33:25] trying to make another you know basketball game at the time just to sort of capitalize on it but

[01:33:30] John Norris he he hates this game he hates this game like you would not believe he hates the art

[01:33:37] he thinks it has the worst back glass he's ever had on any one of his games and this is a guy who

[01:33:42] had back glasses from the system 80b bit era the earlier back glass of shack was actually him

[01:33:48] breaking the backboard but that was rejected by the licensor why that sounds super cool they wanted

[01:33:53] shack big and huge and he's on the play field and he's super tall and towering over everybody they

[01:33:58] actually forced John Norris to have the coach who do you have you heard the coach in this game I've

[01:34:04] never played this game so the coach is sort of like your announcer guy shoot for this and get that

[01:34:11] he's like the NBA jam guy except bad I'm guessing he's it was so bad in fact and John Norris hated it

[01:34:18] so much that he actually had the coder have a way to turn the coach off in the code now it was

[01:34:25] shipped with it on because it had to be but you could turn it off and every time he ever sees anybody

[01:34:31] ever who has or mentions this game he tells them to turn the coach off he hates it so much you can

[01:34:36] see that there's obviously some stress here between the management the design teams you know

[01:34:42] things are starting to kind of get weird at premier gotlib I will say as much as I put down some

[01:34:49] of these games I recommend everyone go play these make up your own mind and that's true that's

[01:34:54] true they are my got leave experience there's a show called California extreme and they would have

[01:34:59] this is probably 10 years ago they would have they were like half video games half pinball and the

[01:35:04] pinballs it was tough to get on them because they would just be the lions for all these games and

[01:35:09] they were all like you attack from bars medieval madness so your classic Williams games and then

[01:35:14] there would be this row of got leaves with games like gladiators and shack attack etc and there's

[01:35:19] no line so that's where I got to play all these games I'm glad I did so give them a try no matter

[01:35:24] how much we say they may suck who knows you might think you ball wizard is the greatest game ever made

[01:35:29] you might you might play shack attack and say man you know what I remember shack and this game

[01:35:35] is too much fun and this is this would fit right in to my shakil o'Neal themed bar in my basement or

[01:35:43] you might go in and you might say hey you know what this operation thunder is so good and it matches

[01:35:50] the theme of my bathroom it would fit right in well it's is an operation thunder when you run out of

[01:35:56] gas so so it might fit with your bathroom we think you run out of fuel and you die I think that's

[01:36:01] another one of those huh not three balls of game but time bait not time based but I think you

[01:36:06] got to keep your fuel up or you crash or something like that maybe shack attack isn't your thing

[01:36:11] maybe you're more into baseball yeah so you're going to play some frank Thomas Frank Thomas is

[01:36:16] big hurt and the funny thing is when got leave one out of business I believe it came out that he

[01:36:21] actually never got paid shack shack did but frank Thomas did not during this time we're getting

[01:36:25] into this like tromolcho is period right like this is like they really peaked at cuba wizard street

[01:36:32] fighter kind of wipe out they kind of they're a little bit coming down then that rescue 911 right

[01:36:38] and then they get sort of stargate Freddy shack attack and then it just it's off a cliff war yeah

[01:36:45] water world Mario and dready it this is we're getting into the dry period here folks so let's get to

[01:36:52] let's say the high point that some tournament players and some collectors would say of the system

[01:36:57] three era which is the got leave system three masterpiece stargate remember to shoot the pyramid okay

[01:37:06] Ron shoot the pyramid yeah so it's movie space theme based on the stargate movie is a standard body

[01:37:14] 3600 units John Norris Ray Tansford design again the Mitchell's and Dave Moore on art and Alan

[01:37:21] Edwell on software and the interesting thing is it's it's kind of like a lot of today's licenses in

[01:37:26] that they got the license for the movie they had the likenesses of the actors including Kurt

[01:37:30] Russell he's on the play field but they have no actual callouts or anyone from the movie it's

[01:37:35] just some dude doing the callouts it was probably the programmer or someone who worked just worked

[01:37:39] it got least somebody's brother it's like the same voice you hit the pyramid hit the pyramid I

[01:37:43] remember seeing seeing stargate years and I remember seeing I don't remember I don't remember it

[01:37:49] because I remember it not being a great movie so it's and it's not like a not great movie that

[01:37:54] you kind of watch just because you do right it's not it didn't fall into one of those sort of

[01:37:59] genres I remember it had the crying game dude in it that was like the only other thing he was in

[01:38:04] I'll think the crying game it had a budget of fifty five million dollars in nineteen ninety four

[01:38:09] and it had a box office of two hundred million which is actually pretty solid that's very solid

[01:38:13] that's a good gift for godly yeah like it's um you know look up the wikipedia page it wasn't a

[01:38:21] great movie it wasn't a bad movie it's one of those it's like that sci-fi era in that time was

[01:38:27] so dominated by sort of star Trek Esk sci-fi that it was really hard to make something really

[01:38:33] different and not and not just seem like too weird the game is good you would you would approve

[01:38:39] it's probably one of their better games typical typical good good play field it's got

[01:38:44] their sarcophagus things that whatever they pop up it's got the super cool I mean the pyramid

[01:38:50] thing when it opens up and the thing comes out starts moving back and forth that's pretty damn cool

[01:38:55] when it opens up what are you supposed to do oh I don't know you shoot the pyramid oh okay

[01:38:58] okay actually has it has modes it has modes you want to play as a wizard mode third

[01:39:04] flipper tutorials out there's got then it's yes got sci-flipper shot got a diverter yeah it's it's

[01:39:10] it's not it's not bad it's not bad at all keyel when more diverters please it it's got this call out

[01:39:16] that tells you to shoot the pyramid and it happens a lot right it happens a lot shoot the pyramid

[01:39:22] is it like the hurry one from that stern hurry hurry hurt no it's not as annoying as that I've never

[01:39:28] played see the thing is it's they you know they sold a lot but not a lot a lot of these right so I

[01:39:33] don't see them around very often I'd love to give it a flip it seems pretty cool the left side

[01:39:38] of the play field seems kind of neat right it's fairly close and in your face it's not it's got

[01:39:43] some kind of unique shots side flipper to a ramp got a lot of that arts kind of cool right it's

[01:39:48] very spacing yeah and the white targets if you're looking at them to the right of the pyramid and

[01:39:53] the one on the left those actually lift up those are mechs it's a cool it's a cool little little

[01:39:59] slow you know as long as you can get through shoot the pyramid there are modes that require you

[01:40:03] to do things other than shoot the pyramid I can tell you that that's good that's good now it's

[01:40:07] this is one this is one that's on my list I want to see it at about this time premier is trying

[01:40:12] to diversify their portfolio they're trying to sort of get into some different markets right they're

[01:40:16] trying to boost their bottom line to do what Williams did except Williams did it much earlier

[01:40:22] Williams got into the slot machine business and they it took a while for them to get in because

[01:40:28] it takes forever to get approved and at the time Williams got into it I think it was the main one

[01:40:34] was it was IGT and Williams were the ones making the slot machines and IGT had the majority of them

[01:40:39] and Williams had some some pretty big cash flows in the early 90s they're selling tens of

[01:40:45] thousands of units you look at something like the Adams family terminator to these games are

[01:40:50] selling a lot so they're making margins and they've got good cash flows in the company so premier is

[01:40:54] like well we got to get in on this cash cow which is gambling and they purchased a company called

[01:41:00] sms which made lottery terminals and unfortunately I can't look up what SMS stands for I wasn't

[01:41:06] able to find that if you know shoot us an email at silver ball chronicles at gmail.com they made

[01:41:11] poker video lottery terminals or VLTs and they would put them in in you know bars or pubs and

[01:41:17] you know they're fairly large in Atlanta Canada we have them you know quite a few places and this

[01:41:23] is sort of your new slot machine stuff new different kind of more innovative games and you know they

[01:41:29] bought this company in the expectation that they would then sort of have a pinball division for

[01:41:34] you know kitty gambling or whatever and then you would have your actual gambling thing in

[01:41:39] casinos and bars and restaurants but they didn't just have a bunch of cash on hand so what they did

[01:41:45] is they took out a bunch of business loans and this will come into play a little bit later but you

[01:41:50] just can't buy this company and then there you go put it into a bar right you got to go state by state

[01:41:55] in the United States and province by province in Canada and you have to get a license for every single

[01:42:00] one and each one has different rules like how many times you can win how many is your maximum bet

[01:42:05] you know how much is the payout how often is the payout all this stuff you get into some issues

[01:42:10] and this is kind of where the issues start with premiere well then they jump into water world

[01:42:15] probably the greatest movie to ever involve jet skis and wave runners in a guy with gills i didn't see

[01:42:21] this movie i have not seen the movie i have seen things about the movie i know Dennis Hopper's a bad guy

[01:42:28] i remember that they used to talk about how expensive it was this movie was like one of the most

[01:42:33] expensive movies ever made it has a really cool mac on the back which is like a rotating

[01:42:39] waterfall thing ball lock honestly don't think i've ever played a water world because the times i've

[01:42:46] seen one they've been broken it's because they got played so much because water world was such an

[01:42:49] awesome movie hey at the time they got i'm sure they got the license while the movie was in

[01:42:53] development and it just seemed like a good idea that must be the worst feeling is not to get i mean

[01:42:57] you have what what's his name made the movie right what's the chemist yes it was his project and his

[01:43:02] last project was dances with wool so if i hear Kevin Costas making this new movie i'm i'm in dive in

[01:43:07] sorry about the point i've yeah what's bad unfortunately the movie sunk oh there you go you

[01:43:15] like that two in a row you know this this is this is the gamble i think that you've got when it comes

[01:43:22] to licensing is that often you're getting into licenses at this time before the movie came out

[01:43:28] so you're not sure if the movie is any good there's an amazing George Gomez story about Johnny

[01:43:33] Mononic Johnny pneumatic they had this game they got the license they built this very very cool pinball

[01:43:39] machine one of one of George and George Gomez got to a point it's like okay we're to the point

[01:43:44] where we got to start putting some stuff from the movie in here i got to we got to see the movie

[01:43:48] so he went to a screening saw the movie i mean as soon as the screen was over got on a pay phone

[01:43:53] call back as it can we get out of this this is the worst movie i've ever seen poor guy good game

[01:43:57] but that's the gamble that's but that's it you know you got a good game you put a lot of time

[01:44:01] and effort into it you don't want to see your game suck because of the license and sure enough

[01:44:05] but that's waves we're talking about godly yeah this is powerful the course so you had a story

[01:44:09] about water world poor mr. tanzar oh yes basically according to john norris he said management

[01:44:14] costed the game by two to three hundred dollars they took out two to four max off the game and put

[01:44:20] them on ray tanzar's chair when we returned from vacation he knew the game that was on the line

[01:44:25] wasn't his how tough is that a things are like the the wheels are starting to come off right things

[01:44:30] are not good wonder what was supposed to be on there originally it seemed pretty packed in that

[01:44:34] picture today's standards it's pretty packed right like it's been an le yeah so it's funny to see now

[01:44:40] that you know they took some stuff off so i mean john norris if you're listening you can email us

[01:44:45] at silver ball chronicles at gmail dot com it's kind of funny how they were so reluctant to get

[01:44:50] in the licensing but by the end if you look at their last games like rescue 911

[01:44:54] Freddy shack attack stargate frank Thomas they did have strikes and spares which was a redemption

[01:45:00] game water world mario undready so that's a game yeah that's a game it's got a little

[01:45:06] thing that circles around 360 like a race car that goes around it's on uh it's it's a game i played it

[01:45:14] it's uh again interesting playfield rules maybe not the best i mean i guess mario

[01:45:21] dready was a was a big thing at the time i mean he's no he's no shumacher right he's no

[01:45:26] handset center right i would art he was well known i mean he was probably still the one of

[01:45:31] the most well known indie drivers indie car drivers so this is like if you take hot wheels

[01:45:36] from american pinball that has that spinning car it looks just like it that's what i thought of

[01:45:41] when i saw it two it's got two cars in the middle yeah i thought of mario undready then they did

[01:45:47] their final game bar wire oh my god bar wire so i remember bar wire and the only reason i remember

[01:45:54] that is because of the lead actress Pamela Anderson who was Canadian who was the biggest

[01:46:00] biggest star at the time she was featured in playboy she was like a sex symbol she was on baywatch

[01:46:08] she married Tommy from uh motley crew um you know she was the first celebrity sex tape it was like

[01:46:15] she there was she was a brand in herself and she was everywhere everybody knew her and everybody

[01:46:22] made jokes and everybody was crazy for some reason she gets into acting and i'll use that lightly

[01:46:27] this this movie was for may of 1996 this was her vehicle this was the you know thing to make

[01:46:33] her a star bar wire it cost nine million dollars to make this movie and the box office was three

[01:46:39] point eight million you know why it hurts me specifically why non pinball related thing when

[01:46:47] bar wire was made bar wire was made through a gramacy pictures i think that's what they were called

[01:46:52] who also at the same time had mystery science theater the movie oh yes so so these two the two

[01:46:59] movies were ready to come out and they just i guess probably because they didn't have a lot of money

[01:47:03] they had to decide which one to do the why distribution to you know they actually released it to all

[01:47:08] the theaters they chose bar wire wow Pamela Anderson won the worst new star the golden razz

[01:47:15] very awarded 1996 this movie has a 28 percent rotten tomatoes approval rating roger ebert would point

[01:47:21] out that the films plot was identical to that of kasa blanca uh and the the game wasn't that much

[01:47:29] you wonder at that point how much it was clustered out of it oh my god could you imagine it's uh

[01:47:34] it's a whole thing it you know like when you get to this point where it's like pimp like the pinball

[01:47:41] companies are just started doing whatever they can and the things are just kind of coming together

[01:47:46] and you know you're at the end and the writings of the wall it's just it's tough to comment it

[01:47:51] because you know there's guys like ray tans or you know there's guys like john norris and they're

[01:47:56] putting a lot of effort they're putting a lot of heart and soul into these things and for us to

[01:48:00] kind of just crap on it it's not fair right but my god i played the game it may be fair in this case

[01:48:07] but they made a thousand of them uh isn't that crazy they still made more of these

[01:48:11] they still made a thousand and they still went on to their next game they started development

[01:48:15] of their next game yeah which which thank god they didn't make it because i oh you never know

[01:48:22] brookson done brookson done would have been their next game another license

[01:48:27] they had done a basic play field it was gonna have a jukebox on the play field i have actually

[01:48:33] played it the prototype wow but i mean the software was so not even barely started it was just it

[01:48:38] was just a play field it just flipping a play field it was one time i was driving through Ontario

[01:48:42] and i saw brookson done tour bus and i was like huh look at that and that was it so that's the last

[01:48:48] i ever thought about brookson done yep i mean the play field the art all that stuff was done so this

[01:48:52] was actually oddly enough this wasn't just designed by john norris and ray tanser there was a a

[01:48:58] a new fella called tim seckel he would say i designed the game with rules and actually the program

[01:49:05] was never actually completed by bob wilson and john burress the play field was complete when got

[01:49:10] leap closed but the software wasn't so that's that's the end you know they went out on a high note

[01:49:16] brookson done barbuyer mario and drenny but they gave us teed off and surf and safari yeah that's

[01:49:23] right it was worth it the unsung heroes plus they could have had zelda you know what i mean like

[01:49:28] that was a yeah i actually didn't know that that was a major mistake because zelda that would have

[01:49:32] been a good license that would have sold that would have sold more a lot that that could have

[01:49:37] that could have got mario numbers and sales i think yeah i would i would agree with that now when

[01:49:41] we come sort of to the end of godly there's there's some pretty interesting bits in here now john

[01:49:47] norris he had a home without a basement and and as a person like you that has a basement filled with

[01:49:52] pinball machines you realize that if you're a collector like somebody like a john norris was not

[01:49:56] having a basement is a big deal uh yeah my previous place i lived in did not have a basement so i

[01:50:01] am well aware yeah so it was time for him to buy a new home and he wanted one with a big basement

[01:50:05] and uh john norris is not a risk taker he uh was taking a risk with building a new home one with a

[01:50:10] nice big basement for his pinball collection so we asked management about the current layoffs

[01:50:15] that were happening at uh got leave it around this time and they said they weren't having any issues

[01:50:20] they were actually in secret talks with sega to buy them out and they figured that that would save

[01:50:26] got leave but that deal would fall through so john moves into his house and 10 days later his

[01:50:31] company announces they're in financial difficulty and then six weeks after that they would go and

[01:50:36] close the doors so they basically bring everybody into the lunch room at godlyb and they hand everyone

[01:50:42] pink slips out and they let everyone know that the business was closing and they had to go and there

[01:50:47] was a guard to lead them back to their office take their personal things put it in a box and it

[01:50:52] go home so john at the time was actually working on like league software so things like handy caps

[01:50:58] tracking of leagues to be able to help out uh operators with tournaments and things like that

[01:51:04] and all of this research and all of his information was all left on his company computer so we

[01:51:08] couldn't even take that with him at first everybody sort of assumed that they would get some

[01:51:12] financial backing somebody would swoop in and buy godlyb but those discussions uh certainly didn't

[01:51:18] go anywhere they didn't bear any fruit then everything went to auction and that's when they knew

[01:51:22] that it was over that it was truly over was when everything with godlyb went to auction can you

[01:51:27] believe that in their peak years in the 1990s that premier actually had sales of 30 million dollars

[01:51:33] and now five years later they're they're done yep that's the way it goes where did the where

[01:51:39] did the bleeding start what happened it was the industry itself was bleeding by the mid 90s going

[01:51:45] to the late 90s everybody was focused on these like gambling machines so it was the it was really

[01:51:49] the issues with SMS the decline in pinball and arcades you you compound that with this SMS video

[01:51:56] llama lottery terminals stuff so premier technology when they bought SMS they wanted to get into

[01:52:02] this sort of hot alternate market and video and gaming lottery terminals were really the way to do

[01:52:08] it so in 1996 they only had one or two jurisdictions in which they could sell these gaming machines

[01:52:15] but they took out all these loans to buy this company so they're servicing the debt they're paying

[01:52:20] off the loans so they're trying to make money from the pinball side to pay the loans and everything

[01:52:25] else on the video lottery terminals side which is still losing money and then you compound the decline

[01:52:31] in arcades and sales in general in the late 90s you know the the the debt service payments are

[01:52:37] what really killed the cash low and really killed got leaps so you can see Williams basically gives

[01:52:43] up on pinball which is still more or less making money for them and they just a screw it or we're

[01:52:48] not going to make pinball or just going to go into gambling and then you have got leave on the other

[01:52:52] side that's basically it's the gambling that kills the only part of the company that makes money

[01:52:58] so what is premier do with what do they do do they do they just go bust it's interesting that

[01:53:03] premier actually didn't file for bankruptcy so they just didn't they didn't just get out no they

[01:53:07] sold off all their assets for the benefit of the creditors so they did the smart business move

[01:53:12] even in death they live on actually there's a piece of got leave that lives on and is in every

[01:53:19] new stern game that you play oh what's that actually every stern game that you play the the

[01:53:24] got leave had um and it might have been older got me but they had a pin press it's the thing that

[01:53:29] presses in the play field where all the screws are supposed to go little pile holes okay and

[01:53:33] stern bought that like an auction it was oh very cool and it sits in their factory and every single

[01:53:39] play field of every game they have ever made it's gone through that press is that the thing to call

[01:53:43] the pants press that's the pants press yes yep that's the way pants press many times but

[01:53:50] the cool thing is like every play field they've done yeah so next time that you're in Chicago you

[01:53:54] go through the stern factory you can be like oh my god that's the press that press the play field

[01:54:00] for barbed wire I think they might have it that might have been even older maybe if somebody knows

[01:54:05] they can email us at silverball chronicles at gmail.com yeah we'd love to know so have you heard

[01:54:10] of got leave development LLC no well they're the owner of the trademarks got leave D got leave

[01:54:16] in company and premier see all their associated property including but not limited to I feel like

[01:54:21] I'm reading a legal document artwork trade dress and designs all per chain to got leave pinball

[01:54:26] products collectively the got lead marks yeah so if you if you google got lead development it comes

[01:54:33] up to this website so it's like a company that owns all of the rights all of the intellectual

[01:54:38] property and all that stuff and then what they do is they just license it out to people so you

[01:54:43] can see now you can you can go into pinball arcade for example uses a lot of these intellectual

[01:54:50] property things so so since acquiring premier technology in 1996 this this got leave development has

[01:54:56] continued the got leave tradition as it says on the website which goes through mostly of the licensing

[01:55:01] of what they call the got leave marks which is really weird I guess that's some sort of legal thing

[01:55:05] I'm not a I'm not licensing guru what do you do with all these old parts like they literally have

[01:55:10] a factory of parts right or head they entered into a licensing agreement with Steve Young

[01:55:15] of the pinball resource and the kipsy new or only like an hour and a half for me so I hear if you

[01:55:20] call Steve Young at pinball resource for anything got leave related he will know exactly what you

[01:55:25] need and what you need but but my god you better have that part number you better have a part number

[01:55:29] if you don't have that part number Steve Young will find you murder you in the middle of the

[01:55:34] nice maybe not well maybe but he will have the part or know that it's not made anymore or tell you

[01:55:39] what you can use in its place yeah like he has everything that you would ever need is all these

[01:55:44] so you know we'll talk about this maybe when it comes to capcom and a few other things is when

[01:55:48] these companies go under like there were you know massive collectors or operators or these

[01:55:52] folk that had money on side were like oh I'll just buy all of it in bulk right godly biz unique

[01:55:58] in that if you go to say ipdb like we mentioned all the time the internet pinball database and you

[01:56:04] want to say download a manual for your atoms family it's right on there it's pdf download it

[01:56:10] but say I want a manual for my teed off it's not on there it's not gonna happen it's not gonna

[01:56:16] happen and I don't know if they still have this but they used to actually have a link and if you

[01:56:20] clicked on it you got the um the legal notice that they received from got leave development

[01:56:26] to them telling them they had to pull all the manuals off because they used to have them on there

[01:56:30] so if you want to download one of those roms you know that they never updated they're not on ipdb either

[01:56:38] you have to get those from steve young it's right so it's very tight-fisted as compared to

[01:56:46] pretty much anyone else like you want to stern an old stern manual a daddy east manual say you

[01:56:51] can get all those well they're they are enforcing their rights as they should and exactly and one

[01:56:57] thing that that does do in all honesty is make sure that the quality is up to their standard right

[01:57:02] it's not all everything is an all scanned I originally on my raven that I had was my first pinball

[01:57:11] machine I I actually got a repro manual directly from pinball resource and it came like perfect it

[01:57:19] was amazing right it wasn't like half photocopied things were blurring missing like it was like an

[01:57:25] actual proper thing and and those standards are pretty important not to advertise people but when it

[01:57:29] comes to manuals his his manuals especially for like the the Williams games near 90s Williams games

[01:57:34] I like them better than the original manuals because his are spiral bound yeah perfect the originals

[01:57:39] were not so they're actually easier to turn and go through tell me what happened to ray tanser and

[01:57:44] john norris because man they pretty much designed everything that we just went through ray tanser this

[01:57:49] guy is a bit of an anomaly it's really hard to find information on him he hasn't done a whole lot

[01:57:56] interviews like a lot of other folks he hasn't really been you know on various platforms or if he

[01:58:02] has it's it's fairly difficult to actually find so ray joined Sega pinball in 1996 to head up their

[01:58:10] mechanical engineering division because he was really the mechanics guy he he really enjoyed that

[01:58:15] I would say and and did an amazing job in a lot of his games now he stayed with uh Sega until it

[01:58:21] became stern in 1999 all the way up until 2008 that's when he joined namco I'm wonder if that's when

[01:58:28] stern had their only fired everybody the calling of the herd yeah so ray returned to stern actually not

[01:58:36] too long ago with helping them move from their old operations facility their own old manufacturing

[01:58:43] his facility to their new larger premises where he's also managed the expansion of that facility so

[01:58:49] he's at stern as far as I know a lot of the people who left stern when they did their right sizing

[01:58:56] I'm doing air quotes end of coming back yeah and at that time it's not any hard feelings it's the

[01:59:01] necessity of a manufacturer you know the largest financial crisis of all time right like it worked out

[01:59:08] yeah it certainly did now now John Norris he also went to Sega he was hired as a quality control

[01:59:14] person and he really worked a lot in the engineering department now it's Sega he worked on a unique

[01:59:21] concept it's sort of like the pinball version of golden tea the online leaderboards and things like

[01:59:27] that that was kind of what he was working on now uh stern canceled that project because they were

[01:59:33] worried about people cheating online and winning prizes instead of winning cash prizes maybe you

[01:59:39] would invite people to a regional tournament things like that he really he really kind of had these

[01:59:43] really cool and unique ideas that just sort of didn't come out and it's funny that we've become

[01:59:47] full circle now it's some years later and you know there's there's talk on the horizon of the

[01:59:55] online connectivity of pinball which is pretty cool so he was at stern and he actually left in a

[02:00:02] bit of a row he would be working in the factory and a lot of the workers would smoke Gary stern

[02:00:09] didn't want people to take smoke breaks because then they weren't working or on the line so he left

[02:00:14] them smoke at their desks and in the factory John Norris has asthma and quite a few breathing issues

[02:00:19] and uh due to some health problems he decided to leave or as he put it I thought I left on good terms

[02:00:27] but I've tried to make a game for them in recent years to no avail maybe he didn't leave

[02:00:32] on such good terms but uh he's actually at deep root pinball now out of Texas John Norris he's

[02:00:39] amazing the guy is just a brainiac he thinks of the most intricate ways for the ball to interact

[02:00:44] with play field and still be a fun shooter that could be played by someone who has never played pinball

[02:00:49] before or for the advanced players what do you think John Norris has been working on down in deep

[02:00:53] root well according to Robert we had hot wheels and John came up with an amazing design I wish

[02:00:58] American pinball the best for stealing that away oh my the silver lining of it is I know a license

[02:01:03] that is harder to get than Harry Potter that we're going after now that would be perfect for this

[02:01:07] layout intended for hot wheels yeah so that came from from the recent episode of Canadian pinball

[02:01:12] podcast and it's just sort of by fate that they sort of brought up John Norris and uh what he's

[02:01:18] been working on uh right before we recorded so I wanted to toss that in so there's something you

[02:01:23] know John Norris is still out there and now it seems like uh you know it's been four years since

[02:01:28] deep root has done anything so he's certainly had more than eight months to build a game this time

[02:01:33] yeah I believe he loves Chicago he lives in Vegas now I believe oh so if he's doing designs he's

[02:01:40] doing it remotely so Ron that brings us to the end of the pod and uh you know it finally looks

[02:01:46] like somebody took old got leap out back and put it down like old Yeller but uh what do you what do

[02:01:51] what are your final thoughts on on the death of godlyb zombie pinball and the system three era

[02:01:58] they're not dead they'll live on forever yeah just literally like a zombie they just will not go away

[02:02:04] they were if you wanted different play fields you want something it was different you had got

[02:02:09] to lead yeah it was very very brain off pinball if you just wanted to step up and shoot and flip the

[02:02:14] ball and see it do a couple of cool things well if you if you wanted to play fields that were different

[02:02:19] yeah if you everyone complains about cookie cutter play fields they're all the same all the games

[02:02:23] are the same god lives were not the same now you may not have liked their software but they gave you

[02:02:29] some interesting shooting games and I advise no matter what I say about uh shack attack or

[02:02:37] Frank Thomas or some of these games you should play them and make your own opinions yeah I mean I

[02:02:42] would I I flip them all the time like I said my you know my first game was a Raven like come on

[02:02:48] that is not a great game but I had a lot of fun right I every then yeah it's all right like you know

[02:02:53] what I mean like you know I had a lot of fun I shot the thing now I mean come on it's not whirlwind

[02:02:58] right it's it's it's not you know black night certainly not Batman 66 but it's you know for what it is

[02:03:06] it is a lot of fun I had a lot of enjoyment I learned to tinker you know they they fit within the
