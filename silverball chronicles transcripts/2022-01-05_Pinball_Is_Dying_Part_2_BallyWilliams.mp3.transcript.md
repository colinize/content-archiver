[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:12] The next two games here in a second I'm just gonna fill this one out. And fill it out.

[00:19] And silver. And fill it, yes, fill it out. Out. Out. Out. Out.

[00:25] Like ETL Americans.

[00:55] Hello everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me this month

[01:13] like every month is my co-host Ron. Secret Santa Hallet. What's up, fella?

[01:18] Not much. How you doing? Very good. Very good. You're in on the

[01:22] pinside secret Santa at this holiday Christmas season. Oh, what's that again? That's where you give away presents.

[01:28] You're a secret Santa. You give presents. They send them in the mail. You get presents back. I'd say this podcast is our present.

[01:35] Oh, that's right. We have decided to release another episode here in the last part of 2021 or is it 2020? I don't know. They all blend together.

[01:45] And we have decided so if you wanted to hide from your family, you have something to do for a couple hours.

[01:51] So it's award season. Award season is upon us, Ron. This week in pinball awards, the yearly awards, the twippies are out for voting very shortly.

[02:01] So please remember us if we make it on the short list. Please, please remember us. So you're begging for twit-by-votes.

[02:08] That's right. I will give up if I don't hear back from people for voting for us.

[02:14] So we're our podcast is ending if we don't get voted for. So what you're saying? That's exact. Yep. We should start a Patreon and ask for money or something.

[02:22] Yeah. Well, that's we could do that. But Ron, I like to be a starving artist instead. We also have the pinball industry awards. That's coming up as well.

[02:32] Sponsored, of course, by Flippin'O pinball and the pinball network. I've been working with our committee on that and I have been very, very busy.

[02:42] So that's why we're a little bit late this month. And this episode might not be to the same exact masterful high standards as usual because I have been very, very busy in the month of December.

[02:54] And David does all the work just to let you guys know.

[02:58] But you add all the charm. I add all the charm, but I don't I don't do any of these show notes here with all the misspellings.

[03:05] That's right. That's right. So remember, of course, our Facebook page, facebook.com slash silverball chronicles. If you want to check out all of my other correct spellings and musings.

[03:16] You can swing on over. We always like to put up a couple of really neat little things to chat about. And last month, Ron, we actually went a little bit further and posted a question as a follow-up to our last podcast, which was your favorite system 80B game.

[03:35] And of course, Ron, your favorite system 80B game was, of course.

[03:40] I believe I said Genesis, but you told me I couldn't vote. Yeah. Yeah. So that's okay. I guess. But it would be Genesis. If you were allowed to vote, which you're not allowed. Yeah. Of course, mine was bad girls. I thought bad girls was really great.

[03:55] And of course, a huge shout out to my first game tag team. Super, super awesome. We had a lot of really awesome responses. We had a lot of great responses.

[04:06] Eric Wurtenberger Chuck Wurt would crack out the Genesis. He would say Genesis as well. Albert Agar formerly of the pinball nerds podcast tag team big fan there.

[04:17] Joe Churavino, of course, from from the greater Toronto area. He would say, of course, TX sector, Robo War arena Genesis victory.

[04:27] I'll have some of the best music and to the best of his ability, he doesn't know who is responsible for those sick jams. Well, I'll tell you what through some of my research, Ron.

[04:37] I wasn't able to 100% confirm who actually did those bang and hits. I think it was rush. But it was not it was not rush. I don't know why I don't know why that's topical at the moment.

[04:50] See as a Canadian, right? Like rush is played all the time. So I'm kind of over it. I think the music was done on those system 80b games by Craig Bierwaltz. Although I can't 100% confirm that.

[05:06] So if anybody bumps into him or hears from him, give him an ask. Of course, another one we've got Clark saying Genesis Scott saying victory Mike Castleman Genesis for me by a long shot.

[05:18] Joe Fox Genesis Tom graph Robo War, of course, you pick Robo War. It was Tom graph. That's Neil graph's dad. Right. Yeah, that's right. So yeah, thanks for engaging with us over on the Facebook.

[05:31] If you want to support the show, you can swing on over to silverballswag.com. We have our silver ball chronicles shop over there.

[05:39] You can grab yourself a t-shirt of mugs and stickers. We sold a couple stickers and a couple shirts I think last month. So I'll tell you what they like us. They really like us.

[05:50] I have a little extra tidbit here. I think it was our pinball 2000 episode where I could not remember the name of the main German distributor.

[06:00] The one that actually was interested in possibly buying the Williams pinball division when they shut down. Yes. And this was the distributor who's always sort of on the periphery kind of poke in making things they want to do certain things.

[06:14] They were the huge German distributor that bought like 70 80% of Williams games. Kudos to 10 Peters for this. They said that their name was Nova. And I believe that's correct when I saw that. Yeah, that sounds familiar. I believe that was their name Nova.

[06:28] And they've got that name of course from the famous German car, the Chevrolet Nova. Okay. What's another show Nova. Like some sci-fi thing. I don't know. I'm not a nerd, Ron.

[06:40] I think Leonard Neemoy might have hosted that ultimate nerdness. He was the guy that did that part of the Simpsons at one time. Very good. Yeah, he did in search of two.

[06:51] Well, Ron the 90s saw the biggest leap in pinball mechanics and technology the hobby has ever seen. The dot matrix display and how Valley Williams leveraged it made the pins from the previous 10 years look like a horse and buggy.

[07:06] The purchase of Valley by Williams in the late 80s created a competitive shark tank which forced designers and engineers to continuously one up each other.

[07:18] But as the 90s marched on in the industry contracted designers left Valley Williams or they removed on to other areas.

[07:27] Junior designers, programmers and dot artists took their place and built some of the best machines Valley Williams had ever produced. But sadly, the sales numbers didn't show that this month is part two of our pinball is dying series.

[07:45] Williams in the late 90s.

[07:49] Ron, what do you remember about the late 90s arcade or pinball scene?

[07:54] I was kind of out of it by that point to be honest. So you were in and then you were.

[07:59] Well, I didn't really start playing pinball till I was in my 30s and the 2000s. So all this kind of happened. Yeah, I really wasn't around.

[08:08] Yeah, all I remember in the late 90s was the one arcade that sort of survived across the street from the high school in my town.

[08:18] It was it was slowly going down. But the biggest thing that I remember at that time was seeing of course Star Trek, the next generation, the machine there.

[08:29] But I spent most of my time on some of the arcade games because I could make my coin last long. And the next jam probably didn't work.

[08:39] You're probably right.

[08:41] Well, Williams of course was looking for other areas to continue to turn a profit by 1994.

[08:49] They were spending a lot of time looking around and quite frankly, they were unhappy with the way that their pinball division was performing.

[08:57] So they entered into the real spinning slot machine market. So what's a what's a spinning real slot machine?

[09:05] It's like the one arm band. That's right. I think of yeah, you pull the arm down in the three things spin.

[09:10] And if you get a line across, you went something. Yeah. So of course it would say that the Williams slot division

[09:18] actually brought some healthier cash flow into the company. Pat Lawler would say that it saved gaming, but it certainly killed pinball.

[09:28] So what was WMS gaming? Well, it was the manufacturer of slot machines and video lottery terminals or VLTs they call them I guess.

[09:37] And of course the software to help casinos manage their gaming operations in 1991 WMS created a new division called Williams Gaming.

[09:46] And they entered the gaming and state video lottery markets and they developed and released their first video lottery terminals in the Oregon market in 1992.

[09:58] Williams brought in a gentleman named Earl Thomas who worked in Las Vegas as a graphic designer to help them with their gaming art.

[10:07] And of course he was in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator genius back when those technologies were just emerging.

[10:14] So he was huge when he helped out a lot of the dot guys when they made their DMD display.

[10:21] So of course we're getting some cross pollination because WMS gaming is in fact helping a little bit on the other side, which is pinball Adam Ryan, the aforementioned one of the aforementioned dot guys says just by sitting next to the guy by House Moses.

[10:37] I learned pretty much the fundamentals and how to think and create using those programs. I'm still using those same skills today.

[10:43] So Williams Gaming then entered the spinning real slot machine or real spinning slot machine market in 1994.

[10:51] But this was the company's video game routes that ultimately would prove to be their strength.

[10:56] However, the gambling slot machine leader, a company called IGT they were based in Las Vegas filed a series of lawsuits against WMS for violating what they called the

[11:08] Tellens patent for virtual spinning real technology.

[11:13] These lawsuits were settled out of court in 1999. So you can see that it took many years to solve this.

[11:19] And WMS agreed to pay IGT approximately 28.67 million dollars.

[11:25] So you can see that there are some issues here. We're racking up legal fees. We're, you know, we're going to have to pay you in a bunch of money.

[11:32] So we're drawing a deeper picture here. So from our pinball 2000 episode, kind of the really the absolute end of Williams to today.

[11:41] You can see there's a lot of turmoil that's creating issues within Williams. And ultimately would probably lead to the death of pinball.

[11:50] The thing about IGT is they're pretty much, they were pretty much about Opli. I mean, if you went to Vegas every single machine you saw there was going to be IGT.

[11:57] So they didn't want anyone else coming in on their market. I'm sure.

[12:00] Yeah. So when the lawsuit started to happen about a year or about a year and a half or so, the layoffs at Williams started to appear.

[12:08] But of course, WMS gaming also gave us a couple of new names in the industry. Some names which are legends today.

[12:16] That would be Keith Johnson. Who's Keith Johnson? He's a programmer. He's done a lot of really good games.

[12:22] He's kind of a big deal. So he was a top five player in the world. His first pop it was Papa three in 1993 in New York City. And he was the top qualifier for B division.

[12:34] He qualified in a division every pop a year until 2017.

[12:38] Oh my goodness. He is so much better at pinball than me.

[12:42] No wonder he can keep a ball alive forever on his games because I can't.

[12:47] So that he's of course a programmer for software. He did a lot of software education systems for financial people, colleges, that kind of stuff.

[12:57] So back in the 1990s, a lot of these sort of nerdy computer folk hung out on a program called IRC.

[13:04] Do you remember IRC?

[13:07] I don't. It's something something chat, right?

[13:10] I thought you were a super nerd. I'm sorry. So IRC was basically a massive chat room to really to really just bring it down level is a huge chat room.

[13:21] It was literally the dark web. Okay. So back in the mid early 90s, this was the dark web. This is where everybody who generally knew how to do computer stuff would go and hang out.

[13:34] This is where you would pirate software. This is where you would chat with other computer programmers and oddly enough, this is where Keith Johnson bumped into one Larry D'Amarr.

[13:45] Now in 1997, Larry D'Amarr said he was looking for programmers for the slot machine division because that's where he was hanging out now.

[13:53] He was no longer in pinball.

[13:55] And it expo that your Keith chatted with Larry D'Amarr and Dwight Sullivan when they went to lunch.

[14:01] Keith then would leave his old job and he would start working in slots at Williams Gaming.

[14:07] And then eventually he would move into the pinball division where he worked on pinball 2000.

[14:12] Of course, Keith loves pinball and you can tell that because he's ended up being very, very important to both Stern and Jersey Jack pinball. Isn't that right?

[14:23] That is right. I mean, the most important thing is he designed as far as I know, he designed because he did everything from scratch.

[14:30] They didn't use any existing board sets or anything. So Jersey Jack. So he was from the main architects of their current system that they use, which had to be a ridiculous amount of work.

[14:42] Yeah, he went like right from board controllers, operating system, you know, programming language, the whole thing. He basically designed it on it.

[14:51] It's a fairly short amount of time. And it's worked out rather well, actually, for Jersey Jack.

[14:55] Yeah, except for the initial light boards they had and was their device that had issues. I think once they were replaced, it's been pretty solid.

[15:03] Keith Johnson's, I think, biggest year was the year that he released both Lord of the Rings and the Simpsons pinball party, one right after another, two of the highest heralded games of the White Star era.

[15:18] So this is when we get into 1995. Williams controller board starts to come out with a new WPC 95 version towards the end of the year.

[15:29] Cost cutting.

[15:30] What did they cost cut, Ron?

[15:32] Let's see. So they changed. There's a bunch of things they changed. The back glass, or just translate.

[15:40] Right. You'd, the old system, most systems people know you remove the thing and there's an insert panel that you can swing out. They made that all one unit, the tub.

[15:50] They call it the glass and like a plastic tub that was attached to it with all the lights attached to it and a plug.

[15:55] Right. And each, each bulb would go in and screw in a plastic clip. That again, cost savings. The speaker panel used to be wood. They made it plastic.

[16:06] And it actually you could, it didn't take it out anymore. You could just flip it down the board set. They just, they consolidated boards.

[16:14] I'm trying to remember exactly all the boards they consolidated. I think it was like, because WPC had the driver board, CPU board, sound board, flip tronics board.

[16:24] So I think they took like the, the flip tronics board and the sound board. Oh, in the, the AV board, the video board.

[16:31] They put them all into one board. And then they made updates to the driver board and the CPU board. I'm trying to remember if that pretty much stayed the same, but it was all consolidation.

[16:41] And they also lost some functionality because the old WPC system it would have, they'd have five strings of GI that they could control like dim.

[16:50] They use triax. They basically, it's like, think of a dimmer switch on a light. That's literally what it is. Instead of a relay off and on, you could actually do different light intensities.

[17:00] And if you look at any pre WPC 95 game, the back box lighting, it dims and comes on just like the, the play field does WPC 95, they eliminated two of the GI strings.

[17:11] So the head light is always on as no effects at all. It's always on, which is kind of like stern is now. I think that like the back box light is always on.

[17:20] So when we talk about sort of the WPC 95 games, though, a lot of them are games that have some pretty unique mechanical bits on them that are, are still heralded today as some of the most fun games.

[17:33] But you're saying a lot of the bits under there were actually cut out.

[17:37] Consolidation and cheapening out even even basic things like the shooter rod housing that used to be had a little Williams logo on it.

[17:48] And then they got rid of that. So it's just generic because it probably cost more might have stamp of Williams logo in there. Oh, interesting. Yeah, just look at any like WPC 95 game with a shoot.

[17:57] So they were looking, they were looking not only at dollars, but pennies. Yeah, yeah. It was a big time at this time. And in that period is when they laid off a lot of their design staff.

[18:07] Yeah, well, one thing that they didn't cut, which I think is probably one of the strengths of this era is the dot animation, the dot art of this time.

[18:16] And they would use software to make the dot art, which is actually designed by electronic arts. You've probably heard of them. It's called deluxe animation.

[18:24] And they use that software from 1990 till probably today. I have no idea. They used it at both Valley Williams pinball and WMS.

[18:33] Yes, of course, DMDs had 128 pixels wide by 30 tall. So each square is a pixel. And it had three levels of intensity or brightness. You'd have 100% 90% 75 or zero.

[18:47] And with that, you would kind of make different animations or images. And you could make them move across the screen or move or change just by changing the brightness and intensity of one of those square pixels.

[19:00] And they used it for 20 years. And you think about it close to overall between 91 or around that era when it started to when Wizard of Oz came out. That's, yeah, it's about 20 years of dot matrix. That's longer than solid state, you know, just like the digital displays.

[19:18] And home panel still using DMD. Yeah. Adam Ryan says, I definitely went through some pain and just wrapping my head around how to create the illusion of reality and motion using only three colors.

[19:29] With 32 pixels high. Of course, the artist would make all of the still images. They would sort of pass the frames over to the programmer. The programmer would take a look, give some feedback, send it back, do some more changes. And then they would sort of stick it into the system. So they still kept the DMD and they still.

[19:48] I'll tell you what during this era, the DMD colors, sorry, the DMD art at this time really became very, very cool.

[19:57] And Adam would say that I don't know what kind of magic or voodoo they did, but it appeared on the depth of screen and choreography that they all wanted and it looked great.

[20:08] So let's get into some games, Ron. People are very bored. We're, you know, 20 minutes in here and they haven't heard a single thing about a game.

[20:15] But the WPC 95, the first game was Congo is a movie licensed theme sells 2,129 units, art by Kevin O'Connor, music and sound by Vince Pantera,

[20:31] dots by Adam Ryan, software by Bill Grupp and Dean Grover. And you'll see a lot of these names are sort of new on the programming side, right?

[20:41] We don't have those, you know, Larry Dimars that we once had just banging out amazing code.

[20:46] Yeah, and Dean Grover works for Stern. He does, he did Beatles and I think all of their whole model pins.

[20:53] He is definitely the elder statesman now, but at this time he was new.

[20:58] Of course, this is the horrible movie Congo. You've seen Congo. I've never seen Congo.

[21:03] I saw Congo in the theater when I was like, I'll tell you, listening to the Tim Curry callouts in the game, I want to see Congo.

[21:11] I mean, I don't know. I guess if you kind of go in expecting it not to be really great and just kind of have fun, it's pretty good.

[21:19] Of course, this is the 1995 science fiction action adventure movie based on the Michael Crite novel from 1980.

[21:28] Michael Crite, of course, from Jurassic Park fame. So why wouldn't you go with another proven book to create an awesome smash hit?

[21:39] Of course, you would, you'd bring in Steven Spielberg for this, wouldn't you?

[21:42] Sure. No, no, Steven Spielberg to do this.

[21:45] Of course, you'd bring in the John Williams guy to have the master piece score that he provided for George.

[21:50] The John Williams guy.

[21:52] Well, no, of course not. But I do remember this movie because it had Ernie Hudson in it.

[21:59] Ghostbusters. Of course. And the only reason I remembered that Ernie Hudson was in this movie is because when I remember seeing this movie, I remember going,

[22:08] that's the guy from Ghostbusters. And I don't think I've ever seen him in anything before or anything after.

[22:15] Like I don't know what Ernie Hudson has ever done, but I remember him in Ghostbusters.

[22:19] Well, he's in the new Ghostbusters to Oh, spoiler. Sorry. Sorry.

[22:23] So it's a of course, it had a $50 million budget back in 1995, which is a big deal.

[22:31] And it did $152 million in the box office. That's pretty good.

[22:36] It made money. Did its job. And it is a kind of a fun movie. It is kind of fun.

[22:41] It had a 22% rotten tomato, so not very good.

[22:45] Generally, I try to avoid anything under 62.

[22:50] I only have so many hours of life left.

[22:53] The play field on Congo, this is probably one of the best parts of the game, isn't it, Ron?

[22:59] It's a great game. Probably one of the best shooting games that's ever been made, my opinion.

[23:04] I have played Congo. I played this at Cabin Fever in Toronto.

[23:09] And I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome this game is.

[23:13] And it wasn't even the first play field. They rejected the original one.

[23:16] Yes. There was a bit of a scramble.

[23:18] That the whole story behind that, which you can also hear on my podcast, the Slam-Till podcast.

[23:23] Just thought I throw that shout out there. The Slam-Till podcast.

[23:26] Episode 100, Lyman Sheets, where he stated, which I didn't even know, that he was on Congo originally.

[23:33] Lyman Sheets. He was on the team.

[23:36] And the original play field was going to be by level.

[23:39] It's going to have two play fields.

[23:41] Interesting.

[23:42] And they just, for whatever reason, cost wasn't working. I don't know.

[23:46] They scrapped it. So he got reassigned to a game you may have heard of, Call of Attack from Mars.

[23:51] And there you go.

[23:53] Of course, I had mentioned dots. Well, the art team were provided a lot of references material, reference material.

[24:00] And of course, Adam Ryan had to jump into the project and smash out those dots in record time.

[24:06] Adam says, there were a couple of games which I was very frustrated with.

[24:10] They were a little more difficult. They had fallen way behind on their development cycle.

[24:14] They were forced upon us late. We were told to do it as fast as we could.

[24:18] I don't think I did a good job as I could have.

[24:21] Of course, this is where the cuts are beginning. Right? So the cuts are getting, in fact, deeper at Valley Williams.

[24:29] And everybody, including all these guys, see the target.

[24:33] If somebody says, get this done in a couple of months, you get it done in a couple of months because the axe has fallen all around you.

[24:40] And I just want to say, I love Congo. And to think Congo is pretty amazing.

[24:45] The thing is, I never got to hear Congo until I actually played it at someone's house and didn't realize the absolutely incredible Tim Curry callouts.

[24:54] Kudos to you, Tim Curry.

[24:56] With, I think you're supposed to be from Romania in the movie. So he's got all these like this accent.

[25:02] You know, the hero glyphics. What do they mean? It's just hilarious. I love it.

[25:08] Multi-ball callouts are awesome. Multi-ball.

[25:13] I love the, the, the flowy shots. It's a really great shooter. But I'll tell you what, it's got hippos, snakes, and killer apes.

[25:23] And that's just on the first ball.

[25:26] Yeah, we got to read from the, the flyer. It also has Stan Winston in it.

[25:33] Yeah, because the story goes that has a gorilla underneath the play field.

[25:38] Originally, the gorilla was supposed to, the original idea was he would actually come up onto the play field and you would battle him like he, like, hit the ball back guy.

[25:47] That would have been cool. But he ended up underneath the play field.

[25:50] John Ferdot in the desire. He just took his creature from the black lagoon like the window and turned it around the other way.

[25:57] But I guess Stan Winston must have some kind of approval for the game. He didn't like the gorilla.

[26:03] It's like you're not doing it right. So he did the gorilla himself.

[26:07] So that's Stan Winston's gorilla. You see on the lower play, or the underneath the play field.

[26:12] It does look very, very cool. Uncover valuable collections.

[26:16] Deep within Congo trademark.

[26:19] It's time to journey into Congo, an adrenaline pumping action-packed pinball adventure based on the hit, movie, and best-selling novel by the author of Jurassic Park.

[26:30] Yeah, they're really playing up that Jurassic Park bar. Explores of all levels can navigate through Congo with its accessible shots.

[26:37] Obtainable awards. It would suck to have unobtainable awards in the game and easily understood rules.

[26:44] Only the brave has survived the quest to collect the coveted diamonds by looting poisonous snakes escaping threatening volcano.

[26:52] Oh, escaping a threatening volcano, which is cool. And defeating a rare species of killer gorillas who guard the law city of Zing Zing.

[27:02] Congo is a non-sequential safari. Players can follow the map weaving through Congo or handpicked their favorite adventures.

[27:12] Yeah, very cool. So there's a couple of things in here that it talks about. One of them is diamonds. What's the big deal about the diamond?

[27:17] Well, I mean, in the movie, they're searching for diamonds in the Congo. But when it comes to the game, what is that? What is that?

[27:23] Collecting diamonds. It lights locks. I'll see if you close it or diamond, multi-ball. There's also a diamond hunt, multi-ball.

[27:30] So like each shot has a diamond in front of it, and then you just sort of shoot the blinking shot. It's not always lit. You got to rely them as you go through.

[27:37] One of the cooler features in this, it has a... And it's actually on the flyer. As far as I know, it's the only game that ever used it. By directional ball-popper, it's a vuck that basically can fire ball two different directions.

[27:48] Ooh. And as soon as you see underneath the playfields, like, whoa, what's this thing? And I don't believe it was ever used anywhere else. Someone can correct me on that, but I don't think so.

[27:56] It's kind of in the center rear between the volcano and the odd sort of ape-looking thing on the left side, right?

[28:03] I think so. Yeah.

[28:05] Let's talk about this volcano shot here. So it has an epic shot that goes through three pop bumpers up a fairly steep ramp.

[28:12] Does a U-turn and comes right back to the flip?

[28:15] As Keith L. said, that was his inspiration for the left ramp on Iron Maiden.

[28:19] Yeah, that is basically the other side of the Iron Maiden shot.

[28:23] And I'll tell you, for a player who's not particularly good, I love shooting between pop bumpers to ramps and stuff, because the satisfaction that I get from that,

[28:36] the feeling of, I made that really difficult shot is pretty great.

[28:41] But when it goes up this ramp and around this volcano, this sort of molded toy, it's even better. It's awesome.

[28:49] It's very, very, very cool. It's got the third flipper shoots into the target on the side, and it's also got that repeatable loop.

[28:58] Kind of orby shot. It's a great game. I mean, the problem with this game is that it is after a very bad movie.

[29:05] And it was one of those games that was stripped for parts to help other games, like our next game we're going to talk about.

[29:12] It didn't become a darling till later. So we just put it that way.

[29:16] Yeah, it became a tournament darling, which then sort of pumped up its value. And now you can't find one for less than your firstborn child.

[29:24] But we've got attack from Mars, which David didn't hear my story because he walked away, but Lyman ended up working on that because he got taken off of Congo.

[29:33] So of course, attack from Mars, the sci-fi theme from December of 95 sells 3,450 units.

[29:43] We're talking aliens, Martians, fantasy. It is awesome all around Doug Watson on art, music and sound by Dan Forden, dots Adam Ryan, Brian Morris, and software by the one Lyman sheets junior criminally low production number brutal.

[30:02] Somebody should remake this.

[30:04] Yeah, very funny. Doug Watson of course was the artist. He did the voice of the Martians. And he wrote a lot of the lines of the script.

[30:14] I just like lines like if you have Martian attack late in the Martians, they're vibrating in you. You miss one of certain ways like, oh, miss me, miss me.

[30:24] I love that.

[30:25] What are the ones that the general says when you shoot shoot the orbit?

[30:29] There's also he says like, damn shoot those things or whatever. I wonder what he says. You some ugly Martians.

[30:35] It's got some great callouts. It's very tongue in cheek. It's very fun. It's funny. For some reason, kind of fun, funny and camp works really well in pinball.

[30:47] And we see enough of it, but we don't see enough of it, I think. When you look at like Deadpool, I think is the last real quality game that had some really fun, fun-iness.

[31:00] Yeah, it's amazing. I have a Deadpool and an AFM and they're right next to each other.

[31:04] Now, let's tie that in. According to George Gomez, attack from Mars was not originally inspired by the movie Mars Attacks.

[31:13] Did I do that? That's right. Because if you ever see Mars Attacks and then you see attack from Mars, it's like, oh, they just didn't want to pay for the theme, obviously.

[31:21] Yeah, well, apparently this is just happenstance. And according to Gomez, Brian Eddie had the concept long before the movie. And it is a mere coincidence that they emerged on the market within a year of each other.

[31:33] I would certainly buy that as well. Now, this was designed, of course, by Brian Eddie. And why is Brian Eddie a big deal?

[31:43] Because he designed attack from Mars and Shadow and medieval menace.

[31:47] Yeah, so I've recently had somebody who listened to our latest podcast, who was also at Pintastic. And they played some of the Shadow and they were unimpressed.

[31:59] Oh, my. Shadow to Tom. Pintastic, which is a show in Massachusetts. If you're wondering what that means.

[32:06] Brian Eddie, he really probably made some of the biggest hits, cult classic hits of this era. And that raised him up very, very high in a strata of top 10 designers who only really did three games.

[32:25] So what do we do? We bring him back at Stern and we give him some pretty cool licenses. He did Stranger Things, which not so great at the beginning, but has certainly panned out to be better along the code lines and Mandalorian, which is awesome.

[32:43] Stranger Things is excellent. So Stranger Things, a lot of people say that the shots are very similar to attack from Mars. Is that true, Ron?

[32:51] Yeah, they're similar, but it's different. It's different enough.

[32:57] So many shots you can have on a play field, man. And if you're going for a fan sort of layout, you're kind of stuck.

[33:04] The attack from Mars. You got Tim Kittsrow again. The NBA jam guy from downtown. Oh, God, I love him. God, he's in so many good games. He's like everything.

[33:15] Wonderful. Wonderful. He's got, he's got an announcer voice. Only, only we could dream.

[33:22] Wonderful. This has a cow video mode. Of course it does. Brian Eddie was the guy that was into cows.

[33:31] He's the one who started the whole cow thing at Williams when he was a programmer. He would stick them in all the games he worked on.

[33:38] So now that he's designing a game, now it's just like there's a cow on the ramp. There's cows everywhere.

[33:44] Yeah, there's a cow being being abducted by aliens on the ramp of the cows.

[33:48] Love the cow. So here's the thing. You know, when you go to like your crazy uncle's place and his house is like all of the kitchen is decked out in John Deere green things.

[33:59] And he's got the John Deere tractors on his bookshelf and stuff like that. Do you think if you go to Brian Eddie's place, it's all like cow themed.

[34:06] Uh, supposedly he had tons of cow stuff in his house. So I would believe it. That's, that's a thing.

[34:12] The cow video mode, if you shoot the ball out the big old beam ramp, the one on the left with the cow on it, if the cow moves, hit the launch button.

[34:20] Then when you get into the video mode, the spaceships will be replaced by cows. That's awesome.

[34:26] I don't think I've ever done that. I've seen people do that, but I've never done that myself.

[34:30] Destroy all the cows and you get to the mother cow. That's a good one.

[34:34] Yep. This is a good one. That's a good one. Brian Eddie. I'll forgive your creepy cow themed kitchen for for that. That's pretty funny.

[34:41] But attack from ours is like the ultimate fan layout game. It's the ultimate loop pass game. You could just loop pass back and forth non stop.

[34:50] Yeah. That's when you're getting into real pro stuff when you can shoot an orbit and the ball, you can just lift your flipper.

[34:57] It taps that flipper and just catches it with the second one on the other side. That is some proper, proper playing, my friend.

[35:04] Also has a lot of red and orange in the cabinet, which means insta fade insta fade any type of light. It will fade badly.

[35:13] But remember attack from ours is an unstoppable earnings invasion thrills big old beam turns animals into giants, shocks, flying saucers wreak havoc, and terrors, an army of martians.

[35:26] Attacks the earth. Oh scary. Quivering may have madness and destruction were never so much fun.

[35:33] Gotta love these flyers attack from ours is a fun and entertaining to play and it's open play field and easy to understand rules are already worth.

[35:42] I noticed whenever the games have a very open play field, they advertise how easy it is, especially operators easily cleanable.

[35:50] But if it's like really complicated play field, they just don't say anything.

[35:55] Yeah, it's like, you know, white water. They were not saying easy to clean.

[36:01] It's a straightforward game. That's fun for players of all skill levels. I completely agree. I disagree. I'm not very good at this game.

[36:09] Just hit the dish hip over and over. That's the problem. So you shoot the ship in the middle, which is a three, which is a lifting three bank and a dropping three bank in the middle of play field.

[36:18] Sort of like drawn, I guess, or black night 2000 head one. I shoot that thing and I am immediate death. It is just terrifying.

[36:28] No, it's not. It says right in the flyer. Novis players are able to reach all the exciting game features while expert players can attempt to rule the universe.

[36:36] So does that mean I'm worse than a novice player? I guess so. You can't blow up a single ship. I can blow up a single ship. That's basically it. That's all you need. It's great experience.

[36:45] I want to I want to I want to I want to T2 the ramps. Right. I want to shoot the ramp. They're pretty hard to come to that's. It's not like payback time. They're they're pretty narrow ramps.

[36:54] What you want to do is just see the little shot to the left of the ship. You want to hit that a lot. Then you just start like the block shot. Yeah. And then then you can have fun. Yeah. I guess.

[37:05] I am a big sci-fi fan. I love sci-fi. I love camp. I love cheese. But for some reason this game does not suck me in like it sucks people. And maybe I don't have enough time on it.

[37:19] But I have played quite a bit. I've played quite a bit. But it doesn't this isn't the game where I'm like I got to have one of these in my basement.

[37:25] This might be my last episode. I can't believe this. Wow. I'm serious. And I don't know what it is. Like I would much rather play medieval madness.

[37:33] No, no, no, no, no. And it has nothing to do with the castle and more to do with all of the other bits. You're more money python than you are sci-fi.

[37:42] I guess I don't know. But shooting that shooting the scoop kind of bothers me in this game. And this one's pretty interesting as well. Because the pop bumpers in the back will feed into the scoop.

[37:53] And I don't know if maybe that's one thing that I don't like because I feel like I'm in the scoop all the time because I'm missing that ramp and I'm missing the number one target ramp for for the emotions or the I ramp like number one. Good Lord.

[38:07] I feel like I'm in the scoop all the time. Well, if you ever get to America, just come visit and you can play my attack from Mars.

[38:15] Your attack from Mars? Well, it's an original, which is important. It needs to be an original or it just doesn't play right.

[38:21] Because the flippers don't feel right. They don't 100%. Look at me. I'm a top 100. No, I just played the original first. I'm sure if I played the remake first, then the original wouldn't feel right.

[38:33] To be honest, I have only played the remake. There you go. Yeah, true story.

[38:37] That takes us to tales of the Arabian Knights, totan or totan. This is the mystic fantasy theme, May of 96.

[38:49] Cells 3128 units designed by John Papaduke. It has its art by Pat McMan, music and sound Dave's brisky, dots Adam Ryan, Brian Morris, and software by Louie or Lewis.

[39:05] Couserish. Couseris. Couseris probably. Couseris. You'd think we'd get this by now. No, that's our gimmick. We can't say people's names right.

[39:15] So of course, Arabian Knights is the English name for the Arabic language collection of Middle Eastern folk tales known as 1000 and 1 Knights. I'm pretty sure that the genie and the bottle stuff comes from this.

[39:29] Yeah, if you think of like a laden, I think a laden is in there. I don't know for sure. I should have looked at it. I think I've actually seen a laden.

[39:36] Oh, a laden is great. That's all Rob Williams in it, right? Yeah. That's okay. I saw that one. Big time good. Probably why I watched it.

[39:43] But Adam Ryan says, I like that kind of theme. I like the Middle Eastern theme. Little more flair to the visuals. The music was very good in that game.

[39:51] I think it's just a pleasure. Papaduke was just a great guy to work with. And you can see that when Adam Ryan has had a longer time to work on the dots like he did in this game over Congo, there is a level of care that he had put into the dots on tales of the Arabian Knights that he didn't necessarily have on Congo.

[40:12] Tales of the Arabian Knights is some would herald John Papaduke's best or second best game. Certainly top three. And it is one that goes for a serious dollar on the secondary market before things went absolutely crazy.

[40:32] Yeah, it's best best game is this first. Yeah, World Cup soccer. It's what most people say. Most people that know how to play pinball as far as playfield goes though, this is if you want long flowing plastic ramps and magnets. This is the game for you.

[40:46] This game is awesome. I love this game. I like theater of magic more when it comes to the actual gameplay. But this game has some flair and some pizzazz that few games that are going to be a little bit more fun.

[41:01] But few games today have if any this game is all about just whimsy and magic and flow and fun and the ball ending up and doing things that you didn't expect it to do.

[41:17] It suffers though on code. Is that right? I don't I've never really played it that much. I know the tournament strategy is not that it has that bug where you can get in what the final wizard mode and just keep it going forever.

[41:30] If you do it right or something like that. Yeah, we'll see I can't even fill up all the lights on the bizarre so I'm not getting that far run. Come on. I know the lamp was overpowered.

[41:42] Like if you got into the what lightning lightning lamp, especially if you're a multi ball, you just hit the lamp over and over and over again and then you end up winning.

[41:49] Yeah, so let's let's talk a little bit about tales of the Arabian nights, but we have to of course start with your wish is granted. Let me guess that's the flyer experience the seven tales of Arabian nights battle the evil genie to rescue the princess spell G-E-N-I-E or genie to light locks and pinball wishes below the play field in the bizarre reappears to begin with three ball multi ball.

[42:18] Spin a laden's lamp spin the magic lamp and watch the bonus grow the bonus explodes in the lightning crash when the blue lights lead the lamp or lit. Wow, very good. It's exciting. It's very whimsical. It has a story to you got to rescue the princess. Yeah, so we're getting into something here that's another level and this is what John Papa Duke would do. We spoke about this little bit in our max that made us episode.

[42:47] Couple episodes back you can check that out at silverball chronicles.com you can watch. Sorry, you can listen to that there in the archives. Please go back and listen to older episodes because we fill in a lot of the gaps you may have.

[43:01] John Papa Duke would add a little level of pizzazz it would bring in more than just sort of the rocking music kind of thrill cars to stosterone person right he tried to bring a level of of of sizzle to the steak. Sometimes that sizzle was all there was in his games, but this is certainly one that I think is is a great packet. It's a world under glass a world of wonder.

[43:30] It's something else I'll tell you one of the neat bits is the plunge here right so you you've got a skill shot that rotates between sort of like three baskets and there's a stand up target in each basket and you kind of shoot the ball and it lands in that and then it hits the ramp and then it comes down to your flippers kind of neat although it's kind of anticlimactic right like it's not I don't know when you do it it's it doesn't feel that grace. It's your snake charmer you got hit the right one or you the snake bite you. Yeah, but it just I don't know it just doesn't.

[44:00] Like the kinetic satisfaction to use a cliche just doesn't it doesn't I don't know it's timing it into the bucket.

[44:06] The same thing as a world cup soccer right so he's kind of recycled it made it maybe better than world cup soccer, but at the same time it just I don't know it's just it's not particularly fun.

[44:16] He definitely made crazy or ramps and work up soccer there wasn't enough plastic I need even longer and I'm just wavier loopier ramps and I'll tell you what at least the skill shot is better than

[44:27] the ones in roses which one so you got a preference that the new one that we talked about the old no one had the same name actually you're wrong.

[44:35] The old one was called guns and roses the new ones called like guns and roses not in this lifetime I believe is the full title.

[44:42] You need to give our listeners the right information. Let's talk about the suck with the rams.

[44:47] So the ramps are pretty cool so there's a ramp on the left side just after the orbit and that ramp goes up and then kind of a round in a

[44:57] it's almost like a what I want to call that like a whirlwind or whirlwind or spiral or John pop it looks like long plastic ramps

[45:05] diverters and magnets and this has all of them I'll tell you what that's what I love a pinball I love

[45:11] Diverters there's not enough diverters in pinball nowadays. Oh no wonder you love Congo there's not enough

[45:17] I'm kind of interesting ball movement beyond you know shooting up a ramp and having a

[45:23] lot of green to you there. Come on pinball manufacturers we want our diverters bring it back the best

[45:28] diverter we've seen of course is the new Godzilla by Keith Elwin the whole building is a diverter that's

[45:34] only which is pretty high our model so but the fun thing about this this game is you'll shoot up a ramp

[45:41] and then you know you might just not make it you might not make it up the ramp but then the ball

[45:46] kind of goes back down the ramp and then into like a hole and then it'll pop out somewhere else on the

[45:51] playfield rather than back down the ramp I find I hate going up a ramp and not making it and it

[45:56] coming right back at me I understand that that's important but having it go up and fall out

[46:01] somewhere interesting is cool too it's got that cool ball saver thing the spikes that come up

[46:06] out of the playfield yeah let's talk about that the first time you see that because you can't really

[46:11] tell it's there then it comes up and saves your bots cool it's like a magnet save right so back when

[46:16] Steve Richie did it they also did it and he did it in theater of magic is that there's a magnet

[46:21] under the play field it goes the out lanes it sticks in a magnet well tails of the Arabian nights

[46:26] literally have spikes that come up from the bottom on the left and right side almost like a cage right

[46:33] that stops the ball and then the cages come down and then it goes in mostly into the in lanes

[46:39] that is something else that is crazy talk nowadays it has a really cool like genie

[46:47] bash toy in the back so it's not a genie on a piece of plastic with like targets in front of

[46:53] him that you hit it's literally a molded plastic toy that you hit and it bounces and it has a switch

[47:00] under there and you hit the genie himself super awesome but let's talk about the magnet that sits in

[47:06] front of the genie so a magnet in front of a bash toy is not something new right Ron it is not

[47:12] but what does this one do it actually grabs it and then goes underneath the playfield holy moly

[47:18] it hits the magnet the magnet holds the ball and then the magnet goes under the playfield pulling

[47:23] the ball down and then the magnet comes back up and there's no ball what what's your game uses to

[47:28] say mech whoo like Led Zeppelin no oh we're talking we're talking the premium metallic up it literally

[47:36] is the same thing it just has the hammer over it so it gives a different effect but it's literally

[47:40] the same thing yeah super super awesome the other thing is that it has this the genie is throwing

[47:48] like a fireball and the fireball itself is like a circular magnet and he would use this previously

[47:56] in theater of magic but this time it's it's vertical and when it's when the ball is going down the

[48:02] ramp on the left side the magnet will engage and suck the ball inside of it and then let the ball

[48:08] go and it goes down a wire form across the playfield to the other flipper for those at home you can

[48:14] always tell which games David really likes because they're the ones we spend more time on oh man I

[48:18] love this game I really I'm sorry for bars can we just go out to this game can we go okay I want to

[48:23] talk about tales from the rabia nights what do you think of the art package of this game uh I like

[48:28] the playfield art yeah yeah it's kind of busy is very busy like most pop a Duke games it's very busy

[48:34] but it's very purple but the very blue the playfield is also very busy sometimes the playfields busy

[48:39] to hide the factors not much on the playfield that is not the case here there is so much going on in

[48:44] this game it is it is something else now of course games at this time were designed to make money

[48:50] they were on a production timeline and they had to have above average earnings success was determined

[48:57] on that if you could get it out the door you could make money that was all that mattered well

[49:04] john pop a doaker j pop didn't really fit well into that system the system was designed to be quick

[49:10] and refined and j pop was a much more slower and calculated with his designs he said he was broken

[49:17] down by the Williams team and built back up to withstand the stress and pressure at valley Williams

[49:26] and the philosophy that came around that valley was softer when he worked there but Williams

[49:33] boy they would tell you that your project sucked and you had to try harder and it was really really

[49:39] designed to try to get the best out of people to clarify if john pop a Duke actually worked at valley

[49:44] like in the mid eighties and then when valley and will you while Williams bought valley he didn't have

[49:49] a green card so he had to leave and then he came back later so when he says valley was softer he

[49:55] means like the original valley he was the millennial of his time right he was he did not respond well

[50:02] to harassment he didn't respond well to people you know yelling at him and telling him that they're

[50:08] the boss and this is how it gets done he really struggled in that let's say shark tank and oddly though

[50:17] once he left that shark tank he couldn't get anything out the door so I guess they all sort of

[50:23] brought the best out of each other which a pop would say you take two days off and when you got

[50:27] back your manager would say he needed to talk to you what happened was while you were awake group

[50:31] of people other designers management engineers would look over your game and say we don't like this

[50:36] on your game we like to change it I was a new designer and I had to deal with that all the time he

[50:41] would leave and he'd come back and he'd have to take stuff to leave him something there you go yes so

[50:46] that is actually what he would talk about in this podcast now I started listening to a podcast

[50:51] coast to coast pinball with j-pop yes which is a very controversial episode of coast to coast

[50:58] I found it and I started listening to it and I was doing all of my notes and stuff and then I

[51:03] went back to that exact same source about a month later and the episode is now gone so when it

[51:11] comes to a j-pop episode I'm having a difficult time finding primary sources sources from individuals

[51:17] who were there speaking at the time about certain things of the time so I'm gonna have a difficult

[51:24] time making a deeper j-pop episode especially when it comes to the zitware stuff which is probably

[51:31] why that episode is not online anymore and I listened to it back in the day I there wasn't any

[51:37] earth shattering things on there that I remember yeah so if anybody happens to have that coast to

[51:43] coast episode saved somewhere I would love to hear it because I can get some cool cool stuff from

[51:49] it any who tie in this back in he really struggled and I'll tell you what one of the things that they

[51:56] had a significant issue with particularly people like Steve Richie who was always very good at giving

[52:03] his opinion was the genie lamp now of course this lamp is not something that j-pop had invented it was

[52:10] actually borrowed from an older electro mechanical game which had a similar spinning lamp actually I'm

[52:19] sure several ems have the spinning the spinning mech but they didn't do it is pretty and beautiful

[52:25] of course j-pop so the tassar act on transformers is not not the level of the lamp not unless you like

[52:33] take the Christmas ornament and put it on there and it flashes that was pretty cool plus it breaks a

[52:38] lot I don't think I've seen the lamp one break that's interesting so j-pop would also say I would get

[52:44] feedback on the game the rules are bad or this rule sucks but at the time it was the best game we could

[52:51] make from that time frame the game worked really well and it made upwards of three 50 to four hundred

[52:57] dollars a day I take that whoo that's a big deal man and that's like we're talking what 50 cent plays

[53:03] that would have been 50 cent yeah whoo that's a big deal let's get into another one here scared stiff

[53:09] this is the camp and horror theme September of 96 sells four thousand twenty eight units art by

[53:16] Greg Ferris music and sound by Dave Zabrisky dots Adam Ryan Brian Morris and software by a gentleman

[53:24] named Cameron Silver from Australia get I might let's put another shrimp on my body goodness

[53:32] my father loves this game this is of course this is the second Elvira game Elvira of course is the

[53:40] sexiest vamp this side of Transylvania she was a TV host from California where they watched a lot of

[53:50] campy and cheesy horror movies at late night she is certainly a cult character is that correct

[53:58] movie macabre something like that that the show she hosted it was sort of like a not funny mystery

[54:05] science theater three she was funny I guess he wouldn't like insult she would do and be breaks during

[54:11] the movie she would make little comments yeah it was like before the commercial or after the commercial

[54:16] right and and she has a huge huge following I don't get it but of course I didn't grow up in that

[54:22] time so you know what do you not cool we get it I understand that I fully embrace that I will never

[54:28] be as cool as somebody like Steve Richie if attacked from ours was too difficult for you then

[54:32] scared stiff is your game anyone can get to the wister mode in this game anyone this game is a

[54:39] Dennis Nordman class the Nord man it's so fun it's scary is it scared stiff ballies new license

[54:47] pinball starring Elvira the sexiest vamp to the side of Transylvania will scare the quarters out

[54:53] of players everywhere yes this is under the bali name and not the Williams it's a Williams

[55:00] game it's just it's just a name it's it's this is sort of like what like why do they just switch

[55:06] those around now I've heard other I've heard some of the designers talk about that I think we talk

[55:11] the Williams guys did not want to be anything yeah and I think we talked about this enough so we're

[55:16] like or I heard it on a podcast somewhere like if it was a sexier type title it would be a bali

[55:22] because that they were known for it's just like they have weird things like that I mean

[55:26] does Nordman was originally from old bali so a lot of his games are bali you know Elvira has the

[55:33] features that turn players on it you mean like the the cabinet in the back the box the industry first

[55:40] interactive 3d backlash it has a spider web in the backlash with a spider and he spins and you can

[55:48] control him you could stop him and it'll stop at various awards okay okay sort of like the mystery

[55:54] award but instead of it just being on the DMD it's kind of got an interactive thing if you're good

[55:59] enough you can pick exactly what you want so it's not random nope skill based very cool and the art

[56:07] on this game fairly risque with the backlash I got to say not offensive but certainly risk a

[56:17] she has a lot of control over the way her character is presented Greg Ferres did the original

[56:26] Elvira and the party monsters art so this game really ties in very well with the previous one

[56:33] and it will also tie in very well to the next Elvira game so I think this is a really really cool design

[56:41] really interesting mechs art it's it's all in it's a really really great package now of course we

[56:49] see the return of the dead heads right dead heads you got all the different heads which with

[56:55] hilarious comments yeah they were all like also I think bad head is Steve Richie good head as she

[57:03] says my favorite oh my the interesting thing about this is in the back there's like this molded

[57:09] plastic sort of stack ahead's called the dead heads in the corner originally in the original

[57:15] design there was actually an upper play field back there and that was cut out because of cost

[57:20] cutting there was other cost cutting just from this we're looking at the flyer picture there's

[57:24] cost cut I think how let me see if I remember some of them I think there was LEDs in the dead heads

[57:29] that were removed but you can put them back like the ice if you look at the flippers in the flyer

[57:34] you see the the bony fingers over the flipper vets that wasn't done in production that was

[57:39] removed this cost cutting now it's a mod and everyone has put it in their scared stiff to the

[57:44] point where you just think that's how it came but that's not how it came originally yeah there's

[57:49] also the coffin lock on the left side where players lock three balls and unleash a monster it's

[57:55] multiple in tin kit throws back again as the generic Dracula sounding guy this deep in the coffin

[58:03] oh that's me and he kills it he's in the latest Lv. game also yeah this has to be the peak of what

[58:11] he did when it comes to because it is this is right up his alley and you can tell he's having a time

[58:15] hey pinheads I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not doing this podcast and making bad

[59:13] Dennis financial ink Canadian residents only great for air says Cassandra Cassandra Peterson was an

[59:19] amazing celebrity wonderful to work with easy going and receptive to ideas Cassandra sign a white

[59:25] wood of scarce stiff somewhere there is a white wood with Cassandra signature and read on the bottom

[59:29] right who betcha that's worth a penny because my goodness even stern can sell theirs with a

[59:35] piece of her couch or a coach signed by her for twenty grand now of course there was a

[59:41] serious fall start with this project they were they were very much overwhelmed at the time ad

[59:47] bali Williams but they did eventually get started the idea was let's put something in the back

[59:53] and that certainly became a big home run and that's where the spider came from

[59:59] smarty who is Cassandra Peters husband is on the back glass as a tribute to him well

[01:00:06] husband at the time husband at the time he has passed away yes I think so they got divorced I

[01:00:12] didn't think he died oh maybe they did all right well anyway he's dead wow now there was

[01:00:18] the the the many play field I had mentioned earlier was actually in the in the shape of a spider

[01:00:22] and the spot there were a bunch of spiders that were made to stick to that but when it was cost cut

[01:00:27] they just took the spiders and stuck them around on the play field in places the dead heads were

[01:00:32] originally behind the box on the left side but when that play field was removed they needed to

[01:00:38] fill the spot and that's where they moved everything in in fact some of the spiders were actually

[01:00:44] replaced with frogs and there's a frog mode what's in the frog mode is that fun that's where you

[01:00:51] get the the splatter the flock frogs or whatever there's the frogs on the slings that go up when

[01:00:56] you hit the slings or whatever or no what would it know you hit a post in a frog comes up it's been

[01:01:00] a while since I play scared stick it's sort of like their leaper that's it leaper sleeper mania or

[01:01:05] something like that's called yeah it's a cool game I kind of like this game it's kind of fun

[01:01:09] it's not one that I can have my living room because of the sort of the risk a nature

[01:01:14] shooting the box is pretty cool you want to talk about that it's the crate yeah the crate sorry oh

[01:01:19] girl those don't mix a box and a crate I'm just that's what it's called in the game the terror in

[01:01:24] the crate terror from the crate what's the difference between a box and a crate anyway uh I think

[01:01:29] a crate is more like made out of wood and a box is a cardboard you see that's what I kind of

[01:01:34] think so the size the size has nothing I don't think so so you could have a small yes you could

[01:01:38] small crate and basically you just you pound on the crate until you you break through it yeah

[01:01:44] and then it kind of opens and then you shoot into it it doesn't open like you hit it and it's

[01:01:48] it lets the ball go into it yeah that's cool yeah it's a cool little toy and it's got these

[01:01:54] eyes on the top of the box yes right and as you shoot the box you get like it lights up a set of

[01:02:00] the two eyes and then when you light them all up then you can get your waking up the terror in the

[01:02:03] crate then he's gonna grab you now if jup if john pop it to gloves ramps I mean the king of ramps

[01:02:10] has to be the the nord man got the bony beast ramp set a double entendre I don't know

[01:02:16] well you know what is is the stifle meter with the different levels of stiffness how stiff can you get

[01:02:24] yes Dennis Nortonman would actually be canned from bali Williams during this time and he would

[01:02:31] write when it was about to go into production was out the door very very sad to see Dennis Nortonman

[01:02:37] go yeah john Frodo would say you come into the office one day and your pass wouldn't work it was

[01:02:42] that cold the past should have been green but it came up red I thought something screwed up and someone

[01:02:47] came out the door and I came in I went to my room and Larry came by and said we got to talk

[01:02:52] that was it me Barry outslur and Dennis Nortonman gone and the exact same day all of them gone three of

[01:02:59] the best sort of interesting designers out the door and Steve Richie was gone at this point also he had

[01:03:05] gone over to I think their video game division he might even went to a tary which I think William

[01:03:10] spotted at the time and we've got you know we've got George Gomez who's left who's who's a young guy

[01:03:16] in his thirties at the time well he's he's left as in he's still there that's right it's like no he

[01:03:21] didn't leave but all these all these fellas all these these top sort of designers are all out the

[01:03:29] door now and they've sort of left the youth in place you got Brian Eddie you got George Gomez

[01:03:33] who's the other guy pop a Duke Jay pop now Greg Ferrer is he would say it was a shock when Dennis

[01:03:39] was let go while working on scared stiff I lost a lot of sleep over that so you can see that losing

[01:03:46] somebody like Dennis and Dennis and Greg worked really closely together back in their valley days

[01:03:50] right they were hand in hand when it came to the art of their games and you know that's tough to

[01:03:55] see your friend go have a very also he was there since the seventies Barry Osler of course was the

[01:04:00] staple and the one who basically kept the lights on and produced pins when there was nobody else

[01:04:06] there except for the janitor Barry said I didn't see it coming I saw dozens of layoffs over my time

[01:04:12] they hit me like a brick Dwight Sullivan would finish up junkyard with the engineering team which is

[01:04:18] what Barry Osler was working with at the time now there are still pins being made though at this time

[01:04:25] and that brings us to NBA fast break which is the sports basketball theme march of 97 sells 4,414

[01:04:35] units that's actually pretty decent seller art by Kevin O'Connor mechanics by Tom Capera

[01:04:43] designed by George Gomez music by Kevin Quinn dots Adam Ryan and software by Bill Uban

[01:04:52] so this this is a game that is a little bit different than most do you know your 90s NBA trivia

[01:05:00] I don't know any of the because it will give you an advantage on this game when you play the

[01:05:05] trivia video mode there's a trivia video mode yeah do you know this is the only authentic NBA license

[01:05:11] pinball the only authentic one yep so hoops is not NBA do you know from godly nope and Jordan is

[01:05:19] not in this game he would have been a separate like he would have been a separate license of course

[01:05:23] his own thing he was the he was the shell of his day real NBA scoring well that doesn't make sense

[01:05:30] it does there's baskets and when you get a basket two points when you make a three point three

[01:05:34] pointers three points how do you get three points just like it's three pointer you make a long

[01:05:39] distance shots four three four three four three it's got a cool back box toy flipper you can make

[01:05:45] more baskets you can set it to regular scoring if basketball scoring is just too crazy for you

[01:05:52] it's too crazy for you like you can't do the math you know only balik and put the NBA spin on pin

[01:06:00] huh the NBA spin on I don't only balik and put the NBA spin on pin somebody reached out to us and

[01:06:05] said that we need to do a collective episode on our favorite and most unfavorite of our flyers

[01:06:12] yeah that one is just weird that and I mean valley Williams there's just bad the godly ones were

[01:06:19] a fun but these are bad well I think the godly ones had to make the game sound better than they might

[01:06:23] actually be yeah shot clock just like right real NBA game action it's not real NBA it's pinball

[01:06:32] now it's it's got a basket it's got defenders you pass the ball can we talk about how the basket

[01:06:37] looks like a toilet uh a Canadian toilet or something I don't know too many metal toilets like this but

[01:06:43] no but it's got the shot clock in the back and then it's got the thing on the front it just doesn't look

[01:06:47] okay toilet overhead shot yeah kind of looks like a toilet it looks toilety now this is a this is

[01:06:53] a George Gomez's follow up from Corvette no wouldn't be Corvette because he did he did Corvette he did

[01:07:00] Johnny pneumonic I mean Johnny wouldn't yeah yeah yeah so be the follow up from Johnny yeah you know he

[01:07:07] worked really well with Tom Capair of he was his main engineer guy and and and he works at stern

[01:07:13] now Tom Capair this is this this this game although odd um and different is actually quite cool so

[01:07:22] the object is basically to shoot up the middle into the basket right well it's it's discord baskets

[01:07:29] a variety of ways but it also has a fan layout and it's got three ramps it's got return ramps it's

[01:07:36] it's got an orbit shot it's it's got a bunch of vertical upkickers and it has a moving shot block

[01:07:44] guy in the middle yeah can use it it's sort of like if you've seen the Dracula toy in monster

[01:07:50] bash but this one is designed to move left to right and cover up the basket for various shots and

[01:07:56] it has an action button ooh ooh yeah basically just as I think shoot it's you head at the shoot the

[01:08:03] ball and it has a lot of vertical upkickers where you can move from one vertical upkicker to another

[01:08:09] to move like to pass your shot it's it's a very confusing game they're they're ejects a vertical

[01:08:16] upkicker I think it was is you know it goes directly up these are just like ejects this it's like the

[01:08:22] it would be like well your pop and do guy circus fall tear you know the lot of stuff on the left

[01:08:27] where it flips the ball from one saucer to another yeah the jugger it's literally the same thing

[01:08:32] now it also has a mechanical back box feature which looks to be like the trend nowadays yes

[01:08:38] that back box animation consists of a flipper in the lower right part of the back box and a basket

[01:08:45] on the far left the game controls the back box flipper sometimes when you score points so for instance

[01:08:53] after you set up an amount of pop bumper hits during multi ball and during the Egyptian soda

[01:09:01] and hot dog me love that Egyptian soda I don't even know what that means but it sounds great I

[01:09:06] want a band called Egyptian soda yeah yeah now the exception is that the exception is pizza power

[01:09:14] shot modes now in this mode the player tries to score as many points as possible in the back box basket

[01:09:24] the number of points depends on the amount shown on the screen and the the voicework 10 kits row

[01:09:30] again kills it he kills it because because he did NBA jam that's his that's his thing his he's the

[01:09:36] he's the NBA jam guy so he knows what's expected for three four three four two three four three

[01:09:43] that's when you're in the back box and you keep shooting yeah it's so cool so you forgot the coolest

[01:09:50] part what's that you can link them oh my goodness the linking the linking this is something else here

[01:09:58] you can link the machine so you can play against each other which I've done a few times I

[01:10:02] go into a couple of trails where they've actually had a blanked you you literally just play a regular

[01:10:06] game but like you pick a team and the person your link with they pick their team and then you can

[01:10:12] see how many points they've scored and they can see how many points you scored so it's not really

[01:10:18] head to head more than you're just trying to score more baskets in there George Gomez did an

[01:10:22] interview with this weekend pinball back in September of 2019 where he talked about his idea for a

[01:10:28] game called armed and dangerous armed and dangerous was an experiment which was a non pinball game

[01:10:35] which went through three or four iterations was basically a tank battlefield kind of theme where

[01:10:41] balls would continuously feed to the flippers in rapid succession and you would shoot at tanks on

[01:10:47] the play field now this is very much like rapid fire hyperball and hyperball from Williams yeah exactly

[01:10:54] so first so part of that was that he thought it would be cool to link games together to play

[01:11:02] against each other and that would eventually become the software or the idea for the software for

[01:11:09] NBA fastbreak Tom says part of what I did when I was writing that software is write some linking

[01:11:14] code that let two games link up that's the code that I use in NBA in order to do the link NBA game

[01:11:21] very very cool of course armed and dangerous would not ever come to existence but at least some of

[01:11:27] those ideas that Gomez thought up when he was either in the shower on the can would eventually make

[01:11:32] it into a pinball game the other thing that I find super cool about this game the cool 90s music

[01:11:39] it's got great is it it's so 90s so we can certainly tell the games that Ron really likes

[01:11:49] because he wants to talk all about the games that Ron likes I like it be if he doesn't want to talk

[01:11:54] about Taylor the Arabian night I talked about it over the years Adam Ryan has popped into a lot of

[01:12:02] these games here that we're talking about this guy is banging out dots left and right and over the

[01:12:07] 26 years that he worked for Valley Williams in the in the 90s and then freelance at Pat Lawler

[01:12:13] designs in the 2000s he did NBA toe 10 junkyard venture Mars Ripley's NASCAR I want to give a little

[01:12:21] bit of background on Adam he attended Northern Illinois University where he studied illustration

[01:12:27] he says that he only had one Macintosh he says there was only one Macintosh computer in the

[01:12:33] whole school and everybody had to share it and learn the professors said that they wouldn't see

[01:12:39] a computer for another four or five years once you exited university and got into the field when

[01:12:46] you were working wow was he certainly wrong Ron when you got out of university immediately the

[01:12:54] computer was super important especially in that late 80s early 90s transition now this is

[01:13:01] certainly when Photoshop burst into the commercial scene now while at Williams gaming Adam and the

[01:13:09] other co-workers would sneak over to the pinball division and they would play pinball

[01:13:15] now pinball of course was on the second floor of the California Avenue building midway was on

[01:13:20] the first floor and they would often spend some time kind of going from one building across the

[01:13:26] alley into the other this is where Adam got to work on his first game after sort of you know making

[01:13:32] some connections over on the pinball division and that was with Corvette he would of course do that

[01:13:37] with George Gomez and come on at the end of the project and do a lot of the shoot again and replay

[01:13:45] animations that's where he really learned a lot of those bits and pieces now the NBA fast break

[01:13:52] dots you know there's over 140 different portraits when you start with that as for the NBA game

[01:14:01] itself which Adam he had to move from the images to actual dots so they were given images by the

[01:14:09] NBA and he had to change those images into dots which must have been super super difficult

[01:14:18] Adam says I was not given all the reference material I had to go surf the web to find some of

[01:14:23] these rookies who became starters and there were no photos of them on the web I had to go to the

[01:14:27] research magazines or find action shots of them and try to make them look like portraits it was a

[01:14:32] complete nightmare yeah so they they told them they you have to use our specific reference materials

[01:14:36] but then the stuff in the game didn't have all of those specific reference materials that's kind

[01:14:41] of annoying it's also got a really cool top or if you're all into toppers it's kind of got like

[01:14:45] this marquee thing that kind of goes around the outside I guess it's kind of cool I don't get

[01:14:51] toppers but whatever NBA fast break baby it's got all the team names on them that's kind of fun

[01:14:58] mm-hmm it's got some Easter eggs crazy bobs is back yes crazy Bob and you'll remember crazy Bob

[01:15:05] from Johnny Newmont as well as in the future crazy Bob will be in he's another game

[01:15:12] he's a dialed in yeah crazy Bob's gets around now of course he was the hot dog vendor

[01:15:17] where else would crazy Bob me some craze I don't know what he's got chilly on there chilly dogs that's

[01:15:22] a crazy hot dog NBA fast breaks one of the games with midnight madness so what's midnight madness

[01:15:27] if you're playing the game and it hits midnight something happens would you say madness happens

[01:15:34] could be depending on the game yeah so during this round a cow actually might appear on the

[01:15:40] display in midnight madness because that's a joke that's a thing speaking of madness

[01:15:46] here we go this will be another half hour on this game many evil madness medieval madness yes

[01:15:53] the the knockoff Monty Python and many evil castle attack theme June of 97 designed by Brian

[01:16:03] it sells 4,016 units not very many so you know if somebody would remake that it would probably go well

[01:16:10] that joke is already losing its tea art by john yosey Greg frairas dots an animation by Adam

[01:16:18] Ryan and Brian Morris the mechanics was done by Robert frisell frisell and music sound Dan

[01:16:26] Fordon software by one lineman f sheets junior this was the pinside number one pin forever

[01:16:38] which is a big big feat to do to be a game so old competing with sort of those modern stirns

[01:16:47] dealing with the the the stirns that are existing nowadays at the time of this recording

[01:16:53] medieval madness is actually behind heist by multi morphing and godzilla sorry I had to put

[01:17:01] that in there because that has a lot of people pretty ruffled in the feathers hey shout out to

[01:17:06] multi morphing good for you sandbag in the top 100 now this is an amazing game I love this game

[01:17:18] I don't know what it is about this game I think it's just that it's the all in all that's good I

[01:17:23] mean it's almost as good as a tack from ours behold the renaissance of pinball

[01:17:29] medieval madness defeat the king and his men to stop the madness and restore order to this great

[01:17:38] land you got to destroy the yonder castle you got a battle to wretched trolls all the trolls

[01:17:47] love the trolls love them yeah so this this machine is best known for the huge castle in the back

[01:17:53] corner and you can you can bash it in multiple states basically the draw bridges up and you can hit it

[01:18:01] and then the draw bridge lowers and then there's like a gate behind it and you hit the gate a

[01:18:05] couple of times and then a gate lifts up and then you can shoot into the castle and then the castle

[01:18:10] kind of collapses and shakes and rattles and then comes back together and then you kind of go to

[01:18:15] the next castle attack and each castle is a different bad guy that you're just amazing

[01:18:21] call it's wonderful wonderful call outs and there's also like a like a catapult mini ramp on the

[01:18:28] left side of the door so if you happen to miss sort of the the entrance way to the castle there's

[01:18:34] like the swinging sort of break away catapult smashing into the castle part which is cool catapult

[01:18:41] it's just like a door you mean the lot it's like a door but it's supposed to be like you're

[01:18:44] shooting your catapult and the ball goes through the wall that's going to be confusing when you

[01:18:49] mention the actual catapult that's on the left side right so the shot furthest to the left all the

[01:18:55] way over to the left just above the tip of this tip of the sling is like a saucer goes into the

[01:19:01] saucer and then it shoots the ball kind of somewhat vertically into a wire form which then goes

[01:19:08] around the corner in behind it's literally the catapult mech and you can pick what object you

[01:19:13] throw which I love yeah so we're talking basket balls cow surprise bowling ball my favorite the cat

[01:19:21] the cat the cat yeah it's a skull this game it just makes me smile it's so much fun this stellar

[01:19:31] all around it's a fairly easy shooter the ramps are pretty wide open most of the shots are pretty

[01:19:37] wide open again it's not the absolute perfection of a fan layout but it's basically a fan layout

[01:19:44] you know what I mean like it's not attacked from Mars perfection but it is still pretty amazing

[01:19:51] nonetheless so we talked about the trolls just briefly so what do they do they pop up literally

[01:19:57] from the bottom of the playfield they just pop up and you hit them and they say all kinds of

[01:20:01] funny things so if you brick if you brick too many shots with and by breaking I mean you're not

[01:20:06] shooting the ramps or you're not shooting the castle these dudes pop up and then they block

[01:20:11] basically two major shots and you got to shoot them in the face to lower them down a couple of times

[01:20:18] and you don't just shoot like a target in front of them again right you smash the bash toy the

[01:20:23] actual like face of the dude and they're pretty detailed little sculpts pretty cool when I first saw

[01:20:31] this game like in person I saw the original sort of Williams version and the first thing I said was

[01:20:38] can I see under the playfield to to my friend who showed me a showed out to Pete and I was like I was

[01:20:46] like man I got to see how the subway works and how the you know when you're shooting the castle you

[01:20:50] know where does the ball go in and around well it's it's sort of designed as like a moat right like

[01:20:56] literally there's a subway piece of plastic moves left to right on the playfield so anytime the

[01:21:02] ball goes into the castle or in front of the castle into the moat it falls into this subway and then

[01:21:07] over and back around kind of around to the orbit and it pops back up it's so cool because it's

[01:21:13] just interesting to see that and how the trolls work so nerdy I thought the trolls popped up as a

[01:21:19] merlin award when you hit it in the merlin's saucer there yeah but that's how they pop up so

[01:21:26] so you build them up from the bricking I think and then it goes into merlin and then it goes out

[01:21:30] well out of Ryan the dot matrix artist says I remember that the team sat in a room we were going to

[01:21:35] bring the attack from Mars team back together we knew what pressure we were under everyone wanted

[01:21:39] Brian Eddie to make another attack from Mars he even shared that pressure with us that we really

[01:21:44] needed to do attack from Mars but better how are we supposed to top that yeah well you top it with

[01:21:48] the theme because man the the the funniness and camp of this theme takes medieval madness to a

[01:21:55] level that attack from Mars was not part of like attack from Mars was funny and it had some great

[01:22:01] quotes but the the silliness went up a notch and it worked so well well Adam also says we started

[01:22:09] working on the game and it ended up being like a money python ripoff it was going to be in that

[01:22:13] vein the idea was going to be storming the castle in fact it took months to name that game we still

[01:22:18] have a page of about fifty names where we were bouncing around none of them seem to stick yeah so

[01:22:23] Doug Dug Watson was out he was around this time he was part of another large layoff round at

[01:22:31] Valley Williams and of course 50% of the engineers went at that time that's when John Yosey was

[01:22:38] brought into replace Doug on the art package so that's why there is a split art package group here

[01:22:45] and you can certainly see on the backlash that's John Yosey through and through right it's got that

[01:22:53] soft cartoon look that Yosey is best known for but I'll tell you when you look at some of the

[01:23:01] silly and fun details of that backlash you can tell that John Yosey was in his wheelhouse yeah we've

[01:23:07] got a cow on the left side being raised in the air by a merlin you've got damsels and distress

[01:23:15] coming out of their their towers there's one lady in in armor and high boots down in the moat

[01:23:24] you got spray paint going up the king is a queen yeah that's yeah that's censored now so yeah

[01:23:30] that wouldn't go no there are several items censored on this class at this point it's certainly

[01:23:36] uh uh uh interesting interesting game one of the fun parts about this and it's a very subtle

[01:23:43] but I think it's very neat is when you're shooting the dragon ramp which is the ramp on the right

[01:23:49] side you shoot up that ramp and then it sort of returns back to your to your right flipper

[01:23:56] after you shoot that shot so many times a diverter opens up and then you'll shoot up the ramp and

[01:24:03] it'll go right into what like the damsel and distress spire of the castle I guess and it's fun

[01:24:12] because you don't expect the ball to do that right it goes up and around and up and around and

[01:24:16] up and around and then also it goes straight through and you're like oh wait a minute wait a minute

[01:24:19] go to the diverter diverter loving it get out of those diverters jack danger I'm talking to you

[01:24:26] now I mean come on let's talk about something pretty cool here one of the damsels in distress

[01:24:33] is actually Tina Fey even I know who that is Tina Fey this is back in her like pre-SNL days when she

[01:24:43] sort of just struggling to make ends meet she's the voice in medieval madness of um what's her name

[01:24:52] some local comedy troupe Chicago comedy troupe that she was in that's who they got to do on

[01:24:57] the different voices a lot of right now she did the sort of the opera singer princess and the

[01:25:03] Cockney talking princess Greg Ferris was the voice of the jostling announcer and one of the trolls

[01:25:09] while Francois de Grim who was one of the uh one of the castle kings or princes or something

[01:25:16] French Waddy Grim yeah and he was Vince Ponterelli so it's fun that all these different characters all

[01:25:23] these different people get to come together and and be part of um medieval madness as well yeah

[01:25:31] cuz great ferris was the jostling announcer he's also the main announcer no fear which always

[01:25:36] threw me cuz it's the same exact voice it's like wait a minute yeah he didn't trust it up

[01:25:42] I'm expecting to tell me you know some of the no fear stuff totally now of course this game was

[01:25:47] the first remake by Chicago gaming in by Chicago gaming company in 2015 when they made medieval madness

[01:25:57] the standard edition and then the limited edition this game of course was heralded as the greatest

[01:26:04] pinball machine of all time of course until uh multi morphec took the number two spot with heist

[01:26:11] and godzilla with the number one spot and this had to be remade by a company and they went all in

[01:26:20] and and worked actually with stern to develop that first remake and uh it sold like

[01:26:27] some of them were actually built there I remember going on the factory tour one year and there were

[01:26:32] medieval madness this on the uh the production floor like what what are they doing here

[01:26:38] they would move on to other remake titles and we'll talk about that in a little while

[01:26:42] but then again in 2019 2020 Chicago gaming would actually go back and revisit medieval madness

[01:26:50] and make a royal edition which had a really kind of neat sculpted topper and a new larger

[01:26:58] DMD upgraded graphics I mean this machine is you know one of the most I mean heralded games of all time

[01:27:07] and you can tell why it's it's a lot of fun what are some of the critiques of this game Ron?

[01:27:13] well even when I got back into the hobby like 20 years ago this was super expensive game

[01:27:20] like you know 3k or something like oh my god yeah you were paying new unboxed prices oh my god

[01:27:25] I mean it's funny it's a very funny game doesn't take itself too seriously it shoots very nice

[01:27:30] shoots very nice it's very accessible for new players old players kind of remember what it was

[01:27:37] like when they first play it because eventually you know at one time they were a new player this was a

[01:27:41] great game yeah it's a it's a it's a good go the second Chicago gaming company remake was of course

[01:27:47] attack from Mars which went a little step further had the XL colored high-resor you know DMD

[01:27:55] display as well it had a really cool topper and then all of a sudden that became sort of their

[01:28:00] thing at Chicago gaming so Ron around this time of course there is some rumblings of a new platform

[01:28:10] and secret project over at Valley Williams that would eventually become the pinball 2000 system

[01:28:18] but of course during that time we're going to get one of the best games but with the lowest

[01:28:22] production amounts and that's monster bash do you have some wonderful feelings about monster

[01:28:29] bash it's fun I like it yeah so we're in July of 1998 we're selling 3361 units this is a horror

[01:28:40] sort of licensed theme designed by George Gomez art by Kevin O'Connor dots by Adam

[01:28:47] Ryan because all he's doing is dots mechanics by Chris Shipman and Robert Frizle we've got sound

[01:28:55] and music by Vince Pontarelli and software by the lineman f sheets this of course is after the

[01:29:04] universal monsters this is Dracula the creature from the black lagoon the bride of Frankenstein

[01:29:14] Frankenstein these this is kind of what we got a jumble of all of them together in a wonderful

[01:29:18] fan layout shots left to right and a fun semi original campy theme so what is the object of monster

[01:29:28] bash to get the band back together but that doesn't make any sense what do you mean they're a band

[01:29:34] you're getting a band back together you get them back together by hitting their shots so like the

[01:29:39] mummy he's in a band with yeah they're on the same band they'll play different instruments

[01:29:45] very cool very fun concept and of course everybody would remember the song monster mash yeah they

[01:29:52] tried to get they tried to get the license for that what what the what the guy's name force bet

[01:29:56] off I think was his name and he thought the song was worth more than William thought it was worth

[01:30:00] George Gomez is I wanted to use the monster mash song from the 60s as the theme for monster bash

[01:30:06] but when the owner of the rights to the song wanted too much money I made mash into bash and never

[01:30:11] look back the reality is we didn't miss it Adam Ryan would actually say that he thought they were

[01:30:16] going to charge twenty thousand dollars to use the song for a pinball game that was certainly a bit

[01:30:24] much and of course to hear it every year at Halloween so I mean the guys obviously making a bunch of

[01:30:30] money what does he need some money for on a pinball machine but George says he doesn't miss it very

[01:30:37] much so I guess we're good with that George Gomez would say that his favorite game I don't know if

[01:30:42] it's currently his favorite game but back in the day his favorite game was T2 which was a standard

[01:30:50] let's say the first of the most perfect fan layouts of shots left to right wonderful positions

[01:30:57] well George wanted to make his own homage to that and that became monster bash I wonder if dead

[01:31:04] pool is George's favorite game now probably who did I say I say Boris bent off I know what I was

[01:31:12] thinking a Bobby picket was the guys name Bobby picket don't write in if you've already opened up

[01:31:17] a email and sent it not going to read it's probably from a cartoon or something was need like

[01:31:22] Boris and Natasha so that's who it is yes from a prock in bowl ankle see still pinball connection

[01:31:29] always keep it pinball it's not a good one though but Gomez would also say that monster bash was

[01:31:35] one of those magical moments in developing a product the sun and the moon all the stars they lined up

[01:31:42] and in terms of quality and enthusiasm all the people who worked on the product went above

[01:31:49] and beyond Vince Ponte Relle's audio package this is a we've talked about you know attack for Mars

[01:31:57] we talked about medieval madness scared stiff has a great audio package you know this one I think

[01:32:04] is better because it's got a lot of these just can't be fun bits around those characters themselves

[01:32:13] my favorite call out in pinball history is when the vampire course Dracula when you shoot his shot he

[01:32:20] goes even now it just cracks what are their instruments oh so you know I think I think the

[01:32:33] creatures on drums no wrong already the creature is the saxophonist right sign is let's see he's

[01:32:40] the keyboardist I think wolf man's on the drums mommy is the bass player brightest singer and

[01:32:47] Dracula is the guitar's oh so cool yeah the wolf man of course the man's got to be a drummer of course

[01:32:55] of course what is Frank is on he's placed keyboard yeah this because he's got his hands out straight

[01:33:01] already so it just goes dude dude dude dude see this is what I mean I freaking love this game I'm just

[01:33:09] talking about another podcast here alone by myself in my office on a Saturday and it's cracking me up

[01:33:15] the monsters of the rock let's rock what I really enjoy about the frankenstein mech so let's talk

[01:33:22] about that there's there's there's a motorized to target bank and it will go under the playfield

[01:33:30] and then up will come off of like a basically a table is frankenstein and then you bash his toes

[01:33:38] or his feet with the ball and then he'll flip up and then you can shoot up a ramp a short little ramp

[01:33:46] that goes into this sort of the ramp that's always there from the right from the the right hand shot

[01:33:52] it's a very unique sort of multi stage toy something like that we don't certainly see a lot of nowadays

[01:34:01] this also has the ramp that George Gomez is is sort of known for I guess where the ball kind of comes

[01:34:10] up a wire form ramp where the wire forms are directly in the playfield he would use this again

[01:34:18] in Lord of the Rings so who the heck is Chris shipment so he's the mechanical engineer and when

[01:34:24] you look at a lot of the mechanics on here there's some pretty cool stuff we're not talking Tom

[01:34:27] Capara right now no George is usual guy so Chris shipment he was actually mark richy's mechanical

[01:34:33] engineer at capcom so when capcom pinball started up Chris shipment popped in and when capcom was

[01:34:40] going down the crapper George Gomez reached out to mark and asked him if there were any good mechanical

[01:34:46] engineers at capcom and that's how Chris got his job at Valley Williams and his first game was

[01:34:53] monster bash because Tom Capara was doing something else so how do you design around a theme like

[01:35:01] this this is a pretty deep theme right like you've got the sort of the campiness and stuff but the

[01:35:07] theme itself you've you've got some kind of iconic characters how do you how do you make a playfield

[01:35:14] that is good enough for the universal monsters well George Gomez says up until the 80s used to be

[01:35:21] that the designer created a game and the artist dressed it I've never worked that way on a product

[01:35:26] I believe that integrating the theme is pivotal because the idea is to immerse the player in the

[01:35:30] world of the themes fiction and everything in the game should do that this game totally does that

[01:35:37] I think a lot of designers especially nowadays just bang out play fields left and right

[01:35:44] and then they sort of put the theme around it right they're like we'll change this bash toy from

[01:35:49] from you know this toy to this toy and it's a completely different theme George you can tell

[01:35:54] when he designs his games you know you look at Deadpool you look at monster bash you look at NBA

[01:36:00] fast break right like you couldn't just slap different art on it and to be a different game

[01:36:06] it's very good that way now the scoring approach is kind of interesting right so this is this is

[01:36:12] a lineman game lineman sheets is like a god amongst pinball playing you know enthusiasts I think he's

[01:36:21] okay I enjoy his code I I'm not good enough to know the difference was really between him and

[01:36:27] Dwight Sullivan but a lot of people hold him up really really high what is so interesting about

[01:36:33] the code in this game trying to get the band together that's the whole concept of the game

[01:36:39] you're trying to assemble the band to play your gig and each different band member is a shot

[01:36:45] so you fell up the shots you got like a mosh pit and what he did is you can you can assemble all the

[01:36:52] monsters that's monster bash but if you can get all their instruments then you get monsters of

[01:36:57] rock which is like the uber wizard mode yeah sort of like a mini wizard mode and that's the uber

[01:37:03] it's kind of like it's the dinosaurs conquer the earth and Jurassic Park it's like the

[01:37:08] like one one way you start everything and you get one wizard mode the other one is you actually

[01:37:13] get all their instruments you finished all their stuff then you get monsters of rock which of course

[01:37:17] is worth more yeah this is a great this is a great game all around lineman also integrated the

[01:37:23] phantom flip this I think is where he spent most of his time in the development cycle was on doing

[01:37:30] the phantom flip how does that work uh the game flips itself and tries to make a shot does it

[01:37:37] work um not optimally most of the time that's why it's usually disabled in any kind of tournament scenario

[01:37:43] so it's used it's it's sort of like the thing flips right but much more um advanced well

[01:37:49] as George Gomez says lineman owes me big time because the number of sensor and array configurations

[01:37:54] that he made me screw into that white wood it was never ending he'd say okay now I want a proximity

[01:37:59] sensor here in two ir sensors over here then I want to roll over switch and three proximity sensors

[01:38:05] he was just making me crazy I'd say we got to build the game he'd say but it's got to be cool

[01:38:12] how well is is that right the the mad scientist uh that is lineman sheets what it works it's cool

[01:38:20] because it literally flips itself and makes the shot what I find um so cool about George Gomez

[01:38:27] is all of the things that he has given to pinball and continues to give to pinball so for example

[01:38:33] he's building monster bash with the mad scientist lineman sheets but at the same time he's working on

[01:38:39] that super secret project with pat lawler now George had to schedule around the engineer Chris

[01:38:46] shipment and George's usual engineer Tom Capero was working on his own game so Chris and George

[01:38:54] would have to work around lineman sheets his hours because they had to optimize everything to

[01:39:00] maximize lineman's time if a machine was down for two hours while they were screwing in some

[01:39:06] mechanisms or changing some sensors doing some testing or shooting it that is two hours that lineman

[01:39:13] couldn't work with it there was only one white wood and it would sit in lineman's office

[01:39:19] shipment used to come in at around five a.m. with George and they would work on the game until 10

[01:39:27] that's when lineman sheets would roll in from 10 o'clock and he would be back in his computer doing

[01:39:32] all the play field stuff and they would start working on the game now George kept his regular hours

[01:39:39] when he was doing all of this stuff but they were crazy hours because after his day was done

[01:39:47] George would jump into his Porsche he would drive all the way into the middle of nowhere to see

[01:39:53] Pat Lawler and they would work on pinball 2000 in Pat's famous home workshop this guy has done a lot

[01:40:02] for pinball and you can learn about pinball 2000 by listening to the silver ball chronicles pinball

[01:40:08] 2000 episode swing on over to silverball chronicles dot com to check out the archive feel free to

[01:40:13] download and listen to all of our old and past episodes most of them where I'm much funnier than

[01:40:18] Ron says you now this is a flow beast right that's very flowy very George George likes flow

[01:40:27] he really this is where he really I think got into you know he did a lot of flow in Johnny

[01:40:32] pneumonic but there's a little clunk in there no there's no clunk of Johnny pneumonic you got to

[01:40:37] call the glove of clunk and court and court vet is super flowy too now you're not going to get me on

[01:40:42] that one you you can't flow more than Johnny pneumonic that thing is one of the flowiest things

[01:40:48] ever made but George says to me flow is not strictly about a series of smooth shots although clearly

[01:40:54] they're the most obvious component of it there's an intensity that occurs when one shot sets up

[01:40:58] another shot or a possible transition in the midst of accomplishing a greater game goal like a hurry

[01:41:03] up or scoring frenzy the feedback the game gives you with sounds as you complete consecutive shots

[01:41:07] is vital to enhancing that feeling it's about getting the player so intensely focused on

[01:41:11] making the subsequent shot to continue the combination that it becomes all consuming man

[01:41:17] d i have never heard of anybody describe flow any better than that even the king of flow himself

[01:41:24] can't describe flow like that i agree that's flow and no seafritchie does not talk like that in real

[01:41:30] life just in games what he like in a nutshell what do you what do you think of monster bash is why

[01:41:36] don't you have one of these in your collection uh too easy really it gets somewhat repetitive same

[01:41:43] reason i wouldn't have like scared stiff because you can get to the wizard mode like on ball one a

[01:41:47] lot of times uh needs a little little little harder little little harder this is more of a game for

[01:41:53] me and also at the time even back in the day 10 15 years ago monster bash was extremely expensive

[01:41:59] they didn't make a lot of these no um and a lot of them didn't survive as well you know the arcade

[01:42:05] circuit the ones that did they they went for high high value numbers yep and that's why Chicago

[01:42:11] gaming pulled this one out for their third remake monster bash attack from ours many evil maness

[01:42:18] they were the games that everyone the all those other games we mentioned from the era they they

[01:42:23] ripped all the parts off of that to save these games yeah monster bash is still a top 10 game on

[01:42:28] the pin side I'll probably tell some rabia nights is another one but like NBA jam Congo they just they

[01:42:35] they ripped those games apart to get parts for the other games yeah yeah absolutely and i'll tell you

[01:42:42] this is this is this is this is this is a great game this isn't wonderful if you're like me you're

[01:42:47] a pretty good player but you're you know you're not killing it you know you're not getting a big

[01:42:52] wizard modes if you struggle a little bit with Jurassic Park you're you know you're you're getting

[01:42:57] maybe to the t-rex paddock you know this is more your style of game monster bash and you'll enjoy it

[01:43:05] you really will my friend Pete picked one of these up the Chicago gaming um SE remakes and uh I

[01:43:13] have not been up to his place since he purchased that because of the whole world ending thing and um

[01:43:22] I really look forward to plan a lot of this game when I have a chance all these games we went through

[01:43:27] are there any real bombs there really isn't no see even open balls dying it's not like they're

[01:43:33] making terrible games but that's that's where I opened it up right that these new designers are

[01:43:39] coming in with some cool new ideas new new sort of ways of doing things and mechanics they're not

[01:43:45] getting those 10,000 unit sales numbers which is a shame but that brings us to the last

[01:43:53] DMD game Williams Valley ever produced cactus canyon that's right the date of manufacturers

[01:44:03] October of 1998 people will say but that's not the last game that Valley Williams ever made well

[01:44:09] it's the last DMD Valley Williams ever made this sells 903 units it's a cowboy American Wild West

[01:44:18] theme it's designed by Tom Capera Matt Caralli Caralli art by John Yosey Adam Ryan and Jeff

[01:44:30] rap a Jim Raff on dots and animation Louis Toi on mechanics boy that's a fortunate last name

[01:44:38] music by Rob Barry and of course he did the sound this this production was cut short again because

[01:44:46] of pinball 2000 as well as it didn't really shoot the lights out when it was really cut short

[01:44:51] that much though the actual plan was for 925 games and they did 903 so they just for screw the last

[01:44:58] 22 don't bother this was another one of those games that went for high high dollar on the secondary

[01:45:07] market because it was it was sort of seen as like the last magical game that they did right the pinball

[01:45:15] 2000 regular pinball machine and all the magic was the last game with magic run now the major

[01:45:23] piece to this was that it had unfinished code code which to date to this day still is unfinished

[01:45:31] except for some hobbyists who've made their own updated code Chicago gaming did finish some of it

[01:45:37] it actually has a map sequence now oh I've seen it and I've seen the new one in action what do you

[01:45:42] think so this is Chicago gaming we mentioned that before they made all these other remakes they

[01:45:46] their latest remake is cactus canyon and they've touched up some of the code but then they're

[01:45:54] going to have extra code package you can buy for as yet undisclosed price that will be from

[01:46:01] lineman sheets and Josh sharp Josh sharps finished like number two and a lot of majors right you see

[01:46:06] that guy I think he's the play tester lineman writes the Cody play test it's got a topper that's

[01:46:12] pretty cool it's basically a guy drawing you know guns on you because it's totally it's the west

[01:46:18] it makes sense this this this is was a difficult game for a lot of people to play if you were able

[01:46:22] to find one of these it was like whoa wow we got to play cactus canyon selling 904 of them or whatever

[01:46:28] I think I think Chicago gaming is probably going to sell more than 900 already yes I think so

[01:46:35] uh so they've sold more of these games than valley Williams it's it's got the Williams humor in it

[01:46:40] that's for sure excellent voice work I mean it's got guns in it man it's you know guns right on

[01:46:45] the apron and it really hadn't been I mean what was the last western themed pinball machine

[01:46:50] well it was the remember we talked about the one where Roger sharp on it um yeah sharp shooter sharp

[01:46:55] shooter or sharp shooter two yeah what was that it was like 88 we went through all these got

[01:47:02] leaves I mean there's got to be at least one got well that was that was the there was the sharp

[01:47:05] shooter and got leave are not sharp shooter but um bounty hunter oh yeah that's like mid 80s they

[01:47:11] also had cactus jacks which I don't know that wasn't really western but it was yeah that cactus

[01:47:16] is it in a cactus for that's one at a five things that you need to be you know wild west theme

[01:47:22] but the great story about cactus canyon it was just literally we need to fill the line with

[01:47:26] something until we start pinball 2000 what you all got yeah and that's where because George is

[01:47:32] too tired he's he's doing his monster bash so top capara and mac corial i'm gonna say that's

[01:47:38] that's i would say his name they had already kind of started working on a game on their own time

[01:47:43] so when it came time to like show off their games they were the only ones that actually had a

[01:47:47] working white wood like here they're like oh man okay you guys get the job and it became cactus canyon

[01:47:55] very very cool and because it was because it was the fill the line let's get something out the door

[01:48:01] let's keep everything running until pinball 2000 gets up that's where a lot of the issues from

[01:48:07] this appear right there are a lot of unfinished mechanics that were cut from the game as well as

[01:48:12] of course we had mentioned the unfinished code adam rine would say that cactus canyon was the very

[01:48:18] last dot game we were being pushed really hard especially myself to leave the dots behind and to

[01:48:25] get on to pinball 2000 basically my time was cut short learning the 3d design for pinball 2000

[01:48:33] and working with George Gomez myself and Jim rap were both pulled away from the project to soon

[01:48:40] you can tell right the other thing is there's a couple of mechanics that were pulled out so originally

[01:48:46] in the play field there was supposed to be saloon doors that you would sort of shoot through and

[01:48:52] they were sort of you know gates or whatever yeah it was like yeah it was like medieval magic you

[01:48:59] hit it and it opens and then you hit the head they cut that because they thought it was like you

[01:49:03] had a bash toy in front of a bash toy so why do you need that so they cut that out right still

[01:49:09] cool that would have gone in front of what is it bad Bart I think right bionic Bart bionic

[01:49:13] Bart I love Bart then there's also another mechanic that was removed which was over by the by the

[01:49:20] mountain and the the the mine I think it was supposed to move a different way or up and down

[01:49:27] or something and the center ramp changed several times originally it's gonna be like two ramps

[01:49:31] like a diverter thing and come on diverters man I'm sorry they took the diverter out no no but they

[01:49:38] kept these stupid guns on the guns are awesome I mean there it's a friggin western theme you need

[01:49:44] to have the six shooters on the bottom everybody knows about the up post in the in the in lanes

[01:49:50] on Jurassic Park well this was a game that had originally on the left and right side for the gun

[01:49:56] fight so the object was that you would shoot the in lanes and the ball would be held there

[01:50:01] until you are ready to pull your gun the bullet come down the ball the ball would come down the

[01:50:06] in lanes it would the the thing would pop up stop the ball and there was four drop targets

[01:50:13] and it's like draw and they they come up and down they were all individually controlled up and

[01:50:18] down and they would come up and now come up and down and they would finally say draw on one of the

[01:50:22] four would come up and you had to hit it it was neat it was neat I have now I have actually played

[01:50:28] a cactus can an original cactus can you oh my for a guy who hasn't played a whole lot of games

[01:50:34] you play some rare ones I've played a lot of really like odd and rare games it's very unusual

[01:50:39] well Canada is very odd and unusual that's that's right odd and unusual I couldn't even say that right

[01:50:45] well that's okay we have a better education system up here that is true the the plunge is

[01:50:50] really cool because you you plunge up and you go into like a like a world pool kind of slosser

[01:50:56] thing which is really neat I also wonder if they just repurpose that from white water like if

[01:51:01] it's the exact same thing yeah they just changed the probably did if they were care cost cutting

[01:51:05] the the other thing is I can tell that the code is unfinished in this game because I played it

[01:51:11] the second time I flipped this game I actually flipped it until I basically made it right to the

[01:51:18] wizard mode on ball three and as mentioned before not really the greatest of players it's all the

[01:51:24] shots are wide open like super wide open you it's impossible to miss them you just keep shooting

[01:51:32] each shot over and over and over again until you fill it up and then you're into the wizard mode

[01:51:37] and I I I G seed this game from this owner who had a very fancy private collection and and I had

[01:51:47] no idea what I was even really doing so hopefully we can get some better code in the future yeah the

[01:51:53] match this the match sequence was just a placeholder wasn't even like it would just come up with the

[01:51:58] match the number with no real animation nothing and then the flyer cactus canyon it says the west

[01:52:06] has never been this wild you rode into cactus canyon this I should do this in a southern accent

[01:52:13] right if it's the old way you rode in a cactus canyon stranger but you can use your skills to

[01:52:18] become marshal this little town and need a time in there's plenty of cleaning up to do here and

[01:52:23] mayor cleatum yes a name mayor cleatum mayor cleatum cleatum hopes you're just the buckaroo to do

[01:52:31] it but earning your badge won't be easy you'll have to do something about the stamp page that

[01:52:37] charged you the town from time to time trampling everything in their pass these those gunslinging

[01:52:43] outlaws the bar brothers are itching to challenge you to a showdown you just might find yourself

[01:52:47] staring them down at the old corral so you better have a quick draw and pre-admiss poly is bound to be

[01:52:54] tied up in some perilous predicament so it'll be up to you to saver you've got to be prepared for

[01:52:59] anything in a town like this but if you're up to the challenge you can hit the mother load here

[01:53:04] in cactus canyon so reach for your revolver and get ready to shoot because the west has never been

[01:53:10] this wild brutal i'll tell you it's a cool game it's a cool game doesn't particularly do it for me

[01:53:19] i think i'd rather have an attack from mars monster bash you know those are the games i think i'd

[01:53:26] rather have met evil madness for sure it's the reason uh Chicago gaming did all those first

[01:53:32] exactly now what i have much rather Chicago gaming done a theater of magic and fix some of the

[01:53:38] kind of the issues with its code absolutely uh a tales of the arabia nights 100 percent

[01:53:45] but you know there are a lot of people that really really love this game i'm surprised they did

[01:53:50] cactus canyon before either tails or uh what's the other poppy duke one theater of magic yeah

[01:53:56] surprising isn't it i i thought they would get a theater magic i thought would get done first

[01:54:01] well around this time run we're on the home stretch but this is when

[01:54:06] things start to get really rough and do you sell the Williams pinball division or do you close it

[01:54:14] down what pat lawler would go on the record is saying on an old top cast episode that they head to

[01:54:22] either sell it or they could write down 12 million dollars so they could somebody out there would

[01:54:29] have to buy the Williams pinball division for 12 million or they could use it as a as a basically an

[01:54:35] accounting practice where you write it off you get a loss and then you can offset gains elsewhere

[01:54:41] well nobody is going to pay 12 million dollars for a pinball company in 2000 so that's when they

[01:54:47] decided to just write it off and send it out the door go mess says shut down the spigot down to a

[01:54:55] trickle in particular business is not necessarily explosive don't lock it off it's kind of like let's

[01:54:59] get rid of it move on to me that says you don't want to be in the business you want to be in a

[01:55:04] different business well what's wrong with your coin business there was a bunch of money made when

[01:55:08] the video game company spun off and that's what this was about it was about how much money can we

[01:55:13] make we're in the middle the business of making a profit today and f*** everything else so that's

[01:55:19] when Williams shuts down lawler would say when they fired us for me personally it was like a

[01:55:24] giant weight had been lifted off my shoulders not that I didn't want the company to succeed

[01:55:30] but going to work every day with a sense of dread was horrible they feel like the acts is right there

[01:55:37] right any day they're going to come in and get asked them when it finally does it's like

[01:55:41] huh finally done I can move on now of course do you think that Neil Nacastro killed the

[01:55:49] Valley Williams business the president of Williams did he kill it well you kind of shut it down but

[01:55:54] George says Neil is either Darth Vader or the nicest guy Neil wasn't out to get us or anything

[01:56:00] like that but I think that his methods were not particularly supportive but he did give us a shot

[01:56:05] and we did take a shot so perhaps he did support us yeah so a lot of people would have a lot of

[01:56:10] commentary on well why didn't they keep running DMD business and pinball 2000 go back to our pinball

[01:56:17] 2000 episode and we talk about that and why they wouldn't have run those two parallel things

[01:56:22] but it was certainly a different kind of fight and struggle there were so many and resources at

[01:56:29] this corporation but for some reason they just they weren't pulling in the same direction as

[01:56:36] management and it just it came down to business and sadly that was the end in fact the passion

[01:56:43] and the creativity that was created at Williams at the time has actually built Chicago gaming

[01:56:50] company to a higher level because they're making remaking those games their entire pinball business

[01:56:57] model has basically been built on making remakes of those games so that's that's pretty nuts

[01:57:04] but where did where did some of the people go that were still at Williams at this time well great

[01:57:09] framer says when Williams closed I went to midway and did art directing on touch screen Xbox and

[01:57:14] PlayStation games it took two to three years to develop a game there versus 12 months on a pinball

[01:57:19] machine I was a fish out of water imagine you're working in a high pressure get it out the door

[01:57:24] you know business model and now they're like just take 12 months that's pretty crazy you know lots

[01:57:30] of these guys would they would go off some of them would start to work for for Sega which would become

[01:57:35] stern some of them would take time to do independent contracting for a few years before they would end

[01:57:40] up at stern you know the industry itself was in a lot of flux in fact Greg Ferrer has ended up in

[01:57:46] stern and now he is the director of their art team there one thing that people always talk about in

[01:57:53] the valley Williams error was the magic the magic of valley Williams right like oh stern they

[01:58:00] stripped everything out and you know those games are no good I want I want the the world under glass

[01:58:05] that was in valley Williams right I need a new valley Williams jersey jack is supposed to be the

[01:58:13] new valley Williams well George Gomez says I have yet to run across that combination of personalities

[01:58:19] that combination of talent I mean when I worked at Marvin Glass there was an incredible amount of

[01:58:24] talent in that place and a lot of ways Williams reminded me of that there was a tremendous amount of

[01:58:28] talent the most talented guys I've ever worked with we're talking engineers artists designers

[01:58:35] animation teams of course that interview might have been 10 years ago I ask him that now

[01:58:40] yeah these stern guys are the most talented the the biggest pieces to those to that puzzle is that all

[01:58:48] of those cylinders were firing at the same time like you look at somebody like pop a Duke Jay

[01:58:53] pop right he really struggled after he got out of the valley Williams team because he didn't have

[01:58:58] his engineers he didn't have his same artists he didn't you know he was he couldn't get the stake

[01:59:03] to back up the sizzle right you look at you know Jersey Jack right they struck they they they have

[01:59:09] all this stuff in their machines right they went with wide bodies they jammed everything and you

[01:59:14] possibly imagine into the game they almost went bankrupt they had to have financial backing come

[01:59:19] in and save them but there's still something that's kind of missing there's some kind of there's

[01:59:24] they're just missing the salt and pepper on there right there's just something missing

[01:59:28] you can't quite put your finger on it so you can't ever recreate Valley Williams and I wish

[01:59:34] that we as a hobby would just move on to the new games and the new manufacturers that are rising up

[01:59:41] I've moved on here's one last quote from Greg Ferris he says life at Valley I made lifelong

[01:59:48] friends we kept up with each other wow it was good at Valley I can't say enough good things about
