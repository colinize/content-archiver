[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching silver ball chronicles.

[00:14] So I'm gonna try this thing out, okay? A friend of mine who records voiceovers for medical

[00:18] stuff. Are you having problems with hemorrhoids? We can help.

[00:22] So she gave me this idea, so I have this dog clicker, okay? So let's say you're recording

[00:26] something and you're like, yes, you keep clicking it more times. Yes. So then you can

[00:32] edit your... So I'm gonna give that a try this time and see if that won't get annoying

[00:35] at all. Well, if you don't just fuck this up, things will work out perfectly fine, Ron.

[00:56] Hello, everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me is

[01:18] Ron Stairmaster Hallet. What's up, fella? Yes, that is true. The Stairmaster.

[01:26] The Stairmaster. Would you like to tell everybody why your legs are on fire? My legs are fine.

[01:32] It's my throat that's bothering me for some reason. You climbed how many flights of stairs?

[01:38] 42? 42 flights of stairs. You go up Corning Tower, which is the tallest building in Albany.

[01:47] And I have no idea what my time is because by the time I got to the top, I looked out

[01:51] and it was snowing and I was like, oh, gotta get out of here. So did you stop halfway,

[01:57] get a hot dog? No, I did not stop. You did not stop. You went the whole way good for

[02:03] you and you did that for a charity, right? Sistic Fibrosis. Good for you, Ron, for getting

[02:07] out and doing that. But beyond you and your poor quality exercise, what have we all been

[02:14] doing you and I? We've been watching all these new game reveals that are coming. They're

[02:19] coming in from all directions, all manufacturers. I would say pretty much any company that

[02:25] says their game is coming out in March, which is like all of them. I assume they will

[02:29] all be a Texas. This is a different story than the last couple of years, right? We've

[02:34] sort of bumbled and stumbled our way from 2020 until today because of that thing that

[02:39] happened. So we're pretty excited to get to maybe a more of a slightly normal feeling.

[02:46] If you will, it's been a year of normal, but I think we're getting into like a real

[02:50] normal here. I can't wait till like five years from now when we cover this in a future

[02:54] still a Royal Chronicles episode. Well, what about food fighters? That's coming out. That

[02:58] looks beautiful, doesn't it? That'll be in our Jack Danger episode, 20 years from now

[03:03] or 10 years from now, whatever. But the most important thing, Ron, that has happened

[03:07] besides all your whopper farming and climbing upstairs and saving the world from Sistic Fibrosis

[03:13] is that I purchased a James Bond premium. I thought you were going to get a premium.

[03:17] I'm getting a premium because I want the I want the ball lock because I want the light

[03:21] show and all the excitement around that and you want bond on a one and the art package

[03:26] is really cool. You only live twice is actually among one of my favorite James Bond films

[03:32] because it's got that whole fight scene at the end in the volcano layer. Oh, you like

[03:37] ninjas. It's very typical over the top James Bond. And that's why I love you only

[03:42] live twice. You like ninjas, rockets and what's his name? Donald Pleasants? Yes. I love

[03:48] Donald Pleasants. Donald Pleasants, that cool lines like we are now unpredictable. Like

[03:53] five minutes before everyone breaks in. And then there's the scene where there's the

[03:56] where he's holding the cat talking to James Bond and there's like explosions behind them

[04:01] and the cat is freaking out and he holds the cat's head because it wants to like bolt

[04:05] from his hands and he's still in the middle of acting. I'm afraid that's not in the script.

[04:10] You must stay there kitty. Well, we've sold out we've joined a Patreon and welcome to

[06:45] Couple of different design choices. Some exciting stuff. We've used some of that fancy patreon money

[06:51] to pay for Randy Martinez to make us a special limited edition silver ball chronicles logo.

[06:59] Looks very cool. It's like a retro clean 1950s look in space. Silver ball chronicles name. I think

[07:05] it looks cool. What do you think? That's the guy did Mandalorian. And he did my comic book pro that I

[07:10] have downstairs. For your Star Wars. Yes. Yes. Yes. Official Star Wars artist. For all your

[07:17] Star Wars and Mandalorian needs did a design for us. And all he all we had to do was pay him for it.

[07:24] Isn't that amazing? That's amazing. So corrections and comments from the previous episode or episodes.

[07:32] Uh oh. We have corrections. We did something wrong. I don't know. We never really do anything wrong.

[07:39] Oh yes. That's why that's why David now has a dog clicker. This way this thing.

[07:46] That will help me hopefully edit this thing a little bit faster than usual because you know

[07:50] quite frankly I've been slacking. I have been super super mega busy and all of the things that I've

[07:59] been doing here on silver ball chronicles. But even more so busy is my real life. Things have

[08:06] been crazy. Oh yeah. We're on a word winning podcast kind of not really actually no silver medal.

[08:14] I guess we're a silver medalist. We're what what do they call it? Second loser first place first

[08:23] place loser as the skull will tell you. As you can hear about in our Steve Richie episode.

[08:28] One of our Steve Richie episodes. So previous comments and corrections from our previous episode

[08:34] Ken Walker emailed us at silver ball chronicles at gmail.com. He wanted to tell us about Dan

[08:40] Langlois dark planet. He sent us an image of that and a local thing. He also found it amazing

[08:46] to learn about Mr. Langloi and unfortunately his early passing in the last episode. Dan Langloi

[08:52] of course was the uh bali midway designer who designed all those crazy crazy pins back in the 80s.

[09:02] Also a shout-outs to Jonas Aikerman who says love the podcast started listening to some of the

[09:09] specific episodes during the pandemic. I picked up this awesome hobby two years ago. Finally got my

[09:17] wife to agree to buying a pinball machine. Hey good for you Jonas and having a spouse that's a

[09:23] partner in your relationship as opposed to the butt of a joke. In May of 2020 he traded his

[09:28] data east Jurassic Park and he had all of he had this difficult time of getting a high score run.

[09:35] That was until he listened to our episode about data east where you talked about the missile button.

[09:42] The missile button. Now he has the high score. It's a missile that's smart. It's a smart missile.

[09:47] I use that. I use that in the term I just played in. I use the smart missile effectively.

[09:52] Jonas is from Sweden. Yes so if he's butchering your name he's going to blame that. So I'll say

[09:58] Jonas Aikerman. No it's Jonas like the Jonas Brothers. One of us of you right. Or will both be wrong.

[10:05] Also I'm going to point this out here. He added a post script. Can you read this for me Ron?

[10:11] Post all that's what PS stands for. I never let always forget that. He says PS since my first

[10:17] real encounters with Canadians back in South Park bigger longer and on cut. I thought the

[10:23] a boot stuff was made up. Thanks for clearing that up as well. That's right the things you figure

[10:31] out things you figure out. I didn't I don't know what he's talking about. I don't know what I've

[10:37] cleared up for him. There's you say boot. You're clearly Canadian dude. I am but we don't say a boot.

[10:47] A boot. Yes you say it weird. All right let's move on to the topic. Oh the topic. Yeah.

[10:54] Let's get done with this. This is this is ridiculous. Oh I'm sorry. Oh by the way when I said

[10:57] silver medals I meant that the pinball awards. Oh yes that's right. We didn't even mention what that

[11:03] even meant. That's that's the worst ceremony that TPN sets up to congratulate its people.

[11:08] That's right. What I wanted to do is make sure that I started a award ceremony to ensure that I

[11:14] could get myself an award. And it didn't work and it's not working. And you're on the committee.

[11:20] I think I'm going to quit. Wow. Yeah this is ridiculous. What can I say about Keith P. Johnson?

[11:27] He has four of the top pinball machines in the pinball awards hall of fame. He coded some of the

[11:35] most revered and most panned pinball codes in our hobby. In addition Keith is one of the most

[11:42] important pieces in designing Jersey Jack's operating system and building their philosophy around

[11:49] pinball code and home use. I've enjoyed Keith's code. I've hated Keith's code. I've even begun

[11:59] to ask more of Keith's code by demanding just a little bit less. But let's begin with how Keith

[12:07] entered pinball. How did he change pinball? And what does he do in nowadays? Let's talk. Everything

[12:16] is lit. Keith Johnson and Jersey Jack pinball should we start at the beginning, Ron, or should we

[12:23] start at the end? Always start at the beginning. Always start at the beginning because we tried that

[12:28] with a different podcast where we did somebody's career backwards and it just confused everybody.

[12:34] Keith Johnson's from the DC area. Have you been to DC? Washington DC. Yes. I've been to DC many times.

[12:41] The District of Columbia. Not a real state apparently. That's where our capital is. That's where all

[12:47] of those people just love to go and have vacations and break windows and stuff. Yeah, I wouldn't

[12:53] take vacation in Washington DC, but yeah. So from the late 70s and 80s, like most of the young

[12:58] pinball folk at the time, most of the exposure to pinball was while on summer vacation. Keith,

[13:05] however, was much more into video games than pinball at the time. Keith says, and I will be the

[13:11] voice of Keith today. I love being the voice of playing Keith Johnson today is Ron Hallett Jr.

[13:19] As video games switch to get the next quarter, which if from from back in the day, and there's a period

[13:28] where like you place something like smash TV and you can't have to put more money in to continue.

[13:34] Like the games wanted you just keep you'll continue continue to continue. They make the game so

[13:38] hard that you had to just keep putting money in. Yeah, those Kenomi games were really big for that.

[13:42] It was all about just get the next quarter in there as opposed to like high scores. Yeah, who knows

[13:46] they might still do that. Keith says, I kind of found myself going back to pinball around college.

[13:51] And college is when I started playing like really seriously. You know, eventually starting going

[13:55] to tournaments and that kind of thing. Keith actually went to Virginia Tech and studied computer

[14:01] science, which is I think a pretty nerdy place to study computer science, right?

[14:07] I for sure. I feel like Virginia Tech is like one of those ones where you're like, oh, Virginia

[14:13] Tech. It's not like MIT, but it's like, that just seems like one of those ones that sticks out in my

[14:18] head for some reason. Isn't it maybe because they had crappy commercials in the 90s or something?

[14:20] I don't know. I guess I should be the expert being the American here, but I don't know.

[14:26] Yeah, but you're also like an IT computer nerd. Well, do you have like the University of Toronto

[14:30] or the Royal Computer Science or something? Yeah, the Waterloo University of Waterloo is

[14:35] a big with computer science. All right. University of New Brunswick is huge with cyber security

[14:40] and stuff like that. We have a really big technology hub here in my city. Wow, New Brunswick,

[14:43] you named yourself after a bowling company. That's the bowling company name themselves after us

[14:48] because quite frankly, everything is awesome in New Brunswick, especially trees.

[14:52] After graduating, Keith spent some time bouncing around some companies like Advanced Systems,

[14:57] which was like a Microsoft support shop. He also worked with companies that specialized in

[15:02] university class scheduling software, financial aid coordination, and other exciting IT-related things.

[15:09] Can you relate to that, Ron? After you first graduate, you just sort of bumble around and

[15:13] sort of information technology and kind of eventually find your way? Well, I wasn't really a programmer

[15:19] and the place I started off with, I'm still there. So I didn't really bounce around. So I guess I

[15:24] I'm I failed. That's that's unusual though. That is unusual. That is unusual. That is unusual.

[15:29] People switch jobs a lot nowadays and we'll get into that with Keith Johnson. Keith would frequent

[15:35] pinball tournaments around this time and he was often seen in the big leagues of Papa and Papa is

[15:41] what, Ron? The Professional Amateur Pinball Association. This was the big league, right? This was

[15:49] really kind of the predecessor to IFPA, the International Pinball Flipper Association. This like Papa

[15:56] was a big big big deal and we've sort of seen it kind of fall off a lot more here in the last

[16:02] what five to seven years. Yeah, well since pinberg isn't around anymore. Yeah, pinberg was really the

[16:08] last sort of hurrah for pin for for the Papa style. Well, not the putt hold on. We're going to get

[16:14] corrections up the answer. Papa, there's the Papa tournament and then there's the pinberg tournament.

[16:19] They were both run by the replay foundation, but they're totally different types of tournaments.

[16:27] Okay, okay. So Keith was actually a top qualifier in B division. So not a division, but B division.

[16:35] And that was at Papa 3 in New York City. He also did a doubles tournament with Bowen Carons

[16:41] at Papa 5 and finished in first place. So I mean, he's a pretty decent pinball player, would you say?

[16:47] He is. He's still a pretty decent pinball player. So when you're ingrained in pinball, you tend to sort

[16:53] of build relationships and friends and you chit chat and all that stuff. I'm sure your buddies with

[16:59] all the designers at all the big companies, isn't that right? That's right. You know all of them best

[17:04] friends. You have coffee with Steve Richie. Oh, yeah. Well, my dad and him are like best buddies.

[17:09] At least my dad thinks so. Yeah, I mean, even programmers, right? Your friends with some of

[17:15] the programmers, you bump into them from time to time. They sleep in your spare bedroom.

[17:22] I don't know about that, but yes, I do know programmers, but I knew them before they even started

[17:26] at the company. And that's exactly it, right? As you're ingrained in the hobby, you tend to sort of

[17:31] bleed through the hobby, especially being as small one as it is. Well, back in the 90s,

[17:35] it was a little bit different because we didn't quite have social media as we knew it today.

[17:41] But we did have a program called IRC. Do you remember that, Ron? I think it was internet relay chat

[17:46] or something like that. It was like a weird, huge chat room thing. That was the dark web

[17:52] back in the day. IRC. And Keith says, I started hanging out on an IRC channel with a lot of pinball

[17:59] enthusiasts. At one point, Larry Demar made a comment that Williams were looking for people.

[18:04] And I just asked him, Hey, I might be interested. That was late 97. So I went over to Williams during

[18:10] Expo 97 and met with a bunch of people and talked to them. It was mostly for slots because there

[18:15] weren't any pinball openings at the time. Yeah, so he just wants to get a foot in the door. He's in

[18:20] this chat room IRC dark web with some of the other pinball folk. And that's where he sort of got his

[18:28] foot in the door. Well, Keith will join Williams in March of 1998 in the slot division working

[18:35] on programming the slots and learning the ropes. But he didn't really enjoy it at slots. He really

[18:40] wanted to be in the pinball division. So he used his time there to make friends in the pinball

[18:45] division and build on the relationships he already had from being on the pinball tournament scene

[18:51] with people like Lyman Sheets, Jr. So of course, I've mentioned before, right? Relationships

[18:58] and getting involved in people is how you get ahead in life folks. And Keith knew that and he

[19:03] spent a lot of time getting to know those individuals so that eventually he could shift in to the

[19:09] pinball division. Well, sometimes you just need an opportunity. And that opportunity was finally

[19:16] given in the summer of 1998. So Keith says so what happened was there was a big restructuring.

[19:22] That was in the summer of 98. The spinning wheel division wasn't going to be under Larry's

[19:26] purview anymore. He was going to solely oversee pinball. Lyman asked Larry for me to be on the

[19:32] revenge from Mars team. So they offer me the position and sink or swim with pinball. There wasn't

[19:38] going to be any going back to slot machine if I moved the pinball. But I was like, well, I want

[19:43] to do pinball. Yeah. So I mean the bread and butter at Williams, right? The thing that still like,

[19:50] you know, kept Williams going was that slot division, the spinning wheels, he called it.

[19:56] That was where all the money was made. That's where all the job security was. Pinball was not

[20:01] was not known for its job security, especially in the late 90s, right? Yeah, that was the rough time.

[20:07] Why would you want us to do that? Well, you know, what he wanted to do pinball and he was willing to

[20:12] take the risk. So that brings us to revenge from Mars. The first game that Keith P. Johnson would

[20:20] work on where he'd he'd cut his teeth in pinball programming. This is the original sci-fi theme from

[20:27] January of 1999. It sells 6,878 units. This is using the Williams pinball 2000 platform designed

[20:37] by George Gomez, art by John Yosey Greg Ferris. Now this is where we get into the to the mud here.

[20:44] Animation by a large team, Adam Ryan, Scott Sloan, Jack Lyndon, Scott Sanders and Dave Mueller,

[20:53] sound by Dan Forden and then the software team which was also large and has some of the greats,

[20:59] Lyman Sheets Jr. Dwight Sullivan, Keith P. Johnson and Graham West. Keith mostly worked on the ball

[21:07] movements, you know, created some modes and C++, but he was on the support team. He wasn't like a lead

[21:13] on this game. And this game was a sequel to attack from Mars. Yeah, which is like coveted as being

[21:20] one of the greatest Valley Williams games of all time. One that you have in your basement,

[21:25] isn't that correct? Yep. Do you sometimes sleep under it and just kind of cuddle it a little bit?

[21:30] I don't sleep under my machines. That's weird. Okay, because like a lot of pinball people really,

[21:35] you know, especially the tournament nerds, they really love that game. It's in the basement.

[21:39] It really, really cold floor. That'd be very uncomfortable. This is where Keith Johnson would

[21:43] program his first wizard mode, the final mode in revenge for Mars. So that's where he gets his

[21:50] excitement for wizard modes, maybe in celebration for the release of revenge for Mars in pinball 2000,

[21:57] a bunch of Williams employees coordinated a trip to Disney World. Everyone bought and paid for

[22:03] their tickets right after the launch of revenge for Mars. And they were planning on going on that

[22:08] vacation sometime toward the end of October that year. Well, in October of 1999, everyone was

[22:15] let go at Williams, including Keith. Well, everyone was let go from the Williams pinball division.

[22:20] That's correct. Yeah. So we've talked about this many, many, many times throughout the podcast,

[22:25] the sort of shutdown and collapse of the Williams pinball division. Well, shortly after that

[22:33] shutdown, a lot of those employees went to Disney World with the tickets that they bought six or

[22:38] eight months before that. Can you imagine? Everyone in the pinball division was talking to Midway.

[22:47] Keith, in fact, was talking to Midway as well, but he would turn down that job, but he would end

[22:53] up at a company called Stern. And Midway was the video game division of Williams. Yeah.

[22:59] We're actually, by that point, I think they were WMS industries. Was there official name? Keith

[23:05] says most of us were still hanging out on IRC and Lonnie Robb started showing up. I originally met

[23:10] Lonnie probably back in IFPA 3 in 1993. Then I'd seen him at expose and stuff like that. I just

[23:17] basically asked him if there were any positions, possibly available at Stern. And probably the next

[23:22] week, I was in his office. We talked for about three or four hours. Yeah. So right there, you know,

[23:29] being in sort of the back channel of the dark web of IRC, Keith was able to jump in and chat

[23:36] with Lonnie. So he was able to sort of get himself kind of ahead of the game, even though he was on

[23:43] vacation in Disney World, he was hired right after Dwight Sullivan who didn't go on that vacation.

[23:51] The shift to Stern is something that we've talked a few times, especially in our Dwight Sullivan

[23:55] episode, where it became really connolly the differences between Stern and Williams.

[24:04] I pulled this quote from a top cast interview with Keith Johnson, which was recorded right around

[24:10] the fall of 2008. Yeah. Keith says, I think the biggest joke that Dwight and I had for a long time

[24:17] was that every day we'd see something that made us shake our heads and wonder how they're still in

[24:21] business, meaning Stern. It was just amazing how things came together and got designed,

[24:26] like how things were pushed in at the last minute. It's just remarkable that the engineering that

[24:30] occurred at the last minute actually made it into a finished game. Things just weren't as structured

[24:35] and as planned out as they were Williams. That was kind of the joke, right? Was that everything was

[24:40] an issue string at Stern. Everything was a bit of a bit of a joke. Now around 2008, this is by the

[24:48] time that Keith Johnson was let go at Stern. That context around this interview is also

[24:56] interesting because he does kind of throw a few jabs here and there in that interview about Stern,

[25:02] kind of about how casual and informal it was. Keith came from the Almighty Williams, which I

[25:10] find funny because he was only really there for a year or two. It's just interesting that he has

[25:16] so much knowledge and insight and how the industry should be run by a guy who's only been in the

[25:22] industry for like three years. Keith is a pretty amazing person and we'll see that through there,

[25:27] but there's some context within that interview and his quotes that I think is sort of important to

[25:34] remember when we're going through today's episode. Now, Stryker Extreme was the next game in January

[25:39] of 2000. That's the sports soccer theme. This has an unknown amount of units because there's no

[25:48] need to release those. It's designed by Joe Balls or Art by Kevin O'Connor. It does dots by Kurt

[25:54] Anderson, sound by Kyle Johnson, who worked on a lot of games with Data East and Alvin G and Stern

[26:03] kind of in this era, but has sort of since disappeared. Software was lead by Lonnie Robb,

[26:10] Orin Day and Keith Johnson. So, Keith has to come aboard and learn an entirely new software set,

[26:16] an entirely new industry, entirely new company in the industry because things are run completely

[26:22] different and by the seat of the pants at Stern. Now, this is the first newly designed game at Stern

[26:28] Pinball because it was originally Sega Pinball and that has been sold to Gary Stern.

[26:33] Yep, and that's why there are no production numbers because they are no longer a public company,

[26:38] i.e. Sega, i.e. Data East. They are private and they do not and have not released any other

[26:44] production numbers, which is really annoying. I'd love to know how many Stryker extremes are out there.

[26:49] Or should I say, well, technically, the LEs where they have a set number, they say how many of

[26:54] those there are. Yeah, that's right. We know how many of the top tier ones are, but it's just

[26:58] it's fun to know how many of these pins are out there, but of course that doesn't happen anymore.

[27:03] I don't mind Stryker Extreme. Is it a good one? It's a fun, I think it's a good shooter

[27:09] and it's got, you could tell it's the first Stern game because they plastered Stern everywhere they

[27:13] can. I think the guys wearing a Stern jacket is like Stern. Everything is Stern.

[27:19] And an extreme is spelled with an X. Extreme. Yeah, yeah. Extreme.

[27:24] The X thing is that screams 90s and the 90s everything was extreme. Everything was with an X.

[27:31] Anything that ended with an S was a Z. Yeah, it's Ed. Yep. Now this had a golly toy behind some drop

[27:38] targets. Yep. Reminiscent of a trying to be better, but not better. World Cup Soccer. Yeah, it's not

[27:47] World Cup Soccer now. And they reused the playfield for the NFL game they did, where you could pick

[27:55] what team you wanted and you'd get that and you'd get that one. I know someone who had a New York

[28:00] Giants one and I played that one first and then I played Stryker Extreme like wait a minute.

[28:04] This is the same play field. Yeah, it's got the guy in a play field and he's wearing his Stern,

[28:12] his Stern sweater. Yes, it's Jersey. It's Jersey's got a collar though. It's very, very fancy collar.

[28:21] It's like a very, very, it's got a lot of ball poppers. This game's got like two ball poppers.

[28:26] Doesn't really do it for me. I haven't I haven't seen one of these. I see them for sale from time

[28:31] to time, but this is that arrow. If you've never even played it, boo. I got to boo you on that boo.

[28:38] Because it's just it's just it just doesn't it doesn't. I don't like this picture.

[28:43] I don't like the picture. What is the flyer? I'm sorry. What is Stern going to do for their first game?

[28:48] How they going to promote this? Oh yes, this is this is the this is the dollars sense.

[28:53] There are people on our flyers here. I'm just curious. Oh god. Yes, everything is X X

[29:00] stream earnings, extreme mechanisms, extreme action, and as custom speech available in German,

[29:08] French, Italian and Spanish. Yes, the countries that actually care about soccer.

[29:14] Funny if it said custom speech also available in Australia or something like that. Yeah, yeah.

[29:19] Or Canadian. Yeah, that'd be funny. Yeah, it'd be Canadian. They'd be all like hockey turns. Gold age.

[29:26] He got it in the net there. He said it's getting down there giving 110% in the corners,

[29:30] keeping his elbows up. Instead of saying it would just say score score. Yeah, it has a simulated

[29:36] corner kick, an upper third flipper. That's an up. That's that's a important thing. A throwing shot.

[29:43] It has a three-choice skill shot, a stadium multi-ball release mechanism. It is a dual flipper return

[29:51] while they're advertising the dual flipper returns. That's exciting.

[29:55] Jiffy all countries to gain championship status, then place celebration multi-ball. In other words,

[30:03] beat Germany and then get victory laps. Sounds very familiar. It does. It does. Now the best part about

[30:10] this pinball machine is the Union Jack is misidentified as belonging to England. Oh, that's not right.

[30:18] Yeah, the English the Union Jack is the flag of the United Kingdom, which consists of England,

[30:23] Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. As being part of Irish out offended. You should be. You should be.

[30:29] But isn't that like the like the most powerful part of you, the Italian part? Yeah, it's

[30:35] an attitude and physical appearance, yes. Yes, because when it comes down to it, anybody who's

[30:41] Italian needs to tell you their Italian like a million times. Yeah, I've done that. Oh, like great

[30:46] grandparents are my great grandparents are from Italy. So that that's that's pretty Italian.

[30:51] The next game was Sharky's shootout, which was a billiards theme from September of 2000.

[30:56] And another game I like. Yeah. Oh, God. This is this is the Stern White Star board as well. This

[31:02] one's designed by John Borg, art by John Yosey, dots by Mark Galvez, sound by Kyle Johnson,

[31:08] software again, Lonnie Robt White and Keith P Johnson on on backup there. Now this is a

[31:14] white Johnson and Keith Johnson or Dwight Sullivan and Keith Johnson. Dwight Sullivan.

[31:18] Dwight Sullivan. We need to be informative here. We can't assume people know the names.

[31:22] I'm just going to make this up all my just people people. I'm just going to make anything up here.

[31:27] Now Sharky's shootout was originally supposed to be another game. I can't remember. It was actually

[31:32] for Sega. There's one that exists too. I've seen it. It's literally the same play feel and it's

[31:38] has another woman on it like a celebrity. And people are probably shouting what it is right now.

[31:43] You should know this. You're on silver ball chronicles. I can't remember. Yeah. Back at her and

[31:48] our when we spoke about John Norris, it was originally his game, which ended up sort of going

[31:55] going a ride. And they wanted to make it very much a connected online kind of thing. He did bad

[32:02] girls too. And did you do a cue ball wizard? I know he did bad girls. He must love.

[32:06] Girls. Bad girls is so good. Love girls. It's so good. So this features Jeanette Lee.

[32:12] Yes. So Jeanette Lee was a a pool shark at the time, a professional pool player. So this was

[32:19] kind of like before poker players were the cool thing. It was a very much of a billiards thing.

[32:25] And she was a really big name. She was like the black widow or something. Yeah. She was the

[32:30] biggest. Yeah. Probably male or female star. And she had her own gimmick. Yeah. She was the

[32:35] black widow. She always had the glove on. It's like Michael Jackson. But and it's sharky shootout.

[32:41] We love pool themes. This had the special tournament kit. Right. Which was that experiment that

[32:47] they wanted to do which ended up not going anywhere sadly. Easy to install tournament kit. Oh,

[32:51] they used to turn them in kits for a while. But they were like trying to be like a like golden tea,

[32:56] right? Like that was kind of the one. They would have the extra topper thing that's a tournament

[33:02] play on it. And they would have like some of them had like a beta bright display, like a ticker.

[33:07] And we go across and I thought it was a neat idea. They had like a tournament button. Yeah. This

[33:12] was a this was a really cool game. It was a variation on eight ball deluxe, which for some reason

[33:18] has been done a billion times. But each time was kind of a little bit better. Game features

[33:24] a skillshot, a drain post save, which they trademarked, outlaying post saves, which they trademark.

[33:32] Basically, they're just they're basically just just pop up. Yes. They're just on the outlaw

[33:36] up in the outlets. Seven bank memory drop target. A mystery ball diverter, eight ball and nine ball

[33:42] modes, three multiple modes. Great visible pop action. Because it sucks when your pop action is

[33:49] not visible. Makes you think like you're doing something if you can see. Yes. Like a tag from

[33:54] Mars would be like invisible pop action. Because you don't really see it. The black widow drop

[33:59] target and the web final mode. Yeah. This is Dennis Creasel's favorite stern pinball machine.

[34:06] Did you know that Dennis Creasel of the pinball show? Yes. Award winning. Yes. Pinball show.

[34:15] Because because chill city bay. Yeah. Not bitter. Now he didn't do a whole lot on this game. It was

[34:25] mostly lamp effects. Some of the minor coding and things like that because at this time a lot of

[34:33] the the the stern pinball ethos was just stay alive. Right. So all hands on deck on most of the

[34:41] pinball machines. Everybody can do as much as you can to get it out the door as fast as you can.

[34:47] But one game where Keith got a little more fun. Little more to do was high roller casino by John

[34:54] Norris. And this was of course of course from 2001. Art by John Yoseen Kevin O'Connor dots by

[35:02] Mark Galvez, sound by Kyle Johnson, software by Keith P Johnson, Lonnie Rob and Dwight Sullivan.

[35:10] The slot machine with the dot matrix display reel in here is very cool. Yes. My co-host for my

[35:18] other podcast. The slam which podcast. My co-host Bruce Nutt and Gale loves this game. He loves

[35:27] high roller casino. Where would you rank high roller casino amongst casino games?

[35:35] I came in answer. There's so many. There is a lot of them. But there's a lot of stuff in here. There is

[35:43] Be a winner with high roller casino game features. Crap. That doesn't sound like a slot machine. Roulette poker high low and blackjack 21.

[35:56] Oh, these flyers are very uninspired. Very uninspired. Where is the cool like it's industry defining going to change the world

[36:04] all that. Where is that? There's none of that. There's none of that. It is it is literally like tell them what's

[36:09] in the game. Just move on to the next thing. Point at point at the the the mechs and stuff. There's no animated role in

[36:18] wind wheel. Pick your prize. The slot machine ramp capture thing there is pretty unique. That's a

[36:26] pretty unique toy because it's it's the first one with sort of like the dot matrix display in the

[36:31] play field. Kind of not in the physical play field. But on like under the glass. It's really cool.

[36:38] Yeah, they used to they don't really use that anymore. That would be kind of cool if they did. I mean,

[36:43] they used it for what Star Wars. They had the LCD. The little screen. That's a Jersey Jack thing where they

[36:48] where they take mechs out and they just put a bigger bigger iPad in. That's kind of their thing now.

[36:54] What about so if this is Bruce Knight and Gales who didn't finish anywhere on the pinball awards.

[37:02] If this is his favorite game, would you classify it as one of yours up there too? Yeah. Really? Wow. That

[37:07] was really quick. I didn't even get an all that one. That's one of the many games we disagree about. Wow.

[37:14] Mark that went down folks. Now Keith would say that programming on the white star system compared

[37:20] obviously to the William system was incredibly tough. Things like trying to cycle coils,

[37:26] you know, dim lights, blank lights, coordinate sounds was incredibly incredibly difficult.

[37:33] And that's where he really draws the line in the sand saying it's really, really hard to program

[37:41] on this system. Keith said that system was basically written in the laser war era when Daddy's first

[37:46] started out. It was like original 6803 code. As time goes on, more and more gets added, but a lot

[37:52] of the code was the same. It's like band aids and band aids on band aids. I thought I could be

[37:57] wrong with this. I thought the white star system was primarily just like an assembly. Yeah. So it was

[38:02] done in C++ I think. I thought it was assembly. I thought he had just ones and zeros, baby. Yeah. Yeah.

[38:08] But that was the biggest thing. The other thing was that, you know, when you we've got this technology

[38:12] that started at Daddy East and it's moved into Sega announced moved into Stern. There's been

[38:17] restructures and people have left and come in. So a lot of the knowledge that is built on like,

[38:22] oh, the reason we program like this on this system is because of this legacy issue that happened,

[38:28] you know, 15 years ago. Well, a lot of those people had left. So Keith spent most of this time

[38:34] trying to reinvent and relearn how this board set works because he didn't he wasn't happy

[38:40] getting what he was getting out of it. Keith is an amazing person because he wants to push himself

[38:44] further and he wanted to push the technology further. So he had to he had to learn more. The system

[38:49] was somewhat limiting. But to be fair, it was also very reliable. White star was a very reliable

[38:56] system. Yeah, I don't I mean, what was the weak point in there? Some of the drivers maybe if

[39:02] a coil got stuck on, but that was really it. I mean, the thing that always bug me about those

[39:05] systems is Williams used triax so they could like dim the lights in cool ways and do stuff like that.

[39:13] Like Daddy East Sega Stern, it was just relays. It's either off or on. Click, click, click. Keith

[39:20] wanted to make sure that he could do more with it. He wanted to make more. He wanted to push it

[39:25] further and harder. And he wanted to make a better game. And the system was limiting him. So he

[39:31] had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to manipulate that system to do what it wanted

[39:35] to do. That's why Keith Johnson, the awesome person. He's not happy with just mediocre. He wants

[39:41] to make things amazing. The next game that he worked on, he only worked on support with this one.

[39:46] This was Austin Powers. This is the licensed comedy spy movie theme, June of 2001. This is another

[39:53] white star system. This is designed by John Borg and Lonnie Rob. The software here, Lonnie Rob was

[39:59] the lead. Keith did a lot of the support on it. As mentioned, he did a lot of the display effects,

[40:04] the blinking of the lights and the, you know, the, the DMD sort of coordination stuff. He removed a

[40:11] lot of the quotes that Mike Myers didn't necessarily want as well as some of the visuals that they

[40:17] did an approve of from the movie theater company or the movie company, the film company. For example,

[40:26] there was a match animation that was the scene in the tent from the second Austin Powers movie where

[40:32] they're like doing the thing with the shadow. Do you remember that? I never saw the second one.

[40:36] Oh man, that's the best one. I didn't see the second or third one. The second one's the best one.

[40:42] Well, there's a part where there's like a light behind somebody and you can see their shadows.

[40:46] And they're putting things in and out of Austin's butt. And that was where the match animation

[40:53] would come out of. There was also a bonus X animation with a lot of vagina where she would have

[41:01] her silhouette and she would take off her bra. But a lot of that was not approved by the movies.

[41:07] You know, IP holder and it was all removed. Apparently, there's a homerom that exists with these

[41:14] animations, but nobody knows where it is. You like Austin Powers though, right? It's great game.

[41:19] It shoots good. And man, they used it for stuff later on. It's got the crossbow that was used

[41:26] later. And walking dead, it has the the time machine, which is basically the ring and Lord of the

[41:34] Rings. Yes, that's right. And they also reuse that in Russia. Reuse the toilet.

[41:39] It's from, I think that's the South Park toilet. Yes, yes. It had the it had the coolest spinner ever.

[41:48] It did, which was actually the mini me toy. Now, I've never played one where he wasn't broken.

[41:54] His feet always get ripped off, but it's still cool. Now Keith really started to flat out run

[42:01] with the Simpsons pinball party from February of 2003. This is the licensed cartoon theme on

[42:08] the Stern White Star board set. This was designed by Joel Balser, but Keith Johnson also had a lot

[42:15] of input into this design. Art by Kevin O'Connor and Margaret Hudson, Dots by Mark Galvez,

[42:22] Sound by Dan Fordon, and the master Chris Granter, and software, the only person on this, the real

[42:28] main lead, Keith P. Johnson. So they got a little extra time on designing this game. And you can

[42:34] certainly tell that it was a big, big deal. Simpsons certainly benefited from the extra time.

[42:40] It was the game I had the most time to work on. It was longer than the normal game time.

[42:46] And that, and that quote was probably from Topcast, right? Yes, I think he had more time to do some

[42:52] of his future games we'll be talking about. If you look at all those other games, right? The turnovers

[42:56] were like months trying to get those games out there working, you know, a bunch of people on games

[43:03] at once. Well, right around this time, sort of the philosophy had changed a little bit at Stern,

[43:08] right? They were opening up a little bit more to the homeowner purchasing games, not just the bars.

[43:16] And the style of games certainly did change. Yeah, not according to Gary Stern, though.

[43:22] They did not acknowledge the homeowner for quite a while after this.

[43:26] And they still really try to struggle on that. That, that, you know, they don't necessarily talk

[43:32] about the homeowner. Yeah, I would say it was probably after Jersey Jack came around,

[43:38] around, and around maybe 2012 or after that Stern finally, acknowledge the home buyer.

[43:45] Yeah, one of the biggest controversies of this game, Ron, was that the speech was done by Nancy

[43:52] Cartwright, Hank Azera, and Dan Castanelta. Oh my god. Okay, I think it's spelled wrong. I

[44:00] believe it's Dan Castanelta, Nancy Cartwright, and a Hank Azera. Right. Yes. That's where most of

[44:08] the speech was like controversial. No, but everybody was angry because they were all sort of the male

[44:13] characters. There were no female characters. And there was no Lisa. There was no Marge. Well, the

[44:18] thing is remember, this was in 2003. And it's when the voice actors for this show were getting

[44:24] an obscene amount of money. And there was no way they were going to be able to afford all of them.

[44:29] So they decided they needed Homer because he was the star of the show by that point. And you need

[44:34] Bart. So you get Dan Castanelta and then you get Nancy Cartwright. So who are you going to get

[44:40] and you can afford one more? So are you going to get Marge Simpson, Patty and Selma?

[44:47] Are you going to get Lisa? Because there's just one woman who does her voice. Or are you going to

[44:52] get Hank Azera? It does like about six or seven different people. Right. He does comic book guy,

[44:57] he does a poo. He does me. Christy, I'm in the game, you know. Yes. This, I owned this game. This

[45:04] was the, the second sort of major pinball machine that I owned. I put probably two thousand plays on

[45:10] this game. I played this game a lot. Did you ever get to the super duper mega extreme wizard mode?

[45:16] No, I did. Because Keith Johnson didn't design this game for me. Keith Johnson designed this game

[45:21] for him and bear Enbow and Karen's. But I did cheat as much as I could. So I put it on five ball

[45:27] for a very long time. After I had gotten to a certain point where I was just banging my head against

[45:33] it, we'll talk about that in a minute. But let's dive into the flyer here. Yeah, they had the actual

[45:40] art crew from the show. Didn't a lot of the art. Yeah, which I'm shocked. It looks great.

[45:46] Wonderful. It looks fabulous. Even Bart says looking fabulous. I can't do part. Fabulous

[45:55] underachiever and proud of it to use a early quote. It was packed. This game was packed. It had a lot of stuff.

[46:01] The stuff they reused a lot of this stuff for the Simpson's Kooky Carnival Redemption game they did later on.

[46:06] There's so much stuff in this game. And this game has a lot of amazing bits and pieces, but it also

[46:11] has a lot of like frustrating annoying stuff to it. It has five flippers. Five flippers. So it's got

[46:19] your regular two at the bottom on your Italian bottom right outlaying in lane and two flippers at

[46:24] the bottom with your slings. Then it's got pops really close on the left side. It's got drop

[46:31] targets on the on the right side. Both the capture hole behind it, which is your itchy and scratchy shot.

[46:36] It has a really wonderful orbit with a spinner on it on the right side into a captive ball on the

[46:43] right side with with Bart on a skateboard, which is really cool. And it has the ramp really kind of

[46:49] like the only actual has a side ramp. You just never hit it. No, I'll get into that a minute. I'll get

[46:55] in. It has a garage. You'll be hitting that a lot. Yes, then there's the garage in the middle,

[47:00] which is actually a really cool little bash toy. You bash it. It flips open like a garage door.

[47:05] And there's a mini ramp in behind that that goes up over into a vertical upkicker. So it pops

[47:10] the ball up to the most amazing upper play field to ever be designed. I'm saying it. I'm saying it.

[47:17] It's good. I'll say I even I'll say that. It's amazing. Two flippers. Loop shot in weird positions.

[47:24] A TV thing with a display, another ramp to a couch.

[47:30] A couch lock. Oh my goodness. I love this game. And if you don't flip, it goes down kind of this

[47:36] metal monorail thing down to your right flipper. Then underneath that is kind of like the

[47:43] Quikimart shot, which is like a weird loop shot, a little bit like the Deadpool colossus shot.

[47:50] Isn't that the guy that's under the under the ramp? Then there's the worst design side ramp

[47:58] ever in you can hit it good for you. It is terrible. It's steep and it's a sharp turn.

[48:07] And it's in a weird location. It should have been further down the play field and had more of a

[48:13] point. The funny thing is if you disable the garage, that's the shot you have to hit to get

[48:16] up to the upper play field. Good luck. But worse is that is that shot is so critical to getting

[48:22] really far in the game. And it's so excruciatingly frustratingly terrible. And people are like,

[48:30] well, you got to get better at pinball. Or there's lots of players that are pretty good at that.

[48:35] Well, you know what, we're not all Travis Mury and we're not all Bowen Carrons. Like, give me a break

[48:41] here. Terrible design. Travis will be happy to use this name with Bowen. Yeah. Travis is pretty

[48:48] awesome. He's a good dude. Did you know he finished third at in disk? Yes, I did. He's a big deal.

[48:58] Did you know there's silos on this game? The silos pop umpricer silos, which is a holdover from

[49:03] the original Simpson spinball machine. And I love I love shots orbit shots through pops.

[49:09] That I'm a sucker for that. You got that in Tron. I'm a big, big, big sucker for that. And this

[49:15] game I think does it really, really well. It's very fun. This is one of the best games I think

[49:21] Stern has ever made. Even though it has that terrible crippling shot. But there's a lot of really

[49:29] cool bits and pieces in here. But the best thing, the thing that makes it is it sold a lot. You know,

[49:33] they did a ton of runs of these things. They did a god at least five, six runs of this game.

[49:39] They could run it again today and still sell a boatload of them guaranteed. But the you know,

[49:46] the problems that Joe Balser did with his you know design of the play field. The couple of things

[49:52] that don't necessarily work in there. And that's kind of the story of Joe Balser anyway, right? He's

[49:58] like the king of clunk. Wow. It was the code. It was the code that made this game something special.

[50:06] And that's all on Keith Johnson. What do you think of the code on this game? You stack everything.

[50:11] You stay. This is where the everything is lit. Everything is blinking.

[50:15] As many modes as possible. Then you get in a multi-bond. Literally every shot's lit.

[50:19] And every shot is a jackpot. It's so deep. It'll take you 45 minutes if you're good to get to the

[50:23] wizard bone. It takes you for it. Okay. So let's let's break down the parts of the play field.

[50:29] And alien invasion is awesome. Even I will admit that. Alien invasion is something else. So let's

[50:33] break this down piece by piece. We're going to look at the play field here. Can you tell that David

[50:39] really likes this game? I love this game. We're not talking about sharky shooting here. We're

[50:44] talking about the Simpsons. Let's say I'd like the fact that Keith Johnson took the fact that this

[50:48] game stops the ball a ton and use that for alien invasion or you have to park balls all over the

[50:54] play field brilliant brilliant. So the way it starts is that there's there's multiple different like

[51:01] mini wizard modes. This is kind of where the mini wizard mode was kind of born.

[51:06] Right. Keith was able to bend this machine's code in a way that made it really interesting.

[51:12] So you've got like itchy and scratchy. So there's four itchy and scratchy modes.

[51:17] You shoot the drop targets and you lock the ball in the scoop behind it or the the the saucer.

[51:23] And those are all different um multi balls. So you do all of those and then you get to a special

[51:29] little wizard mode. It's not the final wizard mode. It's just a special wizard mode.

[51:33] Now on the left orbit through the pops you can get to pretzel multi ball where I think there's

[51:39] like 25 of the clearest kids. You got to shoot that 25 times and you get to pretzel multi ball which

[51:47] I never got to even on five balls even when I was like I'm not going to do anything but shoot the

[51:52] left orbit. I still never got there because it's a tough shot. Then you've got

[52:00] Bart Simpson modes right targets loops bumpers and ramps. So then when you do that you get to

[52:08] God what is that mode called. You get to another mode. I can't. I don't ask me. This is the problem.

[52:16] See this is the problem with the game. Now the most fun one is when you get to the right spot.

[52:23] No. What's the one where they go with the backwards flippers. Oh yeah it does reverse. Yeah.

[52:31] The right flippers the left flipper. Left flippers the right flipper. Yeah so you got to collect all

[52:35] the all the shots for that. Then the upper play field has its shots right. So you've got different

[52:41] modes and I think this is probably the best part of the game. You've got Duffman which is shoot

[52:46] Duffman ramp. You've got and every time you shoot it it's got the amazing Duffman. Duffman.

[52:53] Oh my god it's amazing. I guess Homer is it's Dan Kestelana. I didn't know. Yeah see I told you

[53:00] that's weird. Yeah so there's Homer's day and the most brilliant part of this is that the shots

[53:06] correspond to Homer's day. So Homer starts his day at the power plant so you got to shoot the pops

[53:12] and then he leaves work and he goes to the bar so you got to shoot the most ramp shot. Then he

[53:18] drives home which is terrible and you go to the garage and you go up and you watch television

[53:25] and you sit on the couch. Most tab like most speaking. Oh Homer's right man. There's wh-

[53:33] there's Willie's woes where you got it where you have to shoot the bully and then take him to the

[53:39] school. There's Wigham and the snake where you chase around snake around the playfield and his

[53:44] shots change. He is one of my favorite quotes ever where he steals he steals a VCR and he looks at it

[53:51] oh no beta no one will get that anymore but it was hilarious at the time take take my word for it.

[53:58] Bart's Day that's another mode so what's really neat about this is before this era before this

[54:06] game most of this things were like shoot this shot four times and something happens and shoot this

[54:11] shot six times and something happens. Now we're getting into kind of mode based games that have

[54:18] objectives but like on steroids. Yeah you had those before but yeah this this one this is one of

[54:24] your original super deep games that's going to take you 45 plus minutes to get through.

[54:32] Crusty's last stand you shoot the crusty spinner like stop the monorail so you got to take the

[54:39] monorail ramp a bunch of times so you do all of those and then you get to alien invasion which is one

[54:43] of the greatest mini wizard modes of all time so basically you get two you get a two ball multi

[54:49] ball you got to lock both of those balls then it releases the two balls and it gives you a third ball

[54:53] out of the out of the out of the auto launcher. Today you got three balls in play you got to lock all

[54:57] three balls somewhere out the playfield then when you lock all three of those it gives you the three

[55:01] balls back plus a fourth ball and it does that till like five balls or something and you lock all

[55:06] five of them and it is so much fun but playing alien invasion is not where you get all your points

[55:13] where you get all your points is is you try to start every one of those modes you try to start

[55:19] all of the multi balls and you just try to start all of the hurry ups and then everything just

[55:24] gets lit and crazy and you're doing quadruple jackpots and it's it's crazy but it's sort of

[55:31] like if you eat candy every single day it starts to become not that tasty after a while you know

[55:38] and then when you can't get to the super duper mega extreme wizard mode which is completing all

[55:43] of those modes all of the other multi balls all of the and you have to complete them too you can't

[55:48] just sort of do feel like you finish yeah and you have to have so during the coach multi balls so

[55:53] if you get up there and you get on the couch you lock three balls on the couch you have to shoot

[55:57] I think it's four jackpots then go back up on the couch to get a super if you need to get five

[56:02] supers before you can even get to that final wizard mode by the way that's what Jonas was talking

[56:07] about you said coach what I didn't hear that you're looking crazy so one of the other things that

[56:13] this game really um struggles with is the fact that it is bash the garage door all day yeah

[56:23] shoot the garage up to the coach shoot the garage up to the coach over and over and over now it

[56:29] is fun but once you get about a thousand games in the home environment you start to go I think I

[56:35] want to move this pin on and then by the time you get to 1500 you're like well this was fun

[56:42] what do you say uh I never I again it's play field first and I just never like the way shot

[56:49] with the exception of the upper play field you deal with the play field because the code is so good

[56:54] now imagine if the play field were amazing and the code were amazing that brings us to lord of the rings

[57:03] the licensed fantasy movie epic theme December of 2003 uh I think we generally kind of know that

[57:13] this sold around five thousand units and I think that was spilled by George Gomez in a podcast years

[57:19] ago I think it was in the top game they had like oh god another one they had six or seven different

[57:23] runs and they had the LE later on just went forever it's another one of those pins that just went

[57:27] forever and I think I remember interview I think it was Gary Stern they they had to choose I think

[57:33] it was either lord of the rings or on matrix like one of them would have been one of the one of the

[57:38] sequels god yeah well it wasn't the original matrix it would have been like the matrix two or

[57:42] three whatever the hell they were up to at the time yep and a and Gary he he said lord of the rings

[57:52] this is considered to be like one of the greatest pinball machines of all time is it not it's good

[57:57] designed by George Gomez and Keith P Johnson it's got art by Jerry van der Stelt Kevin O'Connor

[58:03] Margaret Hudson dots by Mark Galvez sound by Chris Granger and the software Keith P Johnson so he's

[58:09] working on these this game and the Simpson sort of kind of overlapping towards the end of the Simpsons

[58:15] but this is the greatest fan layout of all time no I mean that's that's attack for Mars that's

[58:20] attack for Mars yes this this one I'm sorry that left ramp that kind of goes half up and then comes

[58:25] back down at you that that disqualifies it or or the uh golem shot where you hit it in a lot of

[58:29] times it just blows through it doesn't it won't stick yeah yeah that's true that's true but you know

[58:34] the greatest fantasy of all time is now an epic pinball machine for all ages wow yes look at that

[58:43] it's a wonderful wonderful game now I've played when I first got into pinball you know you're kind

[58:48] of looking up like great games or whatever and Lord of the Rings always kind of floated to the top

[58:52] it was always at the top it was always like people are like oh Lord of the Rings is so great

[58:55] and this and that and I was like oh gee whiz you know like I wonder what's so great about Lord of the

[58:59] Rings and then I had a friend of mine who purchased one and I was over uh to you know his way for

[59:05] summer vacation one time and I'm like hey I'm gonna come over he's like I gotta come over and

[59:09] play Lord of the Rings and then I played it for 20 minutes and you saw the ring and you said wait a

[59:13] minute wasn't at the time machine and Austin powers so I played it and I played it for 20 minutes

[59:20] and I was a god yeah pretty much most people were gods when they played this game and I was like oh I

[59:25] get it now everybody feels amazing when they play this game and that is the structure of this game

[59:32] because it is a fan layout it's a fan of fan layouts it's got a couple of diverters

[59:37] which are really cool that sort of you know make the ball go in a different direction than you're

[59:42] expecting and it's got a lot of toys and mechs it has a ball rock the ball rock that's that pops out

[59:49] in front and we'll get into that in just a second because that caused some tension there

[59:53] but does Keith Johnson think this is the greatest layout of all time well Keith says it wasn't the

[59:58] Lord of the Rings play field that I would have liked to have seen I wanted you to be able to hit

[01:00:02] the black gates and have them open up and shoot into more door that kind of thing you can't

[01:00:08] argue with the success the game had I personally have more fun shooting simpsons than I do have

[01:00:12] shooting Lord I'd want more ball interactive devices so Keith Johnson likes shooting the simpsons

[01:00:18] more than shooting Lord of the Rings but yes but but he is a much better player than I am

[01:00:25] and he could probably hit that side right and it has possibly greatest callouts ever I mean it's

[01:00:30] up there oh I mean I don't know man those simpsons call it John Reese Davies and they got what's his face

[01:00:36] who was who was the other star because they got him too Elijah Wood I do not know the way

[01:00:42] or whatever the hell he says I don't know what's any of his quotes but I mean they were done for the

[01:00:47] game but all the Jack yeah he's so good so good John Reese Davies God bless him did he pass away

[01:00:55] recently I think you're thinking Christopher Lee because he's in the game too yeah wow these

[01:00:59] right his scenes from the movie are in there the man with the golden gun the man with the golden

[01:01:04] gun yes the bow rock this fair is bound and he'll do oh wait a minute I have to read both stuff

[01:01:15] now you have to read more stuff to me I want to raise join us on patreon to support the show

[01:01:43] jump on up to the $6 a month premium crony level really you're gonna kill it crony

[01:01:48] want all the other perks and the shirt after three months join us at $20 a month and you can be an

[01:01:55] elite-tissed crony oh my so good so wonderful game I really like this I'm not gonna get into like

[01:02:03] too much fawning over this one because I did that on the Simpsons already but the fan layout on this

[01:02:08] I think keeps that ball flowing in a nice way but the bow rock bash toy comes out all the time so

[01:02:17] in the middle there's this jump ramp with a spinner on it that goes into that magnetic ring that

[01:02:22] sort of makes the ball hover and ball rod comes out to cover that up and he's he's like this big

[01:02:28] I don't know fire demon with a whip of some sort there was a lot of tension around this ball

[01:02:33] rock programming between Keith and Gary sir Gary wanted it to come out more Gary wanted it to

[01:02:40] be out all the time because if he was spending the money to put this in the game he wanted it to

[01:02:45] be out all the time and Keith didn't want it to be out all the time because that ruined the flow

[01:02:50] of the game and it was annoying and Gary won because Gary owns the company the best thing I think

[01:02:56] about that story is George Gomez who did the playfield really didn't know anything about Lord of

[01:03:02] the Rings and he had no idea what the thing was he just caught it like you know that that monster

[01:03:07] thing that comes out like the ball rod say it George say it right but I mean George at this time

[01:03:15] George Gomez with at this time was just spending all of his time sort of on contract doing a

[01:03:19] playfield and sending it in yeah he's working for midway at the time and that and that was it right

[01:03:23] like everybody else did everything else this and and George will tell you that this is Keith's

[01:03:29] baby Keith is the one that made this game as great as it is another testament to how amazing

[01:03:34] Keith is and how great he is he doesn't half ask anything he went all in on this one too can you

[01:03:40] talk a little bit about the code yes it's it's very deep and it's another one it takes like 45

[01:03:45] minutes to get to the end so it's long super mega long all times because it's really hard to lose

[01:03:51] because there's no real dangerous shots they all kind of returned to the flipper we have many

[01:03:56] wizard modes we have like to destroy the ring what it was the other one there and back again

[01:04:01] then the final wizard mode is Valor Valor Valor Valor Valor Valor Valor

[01:04:05] Valor multi ball so it's like it there's all these different moving pieces to this so one of them

[01:04:10] is every shot on the game has has a character attached to it and you shoot every shot in the game

[01:04:17] and you collect the fellowship of the ring and you get fellowship of the ring multi ball and then

[01:04:22] the next thing is you have to shoot the tower in the back a bunch of times the falling tower and

[01:04:27] then you start two towers multi ball and then there's there's like on on the play field as well

[01:04:36] there are all the different species so there's like elves and man and dwarf and you collect all of

[01:04:44] those on the shots and then you start return of the king multi ball but then there's also the gifts

[01:04:50] of the elves which is kind of on the left orbit whereas like two times scoring and and ring

[01:04:57] multi ball and you get big points it's like the it's like the the gifts or the the bonus or the what

[01:05:03] do they call that I the the mystery awards oh I don't know I don't know half the things about this

[01:05:10] game because I just I just go for the multi balls and play multi balls that's what I do so the first

[01:05:15] time I play the first time I played it it was like I played three games on the third game I played

[01:05:19] for 30 minutes and almost destroyed the ring which is the first wizard mode and this is a person

[01:05:25] who hadn't been playing pinball for a long time I felt like a god the Canadian assassin you never know

[01:05:30] when he hits you with a hockey stick I remember watching an old documentary on pinball and they were

[01:05:36] talking about how the 90s pins went too far with code and how things were too crazy well this is

[01:05:41] something else now they did get to the point where the ball times were very long but they're making

[01:05:47] pins for home now aren't they no not according to Gary Stern they're not so you're going to have

[01:05:52] somebody on location who just paid 75 cents or 50 cents 50 cents back then yeah it'd be on this

[01:05:58] game for 40 minutes yeah yeah making any money on that well in our Steve Richie episode the

[01:06:03] Mullet years we talked about Elvis this was a all hands on deck game as well where Keith sort of

[01:06:10] tried to finish everything up with everybody else you can get more detail on Elvis in that Steve

[01:06:16] Richie episode but I did find a wonderful Keith quote for this that Keith says I think for the

[01:06:21] casual player there wasn't enough it wasn't easy with what we had originally done to hear the different

[01:06:27] songs he thought he made it too hard for the casuals but not fun enough for the hard cores

[01:06:35] that Keith next big big game was also another Steve Richie game called world poker tour and we

[01:06:42] cover that one in the Steve Richie episode as well but this is another example of some crazy

[01:06:49] crazy deep code after world poker anything you want to add with world poker tour um not really I

[01:06:57] think I said everything I was going to say about it in the Steve Richie episode yeah and I mean

[01:07:02] we can't we're not going to do it justice because we got a bunch of other things to cover here

[01:07:05] because it it requires a lot to go into in that Steve Richie episode where we talk about world

[01:07:12] poker tour that's where we do the deep deep dive and and with with code is amazing as Keith Johnson's

[01:07:17] code you know we we we can't just reiterate that over and over again go back and listen to that one

[01:07:21] of the archives you can check those out at silverballcronicles.com and the archives or in your pod catcher

[01:07:28] you can go back through the silverball chronicles feed to listen to that Steve Richie episode

[01:07:34] family guy we covered this one in the pat law or episode that's a little favorite of mine

[01:07:40] this one was it was was definitely a bit of a tug and pull and push when it came to pat

[01:07:46] law or in Keith Johnson because there's a lot of silliness not so family friendly stuff and that's

[01:07:52] not really a pat lawlers. No I don't he didn't really want to do this one. Now one of the more

[01:07:58] controversial titles that Keith Johnson worked on was Wheel of Fortune. Now why would why would

[01:08:03] that be controversial? Because it was a game based on murder. No no it's not. No it is. Yeah it's

[01:08:10] the game show theme from the TV show. Yeah I remember when this came out some of the complaints were

[01:08:16] the fact that it like no one in Europe I guess knows what Wheel of Fortune is. And that was a big

[01:08:21] market for stir. Yeah so they were just like what is this? The same thing with like NASCAR that's

[01:08:25] why they made a grand prix for the European version but I guess just Wheel of Fortune wasn't a thing

[01:08:30] over there and it was never finished. It was never finished we're still waiting on that wizard mode.

[01:08:35] Yeah I get there's an insert that like never lights up. Oh that's sad. Although I did hear there

[01:08:40] is a more complete version of it in existence. He just need to know the right people to get a hold of

[01:08:46] it. You got to get in there. That's all I say. That's all I say. Well the next game that Keith would

[01:08:53] work on at Stern was Indiana Jones. He would work on this with Lonnie Rob. This was designed by John

[01:08:59] Borg Keith John's I'm sorry Kevin O'Connor on art dots by Mark Galvez and sound by the legend

[01:09:07] David Thiel. Now this is based on the movie we don't talk about and all of the other all the

[01:09:14] other ones that we actually love. Yeah it'll be the it'll be one of the two ones we don't talk about

[01:09:19] in another couple of us. Yeah that's right so Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal

[01:09:23] Skull is the fourth sadly Indiana Jones movie where he fights aliens. Yes folk aliens. The aliens

[01:09:32] he doesn't fight them and they don't come into the end of the movie spoilers he's fighting Russians

[01:09:38] this time. But it's it's worse because it's like it's there's no Nazis and it's after it's got

[01:09:44] Shaila LaBuff and it's it was directed by Steven Spielberg. So this next one that's coming up soon

[01:09:51] is not directed by Steven Spielberg so you know it's probably going to be even worse. So it's

[01:09:54] it's so bad but the thing is this game was the ultimate grind of a pin. Now that's very un-Keefe

[01:10:01] Johnson like. Yeah this this was definitely more of a Lonnie Rob game. This is definitely more of a

[01:10:07] Lonnie Rob game and it's it's a shoot this shot this many times kind of game. It's just grind,

[01:10:14] grind, grind, grind. To be fair to be fair I will say I I saw this game once in a it was in an

[01:10:22] environment where we had a lot of non pinball players there and this was the one they played

[01:10:27] the most by far. Really they love seeing the arc thing open they liked all the movie clips

[01:10:35] they totally loved this game. Now we're going to get into another John Borg episode here

[01:10:41] sometime this year and and we'll really get into the bro of flow and how he's able to make his

[01:10:48] games flow really well. Did you just say the bro of flow? That's that's what that's what that's what

[01:10:54] John Borg his nickname is the bro of flow. He drives a BMX bike. He smokes he plays guitar. He's

[01:11:03] really good at singing rush. He's the bro of flow my friend. It's a great little fan layout but

[01:11:09] it's just it's just it's just it's just grindy and the art is the terrible is not inspired. It's so

[01:11:15] terrible. It's a big for people who didn't like Jurassic Park with a map you don't know what a bad

[01:11:22] map looks like watch look at this thing. It's terrible is is is not good. It's well worth your time

[01:11:28] to look it up it's well worth your time to play it is fun it is fun to shoot the arc toy is really cool.

[01:11:33] It's got a scoop because John Borg just goes ape shit for scoops. Oh swearing. Oh it's got a magnet.

[01:11:39] It's got a magnet in front of the arc because he loves to put magnets in front of bash toys. Yep.

[01:11:43] And later we'd repurpose this arc and make it the toy box for arosmith. Oh yeah. I don't think it's

[01:11:50] exact copy but I'm sure they're pretty close similar elements on how the meck works because I

[01:11:54] think there's a little platform thing or little that right raises up what and all the balls just fall

[01:11:59] out. It's just like they do on arosmith. It's a great little game. We'll cover this in more detail

[01:12:04] during that episode coming up in the future but CSI was the last game that Keith would work on

[01:12:11] and this of course was worked it was in all hands on deck pat lawler were pat lawler left halfway

[01:12:16] through it and everybody was canned and lineman finished it up with Lonnie but Keith was let go.

[01:12:24] Yeah and this is the one that I think it is the three main multi balls and each was done by it

[01:12:30] either one was done by Lonnie Rob, another one was done by Lyme Sheets and another one was done by Keith Johnson.

[01:12:34] Yes it was one of those like can you guess which guy did which one? Yeah I'm assuming the really

[01:12:39] long one where you have to lock balls is Keith's. So the 2008 downturn we've touched on this a few

[01:12:46] times and almost you know the death of Stern and this is something we'll bring up in our pinball

[01:12:51] is dying series in much more detail but Keith was laid off during the 2008 downturn in October

[01:12:59] of 2008 it was around this time that Keith recorded the top cast episode where most of the quotes

[01:13:06] came from our episode and he was fresh off leaving Stern and he didn't pull any punches now he

[01:13:16] wasn't you know overly mean or anything but the best thing I think about Keith Johnson is that

[01:13:21] he's a straight shooter he doesn't play politics he doesn't goof around he will tell you exactly what

[01:13:26] he's thinking at exactly that time and I commend him for that but you can tell he was definitely

[01:13:31] hurt by being laid off in 2008 Keith would say I would say slightly over 50% of the overhead staff

[01:13:38] was cut and then the people that remained took an additional pay cut I took I think a 10% pay cut in

[01:13:43] August like pretty much everyone that worked there yeah it was very clear that there were some

[01:13:48] struggles happening in manufacturing over the summer at Stern especially in this time sales did

[01:13:54] drop off in the summer because everybody is out and about they're not in the bar playing pinball

[01:13:59] and and you know they're not staying at home playing pinball they're out and about now in the fall

[01:14:05] winter and spring that's the different story so they tend to sell more pins at that time so

[01:14:09] people you know taking time off or or having a pay cut in the summer months is not unusual except

[01:14:15] it was particularly big around this time but this is again where Gary Stern did some interviews

[01:14:21] and he was actually complaining about various things and one of those things was ball times

[01:14:27] oh yeah Keith's code was specifically you know focused on games that happen to have long ball times

[01:14:35] if you're out there and you're trying to sell pins outside of the home to collect money and

[01:14:40] generate money Keith's code games are probably not the ones that you want to have on location right

[01:14:46] they play really long they play really long to really complicated you know we just try to explain

[01:14:51] the Simpsons and Lord of the Rings I own the Simpsons I can't even remember how to play the code

[01:14:55] so it's playing too long on pinball machines is not going to generate money so if you're going to let

[01:15:00] somebody go in your programming department it's probably the guy who makes the games the play too long

[01:15:05] we're also moving into the home market versus operators right right so so if if if if why would it

[01:15:12] matter then how long the code is then you want longer playing games for code don't you

[01:15:17] but people weren't necessarily playing pinball today like they were in the 90s and it was very

[01:15:23] apparent for that for all of the designers and programmers and this wasn't lost on Keith he wasn't

[01:15:29] he wasn't ignorant to that he understood but pinball was not the same anymore well Keith said

[01:15:35] pinballs don't earn I don't think it's because good players play on them too long I think it's

[01:15:40] general lack of appeal yeah so I mean not pulling any punches he's basically saying hey

[01:15:47] it's not my code that's turning people off because it plays too long it's the fact that nobody's

[01:15:51] playing pinball and I probably partly agree with that after the 2008 mass firings in the 2009

[01:15:59] expo I remember Gary talking about how we got to get the games playing shorter yeah that's where we're

[01:16:06] getting into tron we're getting into iron man yeah iron man you got the NBA big buck hunter

[01:16:15] yeah let's get some coins back in these things for the operators right so there's a significant

[01:16:19] philosophy change at around 2008 now there's moves being made in the industry around this time

[01:16:27] and Keith would say that he's personally not very optimistic about the long term health of stern

[01:16:34] this was in 2008 I personally am not very optimistic about the long term health of stern when we got

[01:16:39] the 10% pay cuts in august I pretty much made up my mind then I was going to have to leave and I

[01:16:44] already started put my resume out there I had already come to the conclusion that I was not going

[01:16:48] to be able to continue with stern myself yeah so when when when he received that pay cut he started

[01:16:53] to make some moves that's when the mass layoffs happened at stern in October 2008 right after expo

[01:17:01] Keith would say I fully expected layoffs to occur some people did not expect the amount of complete

[01:17:08] carnage that occurred last Wednesday because he's recording this with top cast like a week after

[01:17:16] it occurred so the wounds are still quite I think open and sore yeah listen to the Steve Richie

[01:17:23] top cast interview they were very open and sore yeah everybody at that time was was we're pretty

[01:17:28] upset now was Keith bitter that he was let go no I don't think he was better I mean when you're

[01:17:33] let go from a job that you really kind of love and enjoy and you've been putting your heart into

[01:17:38] and and making two of probably the greatest coded games ever to be coded to this point you got to be

[01:17:45] kind of upset I wouldn't say bitter I would just say upset or annoyed yeah I mean I don't think he

[01:17:51] wasn't mad at stern necessarily and he he said I mean that changed later on because Keith would say

[01:17:57] later on that maybe a year or so after that when stern like didn't die and kind of started some

[01:18:05] kind of you know recovery that they express interest in hiring them back and then they just

[01:18:11] stop talking to them they ghosted him that's what the kids say nowadays he was not happy with that

[01:18:16] yeah the other really there's a couple of other really amazing interviews to listen to one of them

[01:18:22] is head-to-head pinball episode number four with Martin Robbins and Ryan C they did a great interview

[01:18:28] 41 sorry yeah 41 where they did a really great interview with Keith around the time that Jersey

[01:18:34] Jack Pirates of the Caribbean was launched that's well worth your check out as well as there is a

[01:18:40] pinball profile with Jeff T. Oless right around the covid lockdowns of 2020 when Keith was working

[01:18:47] on the G&R code which he didn't talk about he kept that very quiet but he spoke about sort of

[01:18:53] his other bits of the background and time at JJP well Keith would end up at a company called play

[01:18:59] mechanics which was an arcade machine developer he took the job because well he needed a job and he

[01:19:05] wasn't really excited to work there but it was gaming I guess in arcades I guess it's not like

[01:19:11] he was sad to work there he just wasn't as enthusiastic as he could have been and Keith says

[01:19:19] I actually talked to Stern in the summer of 2010 I went over there and interviewed

[01:19:24] met Dave Peterson and all that stuff I was talking with them to go back because Lyman left

[01:19:29] that thing obviously fell through and that's what I was talking about from before yeah

[01:19:34] right so then you know here's the thing right is it that that Dave Peterson and George Gomez

[01:19:38] they all met with him and they're like you know what he doesn't fit here maybe that's why he

[01:19:42] didn't come aboard you know maybe maybe they just didn't have a spot for him maybe it's because

[01:19:47] Lyman actually came back in 2010 if you recall right he was only gone for a few months uh

[01:19:53] he came back in 2011 right around the Texas pinball festival yeah so I mean there was there was some

[01:20:01] other stuff I don't think it was that you know maybe Keith felt hurt that he wasn't brought a

[01:20:06] board that he was sort of maybe led down that area which is why he's a little bit you know disenfranchised

[01:20:12] with the leadership there maybe maybe we're speculating and you know what is not actually that bad at

[01:20:18] all but that's a lot less fun and then Keith states I remember posting an RGP that you know if someone's

[01:20:25] going to make you go with this it's going to be Jack meaning Jersey Jack and you know he's probably

[01:20:30] the only person that can make this successful and Keith was talking about the announcement from January

[01:20:36] of 2011 where Jersey Jack would talk about starting his own pinball machine manufacturer and the

[01:20:45] Wizard of Oz intellectual property for their first pinball machine well Keith would say that Jack

[01:20:52] eventually would come knocking and the risk reward of going to Jersey Jack versus staying at play

[01:20:57] mechanics was essentially infinite and it was better to go back to pinball but Keith was an

[01:21:06] integral part of the Jersey Jack team he actually showed up in Chicago to do some of this work with

[01:21:14] them there was still the play field done by Joe Balls or still wasn't quite finished yet but there

[01:21:20] was still so much that had to be done at Jersey Jack they actually had to build an operating system

[01:21:26] and an entire framework that had to be created before they even thought about programming lights

[01:21:30] and switches which is a ton of I mean you look at a lot of the up and coming companies or companies

[01:21:37] that came out the last few years like American pinball uses I think the p-rock system a lot of

[01:21:45] them a lot of them use pre-existing systems yeah they go with like an off the shelf sort of system

[01:21:51] well yeah yeah like p-rock fast I guess is another one but they were they just did everything from

[01:21:57] the ground up yeah well at this time they didn't really have any other these these

[01:22:01] they have it yes he literally had to program like a one-to-four player game you know how many balls

[01:22:08] are in play tracking the ball what happens when the ball drains you know putting the ball into

[01:22:13] the shooter lane switching to the next player after it drains right writing the audit system and

[01:22:18] adjustments and all that like he had to do all of that work and he says all kinds of work has to

[01:22:24] be done to make a pinball system it's not glamorous and not fun the cool part is when you get to

[01:22:29] do multi balls and play the game and flip it and have exciting it's not trying to figure out the bugs

[01:22:35] of you know the the shooter lane or the ball search you know what I mean like oh that would be

[01:22:40] terrible that doesn't come without its own stress that's for sure and Keith had you know dealt

[01:22:45] with a lot of stress in this period of time yeah Keith said I was maintaining two sets of code

[01:22:50] one was the show code the dog and pony code and the other code was the code that was the real game code

[01:22:56] it was hair pulling for a long time plus my wife and I were in the process of adopting our child

[01:23:02] there are all kinds of things going on and it was just like I don't need all this going on

[01:23:06] right now but here I am Keith was dealing with a lot at this time he's building from the ground up

[01:23:11] he's back in pinball he's excited to be there he's adopting a child he's you know he's working crazy

[01:23:16] hours and he's doing all of this for what reason he's doing all of this for you and I Ron to make

[01:23:23] us happy with pinball machines that really goes I think to the crux of why all of the designers and

[01:23:31] all of the coders all of the artists they do what they do because they want us to have fun

[01:23:36] even though it is incredibly stressful for them so I mean hats off but the game that he was

[01:23:42] talking about there that he was working on having the show code which is the code that they would

[01:23:47] bring to a show with the brinking blinking lights and stuff and then the actual code of the gameplay

[01:23:52] that was for Wizard of Oz the licensed movie theme from April of 2013 there's an unknown

[01:24:00] number of units sold it is the J.J.P. board set it's designed by the king of clunk Joe Ballster

[01:24:07] art by Jerry Vanderstelt Greg Ferres and Matt Reson to learn her res to her

[01:24:19] click click click click animation by John Paul DeWin sound and music by Chris Granger and Rob

[01:24:27] Barry software by Keith Johnson Ted Estes Joe cats and JT Harkley and Alex Alex levy forgot

[01:24:34] Oh and Alex levy get Alex oh my god poor Alex my goodness Alex levy this is based on the

[01:24:40] Wizard of Oz theme which is the old school movie yes the 1939 MGM classic oh my goodness one of

[01:24:50] the highest grossing films of all time right this is right up there with Avatar and

[01:25:01] Avatar and endgame but it was on TV like every year it was yeah it's I mean this is the this is

[01:25:09] the very famous Judy Garland movie it had a budget of 2.8 million dollars and it had a box office

[01:25:17] of 30 million dollars way back in the 30s it's the musical with the lion and the dead

[01:25:23] tin man and the man behind the curtain and the todo the dog and the slippers and the yeah you know

[01:25:30] all that stuff it's great great film but what an odd thing to have a pinball machine around

[01:25:35] isn't it not at all it's a family it's a family friendly theme that everybody knows everybody knows

[01:25:43] and Wizard of Oz was one heck of a seller and probably could still be one heck of a seller

[01:25:51] for Jersey Jack they they ran this about a billion times and get into that and different

[01:25:56] versions each more expensive than the next version this game was so huge and so ambitious and

[01:26:02] so excitingly different that it almost bankrupt the entire company yeah because they probably

[01:26:08] underpriced it as crazy as that seems this this was originally the price of this was $6,500

[01:26:14] this was when Stern was selling games for under 4k you can get it for under 4k and this was the

[01:26:19] premium home owner bring back the Valley Williams magic excitement this was the bring back max bring

[01:26:27] it back and boy oh boy did they go all they went all in it's a wide body so we can put more stuff

[01:26:36] because everybody loves wide body fit more crap in it to upper play fields because only one is

[01:26:41] just you need more than one physical sculpts so we're not talking flat plastics we're not talking

[01:26:49] like pictures actual molded toys everywhere yeah my favorite thing in the game is the pop-upers

[01:26:58] the trees the yeah the creepy trees with the faces well yeah how would you like it if someone

[01:27:03] picked apples off of you I would be pretty upset and they're holding apples in their hands if you look

[01:27:08] so it's got the witches castle at the top the top play field upper play field it's got the wicked

[01:27:16] witch of the west toy which goes up and down it's got these these bumpers with with the trees on it

[01:27:23] it has a crystal ball which has like a screen underneath it so when you look into the crystal

[01:27:28] ball you see clips pretty brilliant monkeys pretty hold on we're getting there it's got the balloon

[01:27:35] pop bumper state fair outlaying toy thing which I believe was a Dennis Nordman thing Dennis

[01:27:42] Nordman thing it's got ruby red flippers so the covers on the flippers they little ruby red shoes

[01:27:48] that always fall off it's got it's got the toto roll over outlaying on the other side which is

[01:27:54] like another ball save escape thing way easier than the one on the left it's way easier it has it has

[01:28:02] the upper play field which is the spinning house so you shoot around this little mini loop in the

[01:28:10] upper play field and the house will actually spin mm-hmm it has the winged monkey mech in the back

[01:28:16] where the monkey comes down with a magnet picks up the ball and hides it and locks it behind in

[01:28:21] the witch's castle which is part of the movie and it has RGB lighting everywhere full RGB lighting yes

[01:28:29] and a 24 inch LCD back box monitor which was something out of science fiction at this time because we

[01:28:39] are still stuck in DMD we are still stuck in dot matrix displays everywhere else yep this was a

[01:28:46] revolutionary pin and Keith Johnson was one of the fellows that worked tirelessly and endlessly

[01:28:54] to actually get this thing to work which was crazy and this was the game that Stern looked at

[01:29:03] said wow people people paid 6500 for that people paid 6500 dollars really to be charged more for our games

[01:29:12] and that's where it all went wrong it was something like this is a great little game now it was

[01:29:22] originally this is a pet peeve of mine okay how how how how games are named in additions and limited

[01:29:31] and not limited in collectors and all this thing but let's let's talk about the first one here

[01:29:37] which is the standard addition now this included the 26 inch LCD screen in visiglass which is like

[01:29:44] which is polarized glass that doesn't reflect light it had a shaker motor it had all the RGB LEDs it

[01:29:51] had a seven speaker 2.1 audio system it had full color printed manual and it had super shiny armor

[01:30:00] and like super shiny super shiny then they came out with the emerald city limited edition

[01:30:07] this is the this is the super fancy expensive one to be fair I think the first two were at launch

[01:30:14] yes you can get the standard or the yeah limited that that's right that's right the limited

[01:30:19] addition model had a thousand units it had green armor and legs it had a numbered plaque on the

[01:30:27] arch down by the flippers are the the apron some people call it it had the signed the wooden arch

[01:30:33] was signed looks good it does look good heavy as heck but it looks good it has an emerald city

[01:30:39] topper and it had an audio connection for headphones yeah and it also had at least at the

[01:30:45] beginning of the run the clear coated silk screen cabinet which is basically like the butter

[01:30:51] tabs that um spooky does beautiful pin beautiful pin now um I played a bit of wizard of

[01:31:03] Oz at fantastic last year and I was greatly unimpressed with the gameplay no I really was like

[01:31:13] everybody's like oh my god wizard of Oz is so great and I played it and I'm like this shoots

[01:31:18] terrible is that just the joe balsar thing or is it to people like that it's very deep I know

[01:31:26] but it's no fun to get there it's very deep it's very diplomatic of you your answer is very telling

[01:31:33] everybody can hear through that Ron uh I didn't stop you with that way the so after they sold

[01:31:42] all thousand of those emerald city additions yeah yeah and this is this was a bonus attention too

[01:31:48] because they're selling these early editions there's only a thousand these oh I gotta have it

[01:31:52] so they sell and then like a year or two later okay we're now going to do the 75th anniversary

[01:31:57] edition the 75th anniversary edition is the ruby red edition so the trim is all going to be red

[01:32:04] right so it's 1500 units it's all super shiny red armor legs armor and legs

[01:32:11] it has the connection to the audio it has the 75th anniversary edition topper and the back

[01:32:17] and the back glass was different and it had a different numbered arch and plaque I think this is

[01:32:23] probably the nicer unit in my opinion but wait a second you can't have a second limited edition can

[01:32:30] you sure you can you could even have a third one well I mean it's it's I mean I guess so this is

[01:32:36] where we get into this limited edition thing okay I get it stirons limited edition is like 500

[01:32:42] or a thousand units and that's it but sometimes they come out with another one yep so but

[01:32:49] jersey jack did that people freaked out because you're only supposed to have so many units it's like well

[01:32:53] no there's only a thousand units of that type of limited edition so I get it I'm actually okay with

[01:32:58] it I think it's annoying and it makes your branding and marketing look like weird and confusing but

[01:33:04] I understand it now there's 1500 of these of these 75th anniversary editions so they're selling

[01:33:12] even more of those and then in 2019 they unveiled the yellow brick road limited edition which is

[01:33:20] the ugliest of them because it is bright yellow I remember that was right at that was at Texas

[01:33:26] pinball festival yes and this had one of the greatest reveals of all time where in the room at

[01:33:34] the Texas pinball festival everybody was expecting the next greatest pin from jersey jack

[01:33:42] and when they came into that seminar room there was a pinball machine covered in garbage bags

[01:33:48] and under those garbage bags the yellow sparkled playfield the no winged monkey yeah the monkey's not

[01:33:55] in this one the updated witchel witches castle mechanics which had less stuff to break it had a

[01:34:03] special backlash it had rad cows on the side which are like plastic shiny covered art things

[01:34:10] it had a new topper it had yellow powder coated ramps and legs it had a return of the wooden arch

[01:34:17] and the new back box design which was actually taken from dialed in yeah you know train rack of

[01:34:23] the launch of this aside it sold quite well these limited edition yellow brick roads but at that time

[01:34:30] the price had gone way up every single time they released a new one but they kept selling them

[01:34:36] which is why I ask again why is it selling if it's not that great to shoot it's got a ton of toys

[01:34:43] it looks impressive but it's not that impressive they love that deep code so this code is a bit

[01:34:49] unusual right there's there's there's horses of a color and there's areas to shoot and there's

[01:34:55] wizard modes and like it's really got a lot going on and the only person I think that can really

[01:35:01] explain this is martin robins from the final round podcast like do you understand any of that game

[01:35:08] I'm trying to remember what is the final mode is somewhere I think somewhere over the rainbow right

[01:35:12] yes all I know is that but I don't know how to get there I don't know what to shoot I don't know

[01:35:17] where to go you gotta do everything everything you gotta do everything you just shoot the ball everywhere

[01:35:22] and eventually stuff will happen and that's not that fun I mean I I understand that if you're paying

[01:35:27] a lot of money for a pin you want to do a lot of stuff I like the monkey monkey's cool I mean I

[01:35:33] get it I get it it's just this pin obviously was a let's throw everything in there let Keith do

[01:35:40] whatever he wants with code and we'll see how it goes and it went okay and it sold really good

[01:35:45] so it went more than okay you know what I mean but there was a big controversy when it came to

[01:35:50] the light boards do you remember that oh they had issues the first run games had the

[01:35:55] had issues with the light boards which are the which are the boards underneath the feet the play

[01:36:00] field that blink lights and it's kind of like the node board space the light boards the ones that

[01:36:05] yeah have the lights yes there very very good very good but a lot of them failed yeah and jersey

[01:36:12] jack had to send out a bunch of new ones for a bunch of people under warranty and jersey jack got

[01:36:17] into some serious troubles when it come to came to finance and there was ownership changes where

[01:36:22] they ended up coming into the billionaire family of the abyss is I think that was after the hobbit

[01:36:26] though or at least that's right yeah but yeah like there was a lot there was a lot of things the

[01:36:32] light boards I remember yeah they had they had to do a design change and and honestly when you're

[01:36:38] coming up with a completely new board set a completely just new new framework if light boards

[01:36:47] being replaced is the worst thing that happens I mean I know it cost them a lot of money but it's

[01:36:52] better than something going horribly wrong and games like frying themselves or setting you know

[01:36:57] catching fire houses on fire yeah so yeah and if yours went you got you got new light boards most

[01:37:06] most people if you talk to them about all the different editions you'd like to have the emerald

[01:37:10] edition with the the super glossy cabinet silk screen with the new light boards that would be like

[01:37:17] the perfect version you have the best of everything there I would love to put a lot more time on it

[01:37:22] like I've you know I probably played a dozen solid games and it was it was cool like it's not I'm

[01:37:28] not gonna lie in our league at the bar they had a emerald city Ellie not kidding the wow yeah the

[01:37:36] the wood the apron all that had the super the silk screen clear coated cabinet are everything this

[01:37:44] isn't your this isn't your stern iron man or or no that's what was being released at this time

[01:37:51] was like tron right right and you got acdc is coming out right right after this acdc beat it

[01:37:56] though with the RGB lighting yeah and it's it's still not as impressive but I would love to put more

[01:38:02] time on it I'd like to play more I'd like to see what the hype is about because people must it

[01:38:08] must be but my god they're heavy oh they're very heavy they add the heaviest games yep holy moly you

[01:38:14] want to talk about heavy let's talk about their next pin oh yeah pin the Keith worked on the hobbit

[01:38:20] this is the movie license theme from April of 26 2016 we don't know how many units they sold

[01:38:27] this is designed by the king of clunk joe balsar art by Jean Paul de win animation by Jean Paul de

[01:38:33] win sound and music by david theel software Keith Johnson Ted S's Joe's joke hats and JT harcley

[01:38:42] now this this had a whole crazy development cycle right this was this was something where they were

[01:38:52] like struggling to get this game out isn't that right I remember going to the factory when they were

[01:38:59] getting the they were starting to build a wizard of os is but they had already picked the next

[01:39:04] theme like you already knew it was hobbit it wasn't a mystery they came out and said like our next

[01:39:08] game is going to be hobbit and and they had a thing uh yeah after the factory tour and all that

[01:39:15] they were all gonna go to watch one of the the hobbit movies that was just released so it was

[01:39:22] interesting that you knew what the game was gonna be before it was even now they hide everything

[01:39:26] yeah so they played a they played this card that Peter Jackson who did the original lord of the

[01:39:31] rings was releasing a new motion picture trilogy around the hobbit movie which makes no sense

[01:39:37] because the hobbit is one book and lord of the rings is three books this was had a huge huge

[01:39:45] expectation because the lord of the rings trilogy is is is objectively one of the greatest sort

[01:39:51] of film epics of all time based on some of the greatest book epics of all time and Peter Jackson

[01:40:00] went all out they spent seven hundred and almost seven hundred and fifty million dollars and it had a

[01:40:06] two almost a three billion dollar box office across three films but these films were not widely

[01:40:15] accepted and were not um hailed and praised as much as the uh lord of the rings trilogy in fact

[01:40:25] they scored 67% rotten tomatoes for the first hobbit movie the second hobbit movie scored 70

[01:40:32] four percent rotten tomatoes and the third movie which was pretty much a useless you know three

[01:40:38] hour movie was 60 percent or 59 percent and you know that's a far cry from like the 90s that the

[01:40:46] lord of the rings movies get so it's a bit of a gamble to go with some movies you haven't seen

[01:40:51] yet but that's what they did but the other issue with this was that they released the art and

[01:40:58] everybody freaked out at how ugly the art was for this pin so then they re-did the entire art

[01:41:04] again yeah yeah I was there yeah they unveiled it and again it was it's when they used to unveil

[01:41:10] the games when they were still working progress they weren't even ready yet they kind of stopped

[01:41:14] doing that later on which is like a big no no they unveiled the game and everyone saw the art and

[01:41:19] everyone hated it they hated the art so then they they breed it the art hey pinheads when I'm

[01:42:36] Canadian residents only to be honest I remember seeing a play field with the old art I didn't

[01:42:42] think it was that bad it was like more gray and with the but I mean the new one is better

[01:42:47] sometimes you can listen to the customers too much I think well that's that's inevitably it right

[01:42:52] and when you're a small company and you're sort of being run by a sales guy yes man like jersey

[01:42:57] jack and I and I say that I don't mean to be mean about that but that's just what sales people are

[01:43:02] we try to please everybody we want everybody to like us I'm a salesperson too I get that they

[01:43:06] would pivot and change on that but it's not necessarily the best thing to do in this you know

[01:43:12] it probably was but it created more delays and more issues and more cost overruns and then eventually

[01:43:18] that's where you would end up with hobbit being sold now a lot of people were a little bit disappointed

[01:43:24] in the hobbits code because they expected something different isn't that right well Keith says

[01:43:29] hobbit is kind of a sore point because we put a lot of crap into that game and it wasn't what

[01:43:34] people wanted wasn't they were expecting Lord of the Rings 2 but I don't want to do the exact same

[01:43:39] game every time if you want Lord of the Rings 2 you should be playing Wizard of Oz so I mean that

[01:43:44] that Wizard of Oz and Keith has said this quite a few times that code is more similar to Lord of the

[01:43:50] Rings than the hobbit code was in my opinion I think it's the play field that is the part of the

[01:43:59] hobbit that holds it back so let's talk about what is on this play field there are three flippers

[01:44:06] there are three pop bumpers okay we're this is pretty regular stuff there's four pop up targets

[01:44:12] which are like the trolls in many of the trolls I think it's like the same Mac

[01:44:18] but there's not just two there's four yeah that's another reason to game so heavy jersey jack

[01:44:23] doesn't do one thing it's like let's do the same thing but like on steroids there's two spinners

[01:44:28] there's 11 stand-up targets there's two vertical upkickers two three bank drop targets

[01:44:36] there's one captive ball one newton ball post there's a five bank drop target individually controllable

[01:44:43] individual existence eight one mini LCD book screen under the glass the large smog toy which is the

[01:44:52] dragon smog on the on the on the rotates there's a player control diverter in the back ramp

[01:45:01] and there's a physical outlane kickback this thing is so heavy so big and they got tons of assets

[01:45:11] they have all the clip from the actual movie unbelievable the the multi-ball what they did when they

[01:45:17] had it at expo with the art that everyone hated the one thing they had coded in there was like the

[01:45:22] multi-ball intro so you got to see the dragons like talking to you and the multi-ball stars like oh

[01:45:27] okay that's cool he turns his head and looks at you like whoa I want to play this game so bad I

[01:45:35] haven't played this game I want to play it so bad because I want to make up my opinion for myself

[01:45:39] because I think I really want it I really want to I really want to like it I really think it's

[01:45:44] very cool I like pins that are themy and atmospheric and and integrated really well and this is

[01:45:51] probably they say like one of the greatest integrated pins of all time the downside to it unfortunately

[01:45:57] is the play field so it's a fan layout the shots are left to look fans it has a third flipper

[01:46:05] but some people would say that third flipper could be removed and it wouldn't make any difference

[01:46:09] there was originally a fourth flipper in there but it was removed because it was only there to be a

[01:46:14] flipper and literally didn't shoot anything on the right side of the play field but the left one on

[01:46:19] the left side shoots the drop targets on the left sorry the flipper on the right shoots the

[01:46:25] drop targets on the left but you could shoot those from the bottom flipper so there's no sense of

[01:46:30] having that there there's no side ramps to shoot that if there's no like it is a completely

[01:46:35] useless flipper it really is it's like a mechanic to have in the game to have in the game for no

[01:46:39] other reason the other thing is that it has these ramps that are sort of like the boat ramps from

[01:46:48] fish tails but it's a way back in the back of the play field and it has two vertical upkickers

[01:46:54] on the left and right side that you sort of shoot it in and it goes and then it goes plop up onto

[01:46:59] the to the have you played this then you can't say all these things what do you think you tell me

[01:47:06] you've played it um it's it's it's not stellar I mean it's it's not like oh my god this thing shoots

[01:47:14] like a dream it doesn't but it's better than than Wizard of Oz I kind of liked it better just

[01:47:20] because just because it's cool starting a multi-ball with the freaking dragon there and it got even

[01:47:25] though I never seen any of the movies that they're they play on the screen and it looks cool and

[01:47:30] the light show is cool and you know they had assets galore in this game I've heard from

[01:47:37] multiple people that that when casuals come up to play they they just don't have any clue what's

[01:47:44] going on or where to shoot or what to like there's no there's no bash toy there's no real sort of

[01:47:50] ramps in your face there's no magnets in places like there's those pop up trolls and spiders and

[01:47:57] animals and wolves and whatever that pop up out of the playfield but to get those to pop up you

[01:48:02] got to get it into the in lanes casuals have a really hard time with this pin I'm not really casual

[01:48:08] so I I don't I don't know any casuals at this point but I've heard that a few times is that like

[01:48:15] when people stand up there like if you and I got here we'd be like okay I'm gonna shoot the

[01:48:18] thing and start the mode and then the mode is telling me to shoot the drop targets or shoot the

[01:48:22] orbits or collect the characters or whatever but like you got to collect the shots and then the

[01:48:28] shots you collect all the characters and then you roll over the locks and then you shoot the the

[01:48:34] animals and then you got the balls on here where key throws everything at you like you're a multi-ball

[01:48:39] your hit shots trolls are popping up your hit troll everything's the sounds are going insane it's

[01:48:44] just yeah so then like I said before if you're doing everything nothing means anything is that

[01:48:49] correct you know what I mean like if everything is a jackpot and everything is lit and whatever

[01:48:56] you're doing is doing something that then it all kind of blurs together and is kind of meaningless

[01:49:01] not if you're a casual it's great yeah yeah maybe but do they have any clue what's up it's just

[01:49:08] blinking and stuff when I look at the first half of Keith's sort of creation of pinball code we got

[01:49:18] like the Simpsons and Lord of the Rings and world poker tour and stuff like that and you can

[01:49:23] obviously tell that there's somebody at Stern who's always looking over his shoulder and saying like

[01:49:29] don't do that or I want Balrog to come out more we need a bash toy or this has to come there if

[01:49:34] I'm paying for Balrog he better be out more often and they kind of reign him in or or bother him

[01:49:41] enough and make him make Keith angry enough that he does some of the things that they want and

[01:49:48] it's like he's been corralled into creating the games that he's created now it looks at Jersey Jack

[01:49:54] like nobody tells him no he's the leader of the coding team that he's in front of and he is

[01:50:00] literally doing everything that he wants and I think it might be too much David Dennis narrative

[01:50:07] do you what do you think I'm not saying it's good or bad because like I said I haven't played

[01:50:13] enough of it to make my full code I'm just saying there's a lot going on here and there is a lot of

[01:50:18] craziness and a lot of people say man it's too much I could argue though this is this is 100% for

[01:50:24] the whole market okay so we're in a different market this has to keep people occupied for years

[01:50:32] so this isn't this isn't Dave swinging up at fantastic playing four games or somebody's

[01:50:36] going to dollar and playing two games right this is a totally different thing so maybe we'll talk

[01:50:43] about that a little bit here on the next game but I really really really want to play this game

[01:50:49] because I really want to make up an opinion because I think it looks fun fantastic and it's my

[01:50:54] kind of game but I just think wow there's a whole lot of thing going on here so let's get into

[01:51:00] the additions of this game so this got into a really weird confusing additions too didn't it

[01:51:04] I think I had a couple early versions but so it had this it had the standard edition okay so there

[01:51:10] was a standard edition for this game where it had all the movie scenes it had some of standard

[01:51:17] stainless steel parts we haven't gotten to the era of Jersey Jack where they actually take anything

[01:51:22] out of the game so the base game is is the same no matter what version you have it's the more expensive

[01:51:29] versions have way more bling basically it's the only difference so so this it's got standard stainless

[01:51:35] steel it's got a regular industry coin door it's got you know three pop bumpers that are just

[01:51:41] standard pop bumpers you know it has no shaker motor but it's it's exactly the same when it comes

[01:51:46] to physical gameplay now the limited edition is where things get a bit different so these were on

[01:51:52] the pre-production promo and you can see this on IPDB which is the internet pinball database where

[01:51:59] you can look up these games and in here we get the sea breeze bronze powder coated armor and body

[01:52:05] legs which is actually very nice it has the coin door with the external headphone jack and volume

[01:52:12] control it has the invisiglass the shaker motor it has a numbered certificate of authenticity plus

[01:52:20] it just looks awesome and it has these really cool axe slingshots so the slingshots have like little

[01:52:28] axes that stick up so it pushes the rubber which pushes the ball but then above that these little

[01:52:34] axes kind of come down it looks awesome super cool but then there was the small gold limited

[01:52:42] edition and this added a gold colored smoug toy so he was colored painted differently and gold

[01:52:50] armor and body legs and then later on there was another version there was the black arrow special

[01:52:56] edition so it wasn't a limited edition it was a special okay so now we're getting into the

[01:53:00] mess of things here right like my god marketing gold colored smoug so there was no the gold smoug

[01:53:06] edition made it was useless because now it's now you got it on the black arrow one it had black

[01:53:12] ink body armor and legs which I thought was very pretty and it has the headphone jack the volume

[01:53:17] controls it has a black arrow limited edition mode animations which basically meant the attract mode

[01:53:24] head like it said you know black arrow edition which actually looked really cool Jean Paul

[01:53:30] the win man you kill it you were so good at this stuff black flipper bats black captive ball

[01:53:37] people have played this game say it's absolutely amazing other people play it and they're like

[01:53:40] I just don't get it and I don't know where I'm gonna fit in that spectrum what is your

[01:53:45] work co-host on slam till podcast your other podcast Bruce night and gale what does he think of the

[01:53:51] hobbit I don't know if he likes those games I know he hates all the ones I like like he hates

[01:53:56] dial in he hates walka so I don't know what he thinks of hobbit okay so let's jump into pirates

[01:54:06] of the Caribbean are the licensed movie theme that is from the Disney property that is named after

[01:54:16] the ride at the Disney theme parks this is from September of 2008 so this game was the one

[01:54:23] along with Deadpool that was coming out right kind of after I had joined pinball so I was kind of

[01:54:28] excited to see this from the manufacturer Jersey Jack it was designed by Eric Minier or Minier as

[01:54:36] it's supposed to be and he doesn't know how to say his name animations by Jean Paul DeWin sound

[01:54:41] by David Thiel and software by Keith P. Johnson Joe Katz Ted Estes and JT Harkley this is

[01:54:52] pretty cool game I'm not gonna lie it's pretty exciting this this game has a very interesting

[01:54:58] history Jersey Jack went after this IP he said in previous interviews he went after pirates of

[01:55:04] the Caribbean because the original pirates of the Caribbean from Stern when he was a Stern

[01:55:09] distributor sold a lot so he's like that is an awesome theme I want to go back into that theme which

[01:55:16] I think is a crazy way to run a business which is why Jersey Jack doesn't run it anymore

[01:55:21] but it was a good it's a Disney thing everyone likes pirates of the Caribbean at least the original

[01:55:26] three now when they negotiated the contract for this they did not get a whole lot of or any video

[01:55:32] assets for this game so you're basically playing a pirate game with photos from pirates of the Caribbean

[01:55:39] yeah and and and one of the actors yes now the actor is the is the the the fellow that does all

[01:55:49] the callouts does an amazing job and the sound package by David Thiel is stunning and the the

[01:55:56] visuals by Jean Paul DeWin stunning the play field that pretty good I like the play field

[01:56:02] it's not the greatest of play fields it's a wide body and there's more shots in the middle

[01:56:08] that are kind of fun and the ones in the outsider absolutely just wow that's strong takes by David

[01:56:13] Dennis you're gonna get so much hate mail I'm probably gonna get a lot if I ever see Eric

[01:56:18] Minier he's probably gonna punch me in the face but it's it's it's a really it's an ambitious

[01:56:24] game it's an exciting game but it ended up being hamstrung in quite a different way so on the right

[01:56:29] side you've got just this super cool rocking ship upper playfield so the playfield is literally a

[01:56:37] ship that rocks back and forth and there's a ramp that you shoot up to it which is terrible ramp

[01:56:42] it just is tall but you get up there and it is so cool and then you can lock a ball on the left

[01:56:48] side of that ship and it shoots a crop like you're literally your ball shoots across into a

[01:56:55] another sculpt on the other side like that is pretty stunning then there's a a a chest locking

[01:57:03] mechanism on the on in the middle of the play field I've played this a lot actually yet I've

[01:57:09] played this a lot oddly enough then underneath there's this really cool sort of magnet spot underneath

[01:57:16] the ship where you're like stuck in the world pool of the ship there's the malls the maelstrom ramp

[01:57:21] on the other side where it will go through the ramp or it will divert it down into like almost

[01:57:26] like a toilet bowl thing going around it's a great game it is a really great game it just for some

[01:57:32] reason it doesn't come together now a lot of the controversy around this game was that things were

[01:57:37] either cost it out or taken out because they weren't working quite the way they wanted to I think

[01:57:42] that's overblown I think people put too much anger in that I don't think that that's a big what

[01:57:48] happened was they unveiled this at expo and by unveil I mean show an early prototype of it

[01:57:57] you know because it wasn't ready yet and they showed it had a triple spinning disc in the center

[01:58:04] like it's spun like you spin three different ways there's three different parts of the disc

[01:58:08] that's spin and it had the chest in the back open and closed kind of like the chest in the

[01:58:14] stern one and they it just took so long it was I don't know eight to ten months after that before

[01:58:23] this was finally released and they just could not get the triple spinning disc working right so they

[01:58:28] pulled it there were some kind of issue with the trunk opening and closing so they pulled that so

[01:58:35] it doesn't open and close anymore just stays closed I know that some distributors they had early

[01:58:40] copies of the game with the triple spinning disc and they had them for like a year and they

[01:58:46] would bring them to shows so it'd be like the same game so you would see these this triple spinning

[01:58:49] disc but then when the production game came out it didn't have it plus I know at least a few of them

[01:58:56] they had issues with the upper play field where it would only rock in one direction it would not

[01:59:01] rock back and forth yeah because of the the cables were too tight underneath they would pull the

[01:59:06] cables they would embrace the game I played the same prototypes multiple shows and then when it

[01:59:12] finally came out production it was it might even have been a year over a year after the initial

[01:59:16] unveiling and it all kind of died down and it really hurt the game I think the initial sales fell

[01:59:23] off a cliff I mean more than the whole like cutting cutting stuff I think it's the amount of time

[01:59:27] between they showed it and the buzz was there to when it finally came out production it was

[01:59:32] took so long I played this at sunshine laundromat when I was in Manhattan or when I was in Brooklyn

[01:59:38] I played it and I'm like hey this is kind of fun and the code is really kind of neat and innovative

[01:59:42] and whatever but I played it quite a bit that during that vacation when I was there I was back a

[01:59:47] few times and the shots you ended up just being in the middle of the play field a lot and the ramps

[01:59:53] were really like they just didn't they weren't great I don't know what it was you know people

[01:59:58] talk about Jersey Jack flippers or different or maybe the power need to be turned up or something

[02:00:03] but like my experience was not really all that great but I did spend a lot of time watching Kevin

[02:00:08] from Buffalo pinball and his stream playing the game and I'm telling him man it looked like so much fun

[02:00:14] but holy crap there was a lot going as a repeatable loop shot I love that that gets my attention

[02:00:20] then we get into the the whole issue of the code so the code is that you can choose up to like 20

[02:00:26] different characters yes from the game in each one of those so you put your you put your coin in

[02:00:32] you push start and you get like 20 characters to pick from and they all have different perks and

[02:00:37] they can all get you like a multi ball quicker or they can get you more gold for different types of

[02:00:42] things or you know you get an add a ball or your two times play field or they all get a perk which

[02:00:48] is pretty brilliant but 20 people is a lot yeah star wars by Stern had like four four and people

[02:00:57] freaked out but it is very complex and there's so many variations of things you can do it's

[02:01:05] thing is the production was not that long because they weren't selling them so they stopped making them

[02:01:11] then it got way more popular after that now this scares anything but the thing to

[02:01:17] about the code this game was released how was it 2018 yes it's still not at one point I'll code

[02:01:26] yeah there still is no final wizard because there's probably only what 500 of these out there in the

[02:01:31] world yeah that's like there's not very many which is a shame because it deserved I think something

[02:01:39] a little bit better than that will eventually be finished I still do well it comes down to when

[02:01:46] Keith got time and does he have time to do that or is he off doing his next game or do they still

[02:01:50] have a license I mean isn't I thought what every new version depending on what they change you have

[02:01:56] to have license or approval it's it's a really cool game it's really you know I'm not gonna I'm not

[02:02:00] gonna hurt on it but when it comes to the code like if I complained a little bit about the hobbit

[02:02:05] being confusing this is something else on an entirely different level but Keith has a very good

[02:02:10] rebuttal your complaining about the character things but Keith says I will admit the pirates

[02:02:16] is a little bit of a risk with the character thing but people don't have to pay attention to it if

[02:02:20] they don't want to I feel like games just have to have a lot to do and a lot to learn and stuff

[02:02:26] like that to justify their cost I mean we're selling games at 8500 minimum right now now it's

[02:02:32] like 10,000 so if you get a game and you're done with it in two weeks it's just not worth it that's

[02:02:36] always been my philosophy which driving rule design at Jjp that's a very compelling thing is

[02:02:43] that no the game is not made for Dave to come to sunshine laundromat you mean the thing I said

[02:02:47] before how we I was programming for the whole market yeah that's it folks like don't complain about

[02:02:56] Keith's code being complex because if you're just pulling up and playing it at a show that's not

[02:03:01] what it's for you don't have to know the rules you can just play you can do basic things I mean

[02:03:06] you'll get slaughtered by someone who knows the rules intricately but that's the same for any game

[02:03:12] here's the thing though uh-oh when I walk up to a pin and I have no idea what's going on

[02:03:18] and I'm flipping around and having fun and I let's say the code is way crazy and too complex and

[02:03:24] I don't understand it but you know what I'm gonna go up and play it anyway if I'm not having fun

[02:03:28] shooting it and it's not really grasping me with theme and it's not really all that exciting

[02:03:35] I'm probably not gonna spend ten thousand dollars to buy it and bring it home to learn the rules

[02:03:40] you need to play at someone's house you can't play this on location I see the Jersey Jack games

[02:03:44] above all others you need the full experience you need to be able to hear it see the white

[02:03:50] shows I totally I totally get it and the thing is hey you know I'm gonna go I'm gonna shoot a pin

[02:03:56] if it's kind of fun if it's a theme I like it's really enjoyable yeah I'm gonna dive in no problem

[02:04:00] I will probably buy this pinball machine but I'll tell you what if I got to spend ten thousand

[02:04:03] dollars to get a machine home to realize that I don't like it and then try to sell it on the

[02:04:08] secondary market and maybe take a loss you know that's a pretty precarious thing and I think stern

[02:04:17] even though it is the evil empire kind of has figured that out a little bit now they don't have

[02:04:22] as much in their games and they're not as exciting but you know so there's all like even there's

[02:04:28] an action button right in the action button with this code you go and you hit it and you collect gold

[02:04:32] and you bump into things that's cute well what the hell is that well it's it is cool like the guys

[02:04:38] in the movie I don't know a character he plays but like you said he did a great job in man they had

[02:04:42] a they had to read like a hundred pages of script there's so many lines he has but everyone

[02:04:48] wants to probably just hear him go gold and he just sits but go because you got to collect it you

[02:04:54] got to pull it off the table but if you're bothered with the action button Keith says you don't have

[02:04:58] to get gold ever I mean you probably won't get to tour to go if you don't ever go for the goal

[02:05:04] but you don't have to play tour to get ever to win the game so that's what he's saying he's like

[02:05:08] don't get caught up on all this complicated stuff just have fun with the game and then learn it

[02:05:13] I don't you know I get it I get it I understand pinheads with their uh whining so much wine

[02:05:19] all I've done is wine this whole podcast has been two hours of whining you need to appreciate these

[02:05:23] games and the complicated they they had to come up with a whole new platform and light boards were

[02:05:29] like a one issue I would take that all day look at their menu they got like nice nice you know

[02:05:35] we haven't even gone into you know from from me from a more tech side go into their menu system see

[02:05:40] that like the switch matrix has got picture the play feel and little dots shows you what you're

[02:05:45] activating and stuff like that so cool but this had this had a myriad of additions as well there's

[02:05:51] the standard edition exactly the same as all the other ones no in visit glass no shaker you know

[02:05:57] no stuff like that now the limited edition it had the extra volume control and headstone yeah

[02:06:03] that all of them so far but it also has the 72 light display on the black on the back of the

[02:06:11] play field panel so they're the back of the play field there's like a panel that has all these

[02:06:15] lights on it and it gives you hints as to where you should shoot sort of like looking into the night

[02:06:21] sky and looking at stars so you pay more you get hints it's so stupid because you how do you

[02:06:26] figure out what's on that there's just lights then there's the it's it's not like there's an arrow

[02:06:31] or there's another it's just like this blinking thing and it actually does work it actually

[02:06:35] can actually figure it out there is a pattern to it quite whining but it's just there's a collector's

[02:06:41] addition this is the collector's addition armor and barnacles and the other it's got these burnicles

[02:06:47] on it I wasn't a fan of that part they had that and they're really sharp totally different playfield

[02:06:53] art so instead of Johnny Depp you get the dv Jones guy yeah which is totally better because I don't

[02:06:57] really like the I like Johnny Depp better I mean it's kept the jack you just like to stare into his

[02:07:03] eyes just in a bottle topper rad kels with different art and only 200 units 200 unit

[02:07:09] collector's addition can you imagine but they didn't sell so there's 200 of these out there

[02:07:14] and now they sell for like 35 thousand dollars US well well those sold the elite sold with the game

[02:07:19] itself didn't sell that much no so there's like the the most like limited version of this game

[02:07:24] is probably the standard edition yeah standard edition you probably have the one that there's

[02:07:28] the first all of the jerseys jack games it's see ease are like 30 thousand dollars we don't know

[02:07:35] how many were made people went crazy for this game afterwards there's so much hype around it but

[02:07:40] it you know come on people use some common sense here they you know there's still rumors are gonna

[02:07:46] maybe renew the license and do more someday so this brings us to guns roses not in this

[02:07:54] lifetime this is the licensed ban theme September of 2018 this is the jerseys jack board set

[02:08:02] Eric Minier and Saul slash Hudson which really takes away the mystique when you know his real name

[02:08:08] is Saul art by Dane Henry Jr. Jean Paul DeWin does the animations sound and music by

[02:08:19] slash and a vickas dayo software by Keith P. Johnson Ted Estes Joe Katz and JT Harnkey

[02:08:28] yeah remember that last game where they got no assets this is the opposite they got

[02:08:34] every asset known to man including ones that aren't even guns and roses songs

[02:08:40] live and let die

[02:08:42] yeah

[02:08:44] that's what threw me the first time I saw the game that that's the thing they showed because it has

[02:08:48] the coolest light show of all of them in my opinion the live and let die one and I'm like how do

[02:08:53] they get that they don't own that that's a polar card he saw just one phone call from slash

[02:08:59] a Paul can we use this sure there you go done so slash is a big pinball fan he's always been a

[02:09:08] big collector he worked on the guns and roses 90s with with john borg you can hear about that in

[02:09:15] the borg it live in the 90s licensing dream in the art can have that game anymore I believe I think

[02:09:21] is he lost that in the divorce yeek so the the guns and roses theme here was brought to jerseys jack

[02:09:33] by slash himself he approached jerseys jack it said let's make a pinball machine and he said

[02:09:38] okay sure it's not exactly family friendly which doesn't fit within there but of course

[02:09:43] under new ownership at jerseys jack they pretty much decided that they wanted to sell pins so they

[02:09:49] went with guns and roses and because you're working with slash he is giving you concert footage from

[02:09:57] the knot in this lifetime tour you're getting band posters you're getting original audio you get

[02:10:05] access to every band member in guns and roses it is something something else yeah you get access to

[02:10:14] appetite for destruction use your illusion one and two unfortunately then the other ones the Chinese

[02:10:22] democracy no now this was probably considered one of the greatest pinball launches of all times all

[02:10:33] of the mistakes that they had made in previous pinball launches where they kind of you know showed

[02:10:39] too much too soon or not enough this one they showed it in insane video and people were like

[02:10:46] a bina w i'd let me find my wallet and they were ready and they were ready the hype was

[02:10:51] something beautiful pin the art was fantastic the issue with this pin they weren't ready enough they

[02:10:58] sold out quickly and it's like oh crap they they they had never experienced as much demand as they

[02:11:03] did for this game this was the first pin that they had produced in their new factory when they

[02:11:08] moved to Chicago and that caused some issues as well as it was a released during the pandemic which

[02:11:14] also caused a lot of the supply chain issues and manufacturing issues the other thing with this pin

[02:11:22] was that it ended up being a lot of sizzle and not a whole lot of stay just another strong take

[02:11:30] i think that the game is exactly what it needed to be it is and it isn't amazing is you're bringing

[02:11:35] the concert home you are experiencing a guns and roses concert regardless of my zinger there

[02:11:42] this this game is exactly what it needs to be an amazing concert experience in a box for people

[02:11:50] that generally don't know a whole lot about pinball but the deeper you get into this code

[02:11:57] sort of the less satisfying it becomes so it's like a weird over correction for Keith Johnson

[02:12:03] there's a lot of code in it but it doesn't seem to kind of go anywhere is it too simple it's not

[02:12:10] simple it just it just doesn't seem like it's particularly rewarding it's a very risk reward pin

[02:12:16] and what do what do i mean by that Ron well like when i put up give an example why play this game

[02:12:22] i don't really care if it's deep i like to just get into a song you get into a song

[02:12:28] by you collect band members once you collect all the band members the song is ready

[02:12:33] but of course i will try to lock balls beforehand because i want the maximum amount of balls

[02:12:39] makes the song worth more and then you get into a song and you'll see an insane light show

[02:12:44] unbelievable and you can pick the song so pick pick live and let die bet what best light show

[02:12:50] so you pick that and you play and it tells you what to shoot there's like a little display in the back

[02:12:56] shoot these shoot these shots shoot these shots and you shoot them and you just keep going as long

[02:13:01] as you can and you can hit certain points you can hit as the saucer and it's there's a cash out do

[02:13:07] you want to cash out risk reward like no yeah risk reward do you cash out or do you push your push your

[02:13:12] look now if you drain out you've just lost everything but if you keep going you can get to a point

[02:13:18] where when the song is ending if you get it in there and the what five second period at the end of

[02:13:23] the song you get to go it catches it out and you get to go on core you go as to the next song automatically

[02:13:32] and you start on the next song so here's the thing every song although the objectives are different

[02:13:37] the animations are different the light show is different it all ends up being sort of the same thing

[02:13:44] right you shoot it around the play field you put it in the scoop do you want to cash out there's no

[02:13:49] making you happy it's like yeah like I don't know it's I have played a lot of this as well I have a

[02:13:55] friend with one of these and I have played a lot of this and it is impressive and it is awesome and

[02:13:59] it but it just again the the play field has a couple of shots that like the scoop is in a isn't

[02:14:06] isn't I'm oh I feel like I'm always in that scoop that makes me sad but this is a heck of a pin

[02:14:13] and if your guns and roses fan this better be in your collection like it is it is worth every

[02:14:18] penny it is impressive it's got lots going on in it it's fun it's you know but if you're expecting

[02:14:26] craziness like your regular Keith Johnson code it's kind of like here's the thing in jersey jacks

[02:14:33] world these alleys they're they're alleys they never really tell you what what is the what is the

[02:14:39] alley like how many it's supposed to be like 5,000 technically when they have an le yeah this one

[02:14:47] had a 5,000 well this one I still don't think they got the fight but they got as close to 5,000

[02:14:52] probably is is any game they've ever sold they sold a boatload they sold so many at the beginning

[02:14:59] they just ran out and then there was like delays trying to get him this is like Stern has issues

[02:15:04] keeping Godzilla you know it stopped or doing it cuz it's so popular this was there Godzilla they

[02:15:10] could not keep it could not build these fast enough they literally were not ready for the demand

[02:15:16] of this game I guess that's a testament to a few things one of them is the brand of Eric

[02:15:21] Minier he's you know his pirates of the Caribbean was such a great game that his follow-up game

[02:15:25] had a bit of a follow-up the access that they head with slash just the looks of the pin is beautiful

[02:15:32] it is it is crazy impressive but it has drumsticks for a whip why didn't anyone ever do that it's

[02:15:40] that's perfect why didn't anyone have spring video and the symbols it's got symbols on the pop

[02:15:45] bumper so when the pop bumpers go it's got like little symbols the guitar is the wire form why

[02:15:50] why didn't anyone do that you just see so obvious when you see it's like wow why didn't anyone do

[02:15:54] that before it's a really really really great pin is there anything about this pin that you wish

[02:15:59] was improved I mean it's to me it's funny this is like you consider this Jersey Jack games

[02:16:07] as whole games or games for the home for me this would be like my Jersey Jack location game yeah

[02:16:12] you want to yeah that's it like I want to go up I want to try to I want to lock as many

[02:16:17] bosses I can before I start a song I want to totally kill the song and get a huge jackpot and

[02:16:22] then I'm good I don't really need anymore I've had the experience I'm all set it's it is it is

[02:16:28] it's worth it it's it's a great it's a great pin a lot of people crap on it a lot of people

[02:16:32] love it it's somewhere in the middle guys like you know don't don't be all in or all out on

[02:16:37] something like play it and flip it and have a good time it's the greatest Jersey Jack game ever

[02:16:42] because it sold the most yeah absolutely that's that's that's any any owner I'll tell you that

[02:16:47] and that brings us to the end of our podcast this month Ron where we talked everything is lit
