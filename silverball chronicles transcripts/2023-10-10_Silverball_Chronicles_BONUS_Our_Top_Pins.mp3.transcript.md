[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silverball Chronicles.

[00:10] Nordman.

[00:11] What's my favorite?

[00:12] Nordman?

[00:13] I'm favorite.

[00:14] No, I don't like alien.

[00:15] We know.

[00:16] It's the pop-onper on Wizard of Oz.

[00:17] That's it.

[00:18] That's your favorite.

[00:19] That's it.

[00:20] That's the one.

[00:21] That's your favorite.

[00:22] That's your favorite.

[00:23] That's it.

[00:24] That's the one.

[01:21] The one who had the list of favorite podcasts and we were on it.

[01:32] That's right.

[01:33] alphabetically I might add.

[01:35] Oh.

[01:36] So we were sort of towards the middle.

[01:39] Oh, okay.

[01:40] You confuse me there.

[01:41] I thought alphabetically, I'm like, we don't start with A.

[01:44] We should start with A.

[01:45] We should start like ZZ-top.

[01:46] It could be B.

[01:47] Yeah.

[01:48] Yeah.

[01:49] Silverball Chronicles.

[01:50] Chronicles, yeah, I like it.

[01:52] Well, the kineticist wanted to know

[01:53] what our top five pinball machines are.

[01:56] Well, that's far too easy for us.

[01:58] Well, the problem with that is I'm on two podcasts

[02:01] and I'm slam to a podcast, this is the other one.

[02:04] And I'm gonna have to do this twice.

[02:06] So it's gonna be, for me, it's gonna be stupid

[02:08] if I just named the same five machines, both times.

[02:11] So we're gonna have to put a twist on it this.

[02:12] So yeah, I thought of an idea.

[02:15] An idea that we could name our top game

[02:19] from each of the designers that we have featured

[02:22] on Silver Ball Chronicles.

[02:24] Oh, so we're talking John Borg, George Gomez,

[02:27] Barry Ausler, John Papadoug, the Nordman himself,

[02:34] Steve Richie and Pat Lawler.

[02:36] So we have to give you the listener,

[02:40] our favorite pin from that designer.

[02:43] That's what you're getting at.

[02:44] Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.

[02:45] No, we didn't forget Wayne Nions,

[02:46] but he did so many games I can't decide.

[02:49] Yeah, hundreds of games.

[02:51] I'll say flipper clown.

[02:52] There, sounds good.

[02:53] Wow, I'm gonna do the one with the horse

[02:55] that kicks the cowboy the ass.

[02:57] That was a good one.

[02:58] Yeah, that is a good back box animation.

[03:01] Yes, so the other thing at the end,

[03:03] we're also gonna say what do we love most about pinball?

[03:07] And Ron, I'm sorry, it's not you.

[03:11] Oh, I'm sorry, it's not Canada either.

[03:15] No, that one really hurt.

[03:17] That was very mean.

[03:18] Well, you do have a manufacturer now, so.

[03:20] Well, let's not talk about that.

[03:22] Okay, let's go with John Borg, your favorite John Borg game,

[03:27] and it better be the same as mine.

[03:30] Maynapy, Metallica.

[03:32] No, damn it.

[03:33] I love me some Metallica.

[03:34] You love to chop some wood.

[03:37] It's fun chopping that wood.

[03:40] Just hack and slash into Sparky all day.

[03:42] Yep, it's got the left right ramps,

[03:44] like payback time stuff going on.

[03:47] What do they call it in that game?

[03:48] Lady Justice, I think that's what they call it.

[03:50] Yes, that's the one.

[03:51] Yep, it's got Sparky.

[03:53] Everything about it is cool.

[03:54] Wonderful game, love it.

[03:56] I really do love that game.

[03:57] I play a lot of that in my league as the listeners know.

[04:00] That's a good one.

[04:01] My John Borg design, probably the number one game on my list

[04:06] is clearly Tron, the greatest flow game of all time

[04:10] that isn't two flippers.

[04:13] Amazing Photoshop art package.

[04:16] A play field loaded with tons of mechanics

[04:19] at the spinning disc at a scoop.

[04:22] I mean, but the ramps though, Ron, the ramps

[04:25] in the lighting.

[04:26] And the lighting.

[04:29] So much lighting.

[04:30] Anyway, that's mine.

[04:32] That's not a surprise for anybody who listens to this podcast.

[04:34] Really, I thought it would be rush

[04:35] being here Canadian at all.

[04:37] No, I own or Tron, I gotta keep pumping

[04:40] the value of that pin up, my friend.

[04:42] Okay.

[04:43] What about George Gomez?

[04:45] This one I was thinking about,

[04:46] I'm kind of stuck between two.

[04:48] I have two on this,

[04:49] but I'm gonna go with the one that everybody knows

[04:51] I'm gonna choose.

[04:52] I'm gonna go with Deadpool.

[04:53] Yep, because that's a solid choice.

[04:55] It's just super fun.

[04:57] With the honorable mention to his best shooting game,

[05:00] Johnny D'Amontic.

[05:01] Wow, Johnny.

[05:02] With the coolest toy, the glove.

[05:04] What's the best thing of Deadpool?

[05:08] The whole package.

[05:10] It does come together as a whole package.

[05:12] Yeah, individually each piece is kind of okay.

[05:15] You put them all together, it's a brilliant machine.

[05:17] And all that crazy music,

[05:19] all the different things.

[05:20] I love, what is it, the Katana Ramma music?

[05:24] The one that sounds like some kind of like,

[05:27] you're a carnival.

[05:28] Duh, duh, duh, da, dak, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, doo,

[05:34] I love that, I love that.

[05:36] I'm gonna go with the pin that everybody

[05:38] is gonna generally go with,

[05:40] with a very good shout out to Deadpool, by the way,

[05:44] as the close runner up for me.

[05:45] I'm choosing Lord of the Rings.

[05:48] Another pin where the entire package

[05:51] come in together from the callouts,

[05:53] the sound, the music, the DMD.

[05:56] Everything aside from kind of the,

[05:57] the generations art back in those modern DMDs.

[06:03] What more can you say about Lord of the Rings?

[06:05] It's got the mechs, it's got the flow,

[06:08] it's got a diverter.

[06:09] It's got the callouts.

[06:11] Jackpot one!

[06:12] Jackpot two!

[06:14] I got it, love that.

[06:17] I was doing that at, at Pintastic.

[06:21] I was playing Lord of the Rings

[06:22] and I was yelling that out.

[06:24] This fare is beyond any of you.

[06:29] Run!

[06:31] What about Ausler?

[06:32] This one I did have a hard time with

[06:33] because Ausler doesn't have a whole lot of games

[06:36] that I think are like absolute smashes,

[06:38] but he has like the most amazing B-level games

[06:42] that is consistent across this entire career.

[06:44] What did you put there?

[06:45] Other than Wayne Nions,

[06:46] he probably has the most games in the last few years.

[06:48] Yeah.

[06:50] I like, I love dirty Harry.

[06:52] Yep, it's a good one.

[06:54] I embarrassed myself greatly

[06:56] during the Pintastic Tournament on dirty Harry

[06:58] in which everybody saw on stream

[07:00] because I was drinking.

[07:03] How about my choice?

[07:05] I mean, come on.

[07:06] Brahm Stoker's Dracula.

[07:08] Ah, yes.

[07:09] BSD.

[07:11] It's got the mechs, it's got the ramp,

[07:12] it's got the physical ball lock,

[07:14] it's got Kiana Reeves.

[07:15] Did you ask anymore?

[07:16] It doesn't have Kiana Reeves.

[07:18] It does have you by the extra plastic.

[07:20] The extra plastic, they had to remove.

[07:23] Because they didn't have the rights to his likeness.

[07:25] Is his voice in there though?

[07:28] I don't know.

[07:29] That's that weird part of his career

[07:30] where he's like,

[07:32] are you always billin' Ted or is that how you act?

[07:35] Whoa.

[07:37] Sorry.

[07:38] And it has great callouts, you know.

[07:40] 13 million.

[07:44] Love my bats and my rats.

[07:45] Yeah.

[07:46] Love the bats and my rats.

[07:47] Papa Duke.

[07:48] John Papa Duke.

[07:50] J-Pop.

[07:51] That is the easiest one, World Cup Soccer.

[07:54] Okay.

[07:55] Okay, and you're choosing that because of the rules.

[07:58] Ah, I mean, I'm choosing that

[08:00] because I think it's the best game.

[08:02] Okay, shoots really great.

[08:03] I mean, striker, come on.

[08:04] I can't even like the World Cup pup.

[08:08] Go!

[08:10] The callouts again.

[08:11] Ah, so good.

[08:12] So good.

[08:13] So good.

[08:14] And we'll get to the callouts again.

[08:15] That was done by...

[08:16] That's Tim Kittsrow.

[08:17] Tim Kittsrow, we'll get to Tim Kittsrow again in the list.

[08:21] But I'm gonna go theater of magic.

[08:26] I love theater of magic.

[08:27] I know the rules are a little bit not that great,

[08:31] but it's got the pop-up seller trunk thing.

[08:35] It has the turning trunk with the multiple states

[08:38] and the sneak in the ball in the back and the ramps

[08:40] and the magnets that move it off of the ramp

[08:42] and onto another ramp.

[08:43] Oh, you know the most amazing thing about that game?

[08:45] Is that pop-up the squeak it makes?

[08:47] Is the exact same squeak on every single theater of magic?

[08:51] I don't know how that's possible.

[08:53] It's a design.

[08:54] It's a design squeak.

[08:56] So you know it's coming.

[08:57] Love me some theater of magic.

[08:59] Wonderful art package.

[09:02] Just what an awesome theme.

[09:04] I will give honorable mention of Circus Valter.

[09:06] Yeah, Circus Valter is pretty good as well,

[09:08] but I find it it...

[09:10] The ball goes awry, pretty easy in Circus Valter.

[09:13] Where theater of magic is just like...

[09:16] Just butter wrapped in bacon.

[09:18] So smooth.

[09:19] How about the Nord man himself?

[09:22] Dennis, Norman.

[09:23] For me, that's easy.

[09:25] It's in my basement.

[09:26] It is demolition man.

[09:28] Yeah, okay, because you like him wide.

[09:31] It's not really wide.

[09:32] I mean, it is wide, but it isn't.

[09:34] It's the narrowest playing wide body ever made.

[09:36] Yeah, that's a good one.

[09:37] I find it grindy, but I mean, that's kind of of the era,

[09:41] right, those Valley Williams D&Ds are kind of grindy now

[09:44] when you look back.

[09:46] How is it grindy?

[09:47] Well, you got to shoot the ramps

[09:50] and you got to collect the yellow light

[09:52] or the orange light.

[09:53] And then when you do that, you shoot it up,

[09:55] you put it in the claw, the claw into the...

[09:57] It's okay.

[09:58] Because when a wizard modes are easy to get to,

[10:01] so to me, that's the opposite of grindy.

[10:03] Well, yeah, but it's like that.

[10:07] If theater imagines the same thing, right,

[10:08] shoot this shot.

[10:09] Don't question me, Ron.

[10:11] My Nordman, I'm gonna go with something

[10:15] that I've played quite a bit.

[10:17] And I mean, no, it's not obviously his white water,

[10:22] which is friggin' brilliant and all of that showed up to that.

[10:25] I'm going El Vira House of Horrors.

[10:29] I really, really enjoy that game.

[10:32] Now that it is a complete package, it's all come together.

[10:36] It's, I'm not a very good pinball player,

[10:38] so shooting wide open ramps is awesome.

[10:42] Those plastic ramps feel great.

[10:44] It's got cool max in it.

[10:47] The art package is unbelievable by Greg Ferris.

[10:52] And it's Lyman's last game, Lyman Sheets.

[10:56] And it has Torgo in it.

[10:59] From the famous Manos, the Hens of Faith.

[11:03] That's the one Manos, the Hens of Faith.

[11:06] Okay, Steve Richie.

[11:09] This one was hard, because it was a point where I had,

[11:12] almost my whole collection was Steve Richie Games.

[11:15] I'll pick one of the ones I still have.

[11:17] Get away.

[11:18] Yeah, good one.

[11:20] So we were on our way to Pintastic, my wife and I,

[11:23] we stopped in Portland, Maine.

[11:27] And we went to...

[11:29] Arcadia, the downtown core there.

[11:32] And we played the getaway.

[11:34] And my wife immediately went after playing her first ball.

[11:38] That is an awesome game.

[11:39] So there you go.

[11:41] I guess I should call the getaway high speed part two,

[11:44] with the official man.

[11:46] It's got ZZ top.

[11:48] You take the play field from the first one,

[11:49] you add a supercharger, get some ZZ top in there,

[11:52] and the coolest super jackpot call out ever.

[11:56] I love the ball locked to on the right side donut,

[11:58] heaven the way the ball goes up and then into it.

[12:02] So good.

[12:03] So good.

[12:04] The white Sullivan's code with the blinking and the lights.

[12:11] I better not harm that we might get pulled.

[12:13] Yes, yeah, you know, what are they call that DCM,

[12:16] DCA or YMCA or WKRP.

[12:23] Okay, T2, that's my Steve Richie.

[12:27] The first two flipper fan layout, two ramp,

[12:32] right to left shots, absolute masterpiece.

[12:36] Do the thing on steroids into the cannon

[12:41] through the skull lock, a vertical up kicker.

[12:44] Ah, love this game.

[12:46] God, I want one of these games,

[12:48] but I can't find one and they're fairly pricey when you

[12:51] really.

[12:51] Really?

[12:52] Because they're like, they made 10,000 plus of them.

[12:55] You think you'd be able to find them

[12:56] and they made a ton of those games.

[12:59] You live in a country with like three or 400 million people.

[13:02] Uh, yeah.

[13:03] Doesn't everyone?

[13:04] Oh, I don't.

[13:06] But you have the same surface area we do.

[13:08] You're too spread out.

[13:09] That's, that's right.

[13:10] That's right.

[13:11] The same surface area.

[13:12] I will say this, it is funny that any game that has the

[13:15] left right ramp thing, where it returns to you,

[13:17] I just call it payback time.

[13:19] No matter what game is it, no matter what it,

[13:20] it's called in the game.

[13:22] I always call it payback time.

[13:23] And the swearing ROM that they put in?

[13:26] No.

[13:26] With the mystery.

[13:28] Ah, so much fun.

[13:29] And I love it.

[13:30] It just shoots up and it pops out into the pop bumpers.

[13:33] And it's not easy.

[13:34] It is, it is difficult.

[13:37] So awesome.

[13:39] Let's close it out with Pat Lawler.

[13:41] What's your favorite Pat Lawler?

[13:43] You know, I have a Pat Lawler, but I won't say it's that one.

[13:48] I will say whirlwind with an honorable mention to a guilty

[13:54] pleasure of mine, Roachio.

[13:56] Roachio.

[13:58] Don't tell anybody that.

[13:59] Let's rip some rope.

[14:01] Got it.

[14:02] I'm all worn out.

[14:03] Party time.

[14:06] My wife and I played that at Fantastic and she hated it.

[14:10] Oh.

[14:11] But I'm telling you what, I'm going to go with something very

[14:14] similar as my favorite Pat Lawler.

[14:15] This one holds quite a glimmer within my heart.

[14:20] No, it's not dialed in.

[14:21] That's the closest one in there.

[14:23] We're talking fun house.

[14:26] Rudy.

[14:27] Rudy is awesome.

[14:29] The mechanics behind Rudy is amazing.

[14:33] The ramp is fun.

[14:34] The ball lock on the left side.

[14:36] It's got hot dogs in it.

[14:39] I love hot dogs.

[14:40] Give yourself a hot dog.

[14:42] In the midnight he sleeps.

[14:43] He snores is the coding that had to go into all of that

[14:48] with the quivering jaw.

[14:51] The vision of I want to shoot a weird dummy in the face.

[14:57] Amazing.

[14:58] Any other honorable mentions in there?

[15:01] Among those designers, I mean, there's lots of honorable

[15:04] mentions, but I think I got through them all.

[15:08] Great.

[15:09] So what do you love most about pinball, Ron?

[15:13] Don't say me.

[15:14] Let's spread it out a bit.

[15:15] Oh, OK.

[15:16] Hold on, I'll have to cross that out.

[15:18] Yeah.

[15:19] I had Canadians as the second thing too.

[15:21] So I got to cross that out.

[15:22] Sorry.

[15:23] Keep rolling.

[15:24] Keep rolling.

[15:25] What do I like most about pinball?

[15:27] That it's a physical game that I can also work on.

[15:33] You like to tinker?

[15:34] That was probably the initial impetus.

[15:37] Did I say that right?

[15:38] Impetus.

[15:39] Yeah, the initial impetus.

[15:40] The initial impetus.

[15:42] No.

[15:43] Oh, sorry.

[15:46] I'm going to say something very similar.

[15:49] I very much love that it is a physical random analog

[15:59] experience, as opposed to a very digital-based experience.

[16:06] So I'm a little bit younger than you, Ron.

[16:08] And I've almost exclusively grown up in a digital world.

[16:13] Digital video games.

[16:14] You hit the A button.

[16:15] You always jumps.

[16:17] This thing always comes out from that direction.

[16:19] And at all those times, we play those games.

[16:22] So it being an actual physical thing with a solenoid that literally moves a device or

[16:28] a target is very exciting and appealing to me.

[16:33] Is that nostalgia of the previous world?

[16:36] How's that?

[16:37] Sounds great.

[16:39] I think that's it.

[16:41] And Ron, where can people find us if they're looking for more information they want to hear

[16:46] more and they want to join our Patreon?

[16:48] Well, they should just head on over to silverballacronicles.com.

[16:53] And as Patreon.com slash silverballacronicles.

[16:57] Thanks for listening to our wonderful mix of top five, which really wasn't a top five.

[17:02] And what we love about pinball.

[17:04] Enjoy yourself at pinball.

[17:05] Expo, everybody.

[17:06] And our next episode is coming out shortly.

[17:09] Do you want to give them a preview of what that's about, Ron?

[17:12] Our next episode is full of tight but findable shots.

[17:15] Ooh.

[17:16] Very well done.

[17:18] Thanks for watching.

[17:19] I'll see you guys next time.

[17:20] Bye.

[18:48] Oh, I see you have stayed for the bonus episode bloopers.

[18:57] I'm Larry, the Chronicles AI.

[19:00] Hello there.

[19:02] Sadly there are no bloopers in this bonus episode.

[19:05] I'm shocked you didn't know that Dave is pretty lazy these days.

[19:09] Seriously though, this was only a short episode what do you expect?

[19:14] As you can tell by the quality, Dave didn't put much work into editing.

[19:18] He didn't keep anything interesting for the bloopers.

[19:21] Usually, he keeps all the parts and edits them in.

[19:25] Dave even keeps that bits where Ron says terrible things about people for future use.

[19:29] He didn't even do that.

[19:32] Poor Dennis Creasel, Ron really doesn't like you.

[19:35] Alright, go away now.

[19:37] There is nothing else here please leave.
