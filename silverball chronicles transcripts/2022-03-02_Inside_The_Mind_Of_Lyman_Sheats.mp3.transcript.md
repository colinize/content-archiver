[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching. Silver ball chronicles.

[00:10] Did you hear that? What? My like assistant went off on my laptop. I didn't even know my laptop

[00:22] had an assistant. Is it a paperclip? No, it's like a lady. Okay. Good. Okay. I'll have

[00:28] to cut that out.

[00:58] Hello everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me this month

[01:06] like every month is my co-hostess with the mostest. Ron Sinbad Hallet. How you doing, fella?

[01:13] Good morning. Yeah. Somebody was at Indisk out in the California area and put on a clinic

[01:20] didn't they? What's Indisk? Indisk is some sort of tournament out west.

[01:26] Oh, everyone just turned off the episode. It's a shame. If you want to listen to boring

[01:31] tournament talk, go listen to Joel Boring his heck Engelbirth's triple drain podcast. Yeah,

[01:36] I played some Sinbad. It was fun. So you were on stream while I was watching. I tuned in and

[01:43] I saw you just absolutely lay down the law on the Gottlieb System 1 masterpiece Sinbad. I love Sinbad.

[01:55] Such a great game. What was great is is they started streaming us mid game. And one of the guys

[02:00] in our group was like, oh man, I don't want to be on stream. So I just looked at the stream and

[02:05] saw there's like 460 something people watching. So I'm like, don't worry. Only like 460 people are

[02:11] watching. Look at you playing the mind games. I thought it was funny. You the puppet, the puppet

[02:18] machine right there. Hey, look at you. The best part was Elazarus on stream. It was. That

[02:24] although impressive, the the control you had was really impressive. And if you want to learn more

[02:29] about how awesome Sinbad is go check out our Gottlieb System 1 episode stepping on rakes. I think

[02:35] is what we call that episode. And it was one heck of a one heck of a show. I have to say that. So

[02:41] you've been doing a boatload of tournaments. I guess you could say that. Yeah, you've been playing

[02:46] a lot of weeks, which is one of the reasons why we're a little bit late this month. The other

[02:51] thing is that we decided to change our topic just as we began to record and I had to build out a

[02:56] whole episode. But I'll tell you a award season is upon us. We've seen all the Twippy voting is done.

[03:04] So thank you everybody who is voted for silver ball chronicles in the Twippies. And of course,

[03:09] if you wanted to split the vote, you voted for slam tilt as well. So thank you so much for all of

[03:15] that. Yes, slam tilt my other podcast that my podcast mate will yell at me if I don't mention it.

[03:20] Yeah, yeah. Bruce what's his name? Bruce what's his name? My co host. Yes. Yeah. Bruce what's

[03:25] his name and the other fell on slam tilt podcast. We also picked up a strong second place in the pinball

[03:33] industry awards with silver ball chronicles. So my objective of joining TPN and manipulating

[03:41] everybody into creating an award show and then giving myself an award is almost complete.

[03:48] So I'm very excited for that. How about you, Ron? Second is cool. Second is cool. Second is

[03:54] first place for losers, according to skull from no fear. We've also got of course the archive

[04:01] for our shows in the backlog in the back catalog. If you want to check that out, go over to

[04:06] silverball chronicles.com or search for us in your pod catcher with silver ball chronicles and

[04:11] you can go back and listen to some of those old episodes. Please be warned. The first few episodes

[04:16] pretty rocky. Second episode is all about stern electronics because Ron made me do that one to

[04:22] boost up the value of his machines. And then after that, it just generally goes up in quality.

[04:28] Of course, you can swing on over to Facebook to facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles to chat with

[04:33] us. I tossed up some posts every now and then and it's wonderful to hear from you. If you found

[04:39] us on a pod catcher, iTunes basically anything but Spotify because I can't get us on to Spotify because

[04:45] of some really annoying background stuff that doesn't really matter. Feel free to leave us a five-star

[04:51] review. That way we can be found by a bunch of other people. You can't get us Spotify is weird.

[04:59] Yeah, it's some sort of background thing where it tries to pull like the album art or something

[05:03] that doesn't work but every other pod catcher does. I thought you were going to say

[05:06] background check like you feel some kind of thing. They let slam tilt on there. Yeah, well that's

[05:12] the bars fairly low over on Spotify. Darin V over on this week in pinballs promoter database

[05:20] that's this week in pinball.com slash silver ball hyphen chronicles says great podcasts highlighting

[05:28] the historic and memorable events of pinball. Ron and David make an excellent pair going through

[05:34] pinballs most memorable events leading industry figures and errors of pinball these in-depth reviews

[05:41] of past games significant events and unusual tidbits scattered throughout pinball history make

[05:47] this a unique pinball podcast not seen since top cast where I steal a lot of our content from by

[05:53] the way. David's extensive research wow thank you so much and Ron's history in the hobby

[06:01] combine a wonderful podcast experience each person brings a unique flavor spelled in

[06:07] correctly and banter between the hosts of a memorable listening experience. I would highly

[06:13] recommend this show for anyone new to the hobby and listeners interested in a specific era

[06:18] company or creator. So thank you very much Darin W very good you're awesome at research and I'm

[06:26] awesome at just being old. I'll tell you the Lazarus on Sid bad was epic back in 2022.

[06:38] I'm old. That's my that's my Ron voice. Yeah I'm sitting here at my let's see my heating pad on my

[06:44] ice pack on my back so if this is my normal setup I'm ready to go. Do you have do you have reading

[06:50] glasses on? Oh yes. Oh yes I have I have my bifullacles on down on the nose or I can read the uh oh no

[06:58] uh oh well also I can read these awesome show notes you have with all the misspellings.

[07:04] So let's jump into today's topic Ron. There are many stars inside the pinball industry but few

[07:13] create an emotional ripple as large as Lyman Sheets when he passed away. Lyman Sheets gave so much to

[07:19] pinball and always wanted to give more a perfectionist who was often too hard on himself. Lyman was

[07:26] always looking for ways to improve the code on his games. Lyman F Sheets Jr. was a dominant

[07:33] tournament player who joined the industry as a programmer when the dot matrix revolution began.

[07:41] He worked to evolve pinball rules and strategy well beyond what came before him.

[07:47] Lyman was a master of balance and deep tactical scoring all while keeping the casual player excited.

[07:56] This month we dive into the mind of Lyman Sheets. What's your first memory of Lyman Sheets?

[08:03] Ron like his code or a machine or the first time you knew of him. Uh honestly probably the top

[08:10] cast interview and just seeing him at a tournament with that weird stance he had. Yeah so my first

[08:15] memory I've been in the hobby for quite a few years now not as many of you because you're old

[08:21] but I didn't know who Lyman Sheets was for the longest time until I played Metallica and then I was

[08:28] like man this game's something crazy and the person next to me was like oh it's a Lyman Sheets game

[08:32] and I'm like well what do the heck does that mean? And he's like oh man all my favorite games are

[08:36] Lyman Sheets and then of course he would explain who Lyman Sheets was. At that point I was like wow

[08:41] okay I get it because there was something inherently different about the way he codes a game

[08:46] that I didn't know it was somebody I didn't know on every one of those games that I kind of enjoyed

[08:52] Metallica attack for Mars Medieval madness where I was like okay there's some there's a fingerprint

[08:58] here that's very similar Lyman wasn't one of those guys who started playing pinball at the age of

[09:03] three or these teenagers that dominate the tournament scene nowadays Ron. In fact he didn't pick up

[09:10] pinball until college Lyman says I saw a couple of guys playing eight ball deluxe and they're

[09:16] absolutely killing the game playing and winning all kinds of credits and playing back and forth

[09:20] that appealed to me there was skill in pinball. So the first thing I think when a lot of people

[09:26] get into pinball or play pinball or whatever they think it's very random right they think it's

[09:32] the person who can keep the ball from going down the drain longer is better but Lyman almost

[09:39] immediately could kind of identify that there was a certain level of skill and knowledge that you

[09:44] needed and I think that that inevitably led to a lot of his programming changes he wasn't good

[09:52] apparently in his first little while and he watched and played a lot to improve and of course

[09:59] he played in a place called Framing to Framingham Massachusetts Framingham Massachusetts. Massachusetts

[10:07] Massachusetts. I'll say he played in Framingham Massachusetts at fun and games. I wonder if that's

[10:13] still there. There's a place that's in Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Wow I didn't know

[10:21] with the Canadian pronunciation of Massachusetts so difficult. It's so hard word man. Just think of

[10:27] the song The Spirit of Massachusetts is the spirit of America. Oh you probably never seen that commercial.

[10:32] No I have no idea what that is. So I'm sure that that are some some evolve there's some there's

[10:38] one of those play centers out there that's still there that's a big deal. I can't remember what it is.

[10:42] If you don't if you know what it is or if you know a fun and games is still there shoot us an email

[10:47] silver ball chronicles at gmail.com and I'm thinking there's probably a lot of different arcades name

[10:52] fun and games that seems like that would be a common name. Yeah yeah it's like Flynn's arcade. I'm

[10:59] sure there's a billion of those around. Lime and went to college at Northeastern University where

[11:04] he majored in computer science. Is Northeastern like a big university out that way? It's not small.

[11:12] I it's I think they have a lot of famous alumni. Computer science professors they mostly came over

[11:18] from the math department at the time. Because back in sort of the 80s late 80s 90s a lot of the computer

[11:26] science. I don't know programs and structures were being developed. So there was a lot of

[11:32] introductory material because of course a math teacher is going to lean on what they know which is

[11:38] of course math. And he said he learned a lot of basic data structures Pascal Fortran compilers

[11:47] artificial intelligence databases. I know those are words. Ron you're in IT. Do you know any of those

[11:54] words? Well basic Pascal Fortran or languages. I mean a compiler is you know you compile code.

[12:04] Artificial intelligence is just AI and databases are pretty self explanatory. Yeah okay so those are

[12:11] things that people that know a lot about computers know. Very cool. So he's learning computer things.

[12:19] Good for him. What did you take in college Ron? Uh what did I take? Micro computer systems

[12:25] management management computer programming. Cool. Yeah so how was what was your experience?

[12:33] I didn't really have much of an experience. I mean I went to classes that I went home.

[12:37] There good for you. I quite quite boring. Well I'm it says college was hard but one of the best

[12:45] experiences of my life. It's not like I was this big college party dude or whatever but it was just

[12:50] a very stress-free relaxing time for me. It's just a very fun environment. Anybody who has that

[12:56] opportunity to go to school and learn should definitely take advantage of it. I think if I could

[13:00] do absolutely anything I wanted to do in life I probably just go back to school full-time. It's

[13:06] just a very relaxing atmosphere. You get to learn. To me that's one of the best things in life.

[13:11] Never stop learning. My university career was not absolutely stress-free and easy going. I

[13:20] struggled. I really had to work really really really hard because I'm not naturally very good at

[13:26] you know reading or writing or things like that. I really had a hard time. So when I read something

[13:31] like this it's like man this guy really just cruised through computer science which is not easy

[13:39] with like a bunch of professors who are major math oriented calculus folk. So already I can sort of

[13:48] peel from from this old top cast interview that that lineman is pretty laid back and really really

[13:55] intelligent. So he would play whirlwind, earth shaker, f14 and of course the game that he loved

[14:01] the most. Steve Richie's high speed. Ron high speed comes up over and over and over again as a

[14:10] massive inspiration for a lot of these programmers and designers. It does. Limeman actually has

[14:18] Steve Richie's high speed. The actual game that Steve Richie bought and owned four years

[14:25] was sold to Dwight Sullivan who then sold it to lineman sheets. So as most of the computer math

[14:33] nerd folk lineman would gravitate towards the tournament pinball scene. So his friend Dallas

[14:41] overturf was the 1980 Connecticut state champion and Dallas would of course go on in later years to

[14:50] play at expo and a lot of those big tournaments. And one day Dallas was asked by some of his tournament

[14:56] friends who LFS was because these initials were on a lot of machines in the area LFS is lineman

[15:06] F sheets initials that he would put on any game where he would set a high score. So if you notice on

[15:13] any of your machines that some of the default high scores or LFS that's for lineman F sheets.

[15:20] Limeman met a lot of these folks around 1988 who said that he should come out to some of the state

[15:27] championships and he should also come to this new thing called pinball expo. So back in this day,

[15:35] Ron it's very different of course the tournament scene that it is today. It was about four tournaments

[15:41] a year. Nowadays it's almost like four tournaments a week or in the case of the pinball collective

[15:49] in Rochester for events in a day. And you didn't have to chase IFPA whopper points back then either.

[15:57] Now they didn't exist. So tournaments back then were more

[16:03] simple I guess a little more straight forward. A little more head to head as opposed to all these

[16:10] crazy different formats and stuff nowadays. Well the pinball expo the tournament would generally be

[16:15] on whatever the new game was that was coming out. So a lot of times the players hadn't even seen the

[16:21] game ever interesting. Yeah. Very cool. lineman would graduate from university and he would work a

[16:27] couple of years at draper labs in Cambridge. He would also go and work in Norfolk, Virginia for

[16:34] MITRE a government funded defense contract research firm. It was a very academic environment.

[16:41] He actually worked in the Langley Air Force Base which seems kind of fancy for a person who's

[16:46] only ever heard of Langley from spy movies. He had a lot more free time with a job as opposed to

[16:52] going to classes all that time. And this is where lineman decided to finally play at pinball expo

[16:59] in 1991. But he hadn't really played pinball in a long while and was very much out of practice.

[17:06] lineman says I hadn't played in a long time. It's kind of hard to go back to play. It's kind of like

[17:12] riding a bicycle but some skills take a while to refine again. We went out to Chicago and had a great

[17:17] time. It was a lot of fun. I played in an tournament but I did not qualify. So at the time to qualify,

[17:24] you had to really finish in the top eight. We're now like what's qualifying usually Ron?

[17:29] 16, 32, there's enough people and they have multiple divisions which they didn't have then.

[17:34] Yeah. So you got like eight division or B division based on where you fall, right? So there's

[17:38] multiple levels of final. Basically, if you didn't finish top eight and in this interview,

[17:44] lineman actually said that he'd basically just miss out on the top eight. So here's a guy.

[17:49] He hasn't really played a whole lot of pinball in a couple of years or a couple of months.

[17:53] At a practice. And he just barely doesn't get into the top eight of everybody who's come to

[17:59] Chicago in the industry. That's some serious skill level. The most important thing that happened

[18:07] here, Ron was that he met Larry DeMar, who is one of the programmers at Williams,

[18:13] while he was at expo that year. Making the key contact of Larry DeMar, of course, would pay

[18:18] dividends later on. lineman decided he needed more practice. So after that, he went back,

[18:24] he played a lot more on location. He decided to buy his own Adams family because he wanted to play

[18:30] in practice on it. But all of the machines on location were usually crap. They of course had,

[18:39] they were leaning. They needed flipper rebuilds or the ramp was broken or something,

[18:44] but he didn't want to deal with that. He wanted his own machine. So somebody just kind of going

[18:49] out and buying their own machine in the in the early 90s was a pretty unique thing. He probably

[18:55] got it from an operator. I doubt if he would have got it from a distributor. Through 1992, lineman was

[19:01] Mr. Second Place finishing just outside the number one position in all of the tournaments that he

[19:07] played in. One thing that's particularly interesting and we've seen a lot of this since lineman's passing

[19:13] is the lineman stance. Can you kind of describe that a little bit? There was almost multiple

[19:17] stances, but they generally were him getting extremely low to the game with his face almost on the glass.

[19:24] Yeah. So his butt is a way out and his face is a way down. It looked very uncomfortable and something

[19:29] that if if I tried it, I might not be able to get up after like five minutes. He was incredibly

[19:38] methodical when it came to playing. He'd catch the ball. He'd wait. He didn't play on the fly.

[19:45] So he's down there. He's catching that ball. He's got his face to the glass and he's just aiming it

[19:50] up just exactly where it needed to be. And he just did that where I think a lot of players, myself

[19:56] included, tend to be a little more like no patience. So we're always moving it. This odd position

[20:04] that he would play in, Mike Vinicore, who's from Stern, would actually call it the snake.

[20:11] Because he's like slithering down there. Very cool. Cool name. So while living in Virginia,

[20:16] Lyman won the 1993 Papa Championship, which I believe back then I think it was in New York City.

[20:23] So what was what's Papa? The Professional and Amateur Pinball Association.

[20:27] Yes. And that was started by Roger Sharp and Steve Epstein.

[20:33] Right. Who were really sort of the the tournament gods at the time. They were the ones that sort of

[20:39] tried to gather and all together for their excitement to play pinball. Papa was a really,

[20:44] really, really big deal until 2020. See that Williams sent him out to Las Vegas. Did you

[20:48] demonstrations on their games? You played Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black Lagoon and Dracula.

[20:53] So people could see all the features. Really, really, really cool. So that kind of one of the things

[20:59] was that he was so good and he could, you know, see these like wizard modes and fun things and

[21:04] blow up the scores and play almost effortlessly. They decided to bring him out to display his

[21:11] games. It's kind of funny, right? When when you watch a lot of the players nowadays on streams,

[21:19] like when Stern does their reveal streams, we're talking like top 25 players of all time showing

[21:25] you the features of the game. And then you get somebody like myself there. It would just be a

[21:31] train wreck. I wouldn't be like nobody would want to buy the game because it would look so bad

[21:35] because I'm not very good. Or they could get somebody like Ron and he could just put on a clinic,

[21:40] right Ron? Oh, yeah, sure. So there was a really cool piece that Leonard, oh, good lord. What is

[21:49] this guy's name Leonard Mosquery Delo? Let's see. You're Italian. You get this. Mosquery Tolo.

[21:58] Mosquery Tolo. That sounds good. Hey, come eat the salami. Oh boy, I apologize to all Italians.

[22:07] There was a great little article that he had written and I think it was in Play Meter magazine back

[22:11] in the early 90s where it spoke about Lyman and winning the 1993 pop a championship. And there's

[22:20] this this old like black and white like 90s photo. It's fantastic of Lyman holding the trophy. And

[22:27] he's just has this massive smile on his face. One of the things that I found particularly interesting

[22:33] about this piece was that it has a couple of really kind of neat quotes. One of them is

[22:41] if you still doubt who is the best player in the world, don't ever forget the emotion that

[22:48] transformed into tears. The moment he heard his name officially announced as the 1993 pop a

[22:55] world champion. Then next down here it says Lyman Sheets will change this sport as we know it

[23:04] because he loves it. There will never be a world champion better suited for the title and never

[23:12] one more capable of sending this great pastime on the right track. So why I read that Ron is that

[23:21] back in 1993 before Lyman has done anything. It's already kind of plant. He's already planted

[23:30] those seeds which generally say he's going to do something special in pinball. And boy oh boy,

[23:36] did he ever. So one of those aforementioned Vegas trips we was doing a demonstration for William

[23:41] he flew back to the east coast and he happened to be sitting next to Daddy East Lonnie Rob who he

[23:47] met at the Vegas convention. And Lonnie Rob was one of the original programmers at Daddy East.

[23:53] So Lyman figured out that he had the skills the industry could use and it dawned on him. He could

[23:58] help make pinball machines. So he sent his resume to Larry DeMarit Williams and Lonnie Rob at Daddy East.

[24:05] Williams didn't call because his line would find out years later from Ted Estes. Ted didn't

[24:09] hire Lyman because he thought he was too academic from his work experience. It wouldn't do well in

[24:13] the deadline driven Williams pressure cooker. That's a good point. We spoke about sort of the shark tank

[24:18] in a lot of our other episodes where like there's timelines and pressure and you got Steve Richie

[24:24] Yelena. Yeah. You got guys like Pat Lawler who are just demanding perfection on a timeline and

[24:30] pushing the envelope with mechanics and programming. Like you've got all this pressure pressure pressure

[24:35] you know Ted Estes kind of assumed because Lyman spent all this time sort of being an academic

[24:41] thinker and a cushy government kind of funded job. He wouldn't be able to do that. That was when

[24:46] Joe Kamenkao called and he flew Lyman to Chicago and Daddy East offered him a job and immediately

[24:54] put him on his first project the who's Tommy pinball wizard based off of the Broadway play.

[25:02] Yes, the Broadway play the licensed rock musical theme because nothing says pinball like a musical.

[25:10] Well, this one I'd say yeah. Yeah, totally. This is totally different because it literally is about

[25:15] pinball. January 1994. This is a Daddy East version three. It sells 4,700 units designed by Joe

[25:24] Kamenkao and Ed Cabella. I think it's so Cabula. Cabula. I think it's a Bula. I think it's an S.

[25:32] Designed by Joe Kamenkao and Ed Cabula. This is Art by Marcus Rothkran's.

[25:38] Dot animation by Kurt Anderson and Jack Lydon. Lydon. Sounded music by Brian Schmidt. Software by

[25:47] Lonnie Robb, Lyman F. Sheets Jr. and John Carpenter because this was the time of his career

[25:54] when he just wasn't doing that great after the thing. Yeah, I don't think it's that John Carpenter.

[25:59] Interesting Brian Schmidt because he moved over from Williams. The artist of this

[26:05] Marcus Rothkran's who is the sort of famous slash infamous painter art guy. He did a lot of

[26:15] the work for Daddy East in this time and I'm going to have to tell you not my favorite artist when

[26:21] it comes to pinball art, but this time pretty pretty good. Pretty pretty pretty good.

[26:29] The music and lyrics by Pete Townsend. It's based on the 1969 rock opera Tommy by The Who.

[26:38] It premiered in July 1st 1992 in the famous musical area that everybody knows in the United States.

[26:47] San Diego La Joya playhouse, but eventually ended up in Broadway. Broadway in 1993. It did London's West End,

[26:56] which is very fancy as well, 1996, and then it would play again in London's West End in 2015.

[27:03] It actually won five Tony Awards. Tony Awards, of course, only second to the Varnie Cup.

[27:11] Okay. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. No one's going to know what that means.

[27:16] So of course all the rules are linemons, right? He's on the thing. This is his first machine. He

[27:22] comes in. He kills it. No. No. But lineman did a lot of the code in that Daddy East time. No.

[27:29] He was hired to do all the dot matrix display programming. Okay. So he didn't do the dot matrix art.

[27:35] He didn't do the game rules. He just did the dot matrix display programming. So

[27:42] when Joe Kamenkao picked up the license to the musical Tommy, they had six weeks to get the

[27:46] machine up and running. And lineman needed to get that DMD working. Of course, at this time,

[27:54] Ron, everybody knows the DMD at Daddy East had its own CPU, which was 6803 language. I have no

[28:04] idea what that means. And lineman had to learn that programming language in record time.

[28:11] I believe that's the chip 6803 that the CPU, it had its own CPU as opposed to the William system,

[28:16] which it just had one CPU on the CPU board that ran everything. Daddy East needed it. They had

[28:23] a separate one on the on the actual display. Yeah, it's like it wasn't smart enough to tell it to

[28:28] do both things. They needed to do it. If you had to like if you had new code, a lot of times you'd

[28:32] have to replace the the DMD code also, which is kind of a pain. Yeah. So we'll talk about the

[28:40] Daddy East board set in greater detail when we eventually do our Daddy East episode and shout out

[28:45] to one of our viewers who helped us out with a lot of the research on that. So thank you so much.

[28:50] And we'll break that down because the Daddy East board set was somewhat interesting.

[28:55] It was somewhat ripped off and then kind of morphed from there.

[28:59] But I'll tell you the excitement of being in pinball. I mean, he was no longer in a government

[29:06] funded cubicle. Lime and sheets was out and about doing some really cool stuff in the industry that

[29:14] he loved so much. Now this game made its debut at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas, Texas in October

[29:22] of 1993. Yeah, Daddy East flew the team to Texas for the Tommy promotional tour and brought the

[29:29] prototypes and placed them on location. Unfortunately, one of the games fell off the truck and was just

[29:34] destroyed. Yeah. So that's that's a bummer. I don't know how it falls off a truck, but I don't know,

[29:40] you're loading it or something or you're in some sort of like Texas cowboy shootout and you're in

[29:45] like escaping in your you haul truck and it just falls out the back like I've seen in a lot of

[29:50] those American movies. So there were 10 pre-production prototypes that were made for promotional

[29:54] use and conjunction with the off-broadway production. These prototypes had six pop bumpers

[29:59] and EM chime units. I played one of these. Yeah, cool. What's it like? It's totally different, right?

[30:04] It's it's totally different game. It's different. The interesting part is the EM the EM chime unit.

[30:11] So if you've ever played a Daddy East's time machine, which had a actual chime unit in. So when you

[30:18] went back to the 50s, it would play the Chimes. That's cool. So they had the same thing here. They

[30:23] had a chime box in the game and it's cool. Yeah. So Lyman is embedded in all this, right? He's taken

[30:31] trips. He's he's he's taken the machines around. He's setting them up. He you know, he's not sitting

[30:37] in a cube. He's he's out and about doing fun things with fun people. In 1993 in the Macy's Thanksgiving

[30:45] Day Parade, there was a special machine that was rigged for auto play that had no back box.

[30:51] All of the electronics were actually mounted in the cabinet and it was on the Macy day,

[30:56] the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade float. Lyman's family was really happy that he was involved in

[31:02] something like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade because they understood now what he was doing.

[31:09] Of course, when you're working at Miter or a think tank, you're in a cubicle. There's there's

[31:15] something kind of inherently mysterious about that. But when you can point to something like

[31:20] on the on the float with the pinball machine and look what I've made and look what I'm working on,

[31:26] you can really draw that. He would speak to that in that top cast interview, which I thought was

[31:31] really, really cool. Did have to meet Peter Townsend, who of course was one of the the integral parts

[31:38] of the who and he even signed Lyman's Tommy instruction card, which is pretty awesome.

[31:44] Can we talk about a little bit about this game itself? Sure we can. It has a cool topper.

[31:50] It has a very cool topper. It's like the bean from Chicago. It's basically the topper is a large

[31:56] silver ball that reflects a, what does it say again? Does it say that just Tommy? I'm trying to

[32:04] remember what it actually says on the ball. On the ball. It's written on the top of the back box

[32:09] and reflects off the ball. Cool. And also the other idea is you would reflect off the ball

[32:15] because you are the player. Play Tommy, never seen the topper. Oh, you never seen the topper.

[32:19] Never seen the topper. I assume they're all taken off or broken or fallen off or scratched up

[32:24] or something. Yeah, no one dad is probably probably broke. It's true. I mean, there's so many

[32:29] dad's games, you see the toppers either missing or broken. I mean, what's the last time you see

[32:34] a, a Nottens family that didn't have the topper? Yeah, totally. But people love when we read

[32:41] the flyer. So Tommy, the toney award winning smash hit is coming to a location near you

[32:47] that who's Tommy pinball wizard by daddy East. Did you know it features more music than any pinball

[32:53] ever? 21 hit songs sung by the original cast members. Oh, so it's not actually the licensed music

[33:01] from the who it's what's licensed music is just from the Broadway show. That's the only bomber

[33:06] about it's like, and I really wish it was actually the who. Wow. And this comes through the

[33:11] super fancy BS MT 2000 Deluxe digital sound system in stereo. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

[33:20] I assume the BS stands for Brian Schmidt. Actually, the PS MT probably stands for Brian Schmidt.

[33:25] As I remember, he was at Williams and he left to go to Daddy East. Yeah. So if you know that,

[33:29] let us know silver ball chronicles gmail.com. I would assume that's what stands for. So I don't

[33:33] know about you, but I got a feeling that 94 is going to be a good year. According to the flyer. Yes.

[33:39] Yes. I wasn't a good year. I can't really remember 94. The interesting thing about the Tommy design

[33:45] is that it is kind of a mirror image of the tales from the crypt design that John Borg did

[33:52] like the previous year. Yeah. So it's like, it's like, we got to get this done in six weeks. We

[33:56] need a play field. It's kind of flipped and a reused and tales from the crypt they had the

[34:03] tombstone mech just a large tombstone that you bash and it comes down. So they kind of repurpose

[34:09] that and then Tommy is the mirror. It's like the same mech. I really like that tombstone mech. It's

[34:15] kind of neat. Yeah. And it's neat as a mirror. Tommy also has the blinders. Yeah. What are the

[34:20] blinders? Well, like so, so, so that Tommy, the character is, is, is what he's that blind and dumb,

[34:28] but he can sure place a mean pinball. So he's, he wasn't very good at math. I never understood

[34:33] the dumb part. It's, I think it's because he doesn't talk. Oh, right. Of course. I actually knew

[34:37] that folks. Don't, don't email me. So on Tommy inside the apron, they have these blinders that

[34:45] don't realize they're even there and it's a certain part of the game, which I can never remember

[34:48] when they, because they hardly ever come out. It's kind of like a fan, right? It like fans out over

[34:53] the flippers, because he's blind. So you can't see the flippers. So you're playing blind. Look at

[34:57] that world under glass. Huh? The thing is I played Tommy a ton of times. I think I've only seen

[35:03] the blinders like twice. I think there's a mode that you can turn them on all the time. I don't know

[35:08] why you'd want to play a game like that, but I guess it's kind of a fun gimmick. It's just being a fun

[35:13] gimmick. I would think I would have seen it more. It's like if you had thing in Adam's family and he

[35:18] came out once every like 30 games or something or ballrog that never comes out. Yeah. So he's got to

[35:24] come out all the time. It's also got this really cool like the Tommy was during the second world

[35:31] war, right? The theme of well, the, I think it's the first world war. Oh, it changes depending on

[35:37] the original album. It's the first world war. I think in the movie, it was like the second world

[35:43] war. It moves around. But in the game, I believe it says like 1918 or 17 or something at the beginning.

[35:49] So it's supposed to be World War One, which makes playing pinball even weirder because

[35:53] they really wouldn't have existed in the form they are. Yeah. So it's got like a, it's got like a

[35:58] 1940s dogfight in the back. Confusing. It's confusing. It's cool though. I gotta say it is, it is

[36:07] very good. Like I said, the art actually works really well in in this style. It's very, very

[36:14] cool. It's very yellow though. Really yellow. It has a like molded plane with working propellers

[36:21] in the back, which is cool. It's got, it's very Britishy because of course the who are,

[36:25] we're part of that sort of a popular British invasion era. It's got the Union Jack,

[36:32] prominently displayed on the plate field. Very cool. It's a great little game. You know,

[36:37] you, have you played it a lot like, is this a tournament darling kind of game? Is this something

[36:41] you see often? You see it in tournaments a lot. Yeah. If you're going to see a daddy's game in

[36:45] a tournament, Tommy's one of the ones you see a lot. Okay. Okay. Very cool. It's, it's very Adam's

[36:51] family, and that you, you hit a shot to light a mode, you start a mode, you time the mode out.

[36:58] By just start to the next mode, you go through all the modes. It's got a really cool side flipper

[37:02] shot. It's got an amazing orbit spinner orbit spinners. Yeah. Right. So, you know, the game's

[37:08] pretty good. I've only played it a couple of times because I was on, it was on location and it was,

[37:13] and the one that I was playing was kind of flaky. So I didn't want to waste any extra money on that.

[37:18] But very, very cool. I really, I really enjoyed it. I think it's a very cool game, but Lyman

[37:24] Sheets of course only did the DMD programming. This machine beyond the machine itself actually

[37:32] plays a very integral role in silver ball Chronicles run. It does. It does indeed. When I first

[37:40] was in the hobby, I want to say six months, maybe eight months, I'm of course listening to various

[37:47] podcasts as one does. And I discovered pinball profile episode 199. This was titled pinball wizard

[37:59] 50. And this specific podcast actually influenced me to think about creating silver ball Chronicles.

[38:09] And I spent some time kind of writing some stuff down after listening to pinball profile episode

[38:14] number one ninety nine. Lyman Sheets spent some time with Jeff T. Oless, the host of pinball profile.

[38:23] And they spoke about the album Tommy turning 50. And then they spoke about the pinball machine

[38:29] Tommy. And because of this sort of historical conversation that Jeff T. Oless was having,

[38:36] I thought man, there could be a space for a really cool history oriented pinball podcast. So

[38:44] Lyman Sheets and Tommy actually led to silver ball Chronicles. So that's the kind of ripple effect

[38:53] that somebody like Lyman Sheets has in pinball without even knowing he's having it. What inspired you

[38:59] to start slam till with Bruce Nightingale, Ron? I can't really say that. And Bruce was my only choice.

[39:08] After Tommy Lyman would work on WWF Royal Rumble and Guns and Roses, he would do the same DMD

[39:16] animation programming. But after he had learned all the ins and outs of this programming language,

[39:23] it started to become very tedious. Right? Lonnie had written a program to sort of help speed along

[39:29] the programming. And Lyman I guess would get bored, which tends to be a common theme with Lyman,

[39:36] right? As he's like he kind of gets bored. And around this time he appears on the today's show.

[39:41] Super cool. I'm going to include that in our show notes. There's a bunch of these old VHS

[39:47] recordings on YouTube of Lyman being on the today's show or doing various media hits where of course

[39:55] they ask all those dumb questions and they say things like pinball wizard, but it's pretty cool.

[40:00] I like the I think today's show is a Brian Gumball. Yes, it was. Yeah, yeah. At one point he's

[40:05] playing the game. It's like, look, I don't even know what I'm doing. And I'm killing it.

[40:08] Like Brian Gumball, like, ah, what a tool. Go do something about sports on HBO Brian Gumball.

[40:16] The Daddy East code. It certainly wasn't the Williams code of the time. It's sort of like a

[40:22] almost a joke amongst pinball players, kind of how shallow or boring Daddy East code is.

[40:28] How that well, I mean, come on. They had so many games. It's not at Williams level. I'll grant you that.

[40:32] So what like what's like what's I know Joe Camman Cowell would tell you, hey, what company survive.

[40:40] So there you go. Lyman says, I was very appreciative of the opportunity to work at Daddy East.

[40:45] What I take away from my experience was there was a lot of headaches and I felt like we could have

[40:49] done more to improve our games. I think Joe had the right perspective on it, which was we make

[40:54] machines. We employ a bunch of people who have fun what they do and we make money at it. We all

[41:00] get to enjoy our time with our friends and family and that's what's important. I assume he

[41:04] means Joe Camman Cowell by that show. You can see here that Lyman is really saying like we could

[41:08] be pushing ourselves further. We know we could be working harder and putting more into these games

[41:12] and making these games great, but that wasn't that wasn't and to some points isn't the business

[41:17] model of Daddy East. They were about getting machines on the line and getting them out and getting

[41:21] onto the next one. And I can see that that might be frustrating for a perfectionist like Lyman

[41:26] Sheets. He would work on Richie Rich, which was a one-off promotional game for the Richie Rich movie,

[41:34] starring... Oh, who is that? McCulloch? McCulloch. Yeah, that's right from Home Alone.

[41:40] I remember the movie thing. And he would work on Maverick, which was really kind of the last

[41:47] one that he worked on. And that's where he started working on what those larger DMDs and the

[41:52] system behind it at Daddy East. Yeah, the big yes, the big DMD. I actually like Maverick. It's not

[41:57] that. Yeah, but Lyman was ready to move on from Daddy East. So in terms of being challenged,

[42:02] Lyman wanted to move beyond DMD scripting. He wanted to be challenged and learn new things.

[42:07] A new system for a large display was fun, but he wanted to do game programming. So so far he's

[42:12] been at Daddy East for a few years and he hasn't actually programmed a game yet. Lonnie Robb and

[42:17] Neil Faulkner were really the game programmers at Daddy East at the time and really at Stern. Now

[42:24] Kevin Martin, he was hired to come in to do programming. Well, Lyman noticed that he...

[42:29] There was not a spot for him to do the game programming. Right? He was... He was the DMD programmer guy.

[42:37] And he was very much in a crossroads. He had a decision. Does he go back to Virginia?

[42:43] To go back to his old job at MITRE? Or does he try to go or do something else in pinball?

[42:52] During Lyman Sheet's funeral stream, Roger Sharp speaks to how conflicted Lyman was at that time

[43:00] and how really difficult it was for Lyman to make the decision. Does he continue to struggle and

[43:06] fight at Daddy East? Does he go on to do something else in pinball? Or does he just call it a day and

[43:12] go back to Virginia? So Lyman says, I was young, you know. I thought forever. So I called Ted

[43:17] Estes at Williams. He interviewed me for a second time and offered me a job. I think part of that

[43:23] was the fact that I had worked for pinball company for a year and everybody in the industry knows

[43:27] who does what. I suppose people there were a little bit more comfortable hiring me based on the

[43:32] fact I have picked up and moved out to Chicago. And I worked on a lot of things and sort of proving

[43:37] everybody that I could do the work. Lyman really proved himself in that sort of, you know, 10 to 12

[43:42] months that he was at Daddy East. He was willing to take the risk. He moved. He showed himself that

[43:47] he could actually do it. And he wasn't some sort of soft, cubicle government sort of employee,

[43:53] right? Like that's what they were concerned about. And he basically proved that he wasn't. But this

[43:56] is when sort of the industry started to contract in 94 and 95. The industry was selling 9,000 units.

[44:03] Daddy East, of course, Jurassic Park was selling like 5,000 units and they were kind of struggling to

[44:08] do that. Now the industry was basically selling 4,000 units, right? So sales are starting to sort of

[44:15] crater. Lyman was a little bit scared of going to Williams because he felt like and Williams was

[44:22] the big time and there would be a lot of pressure. The games that he played in college were all

[44:28] Williams games, the ones that he loved the most. And he was going to be a small fish in a big

[44:35] pond. He was excited because he felt like this was his opportunity. This was his last chance to

[44:41] do what he really came out to Chicago to do, program games. First day at a new job got to be a big deal.

[44:46] Yeah, this is first day at Williams. After getting lost on his way to the factory, Lyman finally made

[44:51] it and the first person he met with Steve Richie. That's got to be rough. You get lost and then the

[44:56] first person you meet is Steve Richie who is quite intimidating actually, even in his 60s. Steve came

[45:01] out and says, you're really here. It seemed weird to Lyman because it's a big deal person. The

[45:06] Steve calling Lyman a spy and joking that he just made him feel kind of comfortable there. Steve

[45:11] was a big deal person and he basically Steve joked that Lyman was a spy and made him feel comfortable.

[45:19] Oh, like a daddy spy. I just got that. So Lyman shared his office with Ted Estes.

[45:25] So they of course jammed into this one office together. And that's where he learned the ropes

[45:30] of Williams programming along with Louis Cosserich. Cosserich. I can never get the guy's name right.

[45:37] Of course, he joined around the same time and it was quite nerve-racking apparently because they

[45:42] had to learn on the game Jackbot. Oh, man. Louis and Lyman worked on Demoman with Ted from his

[45:50] cubicle. And after a fire in the game and some embarrassment, they finally got the game out the door.

[45:59] Imagine being the programmer and having something go wrong and creating a fire boy. That's got to

[46:04] be pretty ego, ego damaging. There was a big learning curve. After finishing up Demoman Lyman

[46:11] did a lot of test fixtures for theater of magic. Ron, for people who don't know, what's a test

[46:17] fixture? A test fixture. A test fixture. I don't know. What is a text fixture?

[46:24] So what that is is it's like they put something there and they get a ball to smash against it

[46:30] like a million times to see if it's going to hold up. Yeah. That requires programming. So

[46:35] you got to you know, you got to program the flipper to flip a billion times. Right.

[46:39] Somebody's got to do that stuff. And theater magic has a lot of stuff on it that could possibly

[46:43] break. So I'm sure they needed a lot of testing. And they do that to this day. Stern has a room where

[46:49] they just have games running tests constantly. Yeah. That's where they set up a scoop and they just

[46:56] keep shooting it with a ball to see if it bends. Congo. This is where Lyman was going to be a

[47:04] support programmer. The project actually went long. This is where Lyman was moved to Brian

[47:10] Eddie's team because Mike Boone who did the shadow wasn't available. Yes, I guess Congo originally

[47:17] was supposed to have a upper play field. It was a different design. And it just it got to a certain

[47:23] point where they just decided to start again. Yeah, start again. Hack and slash. And that's

[47:29] what he got reassigned. Brian, but to be a reassign a Brian Eddie's team. I mean, they would end

[47:36] up creating some magic here, wouldn't they? They would Roger Sharp, who is a character that we

[47:41] bump into a lot in pinball. He and Lyman actually developed quite the friendship. Specifically when Lyman

[47:49] was at Williams because they would spend more time together being in a same building. They would

[47:54] go golfing. Now Lyman, it was said would hit 300 yard drives. But he would always be so hard on

[48:03] himself that the shots were not perfect. Roger knew that Lyman had troubles dealing with stress

[48:11] and he always let Lyman know that if he needed someone to vent to, he was always there. Lyman could

[48:18] always go back to Miter. Things were got too crazy at Williams. But Roger was always available

[48:24] if he needed that help. It's interesting because Roger Sharp could immediately identify that Lyman

[48:31] was a perfectionist and he had difficulty kind of letting things go. Especially when you're an

[48:37] amazing golfer, you just pick up the game and you're amazing at it. You pick up pinball and you're

[48:42] amazing at it. But yet you're always really difficult and hard on yourself.

[48:47] TAC from Mars was that Brian Eddie game. We talked about that in our last episode.

[48:54] But that's the sci-fi alien invasion theme. It's December of 95. It's the Williams WPC 95 system.

[49:01] sells 3,450 units which is way way too few. Designed by Brian Eddie, art by Doug Watson,

[49:10] dots by Adam Ryan and Brian Morris, sound and music by Dan Fordon and software.

[49:15] The only name on there, Lyman F. Sheets Jr. Now the code on attack from Mars. It's somewhat

[49:22] interesting and unique. Even to this day, it's still sort of heralded as a really great coded game.

[49:30] And this is Lyman Sheets first. So Lyman talks about collaboration on attack from Mars.

[49:35] Lyman says, what happened at Williams was that Brian would be busy during the day.

[49:39] And then he'd go and leave whenever at 9 or 10, but he'd come into my office and we'd always

[49:44] talk about stuff. At Williams, we just wanted to design more stuff into our game as far as software.

[49:51] At Williams, we just wanted to design more stuff into our game as far as software. It's just a lot

[49:56] of evolution and tweaking to take a game from something that is fair or pretty good to something

[50:01] that's great. There's the difference between data east at the time and Williams. They wanted to

[50:07] push themselves further. They wanted to go from good to great. And you got to say you're kind of

[50:13] let down with 3,450 units. Lyman himself would specifically say that he was indeed let down by

[50:20] that. He would work on Safe Cracker next, which is a Pat Lawler designs very weird game.

[50:26] That's covered in our Pat Lawler episode. But he would say that Safe Cracker,

[50:31] helping out on the display effects, he would also say that he wrote Assault on the Vault,

[50:37] which was a mode where you got to where you would get a magic token in the back of the game.

[50:43] There's a slot in the speaker panel where a coin actually comes out rolls to you.

[50:50] So cool. Something unique, something strange, not a major piece. But that's where we get into

[50:57] Medieval Madness, which is from June of 97, sells 4,000 units, so better seller. John Yosey,

[51:04] Greg Ferris on Art, sort of the same kind of get the band back together kind of game from attack

[51:10] for Mars. Lyman says Medieval Madness was probably the most fun I ever had working on any project,

[51:15] because we basically had the same team as we have for attack for Mars. Brian and I were going

[51:20] over themes and we decided for whatever reason on the Medieval theme. It was appealing to pretty much

[51:25] everyone on the team. My appeal was I'm a big Monty Python fan. I saw Holy Grail and I thought

[51:30] we could do a lot with the humor. And we spoke about that again in our last episode that Brian Eddie

[51:38] had a list of names specifically for Medieval Madness and a lot of them were really, really bad.

[51:44] And the one that everybody sort of settled on that they didn't jump on and say was absolutely

[51:49] horrible was Medieval Madness. There was less pressure on the second game because he knew how to

[51:56] program that game and he felt a lot more comfortable, but he still wanted to do better. He wanted

[52:02] to improve. The only issue that they really had was the catapult that went through a few different

[52:08] rules changes. Apparently Lyman spent a lot of time changing the rules on that left catapult

[52:15] shot because the other ones were and I quote, really bad. Now in Lyman speak, really bad actually

[52:23] is probably really, really, really good. But there were still three reiterations of that code for

[52:30] that catapult. I find that pretty crazy. The downward spiral speeds up around this time, isn't that right?

[52:37] Yeah, around this time, 97, 98. It's really hurting at this point. The catapult decided to no longer

[52:45] do the pinball division. I got shut down, got lead. They made Barb wires their last game and then

[52:51] they were out. Williams management really wanted the pinball designers to start making some

[52:57] interesting and new slot machine designs. Management realized that the pinball division,

[53:04] they were very smart, very innovative. They came up with a lot of really cool novel ideas and they

[53:10] wanted to start leveraging that knowledge over in the slot division. Nobody is happy selling a

[53:19] thousand machines in one year. And of course, your shareholders will start to bail on you.

[53:25] Lyman said the gaming business was perceived to be this sort of infinitely growing business that

[53:31] Williams could take a little piece of and do very well. And so there's a lot of people trying to

[53:35] get the pinball people involved in slot machine design. So I worked on a slot machine between

[53:40] medieval madness and monster bash. Lyman and Brian were going to do another game after many

[53:47] evil madness. But Brian knew the writing was on the wall. Brian loved video games and he wanted

[53:55] to work on them and do more of that. So he moved over to the midway division in a management creator

[54:01] rule. So Lyman says, Larry Demar and asked me if I was interested in working with George,

[54:06] meaning George Gomez. I didn't really know him all that well or talked to him too much. The most

[54:10] I got to interface with George was on the exploding castle in medieval madness. In the eleventh

[54:16] hour, he saved it as a feature on the game because our mechanical people were having trouble

[54:20] coming up with a reliable cost effective exploding castle. Yeah. So that was interesting. I had never

[54:25] heard that before. And a lot of my other interviews that George was integral to the castle.

[54:30] So George is like the mech saver. That's like not the first time he did that either.

[54:36] Yeah. He's come forward to save mechs multiple times. He just pops up every now and then,

[54:43] right? It's like you need George Gomez to save something. You know, let him put on his cape and

[54:48] come on over to the to the area here and then super Gomez will fix it. Choosing a theme was

[54:54] really difficult because of course in this time they were doing those sort of hybrid

[54:58] original theme license themes or they were coming up with kind of a knockoff theme or something

[55:04] like that. Lime and made a deal with George that if he could agree on the theme that they were

[55:11] both interested in that they would end up working together. Can you imagine nowadays,

[55:16] Ron Raymond Davidson showing up to stern? Yeah. I'm not going to work with you Keith Elwin unless

[55:23] we both agree on the theme. You kind of have a lot of balls to say that, right? I'm not working

[55:29] with George unless we come up with the theme. Generally, your boss says you're doing it. You're like,

[55:33] okay. Well, no one does original themes anymore. So I guess it's easier. I guess it's mooch, right?

[55:39] Now, Lime and would say we're not having an easy time coming up with themes because George

[55:44] liked robots and monster trucks and stuff like that, like all the testosterone, not as deep of a theme.

[55:51] But you know, he's a guy and he likes what he likes. I was wanting to do like goofy monster

[55:56] game, this sort of like fun monsters that you don't take too seriously. George said we needed a

[56:02] license because we just did attack from ours in medieval madness, which didn't have licenses.

[56:07] Then one day he comes walking down the hall and he had this little brochure from Universal Studios

[56:13] Monsters popped into my office. He's like, I'm doing this game. I just felt like, hey,

[56:20] that was my monster idea. So there you go. The Universal Monsters playing at Universal Studios

[56:26] is where that theme came from. We talked about Monster Bash in our pinball 2000 episode. We also

[56:33] talked about it a little bit in the last episode. But this is the Universal Monsters Party theme from

[56:39] July of 98. Sells 3361 units. George Gomez on design, art by Kevin O'Connor, dots by Adam

[56:47] Ryan. Vince Pantarelli as the sound and music and software by Lyman F. Sheets Jr.

[56:55] This has a very interesting mode called Lyman's lament. Can you talk about that?

[57:01] Well, if I remember, there are two ways to do it. Either you hit the scoop,

[57:06] like an obscene amount of times. It's like 60 something times. It'll start. Or you can put in a

[57:12] flipper code. And then you do a, yeah, you put the right flipper code in the game, we'll say totally.

[57:19] And then when you hit the scoop, it will start Lyman's lament, which is basically just a quasi,

[57:23] like the music has like the scratching, like, wrap, but like, kind of bad. It's hard to explain.

[57:31] Actually, the music is kind of pretty kind of good. But it's just Lyman saying things,

[57:36] oh man, that's going to drain. Yeah, he complains about the game the whole time. And a lament is,

[57:43] tragically complaining or being, you know, sad or upset or worried. That's really what a lament is.

[57:52] And it was more or less George Gomez's idea to stick this kind of secret mode in the game.

[57:57] Yeah, Lyman said, so Gomez, when I'm showing him disrespect, he thinks I complain a lot.

[58:01] I don't know what he's talking about, but he thinks I like to complain a lot. So he jokingly said,

[58:05] I'm going to put this feature in. It's just Lyman complaining about stuff in the game.

[58:09] George came in and hammered me saying, hey, you have to put this feature in the game.

[58:14] I was sort of forced to put it in. Yeah, he's kind of kind of being like shoved into an area,

[58:19] but he actually had to sit down and record audio for it, which he really didn't want to do.

[58:24] He really didn't want to record it, but he put it in there. You can tell a kind of bothered Lyman

[58:28] that it was in the game. In fact, when he's talking about it, but I think it's actually a really kind of

[58:35] it's hilarious. It is one of the most amazing things ever. My favorite quote in it. I think if you

[58:42] tilt during it, it will say he'll say, like, can't we all just get along?

[58:50] While George was doing Monster Bash with Lyman, he was traveling to Pat Lawler's place in the

[58:56] night to work on the pinball 2000 secret project. There was a lot of pressure on this game because

[59:02] George would come in in the morning and he'd work with his engineer on moving stuff on the play

[59:06] field or designing a play field. Lyman would do all his programming in the afternoon. They'd

[59:10] collaborate in the evening. And then George would travel all the way out to sort of outside of

[59:15] Chicago to work with Pat Lawler at the night. It was it was a pretty impressive time for George

[59:20] Gomez. So this of course gets us to when Williams shuts down, which of course is a tragic day that

[59:26] we always talk about. Lyman, he would go to work at Midway and he all but stopped thinking about

[59:33] pinball. He stopped playing pinball in fact and he stopped competing entirely and he was very much

[59:40] out of touch with pinball after Williams closed for three years. Lyman says pinball has always had

[59:47] it's up and downs. For me, I needed a break from it. I have so much work piled on me and look at

[59:53] all the stuff that I did in less than five years when I was at Williams. In the year and a half,

[59:56] I was at Data East. Sometimes you get burnout. I think I needed a break to just kind of recharge

[01:00:02] and come up with some fresh ideas. What I find interesting about this, Ron, is you look at it,

[01:00:07] he's done three major games at Williams as the programmer. And he worked for 12 to 10 months at

[01:00:15] at Data East. In the grand scheme of things, that is not a lot of games. He did, I would say probably

[01:00:26] put a lot of himself into those. He probably worked crazy long hours into the nights, into the mornings.

[01:00:34] He put a lot of his emotional capital into that. But when you look at somebody like Larry DeMar

[01:00:40] or Eugene Jarvis or some of those other programmers, Lonnie Rob, they've done 20 or 30 games.

[01:00:48] Right there, like non-stop doing games. So I find it kind of interesting that he's burned out

[01:00:55] kind of so quickly at Williams on three games. Some of it probably Ron had to do with the work

[01:01:03] ethic at Williams and pinball basically collapsing. He probably just wanted to get up and move on

[01:01:09] for a while. He had a lot of internal struggle in such a short period of time. After three years,

[01:01:16] something was missing at Midway. Lyman was appreciated. He was working on new technology and

[01:01:23] everything else. But he said he really missed the creative aspect of working on a pinball machine.

[01:01:30] Right? It's a little less predictable. It's more dynamic and fun. You're working sort of less to

[01:01:35] computer game schedule, I guess. Right? Lyman would call up Gary Stern and ask him if he

[01:01:41] were looking for help. And Gary said no, not right now. But they were working on a new hardware

[01:01:47] system. And they needed somebody to create a custom operating system. And that's how Lyman

[01:01:54] got his start back in pinball. That system would be the Stern Sam system. Isn't that right?

[01:02:01] That is right. I assume named after Sam Stern. That's what I always assumed it meant.

[01:02:07] The white star system was written in what was called an assembly language. Don't know what that

[01:02:12] means. And Lyman moved everything over to a C or a C++ standard with the new Sam system.

[01:02:21] Yes, assembly language is literally one step down from the hardware. It's like a series of

[01:02:28] ones and zeros. You never heard that. Now, one thing that was also pretty interesting is they

[01:02:32] added USB code updates rather than switching out the e-prom in the system. Yes. So finally,

[01:02:38] after pinball 2000, which allowed you to do code updates, we finally have a system.

[01:02:44] What is it? Seven, eight years later, that can do it. Yeah. Now, the first game that he would work on

[01:02:51] with them was sopranos, which was originally going to be a Sam system, but ended up being on

[01:02:57] white star. So what was the first Sam game? Here's a really obscure

[01:03:06] factoid. It's Simpsons Kookie Carnival with a K, where they reused a lot of the parts from

[01:03:13] Simpsons pinball party like Homer's like a big rotating head and Bart's on the skateboard. They had

[01:03:19] a lot of those parts left over. So they made a redemption game called Simpsons Kookie Carnival.

[01:03:25] That's right. Totally different. It was not actually a pinball machine. It was the first,

[01:03:29] I guess proof of concept, right? Like the bar is not too high if it goes bad. And it's Simpsons

[01:03:33] it'll probably sell. The first pinball machine they did with that was World Poker Tour. That's

[01:03:38] right. And you could tell, right, that the game programming was very different in World Poker Tour.

[01:03:42] The next full game that Lyman Sheets would actually program is the absolute masterpiece Spider-Man

[01:03:51] from June of 2007, which is the licensed superhero movie theme. It's the Stern Sam system.

[01:03:58] We don't know how many units, but I think it was probably around 5,000 as per Steve Richie

[01:04:03] mentioning it in an interview one time. Designed by Steve Richie, Kevin O'Connor on art,

[01:04:08] Dots by Mark Galvez, Sound and Music by the Master David Thiel. This, of course, is an epic game.

[01:04:16] We've got tons of discussion on this game in Steve Richie 3 in the archives over at silverballcronicals.com

[01:04:25] or in your pod catcher if you look for silverball chronicles. But what did Lyman say about Spider-Man?

[01:04:30] Well, think just to put my own opinion in this, I always wondered how so you have Lyman Sheets

[01:04:36] and at Williams, he does in succession attack from ours, medieval madness and monster bash.

[01:04:43] You know, three masterpieces, you know, all-time great games in a row. When he goes to Stern,

[01:04:50] I mean, number one, he worked for Gary Stern before when he was at Data East, so you figure there

[01:04:54] was an in there and it's like, now we want you to program our OS. Like, okay. So he's literally there

[01:05:00] for years before he gets another lead in a game, which just seems insane. And as we'll be talking

[01:05:08] about as we go through this episode, I mean, he ended up being in like a partnership role where he

[01:05:14] wasn't a lead in a bunch of games. I think that was more because of the state of the company at the

[01:05:18] time, but still, it seems crazy to this long to get another lead. Very strange. So what does Lyman say

[01:05:25] about Spider-Man, Ron? He says, I'm pretty happy with Spider-Man. We had a couple of rough spots,

[01:05:30] especially towards the end of it because the way the license was structured, we were allowed to use

[01:05:34] all three movies, but we couldn't actually get any of the footage from the third movie until the

[01:05:37] DVD came out and they wouldn't give it to us ahead of time. I'm pretty happy with it. In the end,

[01:05:43] I think most people are happy with it. I probably made a few mistakes with it, but I don't know. It's

[01:05:48] still one of my favorite games that I worked on. I included this quote because I'm perplexed by it.

[01:05:53] Well, there's background on this. I should elucidate the background. Yeah, please. Is this from

[01:06:00] the Topcast interview? Yes, it is. Yes, because the timing of that, basically, he was on Spider-Man.

[01:06:04] As far as he was concerned, there was still a lot of work left to do on the game and he was taken off.

[01:06:09] We got to go on to the next game and he was not happy. On his own time, he basically continued to

[01:06:16] work on it. A lot of the things you see when you finish villain and the headline comes up,

[01:06:24] headline says, said, man, beeched and all that. That was all added later. That was all done on his own

[01:06:31] at his house when he was working on it. At the time, he recorded Topcast, none of that was out yet

[01:06:38] and he was not happy that he was not allowed to continue on the game. It wasn't done in his eyes.

[01:06:46] He would also do a spot on head-to-head pinball podcast with Marty Robbins and Ryan Say.

[01:06:55] And they would also talk in great lengths about Spider-Man because, of course, it is a masterpiece,

[01:07:00] in my opinion. A lot of people recognize that. But Lyman was really heart like he made a few mistakes.

[01:07:09] He doesn't know it's still one of the best games he had. He's really, really hard on himself, Ron.

[01:07:14] Like, if he would have left it the way it was, it still would have been an amazing game.

[01:07:20] It's so good, in fact, Stern vaulted the pin in 2008. They just re-released the design in the code,

[01:07:28] a couple of tweaks to the modes, but in general, it's the same game. Yeah, different R.R.

[01:07:32] It's that good. And different callouts, unfortunately. No more Jameson. He would work. Yeah.

[01:07:38] So this is where he would work on Wheel of Fortune and Indiana Jones. Wait a second. No, he didn't work

[01:07:43] on those, but he's credited on IPDB to work on those. Actually, during a episode of the world-famous

[01:07:50] Slamtilt podcast, he spent a great deal of time basically debunking a lot of the things that he's

[01:07:56] tagged to on IPDB, isn't that right? That's right. He said the next game that he actually spent a lot of

[01:08:03] time on was Batman the Dark Knight, which is the licensed superhero theme from July of 2008.

[01:08:12] It sells a couple of units, but during this time, Stern does not release any of their sales

[01:08:19] numbers. This is designed by George Gomez and Kevin O'Connor on art. It has Mark Galvez on

[01:08:27] dots, along with Tom Creezevett, Kezovat. Kezovat. I even spelled it out phonetically, and I still

[01:08:35] screwed it up, folks. Honest to God. This is not a joke. Sound by Ken Hale and Software by

[01:08:43] Lyman F. Sheets, Jr. This is based on the 2008 Christopher Nolan Dark Knight movie masterpiece,

[01:08:52] which Ron has not seen. I've seen it. Really? I've seen the one with the Heath Ledger's the

[01:08:57] Joker. That's the only one of the three I've seen. You haven't seen Jurassic Park, but you've seen

[01:09:01] Dark Knight. Oh, yeah. It was excellent. I'm Batman. I couldn't understand why you kept talking

[01:09:06] like this though. Other than he's disguising his voice, that's about it. I'm Batman. It had

[01:09:11] $185 million budget. It did a billion dollar box office in 2008 in that summer. This was a big

[01:09:20] deal license. Like, I don't know if people understand now how huge Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight

[01:09:28] movie was. Oh, it was a big get. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards at one two for sound

[01:09:34] editing, best supporting actor Heath Ledger as the Joker. It lost best picture to slum dog

[01:09:41] millionaire because the Academy hates action and comedy. Heath Ledger, of course, would sadly lose

[01:09:47] his life to a prescription drug overdose shortly after this movie was released, which now makes

[01:09:53] watching the movie even more creepy because Heath Ledger is completely transformed in this movie.

[01:09:59] It is something else. This was Ron the first movie I had ever seen in IMAX. Oh, okay. I had

[01:10:09] recently moved to Toronto in 2008 to do my financial licenses after my university degree.

[01:10:16] And my friend was like, we got to go to IMAX. I'm like, what's IMAX? He's like, it's the

[01:10:21] biggest screen ever. It's amazing. You got to come see it. So we went and I saw this in IMAX and

[01:10:26] it was epic. It was so great. This was also the first time I had Taco Bell because they had a

[01:10:33] Taco Bell in the theater. Okay. And I learned that it was nature's drain. Okay.

[01:10:43] This has some really cool toys in it, doesn't this game? Yes, but it's got the Joker reveal mechanism.

[01:10:49] It's like a cylinder that rotates and it's just like, uh, well, it has it has an action figure

[01:10:55] of the Joker. I should remember when it turns, he like, it's like wobbling around.

[01:11:00] It's got scarecrows crane. Of course, scarecrows was the bad guy in the first dark night movie.

[01:11:05] Yeah, there's no crane in the movie. Yeah, but it's one of those things that cranes are awesome and

[01:11:11] they they're always awesome in pinball. So they put a crane in. Everybody loves a crane. Yep.

[01:11:15] And then there's the teeter totter, which is pretty cool. Yes. It's like a hot wheels tumbler car.

[01:11:21] Yeah, it's got a hot wheels car in it and it like fires up in the car rolls down.

[01:11:25] It's pretty cool. It's a great, it's a great little little game. It's, um, it's kind of in that weird

[01:11:32] kind of tooth like mid 2000s Photoshoppy art era, which is kind of a bummer. And I know this was,

[01:11:41] this was the game that was in the tournament and the expo in 2008.

[01:11:48] Right before Stern fired everybody that upcoming Monday, like the after that weekend.

[01:11:55] So it was it I remember at the bankwits, they had a presentation on the game with

[01:12:01] Lyman sheets and George Gomez. And they talked about the issues they had with that ramp in the

[01:12:06] center. Yeah, the one where you shoot the tumbler, right? It's just the one it's a ramp in the

[01:12:11] dead center of the playfield. They had major issues getting it to work right. I remember I

[01:12:15] remember that specifically. It's it's it's kind of a cool game. I haven't played the dark night.

[01:12:20] I have played the next Batman game, which we can talk about a little bit, but, um, I haven't

[01:12:24] played a lot of this ever. I'm playing the crane is super cool. I mean, if you play Batman 66 is

[01:12:31] exact same Mac, it's it's it's a cool it's a cool thing. The um, the rotating cylinder like what

[01:12:38] one one one side is is the joke action figure. The other side is his face. It's pretty grindy. It's

[01:12:43] one of those long playing games that Stern did in that era that you could stand for a long time.

[01:12:48] Yeah, I've really designed this sort of be a home model kind of. And most of the games were

[01:12:53] long players at this point. Yeah. And I mean, the art, although during that era, it's actually

[01:12:58] pretty cool. So the side art on the side with Heath Ledger is the Joker's really cool. Yeah,

[01:13:03] it's got the motor cycle on one. They all have all the lights. This is in there. They use

[01:13:07] actual clips from the movie, which are hard to see, but these actual sound clips from the movie.

[01:13:12] It like it's a it's a great little game. It's got a cool upper play field too, right, which is

[01:13:16] sort of Lord of the Rings. Ask. Yes. Roll over. Yeah. Yeah. Gomez. That's just re re doing it.

[01:13:22] Yeah. Very cool. You know, decent decent game. Would you own one? No. Why? It plays too long.

[01:13:29] Place too long. Yeah. So this is when the 2008 financial crisis just right after this would

[01:13:36] happen. And we'll talk about that in greater detail some other time. But everyone was worried at

[01:13:41] Stern that the company itself would survive. Everyone was helping out on multiple games to make sure

[01:13:48] everything was done to get it out. Everybody was just terrified. They were going to be like go.

[01:13:54] You had mentioned a moment ago after 2008, after expo of 2008, basically they let everybody go

[01:14:03] in the programming division except for Lonnie Rob and Lyman. Yeah. And I often thought they kept

[01:14:09] them specifically because they were data east. I know. Lyman was at Williams, but he was originally

[01:14:15] a dad of east. The ones they'd like go were Keith Johnson who originally started at Williams

[01:14:21] and Dwight Sullivan who originally started at Williams. Lyman said it was tumbleweeds in the office.

[01:14:26] We walked down the hall and that's tough. Your friends used to be in an office next door and now

[01:14:30] they're not there anymore. So Lyman was parachuted in where he finished CSI by Pat Lawler's design.

[01:14:38] George Gomez's NBA design and Steve Richie's 24 design. Of course, him and Lonnie would tag team that.

[01:14:46] Now when you look those up in IPDB, that's where you see a lot of programmers on those games kind

[01:14:53] of in that sort of space because they were just trying to finish up what they could after everybody

[01:14:59] was like. Yeah. Because CSI Lawler quit halfway through so Borg finished the play field. And then

[01:15:06] yes, Dwight Sullivan was supposed to be on 24 another partnership with Steve Richie and then he

[01:15:11] was let go so they'd come in to finish that one. Now the next major game that Stern would release

[01:15:18] between the fall of 2008 and the ones they sort of kind of finished up. Let's say tidied up with

[01:15:26] the other designers and other programmers through 2009. It was 2010's Iron Man

[01:15:33] where Lyman and Lonnie worked together to finish or to from scratch on that game. That is the superhero

[01:15:42] theme based on the 2008 movie of Iron Man. It's designed by John Borg, Dots and Animation by

[01:15:51] Mark Galvez, Music and Sound by David Thiel, Lonnie and Lyman on software. This at the time was a bit

[01:16:01] of a joke, right? It wasn't a joke, but it was. I mean, it was the stripped down, you know,

[01:16:07] tear everything out. No one was happy because this game was just the end of the end when it came to

[01:16:13] pinball machines. Oh my god. They took the service rails out. Ron. They took this service the first

[01:16:18] game with the pegs, whichever one hated the pegs. I have I actually took the so what are the pegs?

[01:16:25] Let's start with that. Well, what are service rails? Service rails are the things that are under

[01:16:29] most play fields from the Williams era, the 90s Williams era all the way up through the stern

[01:16:35] era. So you can lift the play field, you can slide it out. So you can get to the back of the

[01:16:41] play field. So stern just cut out the service rails. Instead, they just put these pegs, which

[01:16:47] are basically like shooter raw almost like they're not shooter rods, but just these rods that come down

[01:16:53] that has the rubber that you would end use at the end of a shooter rod on the. Yeah, just to keep

[01:16:59] it from scratching and scratching and you just you can only pull the play field out slightly and

[01:17:04] then you just set it down. Everyone hated that. Ron, how bad is it that the company isn't such

[01:17:11] dire straits that they have to take out service rails to keep the company rolling? It must have been

[01:17:18] bad. When they when that first came out and they saw that play field, there's nothing on this.

[01:17:24] Jokes on them if they seen a 2020 stern. Wow. But yeah, I remember in Expo the next year,

[01:17:34] man, they roasted Gary because Gary Stern would always have, he still does have his presentation

[01:17:41] in Expo usually gives it like Thursday, like the state of the company and man, they just like,

[01:17:47] what is this? People actually like like yelled that. I don't think anybody would have the balls to

[01:17:53] do that. Oh, they have people asking like, what is this stripped down stuff? What is this? What's

[01:17:59] happened? Oh yeah. Another thing that's kind of particularly interesting about this game is

[01:18:06] that it has a few moving pieces, but it's basically what like two ramps and some pop bumpers and

[01:18:11] a rising thing in the middle of the play field. Like if you looked at Batman the dark night,

[01:18:18] you have a crane, an upper play field, a rotating joker toy thing, another crane on the left side

[01:18:27] that's like a ramp. 24 was their last full featured game as we know it. Yeah. And it's basically now,

[01:18:35] you've got a thing that comes up out of the play field and that's it, which is basically I think they

[01:18:39] repurposed the, what is it called? One in Austin Powers. Who's the guy that pops up? Is it Dr.

[01:18:46] Evil or Dr. Evil? Yeah. Okay. The Dr. Evil, bash toly. Yeah. Now I'm a huge Iron Man fan. Like

[01:18:55] actually before like the mark, like always an Iron Man fan, I have a lot of collectible Iron Man

[01:19:05] comics from Marvel back in the day. I love Iron Man. And I love this game. I've played this game

[01:19:13] quite a few times. And there's something just magical about this stripped down brutal ass kicker,

[01:19:21] isn't there? This was one of the, if you asked me like, what game did you hate that you eventually

[01:19:26] liked? It's this one. As the Iron Man I have downstairs will attest to not only does the theme

[01:19:33] just draw me in because I love the theme. It's kind of based on Iron Man, the movie, and Iron Man 2,

[01:19:39] the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Most people don't realize that's the actually, in the code,

[01:19:45] that's the official name of the game when it would boot up. It said Iron Man 2. The theme pulls me in

[01:19:50] and then the gameplay. It just, I can't, I can't get enough of it. It just, it's quick and fast and

[01:19:56] fun. Yes. On one ball, you're trying to fill up that, the suits you're trying to collect the

[01:20:02] different Iron Man suits to get to the ultimate sort of mode, but you got to do it on one ball?

[01:20:07] Brilliant. Very shallow, but very, the presentation is excellent. It's like Tron that way. We'll

[01:20:13] speak about that in a minute. It definitely, it started a, it's continued a trend back from

[01:20:20] their long playing games to the newer shorter playing games. You were, you were not going to play

[01:20:26] this thing forever. You weren't, you wanted to get in, get out. It's back in the bars. It's not in

[01:20:31] the house. Anything that we could do to, to increase our profit margin comes, got the Iron

[01:20:37] Monger that comes out of the play field. It has kind of a whip lash toy. It's got a couple of

[01:20:42] magnets. It's got three spinners, Ron. Three spinners, two orbit spinners. That would be an Ellie

[01:20:47] now. Ah, three spinners. It's such a cool game. Such a cool game and it's that, I think the play

[01:20:55] field is one thing, but when you can marry a play field and code together, like Lonnie and Lyman

[01:21:01] did here, that's a big deal. The left four targets on the, on the left side represent the

[01:21:08] letters iron, I R O N, and the three targets on the right side represent man, M A N. But they couldn't

[01:21:16] do that because one of the Marvel requirements is the words iron man must never be separated from

[01:21:23] each other. Crazy iron man needs to be together. It can't be on two separate sides of the play field.

[01:21:29] Or you can just get the decals someone was selling that you can just put over for iron man.

[01:21:34] Then you're all set. This is where we get into episode 100, the Centurion Slam till podcast.

[01:21:43] This of course was co-hosted by Lyman Sheets and Greg Poverelli, who's a New York City tournament

[01:21:50] player. This was a really cool discussion specifically around Iron Man and the software.

[01:21:59] He was talking at this time when this was recorded with you in Bruce Nightingale. He spoke about how

[01:22:05] he still wanted to update the Iron Man code at that time. He's always, he just can't, he can't let

[01:22:12] little things go. He just wants perfection and it's, it's got to be difficult. So I reached out to

[01:22:19] Greg Poverelli and I asked him if I could use quote about his thoughts of Lyman Sheets and specifically

[01:22:28] Iron Man. Having recorded the Slam till podcast was beyond special. We were all big fans hearing a

[01:22:35] legendary history of our friend in his own words. It gave me chills. Having played his Monster Bash

[01:22:44] number one and our mutual favorite attack from Mars in Lyman's basement was remarkable. Every time

[01:22:53] his name displayed on my ringing phone it was surreal. He cared about his work so much. He was

[01:23:00] always excited and asked for feedback. I will never forget battling on Iron Man with him. Game

[01:23:07] after game in line qualifying for the New York City pinball championships. We strategized together

[01:23:14] and he said he'd put my initials in the later high score update for Bogey. He was the best at

[01:23:21] what he did, but an even better friend. Thanks Lyman. Rest in peace. The code and the camaraderie

[01:23:31] that you can create while playing Iron Man is a pretty awesome thing, right? So it's brutal,

[01:23:36] it's fast, it's hard. You're battling back and forth. You're going through a bunch of these

[01:23:40] modes and it just creates this sense of like tension. You know, guys like Greg and others were

[01:23:47] able to play that with the creator themselves. That's pretty amazing. And the funny thing about

[01:23:51] Iron Man for a game that came out that everyone saw as this stripped down just bad thing.

[01:23:55] Eventually became so popular that they vaulted it and did it again. And again, which let Lyman

[01:24:01] update the code where he added just added some things like for example, Whiplash. There was never

[01:24:10] any kind of fanfare for a Whiplash super. After you hit him a certain amount of times. So that was

[01:24:16] there was no celebration in the lights and he added a super skill shot that wasn't there before.

[01:24:21] It was kind of like the opposite of being at Midway working at Sternigan. Yeah, Lyman says at Midway,

[01:24:26] I was like, I want to work on pinball machines. Then after the layoffs in 2008, Lonnie and I are

[01:24:31] making a game like every three months. I just wanted to get back to when I was with Steve.

[01:24:36] Make a good solid quality game that has a little bit more in it. He didn't like the rush. He didn't

[01:24:42] like the pressure. He wanted to go back to the design team making a loaded game on a longer time

[01:24:51] schedule. I could say that that probably had a hard feeling on him. So this is when Lyman decided

[01:25:00] to leave pinball again and he would work at WMS or what was Williams and he made slot machines

[01:25:10] again. He felt the games specifically after family guy were too shallow and too stripped out.

[01:25:15] And you can hear all about that on the slam tail podcast and head to head podcast, which I've

[01:25:21] included in the show notes. But before his return, changes happened at Stern. IE investors came in.

[01:25:28] Money was put in and things like transformers and Tron were made. I think Stern realized

[01:25:34] that's like Tron, IE that they could charge more and a new era, a new era is dawning. Is that from

[01:25:41] a game? To war or something. Well, you can see that that recovery had sort of started to take place

[01:25:48] again, right? Things that are normalizing. It took a long time after 2008 for things to feel normal

[01:25:54] again, specifically in manufacturing. You could feel it when it was happening. Right around when

[01:25:59] transformers, Tron came out, you could kind of see it coming back. So Lyman would leave and he was not

[01:26:05] there long. Well, he was not there long Williams at WMS. I should say that's right. Yeah, he definitely,

[01:26:11] he was like, he was gone and then he was back. Yeah, you can tell that he got out of that atmosphere.

[01:26:15] He just needed a break. So here's another example, okay? Where Lyman is putting so much of himself

[01:26:21] into these things and he's not getting what he wants out of it and he gets frustrated and he just

[01:26:25] believes and then he gets away and he realizes, man, I miss it. I want to get back. And that's

[01:26:30] when he heard Steve was working on something. Yeah, Lyman said, I heard they were looking at

[01:26:34] hiring Steve again. Steve Richie, that's turn. Maybe I can work with Steve on a game. I talked

[01:26:39] to Steve and he's going to get a game on Steve Richie terms. I'm like, all right, maybe we can work

[01:26:44] together again. We made ACDC. Yeah. So Steve Richie terms. Steve Richie terms is very much like,

[01:26:51] I want to do what I want. I don't want you to stay the way. And the, that was my Steve Richie voice.

[01:26:57] Very good. And the announcement was made at the 2011 Texas pinball festival during Steve Richie's

[01:27:05] seminar where at the end of it, he said, you know, I'm starting my next game Monday. Lyman

[01:27:11] Jesus coming back to Stern and he's going to be working with me on this game. At this time,

[01:27:16] they were just finishing up Tron. And he pitched in on that, of course, we'll cover Tron in another

[01:27:22] episode, probably one of the greatest pinball machines of all time. I take it you like Tron.

[01:27:27] It's because I own Tron. And I need to keep that, keep that value going up, brother. And

[01:27:33] of course, we covered ACDC in length in our Steve Richie part three episode. But Lyman was really

[01:27:40] gearing up to work with Steve Richie on his next game, which was Star Trek.

[01:27:45] Jody Dankberg, who is the director of licensing, convinced Lyman to move over to Metallica with John

[01:27:53] Borg. Now Lyman was a big Metallica fan. Jody knew that. And he spent a lot of time to get Lyman

[01:28:00] to jump over to that project. And what happened was probably one of the greatest events of all time

[01:28:07] in pinball, which was the rule set and design of Metallica. Any artwork? And the artwork.

[01:28:13] That was the first game in God 15 years or something. We looked at the artwork and we're like,

[01:28:19] oh my God, this thing looks incredible. It's not Photoshopped art. This is amazing.

[01:28:24] This is the 2013 Metallica pinball machine designed by John Borg, probably one of his best layouts.

[01:28:34] Dots an animation by Mark Galvez and his team software by Lyman F. Sheets Jr. Lonnie Rob.

[01:28:43] And Mike, because, Kizovat, I think we got it that time. Good job team. This is one of the first

[01:28:53] games that I've had an extensive period of time playing. James Headfield is the lead singer from

[01:29:00] Metallica. He is a big pinball player, apparently. And by goodness, he wanted a Metallica pinball

[01:29:07] machine. He originally had an earth shaker customized over to a Metallica pinball machine. And it was

[01:29:15] done by the artist, Dirty Donnie, who did a lot of their, like, ban shows. He's Canadian. Yes.

[01:29:24] Yes. For Montreal, I think. But I played that game. That actual earth shaker. I played that earth shaker.

[01:29:30] It was at one show. It was earth shaker. It played Metallica. And James Headfield did a lot of

[01:29:38] custom callouts. So it sounded a lot like the stern Metallica. A lot of, yeah, that kind of stuff.

[01:29:44] Yeah. A lot of the Metallica noise, right? Like Metallica is very Metallica. Now, I listened to

[01:29:52] some Metallica in high school. And that was sort of like late 90s, early 2000, you know, time period,

[01:30:00] which is very much like when they were done when Metallica was kind of done. So it was a lot of

[01:30:05] their quote unquote classic music back from sort of the master of puppets kind of album time and

[01:30:11] things like that. I don't have a huge connection to the theme of Metallica. But man, oh man, Metallica

[01:30:18] just screams the noise of pinball, right? It's like high energy, high adrenaline, lots of long,

[01:30:27] loud music. It was a perfect mixture for pinball, I think.

[01:30:32] Now, this thing's got some pretty cool max, doesn't it?

[01:30:35] Yes, that it does, especially the premium. It has like a scoop that's a snake thing.

[01:30:42] And I don't know. I've never really looked at the mac and how it actually works. But it's kind of

[01:30:47] cool, right? You shoot in it and it kind of like clicks backwards and then clicks out.

[01:30:51] It's got like this, how does that work? Pretty cool. Which one? The pro, it's just a scoop,

[01:30:56] and it just spits it out. Yeah. The premium one, it just hits, I think it's an opto. So it knows

[01:31:02] you hit the snake and it'll open the mouth and then you go into it like a scoop. Cool. The original

[01:31:08] Metallica pros, the snake, and you see it from the flyer that we're looking at. The snake had fangs.

[01:31:14] But the fangs kept getting broken off. So they were removed. So later models do not have the fangs.

[01:31:21] Which is weird because there's an actual call out where they say, look at the fangs on that thing.

[01:31:25] And I'm like, it's not, there's no fangs there. Yeah, one of the coolest mods you can get is like a

[01:31:30] sticker that kind of goes on the ramp. Oh, to make it look like the snake is, to make it look like

[01:31:34] the snake's tail is going up the ramp. So cool. Little details like that. It's got a cool captive

[01:31:39] ball exciting. Everybody loves captive balls. Got a hammer that hits the ball into the playfield.

[01:31:44] That's very cool on the premium. It has, I would say a very amazing fun bash toy, which is called

[01:31:50] Sparky, which is like a dude in an electric chair. Yeah. Who wants to get electrocuted. He was in

[01:31:57] the first game. He was in the first custom one, the art for him. And it was similar like he had a,

[01:32:03] I think in the DMD animations, he's wearing a shirt that says Metallica socks. And in the Earth

[01:32:07] shaker one, he had similar like he's the enemy. It's, it has in line drop targets. Come on. Yeah.

[01:32:14] Instant amazing with a magnet in behind it, which is really cool. And across that comes up. Yeah,

[01:32:20] it's, it's a neat, it's a neat game, right? But it does have a few things that doesn't really,

[01:32:29] it doesn't speak to me. One of them is that a lot of people talk about it being very wood choppy.

[01:32:35] That the code is, is like chopping wood, right? You have to shoot so many shots so many times.

[01:32:41] You have to shoot some shots so many times. But then once you kind of get through that first

[01:32:45] level of wood chopping, it really starts to open up and give you a lot of other options to play.

[01:32:51] Yes. And Lyman tweaked the rules on this a lot through the years. There were updates to this well

[01:33:00] after, you know, it originally, they did the vault. They did another code update. They did

[01:33:05] another code update to have to evolve. Because this would be in tournaments. People would always

[01:33:10] play a certain way. So he kind of changed some of it to try to make it a little, a little different.

[01:33:16] He was always looking for balance, right? He didn't want you to always play in one direction.

[01:33:21] But for somebody like me who's not really a great player, if I can, if I can get

[01:33:27] 35 million, I'm like, man, that was a good game. Right? But that's like missing an entire digit, isn't it?

[01:33:34] You ever noticed in some places the lock on the game is called casket in other places? It's called coffin.

[01:33:40] Ooh, yes. When Jody was negotiating with the band and the songs, they had this script that was

[01:33:48] that was written up. And the band actually recorded all of the callouts before the code was actually

[01:33:55] created in the game. I don't know if that's right. I'm trying to remember from our podcast. I

[01:33:59] thought he said that they had already had all the callouts recorded by the time he came into the

[01:34:04] project. Right. So he wouldn't have that's right. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's. So then when they

[01:34:09] started to code, that's where these kind of small errors came from where he would code casket

[01:34:16] when the speech would say coffin. And there were a couple of these like little bits and pieces

[01:34:20] that would pop up, especially around the first iterations of the code. For somebody like

[01:34:26] Lyman who I'm sure is the ultimate perfectionist, this probably drove him crazy. Lyman said there

[01:34:32] was speech that said casket and then there was speech that said coffin. I don't know because I'm

[01:34:37] stupid or whatever. But for all the multiples in the game, when you start cross electric chair

[01:34:41] or snake, it just says multi ball. For whatever reason, when you start the casket, multi ball, I would say

[01:34:46] coffin, multi ball. And then he would call out casket. Everybody just had a fit. And I was like,

[01:34:51] yeah, I'm an idiot. He was really, really hard on himself. He kind of like Lyman's really laid back.

[01:34:57] Right. Like he's just easy going kind of like he's got that cool sort of like 80s nerd thing in his

[01:35:04] 40s that all of those tech guys have nowadays that they were super nerdy like 30 years ago. But now

[01:35:11] they're just kind of like laid back and cool. But in the words itself, you can see that he was

[01:35:15] he was way too hard on himself for something that was not that big a deal. A lot of people also say

[01:35:20] that this is the ultimate risk reward game. Would you agree with that? Uh, it's up there. ACD

[01:35:26] sees up there too. As far as the song Jackpot holding off on it before you go for it. But the thing

[01:35:31] about it has the cool cool crank it up feature. One of my favorite features, which is just keep building

[01:35:38] and you got to decide whether you want to cash out or not. Yeah. And it's like a mini wizard mode.

[01:35:43] But that mini wizard mode just sort of opens up to a bunch of different options. You kind of play

[01:35:49] the first sort of sparky or snake or and then you kind of you build up enough to then get into

[01:35:56] crank it up, which then has kind of like three modes you play to a song and they all have like you

[01:35:59] shoot the ramps or you shoot the orbits or you're right. And the cool thing about this era is at

[01:36:04] this time Lyman was still playing a tournament. He would be at the pop-alworld championships every year.

[01:36:09] So whatever game he was working on or was out, he would usually show up with some new code for it.

[01:36:16] Like you know, ACDC. Here's some brand new code. No one has played yet. I'm going to put it in this

[01:36:20] ACDC. So we would get to play it. You know, little things like when he added the multi-ball starts would

[01:36:26] have the train coming at you and would actually give the call out and all that. The first time that

[01:36:31] was ever seen was in the Papa free play area. Well, actually it wasn't free. But the non-turnumum

[01:36:37] area he would just stick it in there and say play it. Go to town. See what happens. See if he can

[01:36:41] break it. Yeah, nobody else does that. Everybody just does their game and moves on or he bring he

[01:36:46] brought, you know, he'd bring code for Metallica like I'm putting this new code in here. He brought

[01:36:51] code for CSI one year like some modified code. So there was some kind of bug. Some kind of thing

[01:36:57] in CSI that made it like you couldn't use in tournaments. So he fixed whatever that was. But I

[01:37:02] think he just did a version for Papa. I don't believe it was ever released anywhere. So if you

[01:37:08] happen to buy that Papa machine at their sale back in 2020, you might have like experimental.

[01:37:13] I think just there's a few select people who actually haven't. Wow. Very cool. It speaks to

[01:37:19] Lyman, right? That he's he just he can't let projects sort of sit. It's not it's not I mean,

[01:37:26] it's not a horrible thing. But you can see that there's this pattern throughout everything he's

[01:37:31] ever done that he he minimizes his successes. He doesn't he doesn't celebrate his successes enough.

[01:37:39] It's sad, right? Like he he's heralded as one of the greatest coders of all time. And part of

[01:37:45] the reason is that he's always looking to improve and he just never stops. I play Metallica in my

[01:37:53] we in my league like a lot. And I'm I'm not very good at it. But it has this feeling that is a

[01:38:02] little bit different that the risk reward of do I cash in the jackpot or do I keep building it?

[01:38:09] And I never noticed that on a pinball machine, even if all the other pinball machines had it before,

[01:38:16] I never noticed it. And I never kind of understood how it kept drawing me towards that like in

[01:38:25] the flashing of the lights in in the callouts. The game is programmed in a way that it pulls you

[01:38:32] to learn that code where a lot of other games you kind of have to just figure it out. This one

[01:38:39] guides you. And it's the first pin I ever noticed ever did that just just a masterpiece.

[01:38:45] And the Sparky multi ball intro sequence. Oh my goodness. Where the lights go out. It's a direct

[01:38:51] homage to monster bash. And it's unskippable. I love that part because that's tournament types.

[01:38:58] You know, they like to skip over everything like no, no, I worked on this. You're going to watch it.

[01:39:03] Yeah. And all the lights go out and it blinks. And then the the inserts all light up from the

[01:39:08] bottom to the top of the play field. And he's like, do it. Do it. Before it starts, the lights dim

[01:39:14] slightly to chain kind of bring your attention. Okay. What's what's different? And then the lights

[01:39:19] in front of Sparky just flash like crazy. Like hit this. If AC DC was like a watershed moment when

[01:39:25] it came to stern and the restart of stern, Metallica was the was was the turbocharger for that,

[01:39:31] right? Somebody threw some gas on the fire. And it was Metallica and it restarted decent art in

[01:39:36] pinball. Yeah. Thank you for that. I'd like to thank Metallica the band because they're the ones

[01:39:40] that said we want our art guy on the game. Otherwise, it would have been like Photoshop stuff like

[01:39:45] AC DC was probably. We don't have any sales numbers for for Metallica, but they were

[01:39:51] reviewed that license over and over again. Like people that I know that don't even like play pinball.

[01:39:57] Yeah. Have all all generally know Metallica. And I that blows my mind. I got my premium

[01:40:05] years and years after the initial run. They were still making them. It's sort of.

[01:40:09] So why don't you still have that game? I do. It's at my dad's house. Oh,

[01:40:14] yeah. Your dad plays Metallica. Bremio. Of course he does. That's amazing. I never asked

[01:40:18] someone whose favorite song was put. I like picking battery battery. That's a good one. I'm a

[01:40:22] seeking destroy kind of guy. And yeah, they were smart. They used all the music that you would

[01:40:27] want them to use. IE all the earlier stuff. Smart. Yeah. Yeah. They didn't use any of that crap from

[01:40:31] all they did have fuel, but I kind of like fuel. So I'll give it a pass on that.

[01:40:36] Yeah. The silence says nonacceptance there. Lime and he's known to program quite slow.

[01:40:44] Right. One of the critiques he's always had was that his code's kind of

[01:40:49] linger for a little while. And then they eventually start to really open up and generally become

[01:40:55] heralded as amazing. And I would argue there are reasons for that. Like the next game we're

[01:41:00] going to talk about. There was there was big reasons why it was took so long. The Walking Dead.

[01:41:05] This is a licensed television zombie series. It's from September of 2014. It's a Stern Sam system.

[01:41:14] There's no sales numbers on this, but I think it's all okay. This is again designed by John Borg.

[01:41:20] The art is uncredited. Dots by Mark Galvez and his team. The sound and music is also uncredited,

[01:41:28] which I find interesting. Software by Lyman F Sheets and Lonnie Rob. So the theme on this,

[01:41:35] this is based on the AMC television series of the same name. It is a post apocalyptic zombie horror

[01:41:45] series, which itself was based on a comic book by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlerd.

[01:41:54] At this time, it has 11 seasons, 161 episodes. It also has a bunch of spin-off series,

[01:42:02] online web shorts, video games, and was quite the cultural phenomenon in 2010, 2011.

[01:42:11] I haven't seen it since season four. So I'm quite shocked that there are 11 seasons now. I assume

[01:42:19] all the main characters are dead. Are you a fan of the series? I've never seen it. You've never seen

[01:42:23] it. That does not surprise me. It is a spike system. No, it's not. It was originally going to be a

[01:42:30] spike system. That system was under development, and this started a dual programming path,

[01:42:38] where Lyman would work on the spike system, and Tano Clice was working on the Sam version. Well,

[01:42:45] the spike system did not come to exist, so it ended up being a Sam game. Not fast enough,

[01:42:52] anyway. Although they did at Pinball Expo one year, they had two walking deads next to each

[01:42:57] other, one with the spike system and one with the Sam system, just to show you how much less wiring

[01:43:02] there was in the spike version. Yeah, they were moving from that older version of an MPU,

[01:43:10] and a driver board, and a butt load, a cable, and now we're going to use new boards. We're actually

[01:43:15] going to have stereo. It's going to be great. It's good. It's like 1993 all over the

[01:43:20] again. Mysterio sound. Is there anything you want to share before we get into? Well, when you talk

[01:43:25] about how long it took, there was a reason. Basically, when Lyman first started working on this game,

[01:43:31] he was under the impression that they had the full license. So there's like really early prototypes

[01:43:36] off or out there somewhere that has the clips, sound clips, and stuff from the show. Oh, interesting.

[01:43:41] And then he found out they didn't have all that. And he was not happy. Lyman did not post on

[01:43:48] social media too often, but he did post occasionally. And sometimes he would post interesting things,

[01:43:56] and then just kind of disappear for a while. He was the tweet and delete. Yeah, he posted something

[01:44:01] about them not having the full license and not directly, but kind of insinuating how he was kind

[01:44:07] of pissed. And then it was gone. But you know, because I remember everything that everyone posts on

[01:44:11] the internet, it's one of my abilities. I remember that specifically. It's like your superhero ability.

[01:44:16] I would imagine one of the reasons it was so far behind is he just had to start over. Like,

[01:44:21] there goes that idea I had. Okay, looks like I have to start this again. Yeah. So I mean, this was

[01:44:27] very much a dream theme for Lyman. This was right up his alley. He would say on the head-to-head

[01:44:33] pinball podcast specifically that he prefers the pro. But of course, you know, he does a little

[01:44:40] more work on the premium and alley models. He really loved the theme. He loved working on it.

[01:44:46] And one of the best parts of this game I think is it's really difficult and confusing layout.

[01:44:53] It's really different. It's not like your Metallica wide open, flowy play field. Hey, pinheads,

[01:45:00] I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not making cheesy jokes to make Ron laugh,

[01:45:04] I'm David, the financial advice guy. At Dennis Financial, our advisors strive to provide a return

[01:46:08] Ron, do you want to paint a word picture on this layout for everybody?

[01:46:12] Pain. I remember this came out right around Expo, and I remember playing it the first time.

[01:46:20] I love the skill shot. It has a couple of rollovers which hadn't seen those in forever on a pinball

[01:46:27] machine. You had to time them and get it in the right lane. Then you start playing the thing and

[01:46:34] realize how freaking brutal it is. We go in the pop-up area and just fly out and drain. It was like,

[01:46:40] man, this thing is just brutal. That was my first impression of the game. I wanted to have this big

[01:46:48] fat well-walker dude. It's got this really cool bash toy, the barn. You bash the doors of the barn

[01:46:55] and then the doors open up, right? It isn't or a dude's head in there or something. Yeah, there's

[01:46:59] like a zombie in there. Then in front of it is a magnet and then you mentioned it, there's the

[01:47:04] well-walker who's got this really weird, it's a really odd kind of toy. It's like a cover on a can

[01:47:12] and then you hit like this metal bit and it jumps a little bit. I think it was close. Some of

[01:47:18] their other bash toys like Wolverine and they designed this differently, probably to be a little

[01:47:23] more durable, a little different. This game is cool but it's not a Dave's puttin' in his living room

[01:47:31] kind of game. I got a bunch of little kids. It would not be good for little kids because some of the

[01:47:37] animations are extremely gory. But it's really vital. Yes, it's really vital. You know, zombies kill

[01:47:43] people. Not that violence bothers me. Trust me, I'm all about violent video games and all that

[01:47:50] stuff. It's just, I don't know, it's just, it's really, it's like, I mean, I don't know, it's not

[01:47:56] it's not a theme for J.J. P.O. tell me that. This has a couple of recycled ideas though, sadly.

[01:48:04] It has underneath the ramp on the premium LE, it has like a bash toy. What is it called the

[01:48:10] bicycle girl? Yep. Where it'll flip open kind of like those Stargate ramps or there was the

[01:48:19] same ramp in Mustang and then you, you know, in this one there's something in the middle though,

[01:48:25] it's not a shot through it. You bash a toy. A lot of people didn't really like this.

[01:48:30] So no one's confused when Dave says Stargate ramp. He doesn't mean the game Stargate. He

[01:48:35] means he got leave like ramps that turn that flip up. This one on the premium LE also has a crossbow

[01:48:42] shot where you can load left ramps down in the eight Austin powers. It's the same mech. It's like a

[01:48:50] gun almost. It kind of goes out and then you can shoot kind of one of the shots if you have a

[01:48:55] good enough aim, which is pretty cool. And it also has a teola's button in the middle of the game.

[01:49:01] Has an action button. Yes. Yeah. Where you hit the button and you can use in the premium LE,

[01:49:07] it has Walkerbombs. Yes. And it's Lyman said he preferred the pro. Most people probably do

[01:49:12] prefer the pro and they don't want like a hybrid of a pro with an action button because one of the

[01:49:19] the one feature of the premium that you want is the Walkerbombs. The code was a mess. You had

[01:49:25] mentioned that they thought they had the license. They didn't. They were behind in schedule.

[01:49:28] They thought they had a full license, but they didn't have everything. Right. So Lyman was a little

[01:49:33] upset allegedly about that and a few other things. When the game was originally released, it was

[01:49:39] a bit of a mess. Lyman says while we were working on the game, we didn't have a super lot of time

[01:49:44] to work on it. We had to kind of go in a different direction after the game was released. It

[01:49:49] went to the mic, my comment. For me, it's my life into it. I don't want to let people down. I want

[01:49:54] to be proud of the things I do. I kept working on it. Unfortunately, I got myself into a situation

[01:49:59] that it rather not be in again. In the end, I'll just look at the result. I will say that what happened

[01:50:03] happened. I was happy I was able to finish up the game as far as rules, strategy, and scoring. I

[01:50:09] think it's probably one of the best games I made it stir. Yeah. So there you go again. There's Lyman

[01:50:15] basically saying things didn't go the way I wanted it to, but I sort of rolled with it. I'm happy

[01:50:20] with what came out in the end. I would say he did come out with probably his best game at

[01:50:27] stirred. I haven't got anywhere on this game any time I've ever played it. I'm way too bad a

[01:50:32] player to get anywhere in this game. But when I look at the rule structure, when I see people

[01:50:38] like yourself play it, I can really see, yeah, there are some real serious stuff here. The way he

[01:50:44] uses the drop targets on the left side to collect weapons or food or medical supplies and the way

[01:50:52] that that ties into the game, that's something else. That's a pretty unique way to come.

[01:50:57] It has one of the best modes ever made. Horde. People have said that. Why is it so great?

[01:51:02] You got to play it. It's the intensity. I'll never play it. I'll never get there. Horde is just

[01:51:07] what it says, the dead. I guess I should call them the walking dead, not zombies, even

[01:51:12] else what they are. The zombies are all coming towards you and each of them is like

[01:51:17] associated with a certain shot and you have to hit that shot to kill them before they get to you.

[01:51:23] The DMD, the walking closer to the coming, they keep coming and it gets harder and harder and

[01:51:29] you have to hit more and more shots. On the premium you have the button, which is the walker bomb.

[01:51:37] So you hit it and it'll just kill all the walkers that at once. It'll give you just like a

[01:51:42] breath. But they keep coming. I don't know if you can actually win. You will get bit eventually.

[01:51:48] But it's like the mini wizard mode of the game. This is really where the term in Lyman we trust.

[01:51:55] I remember back before he was hired by Stern when Keith Elwin, he would occasionally,

[01:52:03] wasn't streaming. He would put stuff up on his YouTube channel like of these huge games of various

[01:52:09] titles. But one of them was walking dead and then one time I know on social media he took a picture

[01:52:15] of like a new in box like in the box walking dead and he just said thank you Lyman on it. That was

[01:52:23] like his comment. Like I want to got this game. It was Lyman maybe get this game. Yeah. And you

[01:52:30] could always put your trust in Lyman even though the game starts off a little rocky or there's a

[01:52:37] let you know the the the the bones are there but it's not quite done. You could trust in Lyman that

[01:52:44] he was going to get it done and it was going to end up being epic especially in the sort of post

[01:52:50] Metallica era of Lyman code. He was all in and he was going to do a heck of a job. And at this point

[01:52:57] Stern was well aware of this attitude that people had towards Lyman and I think they decided to

[01:53:03] take advantage of this with the next title. So they created this thing. So you've got a cornerstone

[01:53:11] title and what's that Ron? That's the main title. They released during the year. The ones that are

[01:53:16] that are all three versions pro premium LE. They're going to keep making them on an active basis.

[01:53:22] They're what keep the building together. Right. You've got four titles a year. Keep it

[01:53:28] chugging along. Then they bring in something called a studio title. Basically there's a cup called

[01:53:33] Kapal which is owned by Joe Kamikaw and they have done studio titles meaning he gets a big license

[01:53:42] and they do the game games like Batman 66 of Lyra House of Horrors which I don't think was Kapal.

[01:53:50] That was Wiz. No, that was Wizband. Oh yeah. I technically. Yeah. Great Ferris and

[01:53:56] Dennis Norman. Then you had Beatles which was also Kapal. But these are games that generally have

[01:54:03] smaller runs and they don't have like just a premium and like a uber super LE and that's it. Yeah.

[01:54:10] It's it's made to be something like really, really, really expensive and really, really expensive.

[01:54:16] And it started out as really expensive. Nowadays it's like basically the price and they just

[01:54:21] haven't reprice them to the point of where they should be which is a fortune. So that's just a pain

[01:54:27] in my butt. I don't want to talk. I don't want to complain about inflation at the moment but

[01:54:32] Batman 66 for me is really a bit of a dream theme. I I'm significantly younger than you. Really

[01:54:40] all chum and significantly younger than most of the target demographic for that theme. But I

[01:54:49] watched Batman 66 almost every day in reruns when I came home from school. So it holds a really

[01:54:55] like nostalgic heart tugging spot. So when I first joined the hobby and started sort of you know

[01:55:03] looking at more of those things and stuff. Batman 66 immediately was like oh my god they've

[01:55:08] got Batman 66 and and this is the game where I'm like man I wish I had a Batman 66. This is the

[01:55:15] one I've wanted for a long time. I've chased it for a while but I've just never been able to find

[01:55:19] one priced right or found one in my in my region. And now I'm probably not going to afford one. So

[01:55:30] I have to move on. Well you know what? I thought about Batman 66 and my Batman 66 we should explain

[01:55:35] it's that Batman show from what 1966 to 68 that was on that's correct Adam Weston. Bert Ward.

[01:55:43] The show that killed the monsters and Lyman says I grew up watching the show. If we're going to do

[01:55:48] this I wanted to be involved. There's just so much material to go through. I know it was going to be

[01:55:53] on a pretty tight schedule. Once I saw all the people we have as part of the license and hear all the

[01:55:57] things we can do I was like oh what did I sign myself up for? This was also a Lyman dream theme and

[01:56:04] then he realized he was in for a lot of work. Yeah and at least one restart. So Batman you had

[01:56:12] mentioned is based on the licensed superhero TV series from I believe it was CBS from 1966. This

[01:56:21] is a released in September of 2016. It is a Stern Spike 2 game the second Spike 2 third Spike 2

[01:56:30] game. It's designed by George Gomez, art by Kevin O'Connor who did the playfield and Christopher

[01:56:35] Franchie who did the cabinet side art and the center characters and around the playfield. This has

[01:56:43] LCD animations by Chuck Ernst and his team first LCD game by Stern the sound and music by Jerry Thompson

[01:56:53] and software by Lyman F sheets. Here is another tie in when I joined the hobby I was watching the

[01:57:02] dead flip stream. I would say within the first couple of months there was Lyman sheets and Mike

[01:57:09] Vinicore with Jack Danger in the Stern factory in front of the wall of microwaves in the breakroom

[01:57:16] area and they were playing Batman 66. This stream is linked in the show notes and you can check it out

[01:57:24] on YouTube. You can actually see me chatting in the chat if you want to go back in time and be creepy.

[01:57:29] I really had a good time watching this and you can see Lyman taking notes off in the background

[01:57:37] on a little sketchpad like he's playing and I can't see anything that's not doing it like you

[01:57:43] know what I mean like he's just playing with Jack and Mike and then he just will write something

[01:57:46] down on his note pad like he noticed something in the code like it's crazy that he could do that.

[01:57:52] This game was designed by George Gomez. It's a reimagining of the previously mentioned Batman

[01:58:00] Dark Knight game. Yeah so it was like George Gomez just wasn't quite comfortable with maybe the

[01:58:07] way Black Knight turned out or he wanted to do something a little bit better or tweak it so they

[01:58:12] were he reused what like the lower third two thirds of the play field and he decided the crane

[01:58:19] wasn't a complex enough mech so he made the turntable which which is really complex. The idea

[01:58:27] kind of of the studio title at this time was that it can't just have one mech right like most of

[01:58:34] the stern cornerstone titles would have one mech. Well this needed to justify the increased price

[01:58:41] tag. Right it needed to have it was you know what $1500 more than a regular machine so it needed a

[01:58:48] little bit extra pizzazz and that was basically two mechs one of them being huge. Can you describe

[01:58:54] the turntable? God it's this gigantic mech in the upper left which it rotates as different.

[01:59:02] There's like one part of it locks balls and other part of it has like a television screen and

[01:59:07] another it's just it's insane. Another one has like a spinner like it looks like a

[01:59:11] hat cave. It has a magnet in front of it. When it rotates in one direction you can shoot through it

[01:59:17] and it exits kind of on the left but on the other shots it doesn't exit on the left because it

[01:59:22] doesn't open up that shot when the turntable is in that direction. We know what they stern says about

[01:59:26] the action turntable. Action turntable mini playfield. A rotating mini playfield that presents the

[01:59:32] player with several alternating targets and shots as the villain vision TV set. Wow I love that.

[01:59:40] The villain vision TV set target brings the TV show and Batman's adversaries to life directly

[01:59:46] on the playfield. Magnet feature linked to villain vision TV set. Did you know that Batman 66

[01:59:53] pinball takes players on a feature packed adventure through the campy world of the dynamic duo.

[01:59:59] I love this game. It's got what's called the Glo Gomez clunk. I don't know what that means but I

[02:00:04] guess it means it's it's clunk. It's hard to believe there could be the Gomez clunk when he

[02:00:07] designed Johnny Numanik which is probably one of the best flowing games ever made. I would say it's a

[02:00:12] good mixture of a game that can flow and a game where you're like got to stop for a second to do

[02:00:18] out a couple of good shots. You know what I mean I think it is a good if not perfect mixture of

[02:00:24] those two things. Now if I'm trying to remember I think they had three versions of it. They had the

[02:00:28] premium. They had the Ellie Ellie and then they had the super Ellie which had the topper with the

[02:00:37] bat signal light on it and the super Ellie Adam West would say your name. There's a lot of

[02:00:43] controversy at the time around specifically specifically the S. L. E. me. Yeah because you George

[02:00:51] Gomez would say that they took the inspiration for the super limited edition pinball version of the

[02:01:00] game from Ford. Stern is primarily a manufacturer. They manufacture things right it just happens to

[02:01:09] be that they make pinball machines and in the world of manufacturing everybody wants to be Ford.

[02:01:16] Everybody wants to be Chevrolet right like it doesn't matter what you do whatever you manufacture

[02:01:22] you want to be one of them. So you're always looking at them as being like the big brother or the

[02:01:28] example shining up on the pedestal that you want to be. At the time Ford I think the year before

[02:01:35] had released the new version of the Ford GT. The Ford GT if you wanted to get into buy the super

[02:01:42] fancy car you had to submit a video as to why you were quote unquote worthy and Gomez would say

[02:01:51] and I think he spoke about this on head to head podcast. They took the inspiration for the S. L. E.

[02:01:59] video. You had to submit a video as to why you should be you know why you should get the S. L. E.

[02:02:03] They took that from Ford. So a lot of people gave him a lot of crap about this. Isn't that right?

[02:02:08] Oh yeah. Because it was the super L. E. was like 12,000, 15,000 dollars something like that. Plus

[02:02:16] they wanted you to say why you should get one. Yeah you couldn't just you couldn't just you know

[02:02:23] pay your money. And they they were on a time crunch also because Adam West was in poor health.

[02:02:29] So they knew he wasn't going to be around that much longer and they needed to

[02:02:33] record him saying all these names. So that's another reason for the time crunch on a lot of

[02:02:37] the stuff with this game. They had a so there's 250 L. E. and there was only supposed to be 30 S. L. E.

[02:02:46] Yeah. And the 30 the 30 came specifically from Stern's 30th anniversary dating back to

[02:02:54] Dana East. Then all of a sudden that 30 went to 80. I guess the reason was it was a celebration

[02:03:02] of Stern pinball's 30th anniversary and Batman's 50th anniversary. I think it was 30 and then they made

[02:03:08] it 80 to try to say like well it's Batman's 50th anniversary. So we're going to add the 50 to the 30

[02:03:13] to make it 80. It was so I was like that. It was like we need a way to increase the amount that we

[02:03:19] made because we can sell these for 12.5 that that was the actual reason. I'm sorry the MSRP was

[02:03:24] actually 15,000. Yep. This sort of what was special about the S. L. E. was that Adam West

[02:03:32] would say your name because you had to sort of register that you had purchased it. So you submitted

[02:03:37] your thing. Adam West would say your name and it would be put in. So the code for your game would

[02:03:43] be custom to your game. So Jerry Thompson on a podcast. I'm quite sure it was head to head.

[02:03:51] Correct me if I'm wrong anybody. Silverball Chronicles at gmail.com. Where Jerry Thompson

[02:03:56] actually spoke about working with Adam West on the voice callouts. The day that they showed up

[02:04:02] at Expo earlier that day they were doing the name callouts. So if you don't answer the

[02:04:08] bat phone, which is one of the ways you start a mode. Eventually Adam West will say like

[02:04:14] Ron pick up the bat phone and that was like the big draw that you would pay the extra money for

[02:04:20] because Adam West would say your name. Jerry Thompson would say that of course Adam West was always

[02:04:26] oddly in character like the character of Adam West in family guy and he turned over to Jerry

[02:04:33] when they were doing their signing at pinball Expo and he said Jerry we certainly had a great day

[02:04:39] with those callouts today, didn't we? Jan Michael Chris Mark. God it was great. We had a great day.

[02:04:50] You could just I could totally hear him saying that. Yes. So this was also one of the games that Mike

[02:04:56] Vinicore first started on and Mike Vinicore has become a staple at Stern pinball. Lyman would

[02:05:03] actually lobby quite hard to get Mike Vinicore who was at midway and Williams before that.

[02:05:11] A job working at Stern and the first game that he worked on was Batman along with Lyman. Mike

[02:05:18] Vinicore would say that Batman will go down as one of my top career highlights. Lyman went to bat

[02:05:26] for me and I owe my career to him. Yeah Mike was at Jersey Jack actually before he got hired by

[02:05:33] Stern. Lyman says I wanted to do the theme justice. The thing about doing a licensed game is

[02:05:39] most of the time you only get one shot. I wasn't really sure what was happening with the game.

[02:05:43] I found out a little later that the company was wanting to do a little more expensive games.

[02:05:47] The super LEDs, the LEDs. They were a little more expensive than normal. Then it just became like

[02:05:53] this self-fulfilling prophecy. I have to really make this game like a big game and utilize all

[02:05:58] of the material that we're able to use. And so it's been some days a lot of fun and some days you know

[02:06:03] not so fun I guess. And in the end I really you know I get one shot at doing it. So I want to make

[02:06:09] sure that I do the best I can. There he is. He's loading the pressure on himself. He's really saying

[02:06:16] that he needs to do an amazing job of this because not only do the fans want it but now we're spending

[02:06:23] so much money on these machines. The quality of the code has to be there. I don't think it's fair

[02:06:29] for him to put that much pressure on himself but he did and that's why this code ended up being

[02:06:36] absolutely amazing. Originally when they were there to do the launch it was a box of lights. So

[02:06:45] I was there and just from what I could surmise and what I've heard around through the grapevine I

[02:06:51] guess. It was behind velvet ropes. It was like in a track mode which you couldn't play it. Then at

[02:06:58] the seminar Gomez was like you know we have the game here but Lyman will let me let you play it.

[02:07:04] And I don't think Lyman was happy about that comment almost like he's getting thrown under the

[02:07:09] boss for the fact that's not ready. But yeah it was literally a box of lights. It just had a track

[02:07:14] mode and that was it. Ryan C from head to head pinball podcast famously cancelled his le order

[02:07:22] after seeing the game at expo. Man that sucks. If I can have an le one of these man I don't need

[02:07:30] this le I'm not greedy. Just the le I'd be okay with that. The game is completely the same from

[02:07:35] each model. There is no difference. SLE has the extra call out in the top. The le also came with

[02:07:42] the I thought it was just a super early. Nope the le also came with the topper. That's why the

[02:07:46] le is the way to go because it's got that topper. Now that brings me to a fellow named Christopher

[02:07:51] Franchi who is I would say one of the best but his career at Stern was significantly short lived.

[02:07:58] He did some amazing art and we'll go down I think is probably one of the best when it comes to photo

[02:08:05] realistic style in pinball. He could do a bunch of different styles but for some reason he was

[02:08:09] sort of pigeonholed into sort of people and when you had to do people this is kind of the go to

[02:08:14] artist. They were again away behind when it came to art and George Gomez was not pleased with the

[02:08:22] way the characters were coming together on the cabinet and backlash. So in a panic he went for a

[02:08:30] search and that search came up with Christopher Franchi who actually was very well known sort of in

[02:08:37] Batman community if there is such a thing because he did a lot of like vintage lunch boxes he did

[02:08:44] a DVD cover. He did a bunch of you know toy surprise box things and he was brought in really quickly

[02:08:54] at the end to sort of just do the characters and the cabinet as quick as he could and boy oh boy

[02:09:00] he did a heck of a job. What do you think? Yeah it looks fine. It looks like Batman. It looks and

[02:09:07] I think it's amazing personally. I think it is so good so good. The other thing about that game

[02:09:13] from what I could surmise from interviews with Lyman and in George Gomez one of the other reasons

[02:09:19] it took so long the code is because it sounded like they went into a certain direction with it

[02:09:25] and after a while they kind of felt it wasn't working so they just dumped it all and started again

[02:09:31] so they did like a full restart on the code which put it which put it further behind.

[02:09:38] That's a lot of pressure but I want to say what that was released in 2016 that man 66 which is

[02:09:48] right as you know a year before I sort of started in the pinball hobby. The code was quote-unquote

[02:09:55] finished in probably around 2018 so it basically took two years. Yeah it's all right to tighten up

[02:10:02] that code and it's a masterpiece now right you've got villains you've got you know which are like

[02:10:08] catwoman and the penguin is to go for me. I get lost I want I'm supposed to do I think it's what

[02:10:15] the minor villains and then you've got minor villains and when to pick them and all that stuff

[02:10:21] yeah you can freeze timers if you capture a minor villain you can replay characters if you capture

[02:10:28] another villain if you capture so many so many minor villains you get a mini wizard mode if you

[02:10:34] capture all the villains you get a wizard but like it's great. The nice thing is that the footage

[02:10:39] looks so good because it was all I mean it was all originally filmed in 35 millimeter like a movie

[02:10:45] would be even though it was a TV show I think I said this on our Gomez episode but like the the

[02:10:51] TVs of the time cannot reproduce how good it actually would look but now with the LCD there it looks

[02:10:57] great. It's the extra ball animation is awesome they had all of the all of the everything they had

[02:11:04] everything you could possibly want with Batman but they did not have the Batman film the Batman

[02:11:10] 66 film from the I believe it was the summer of 67. Oh they couldn't between season two and

[02:11:16] the shark repellent. They couldn't use the shark repellent and they couldn't use where Batman has

[02:11:24] the bomb and he's running down the like pier and he has to throw it away. That's why that's done

[02:11:31] in animation. The other thing we forgot to mention it's in the game but it's done drawn it's not

[02:11:36] the they also had the gadgets. I think that's the Ellie I don't remember it was the Ellie

[02:11:43] was super pro to super Ellie but everyone had their own gadget so yeah so the Ellie is the

[02:11:49] Ellie's were named after episodes and I think the S. Ellie's were named after the gadgets and

[02:11:54] everyone wanted the shark repellent one. Yeah I just remember like I'll pay extra for the shark

[02:12:00] repellent gadget. Yeah how could you not now Lyman's last game at Stern was Elvira's House of

[02:12:07] Horrors and we'll talk about that in another episode likely during our Nordman episode.

[02:12:14] And we will touch on I mean that was one of the again another studio release and they're playing

[02:12:21] off they're playing off the Elvira name but I would argue they play Borough the Lyman name like

[02:12:27] Lyman's on this game. Yeah they could get a higher dollar for Lyman code than they could for

[02:12:32] Lyman and it is or for the one. It was so great people it's just like you know I know Batman took

[02:12:37] two years but it's awesome I know any game he works on will eventually be awesome so I'm buying it

[02:12:43] I'm buying it I don't care I'm buying it whatever whatever I'm buying it and I think Elvira's

[02:12:47] House of Horrors is fantastic. One of the last games I actually played a lot of before the world

[02:12:52] and and well it's again we'll talk about that in deeper period but it was in the winter of

[02:12:57] 2021 I think it was probably somewhere around February where news broke that Lyman had left Stern

[02:13:05] in the fall of 2020. This was probably one of the greatest most well kept secrets ever because

[02:13:11] nobody knew that Lyman was gone for even people within Stern. Even people within which you wonder

[02:13:17] how is that possible but for what I could surmise were a lot of the programmers have a lot of

[02:13:24] support staff and maybe work a lot with other people with Lyman it was Lyman you know he's working

[02:13:31] solo on his stuff so if he's not working with anyone and he's just gone how would you know he's

[02:13:38] gone you know they update the code digitally now right with a USB sticker I mean he pretty much

[02:13:45] finished Elvira for the most part. Yeah another game that took like two years it took like a year

[02:13:50] and a half it was said it would eventually come out that he left Stern because of timelines and

[02:13:57] workloads that that Stern of course is a machine right you got to you got to feed the machine

[02:14:03] things got to keep rolling you got to keep selling machines you got to keep on to the next one

[02:14:08] and as we've seen throughout this podcast Lyman does not like a whole lot of pressure he doesn't like

[02:14:14] a whole lot of doing things all the time he doesn't like to be told all the time what to do and to

[02:14:18] keep pushing so eventually he left Stern it was in the fall of 2021 Ron when it leaked that Lyman

[02:14:26] was working with Josh Sharp of raw thrills in development of a new code for cactus came

[02:14:34] to Josh Sharp was his beta tester turns out that CGC was looking to sort of create like a

[02:14:41] downloadable content style of model where Lyman could kind of do his own thing at his own pace develop

[02:14:49] his own updated code for cactus Canyon because he's from Valley Williams he would know a lot of the

[02:14:56] feeling of those Valley Williams coding days and he was going to release his own cactus Canyon.

[02:15:02] So it's a Chicago gaming company so they released a cactus Canyon remake with some updated code they

[02:15:10] they finished they had employed I'm trying to remember I think it was I think it was Joe

[02:15:15] Schobert and someone else it was during one of Chicago gaming company CGC's seminars where they

[02:15:22] said they had worked on the code so it was it was one of those deals where it was because cactus Canyon

[02:15:28] if you remember from our previous oh the last one our last episode the code was never really finished

[02:15:35] so when CGC was going to do this game one of the things that we're going to finish the code

[02:15:40] so they did do updates to it like it actually has a match animation now and they changed a lot

[02:15:45] of the display effects and all that just minor tweaking stuff but then this bombshell came out that

[02:15:52] it's also going to have for a separate fee which still has not been disseminated what the

[02:15:57] fee is going to be you can buy the lineman sheets code for cactus Canyon and I guarantee you

[02:16:04] that helps sell units you know what I think a lot of people bought this game day one in the

[02:16:12] expectation and anticipation of lineman's 100% even people wouldn't weren't into it to begin with

[02:16:20] would be like lineman's lineman's doing a re code re re re I'm in I'm buying it and that brings us

[02:16:26] to January of 2022 where we had heard that lineman sheets had passed away.

[02:16:34] Ron I had first heard about lineman's passing in a Facebook group chat you and I are in a group

[02:16:40] chat with a few tournament players and the loser kids from the loser kid pinball podcast

[02:16:47] yeah I first read it's on pin side it just said it just said lineman sheets RIP I'm like I

[02:16:57] I don't know what to say and in this time of sort of social median all that stuff like stuff travels

[02:17:03] really quickly and you gotta always source it right you always gotta take a breath and say okay

[02:17:07] is this really real is this what's going on well it turns out the reason these posts were there

[02:17:12] because of a post made by Penny Epstein who is lineman's partner of many years that simple post

[02:17:20] sent massive reverberations through the pinball industry and we're not talking

[02:17:28] just his friends and family and loved ones like immediately everybody in our chat was devastated

[02:17:35] everybody on pin pin side started posting of how devastated they were of like it was

[02:17:42] it was really difficult because lineman was was 55 which is a really young age to pass away

[02:17:51] I I don't know lineman I've never met lineman but as I had mentioned for some reason there are

[02:17:57] threads through the creation of silver ball chronicles and my love for pinball that have

[02:18:05] been interconnected with lineman which is really unusual in fact john borg would actually post on

[02:18:13] Facebook as well that he can't even describe how he feels I'm going to miss coffee runs with my

[02:18:21] friend lineman this photo with a photo that was posted I pulled I was pulled over and received a

[02:18:29] seat belt ticket from elk grove village after the officer gave me the ticket I set my phone up to

[02:18:37] take a selfie and I said who's a dumbass with a hundred dollar cup of coffee and then we just laughed

[02:18:44] about it lineman said I should have told him I was john borg and I probably would have gotten

[02:18:51] out of the ticket then a moment of silence and we both broke out laughing again in 2008 when

[02:19:00] everyone was worried if pinball would survive we all worked very hard and came out with iron man

[02:19:07] avatar tron and metallica and watched it all come back lineman's work will be enjoyed for generations

[02:19:17] my heart goes out to penny and and that's just one example of everybody who worked with lineman

[02:19:25] and the fun and humor they had with lineman during that time yeah and that I mean there was

[02:19:34] the initial outpouring and then we we had slam tilt in an episode um in a few days later like

[02:19:41] before his funeral that when the obituary was released I mean because when someone that young

[02:19:47] dies you forget like well what happened you figure maybe it had a heart attack that's usually

[02:19:51] the first thing that comes in your your mind um but when his obituary came out that's when it

[02:19:59] took a different turn it it certainly did his obituary says after a courageous and long battle

[02:20:06] with mental illness lineman died by suicide on january 19th 2022 his soul is finally at peace

[02:20:16] lineman was a pinball software engineer whose accomplishments spanned nearly three decades lineman

[02:20:22] brought a wealth of knowledge and software design as well as gameplay his visions of gameplay and

[02:20:27] rules were the result of many years as an avid pinball tournament player and enthusiast and many

[02:20:33] of his rules that serve as the backbone for modern pinball rules design he loved watching people play

[02:20:40] and enjoy his games please assist us in bringing awareness to the silent epidemic donations can be made

[02:20:47] to the national alliance on mental illness um what immediately struck me when I read that run

[02:20:55] um was that the writer of the obituary wanted everyone to know

[02:21:04] that lineman died by suicide they wanted to bring awareness to the silent epidemic and the struggle

[02:21:11] that lineman had his entire life um that is difficult because usually if somebody were to pass away

[02:21:21] by suicide you keep that quiet you don't tell anybody and we all just live on thinking he had a

[02:21:27] hard attack but they wanted to make sure that people knew and um that's why we're bringing it up

[02:21:35] in in lineman's episode today um the pinball community really came together after hearing this um

[02:21:44] even tighter i would say than his passing the pinball industry awards uh play to tribute video at

[02:21:51] the beginning of the second annual um pinball industry awards uh even podcasts began speaking

[02:21:59] in a second round of episodes including uh yourself uh Bruce night and gale jeth tiolas rani uh

[02:22:06] you know uh martin robins the the loser kid pinball podcast they all came out with various ways of

[02:22:13] talking about their own struggles with mental health to um use that as an a way to honor lineman

[02:22:21] isn't that right that is correct yeah um actually uh lineman's funeral was streamed live um and many

[02:22:30] in the pinball community attended that uh funeral many people commented that they had never met lineman

[02:22:38] they never talked to lineman but yet lineman left an impact on their life because he brings them joy

[02:22:44] on a daily basis yeah that was very difficult watching that uh funeral stream because even a lot of

[02:22:53] the people who spoke at the funeral i or you know either know or know of um collectively everybody had a

[02:23:01] lot of difficulty uh accepting what had happened martin robins from the final round pinball podcast he

[02:23:09] would say i think i thought the same as a lot of people i wish i could have done something at

[02:23:15] robert sent on the loser kid pinball podcast says lineman and i spoke pretty regularly about his mental

[02:23:20] health i tried to be a resource to lineman i spent a awful long time after lineman committed suicide

[02:23:25] worry that i hadn't done enough to let him know how appreciated he was and how loved he was i'm sure a

[02:23:30] lot of his friends are having those fears right now it's been really hard to reconcile i bowled

[02:23:36] depression for many many years i've never been at that intense level of the struggle but i've spoken

[02:23:40] to a therapist regularly for almost two decades yeah jeff to alless um on uh the final round pinball

[02:23:47] podcast would say as i reflect on feeling down and depressed and thinking of when am i going to wake up

[02:23:53] and feel better i told this person everything that i was going through this person told me why don't

[02:23:58] you write down all the good things that happened during your day it could be anything the beautiful

[02:24:04] sunshine a great meal you had however big or small write it down if you focus on the positivity it

[02:24:13] makes it a lot easier run specifically for me i moved to toronto in 2008 like i said to do my

[02:24:19] financial licenses and it was certainly not the best time to start in finance i'll tell you that

[02:24:28] i i struggled a lot specifically in the winter of 2008 and 2009 to to the point that i would cry

[02:24:37] daily and i wanted to come back to new brungswick and be a kid again and not deal with anything that

[02:24:44] was reality and i'll tell you the more we talk about the stigma we realize that everybody struggles

[02:24:52] with mental health some of us win and some of us don't if you would like to share some of your

[02:24:59] comments on mental health um how the pandemic that we've been enduring for the last two years has

[02:25:06] compounded that sickness and those mental health issues talk to a friend reach out to people and

[02:25:12] ask them how they're doing if you think they're being if they're struggling with mental health do

[02:25:17] whatever you can anything you want to add Ron ah well you listen to the episode 181 of the slam

[02:25:24] till podcast you can hear my story i'm not gonna repeat it here saying it once is enough just

[02:25:32] enclosing the next time you randomly meet somebody on the street or a restaurant employee a retail

[02:25:41] clerk at Costco the IT guy at work a repair person that you just happen to call that person may be

[02:25:49] suffering just like lineman and remember they may be having a bad day and they might be on the edge

[02:25:56] so just take some time to be kind to every person you meet because being kind that day and saying

[02:26:03] something and helping somebody who you may or may not know might make all the difference that day

[02:26:12] thank you lineman goodbye

[02:26:17] congratulations on winning the world championship how old are you to begin with?

[02:26:21] 26 now is this all you do or do you have a real life? no i have a real life i'm a software engineer

[02:26:27] all right lineman sheets is the world champion for the professional amateur pinball association

[02:26:32] he'll defend his crown next week in the international championships here in New York

[02:26:36] learning good morning good morning how does one become a pinball champion a pinball wizard?

[02:26:40] a lot of practice dedication good level of concentration yeah this isn't a sport right?

[02:26:47] uh yeah actually it is a sport there is a select group of people who take it very seriously

[02:26:53] consider it a sport and then the thing that hooked me was i saw a couple guys when i was in

[02:26:59] college played eight ball blocks and they you know they won like 12 or 15 credits on it just played

[02:27:06] at one time and then they had to run off to class and so i was like oh okay and then i played the game

[02:27:11] and we probably played on 12 or 15 credits and i don't know five ten minutes and something like that

[02:27:17] and but in that process i understood what the appeal was i mean at least maybe not to them but to

[02:27:25] me and then how i think i was like i kind of hooked on pinball after that each one

[02:27:33] each game that i've worked on has been a big part of my life probably at least a year of my life

[02:27:38] and there are relationships and experiences and all parts of my life in each one of those and it's

[02:27:48] i mean i guess in the end it is just a game but um it's also a learning process

[02:27:55] but yeah each one of those games are something that that i take away from um several things um

[02:28:03] good experiences with people working with people all the memories from working on games

[02:28:08] and then even just coming here watching people watching people play and get enjoyment out of them

[02:28:14] that's the biggest reward for all

[02:28:20] my name is lime sheets i am a pinball well i mean i'm a software engineer so and but i've been

[02:28:27] working in pinball programming pinball machines uh wow for almost 30 years

[02:28:35] well working on this i get involved way more than i can die big schools now it's about story

[02:28:42] and engaging the player at an emotional level and that job becomes a job that

[02:28:51] i can do this job and i'm gonna do this job well
