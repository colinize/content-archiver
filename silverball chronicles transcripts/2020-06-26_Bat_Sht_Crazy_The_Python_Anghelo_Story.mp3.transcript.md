[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:07] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:15] I'm back.

[00:17] Nope.

[00:19] It's all mine.

[00:25] Don't worry, I'll stop eating when we start.

[00:30] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:54] This week every month is my charming co-host Ron Handy Hallet.

[01:01] This is a name I never heard of.

[01:05] You know how to adjust all the leaf switches.

[01:12] I watch you sometimes on your streaming with your co-host Stu and you know how to do all the tweaks.

[01:22] He doesn't know how to do anything, he's useless.

[01:25] You're talking of course about your slam tilt streaming over on Twitch because you've been stuck at home for some unapparent reason which nobody is aware of.

[01:35] When people are listening to this years from now they'll have no idea.

[01:39] Yes, this is not an unprecedented time for using cliches as much as we can.

[01:45] We've had a lot of fun here on the first four months that we've done this.

[01:49] I'm very new to the hobby.

[01:52] I've only sort of done this really for about two years but I'm having a lot of fun doing the research.

[01:59] I know it's not super ideal nor I don't think a lot of people enjoy sort of surfing around and going down internet rabbit holes but for some reason I'm finding it kind of fun.

[02:08] The other thing is I'm so lucky to have a co-host like you.

[02:11] You're adding I would say a lot of awesome perspective, a lot of points and a lot of the feedback that we get is between our interactions which is kind of funny because I've never met you.

[02:22] And quite frankly I think in real life you probably wouldn't like me because I hate everybody from upstate New York.

[02:30] Oh wow.

[02:32] That's true. That's true.

[02:34] One thing that we started this week because I've noticed I'm getting more messages on pin side.

[02:41] We're getting more emails regularly.

[02:43] I thought we should sort of up our social media presence.

[02:46] The other thing is I want to be a bigger deal sort of like Jeff Tielis and Martin Robbins over on their final round podcast and they have a Facebook page.

[02:56] So to not be left out on the social medias we've started a Facebook page which can be found at facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles.

[03:06] And that's where you can interact with us.

[03:08] You can see what we're working on.

[03:10] Maybe find some hints about the next episode.

[03:13] We'll probably toss up a poll for our next episode so people can vote on what they want us to do.

[03:18] And I think that's a good sort of hub to focus people in to be able to interact with us.

[03:24] You can tell us how wrong we are.

[03:26] All kinds of great things.

[03:28] I'm so looking forward to that part.

[03:30] Love social media.

[03:31] Another thing that is very, very cool is this week in pinball has started their twip pinball promoters database.

[03:40] Can you tell us what that is Ron?

[03:42] Oh yes. You get to review pinball content providers.

[03:45] Yeah. So they've got lists of all of the twitch streams, all of the podcasts, various websites.

[03:53] That kind of stuff. You can leave your reviews on there from one to five stars.

[03:57] And we would always love you to add a five star review.

[04:01] Add your comments in there because that's going to help other people find us.

[04:05] I think when people start in this they're going to go to Google.

[04:09] They're going to type in pinball podcasts and it'll bring up a list.

[04:12] My assumption is that this list would probably rise to the top of that.

[04:16] It's going to help people find us.

[04:18] And the more people that we have engaged in this, I think the more fun we can have.

[04:22] Because we can add some reviews and some of those reviews I've added here.

[04:28] Four stars is good too.

[04:30] Three, you know, and one and two definitely not.

[04:33] Definitely not. Don't do that.

[04:35] Yeah. Yeah. One or two you can just show it off.

[04:37] I don't want you listening to this if you're going to give us one or two because you're obviously not having fun.

[04:42] So Glenn W. He says that each episode is packed with tons of information about history of pinball broken down into categories.

[04:51] So that you can choose which topic to learn about great personality and some good humor.

[04:57] A must listen.

[04:59] Did you ever think that you would have a review that said you were a must listen, Ron?

[05:03] When I started, no.

[05:04] Wow. I didn't think people wanted to listen to me at all.

[05:07] But I guess they do or at least Glenn W. does.

[05:10] Okay. This one's from Sean.

[05:12] He says if you want to lay back discussion on historical topics of pinball, this is the place.

[05:17] The hosts work well together and is an entertaining podcast to listen to.

[05:20] The funny thing is that as much as we have fun and we try to be entertaining, it's just the content itself is fun and entertaining.

[05:27] I think and it's just sort of us reading it with funny voices and a Canadian accent that just make it better.

[05:35] I mean, when you've got some topics like our topic today, that content just automatically breeds itself to being super interesting and entertaining.

[05:43] This and the Canadian accent is funny. I agree.

[05:46] It is, it's all about being able to be funny.

[05:50] It's not just that. I'm looking at your show notes now and you have all those little Canadian spellings of certain things.

[05:55] That's right. I mean, they're wrong, but I mean, it's still funny to look at them.

[05:59] Because we're speaking the Queen's English here on this podcast because I do the editing.

[06:05] So, Ron, this episode is brought to you by Massive Backbox Screens.

[06:11] Massive screens distracting you from disappointing play fields since 2013.

[06:17] One thing that we do here on this podcast that I think is very unique is we take a lot of corrections and we try to integrate those into the following episode so that we can at least acknowledge the fact that we are not the be all and end all of all pinball knowledge and history.

[06:38] We make a lot of mistakes because quite frankly, I'm a slacker when it comes to research and I just sort of copy and paste about as much as I can.

[06:46] You know what the best things are about corrections? What's that? When they come from the most authoritative source possible.

[06:52] Which are latest corrections could not come from a more authoritative source.

[06:57] That's right.

[06:58] Let's see our last episode about Gottlieb, System 3.

[07:01] The two names that came up most of the time were John Norris and Ray Tanzer.

[07:06] So we happen to get an email from John Norris.

[07:09] Yeah.

[07:10] John Frigen Norris emailed us at SilverBall Chronicles at gmail.com.

[07:16] And to be completely honest out of all the designers at Deeproot, he's the one I really want to see what he gets to do there.

[07:24] I really want to see a John Norris design game at Deeproot with Better Software.

[07:30] With somebody like him who's one of those.

[07:33] Ed of the box weird individual designers that we talked about in System 3.

[07:40] He is the one that I'm most excited about.

[07:42] We've seen some cool stuff from J. Pop.

[07:44] We've seen some cool stuff from Barry Eisler.

[07:47] And those guys at Deeproot.

[07:49] Yeah. Of course I want to see what they're doing.

[07:51] But somebody like John Norris, who I think now has maybe the resources and the time to really do what he wants in his actual end vision.

[07:59] This is super exciting.

[08:01] That's for sure.

[08:02] Do you know actually the greatest feedback we got from John Norris?

[08:07] He said, nice job, mostly accurate.

[08:11] Yes.

[08:12] What do you think it is?

[08:13] This pumping right now.

[08:14] Yeah.

[08:15] So what do we get wrong?

[08:17] What do we get wrong?

[08:19] So according to John, it was SMS debt that four Scott lead to close.

[08:24] All pinball games near the end made black ink including barbed wire.

[08:28] They couldn't pay interest on the SMS debt.

[08:31] I said it takes six to eight months for a project and and John says no.

[08:37] He said try 90 to 120 days typical.

[08:40] I know.

[08:41] Three to four months.

[08:43] That's insane.

[08:44] Got Leeb heads had a small staff.

[08:46] So everybody worked on every game.

[08:48] We used just in time design philosophy where everything was parallel developed.

[08:53] Art being worked on at the same time as software being written for example.

[08:57] Then everything comes together at the end typically one to two weeks to tweak the game rules and find bugs.

[09:03] That's why the scoring was so out of balance on a lot of titles.

[09:07] Management never allowed software updates for games for rule tweaks.

[09:11] So once the game was boxed up then no wrong changes unless it was a big bug fix like a game crash.

[09:17] That's like I was I went on this sort of tangent and rant like how can you make such an amazing play field

[09:25] have so much fun packed into this with some amazing max and only do it in like six to eight months.

[09:31] And he's just telling us oh yeah no we just did that like in two months.

[09:35] That's like when you think about stern today and typically they're like a packed cycle is 12 months.

[09:43] And you know 18 months is really where they fit and guys like Steve Richie or more on a you know almost on a 20 month cycle like that's crazy.

[09:52] Back in the E.M. era would be like every month or two months.

[09:55] But those were E.M.s and a lot of the designs were very similar should I say.

[10:00] Yeah let's move the drop down bank to the left side.

[10:02] Yeah a lot of them were recycled like that one that one design that got abused.

[10:08] It was like I was on Canada dry was on fast or quick or whatever it was on like four or five different games the exact same design.

[10:16] John also said I love this part we talked about Shack attack how we wanted the coach speech off.

[10:22] So according to John he says the Shack attack added coach speech setting is reduced coach but it's still too much.

[10:29] It would have been nice to add no coach callout setting too.

[10:33] Shack attack had a massive rule change very late the original rule set was surf and safari like oh now I feel sad.

[10:40] Yeah.

[10:41] So players needed to complete see that that interests me.

[10:44] Oh damn it management didn't like a grid of inserts and had me John remove them so they could put Shack's face on the play field instead.

[10:53] The final rule set ended up being very confusing the game is all about stacking modes but to this day nobody knows this.

[11:00] We let the cat out of the bag all the tournament players are already now when they see that Shack in a tournament which I have seen Shack in a tournament before so.

[11:09] Shack attack pinburg it was in a pinburg final I think wow I like how he also said because we mentioned the terrible.

[11:18] Gottlieb system three flippers.

[11:20] Oh John says I hated the new flipper design and tried to mod them to reduce the height of the stroke.

[11:26] I tried to method you mentioned by changing the coil stop to a system one call stop but this resulted in a weak flipper shot.

[11:32] I give permission.

[11:33] Okay this is from John Norris I give permission to design the game.

[11:36] The man who designed these games I give permission to all pinball enthusiasts to replace their flipper assemblies with Williams if they fit one of my ambitions before Gottlieb closed was to have the flipper assembly redesigned to copy Williams.

[11:48] There you go that's you have been giving the blessing he is telling you to do this the patron saint of Gottlieb John Norris says that you are allowed to change the flippers and blow they rejoiced.

[12:02] Watch it tell me about water world.

[12:04] Oh so this is great so I just I made this sort of comment like oh John Norris if you're listening just let us know what came out of the water world when they took the mix out not thinking that the John Norris from Gottlieb would actually be listing and send us an email.

[12:18] What he writes is from what I recall regarding the assemblies removed from water world it had a three drop bank target placed in front of the rotating ship and a couple of other mechanical play field assemblies.

[12:30] Now of course Ray Tanser would be the person to ask that question but I have too much of an ego to reach out to Ray Tanser.

[12:36] He should reach out to me.

[12:38] Oh okay so he should be sending an emails exactly exactly.

[12:42] According to John Gottlieb only licensed barbed wire so they could put Pamela Anderson on the back glass.

[12:47] There you go totally could see that she's Canadian too you know she is that's so that sums up nice tight bow on system three from from really I would say the

[12:59] expert. We love to get primary sources and primary sources run for those listing are the words of the individuals that were there.

[13:09] We have our own sort of comments and suggestions and oh the reason they put that Mac over there is because you know they were lazy or the reason they use that Mac is because it was the one that they used on the

[13:21] previous machine that didn't sell and they had a bunch of them in the office and they just needed to reuse it again American pinball.

[13:28] And we wanted to actually find out not the opinion is to why they use things but from the sources themselves and that's one thing that we really pride ourselves on this

[13:37] podcast is being able to pull out those primary sources even though it takes forever anything else you want to add there run.

[13:44] Thanks John.

[13:46] Yeah that's awesome. So today's topic let's just dive right into that the coin up industry and specifically pinball has always been an eclectic mix of characters pinball events are the melting pot of individuality

[13:59] social classes education levels and wit one thing these gatherings heaven spades is personality python angel was an eclectic passionate charming classically

[14:10] educated combative spiteful and caring individual he gave his all for pinball python is a guy who added social commentary to his back glass art added Easter eggs to his work drank a lot

[14:25] fought with leadership over creating unique worlds under glass and of course burned bridges one thing that will dive into his python tossing insults to his former co-workers one thing that

[14:37] python did is he pulled no punches on his life's journey he was a nut for sure in fact during the 2012 expo while undergoing cancer treatments he arrived as Hannibal lector on a cart in a

[14:52] straight jacket with a mesh mask that was there our topic today that crazy the python angel of story Ron have you met Python yes I met

[15:03] the python several times would you say that I summed him up fairly well I would say so he tossed a few bombs let's just say python was a type of person if you were going to see if you're going to see a seminar with him and he was I don't know 40 minutes to an hour late that

[15:20] be normal he's just rolling in whenever he wanted and he show up and he'd start talking and you would just be transfixed while he talked he just he definitely had a

[15:31] way he just had like this weird charisma yes and I and it's funny because I've I've never been to a big show I've of course never met a python angel

[15:42] though but when I'm watching these old videos and we've added them to the show notes you can click on them on YouTube where people have uploaded them from these old shows even

[15:51] through the computer screen with sort of poor lighting and in poor audio it just sucks you in because you just like what is he going to say next

[16:00] it's crazy some of the show notes that we have in here are links to articles comments that he's done but one one that really I really

[16:11] transfixed me there's an old podcast really I would say the first podcast back in the day called top cast their number 10

[16:20] episode was an interview with Python what what did you think of that interview yes top cast this clay

[16:25] barrel and in there's rumors around the interview itself that Python didn't realize he was actually an interview and he he kept

[16:34] mentioning some book during the interview that that he wanted clay to read and in yeah if you never heard him before he

[16:42] basically just went off I mean they talked about his life you know his education all that stuff but when he started

[16:51] talking about like a lot of his former employees it just be like you know this person sucks this person's great this person sucks this person's

[16:58] great it was like insane like wow yeah we joked we joked last episode sort of secretly throughout the old episode about Pat

[17:07] Lawler he hated Pat Lawler for some reason a lot of that came from listening to this interview and preparing for the next

[17:13] interview where he just he just roasts poor Pat Lawler is very consistent just you can almost make a list of like Steve

[17:20] Richie he likes to be richie make you a great play feels he hated Pat Law he hated Pat Lawler the one thing he always said his hero the guy he

[17:30] considered the king of pinball was Harry Williams you mentioned that on multiple interviews that that was to him that was the

[17:39] king the god of pinball that the thing to the thing to aspire to yeah it's so funny to think about the way that he

[17:49] has this passion but like I said he pulls no punches and we'll go into a lot of that we have a lot of his quotes through here we also

[17:56] have quotes about Python angelo for other people but I want to start at Williams around this time we're talking sort of late 70s

[18:07] moving into the early mid 80s there's this is the watershed moment we mentioned this in previous podcast where this

[18:14] movement to solid state the exit of a lot of the big sort of top play field producers back in the 60s and the 50s they're all starting to sort of take more

[18:26] senior management roles they're moving out of the industry and retiring you've got this fresh new talent coming in and Williams was really the the primary driver to that they they

[18:39] pulled in so much talent just like a sponge and then that talent would spin off to other places like like a got

[18:46] the bar a midway or you know a Sega daddy east but it was it was such a a flux of a time would you say that this is sort of like the the golden

[18:58] age of pinball this sort of mid 80s I know it's a golden age but it was definitely the beginning of solid states saw a lot of

[19:05] influx of young talent especially if designer especially programmers like just out of college taking advantage of this new technology what can we do with this

[19:13] it's pinball really I would say in the 50s 60s was really engineers right these were guys that were electrical engineers they were highly educated

[19:22] you know they were unique we're moving into now more like artists right the the programmers are artists the light shows that they create is like an

[19:33] art the mechanics that they're that they're doing are things they didn't think of before Python angelo bringing in his designing philosophy and his art philosophy I think is an

[19:43] example of that but let's dive into the Williams talent roster so Mike Stroll he was the president of Williams at the time

[19:52] Stroll is a big piece in this pie and really he built a big talent roster he wanted to mentor that talent roster so I want to talk a little bit about Steve

[20:04] Cordick and and who he was just add some context to those who he was hiring did you know see richie didn't like him

[20:12] uh yes Steve nobody likes their boss well no he didn't because when he did flash he showed that you have to he thought it was perfect like this like his first game of

[20:23] Williams he showed Steve Cordick in court was didn't you know like it so being Steve Richie he was like should I change anything it's like no

[20:31] Kim it's perfect I changed a damn thing this game is perfect this game is perfect and there you go that's why Steve Richie is Steve Richie

[20:39] and solved like it was 20,000 units so I guess he was right yeah and and it was Steve Cordick of course from our first episode

[20:47] Steve Richie before the mullet all right see Python might on my straw he brought you know I could do the accent but we'll be a little more

[20:54] classy today he brought so many talented people in he gave Williams so much energy and vision building a foundation of what we

[21:02] were to become that's right so he's this sort of visionary Steve Cordick he was the head of game design he was Steven

[21:10] Francis Cordick he was born in Chicago December 26th which is very close to my birthday 1911 which is not very close to my

[21:18] birth year and he's the oldest of 10 children his father worked in the steel mills and Steve Cordick worked in the civilian

[21:25] conservation core and for the United States Forestry Service during the Depression on a visit to his hometown in

[21:31] 1937 he was walking down the street without an umbrella when a torrential rain forced him to step into a lobby of a building he was passing

[21:39] that was Genko company and the reception asked if he was looking for a job which happens all the time now right and he said

[21:47] sure if he asked can you solder and he had no idea how to solder or see it yeah I can solder the first rule of being

[21:53] interviewed by a receptionist for a job after the Great Depression when nobody could get a job was always say yes and learn on the

[21:59] job as a millennial somebody in my early 30s I'm gonna have to say that doesn't happen very often nowadays

[22:10] for 45 cents an hour he was soldering on the company's production line he studied at the coin

[22:17] Cohen electric school it's probably coin it's probably coin it looks like it is I hate this these names

[22:25] we can't you people have regular names you said Genko you said Genko right I know that's because you corrected me in the last episode well

[22:31] no well I've heard it both ways but there's an interview with Steve Cordick where he says it's Genko and if Steve Cordick says it's

[22:39] Genko that's what I'm gonna say as always you begin working your way up in the engineering department his

[22:46] in the 1930s you know pin games were flipperless we talked a little bit about that and why was Steve

[22:54] Cordick so important well him along with Harry Mabbs and Wayne Nions who's another big big deal in the in the coin up

[23:02] industry at the time work together on a project in mid

[23:05] 1947 which was sort of the idea of player controlled flipper bumpers

[23:11] Humpty Dumpty added six electro mechanical flippers three on each side from the top and the bottom of the play field

[23:18] this was the first machine with flippers and as you said in a previous episode all other machines were basically garbage at this point right

[23:25] absolutely they would even retrofit flippers on the older ones are tried to Steve Cordick along with Wayne Nions

[23:32] really revolutionized the industry completely changed everything he was a big big big deal in 1948

[23:41] Cordick created triple action which feature just two flippers both controlled by buttons and those were at the bottom of the pinball

[23:49] play field not only did he help invent the flippers he also sort of invented kind of the modern idea of two flippers at the

[23:57] bottom shooting up the play field recall they were facing the other direction like they weren't the tips weren't going in

[24:04] word they were actually outward oh yes that's right yeah so you know close enough we'll mark that one up good enough

[24:11] for good enough for Canada so Roger Sharp says but not only did Steve choose to put two flippers down at the bottom of the

[24:18] play field even more importantly he provided direct current power DC power to those flippers

[24:23] being that a ball skillfully flip from the bottom of the play field could actually get to the top

[24:27] and anywhere in between with some semblance of accuracy you know as silly as that sounds today like

[24:33] at that time that's like the crazy thinking out of the box like shenanigans right he's changing everything

[24:40] maybe not nearly realizing it but you can you can imagine all the previous people they came before him we're all like well

[24:45] why would you do that you can't bump it into the holes the thing is at Genko they made primarily arcade type

[24:52] equipment meaning like they weren't pinballs they'd be like little mannequin thing like throwing a ball at a

[24:59] basket and stuff like that in all their games were all primarily running on DC voltage so I'm sure for him

[25:07] that was just normal yeah very cool Steve Corkick was a designer for Genko Valley got

[25:13] lead Williams he desired many of the most popular electro mechanical play fields in the 60s and early

[25:18] 70s he was a got lead yeah it said got lead in the in the gimmick now I mean I'm sure he was probably

[25:24] just there for a couple coffee but a valley he was there he was hired but never actually started he

[25:31] got a few of his Genko people jobs there because he got a you got to offer it Williams to be the

[25:37] primary designer so he went there yeah and it Williams he designed some some pretty amazing games

[25:42] but here's a couple of examples Shangri-La never seen one beat time which is most notable as a knockoff

[25:49] for the Beatles because you couldn't get a Beatles license back then and there was a band called the

[25:53] Beatles and I think this game is dumpster fire aces and kings this here now we're getting into the

[26:00] ones people know Skylab Grand Prix and his highest seller was space mission which I see come up

[26:08] for sale at least on a bi monthly basis yeah I'd say Grand Prix yeah you got to love orbit spinners man

[26:16] and especially on those electric mechanicals where they're just like oh there's just something

[26:21] so awesome about that George Gomez throw in a couple of electro mechanical spinners forget

[26:26] these optical spinner things you also made some solid state games poke Reno in contact oh big time

[26:34] sellers you can see we're moving into he's moving out of sort of that older era into the solid state

[26:41] era and you could tell he's kind of like later in his career and he's like ah it's a big change

[26:46] yeah he was he was more of a mentor and just the guy at Williams where if they couldn't figure

[26:52] something out he might look at it and like oh did just do this we did this on this game in like

[26:57] 1940 something and like oh oh yeah hey it works that that was what he did primarily at Williams

[27:03] think of him like think of him as like Yoda the Yoda of Williams that's probably the best description

[27:08] I can go when you move into sort of the more management rules you know part of you I think probably

[27:14] still wants to be out on the line you know designing some some play feels and doing all that stuff but

[27:21] it gets to a point where you know that's probably not gonna happen because again things are so

[27:27] rapidly changing during that time and now we're moving into sort of the cultural zeitgeist of the

[27:33] the late 60s in the 70s Steve Cortic worked point out from well 1937 to 1999 yeah which is which

[27:40] is he was there when pinball 2000 shut down yeah he passed away he passed away on February 19th

[27:45] 2012 at age 100 if we can all get to that age I think we would all be pretty happy with that

[27:51] considering we're you know all about to die here the coming months yeah he broke his hip

[27:56] near the end so he kind of went down hill the last year or so but before that I'd say until he was

[28:01] like 90 70 90 like he was as energetic as anyone you will meet yeah isn't that awesome when you go

[28:08] to expo he would not stop talking that's the best that's that's the best when you meet individuals

[28:13] who are older and they're still ingrained in what they're doing they're not designing the play

[28:17] fields but imagine you get to go to a an expo and people come up to you and they're like oh grand

[28:22] free I've got one you know I I stripped the play field I repainted it it's you know it looks like

[28:29] it came out of the factory you know imagine how amazing that that would feel for you the designer

[28:34] and then how it would recharge your batteries all the time right as opposed to you know a lot of

[28:38] retirees who sit at home and watch home and garden television right he would do things like if

[28:43] someone came in with like a pinball book like all the like pictures in it like oh you have the

[28:49] page open a grand prix it's like can you sign my book he'd sign the book then he take the book it's

[28:53] like oh I did this one too and he'd sign that oh I did this one too and I'd sign that and a guy

[28:57] would be there for 10 minutes perfect it's like a it's like a George Gomez you know signature on a

[29:02] translate it just takes 45 minutes yes I mean really he spent a lot of time reinvesting

[29:09] reinventing Williams for really the second half of the 20th century and you know I've just collected

[29:16] a group of individuals here on his all-star team who's who's all-star team is this well it wouldn't

[29:23] be Steve Cornix all-star team I would call it Steve Cornix all-star team you know think so who's

[29:30] all-star team was it it would be more Mike Strolls they've got you actually hired them specifically he

[29:34] was a major mentor he was Barry Auser's main mentor Barry Auser was his main student if you will

[29:40] at the end of his life the Steve Cortec he only had like a few games in his house and they were all

[29:45] Barry's games I wouldn't say like he like I said he was more of a Yoda he was not in any decision-making

[29:51] function he was not hiring people so I wouldn't say that he's got he's got some individuals here

[29:58] along with Mike Stroll Ken Fresna who was the VP of management at the time Ken Fidesna Ken Fidesna

[30:08] we've got you know guys that came into Williams that Steve Cornix sort of mentored were the John

[30:16] Trudeau's the Barry Auser's Pat Lawler Dennis Nordman Chris Granger Larry Tamar Steve Richie Eugene

[30:23] Jarvis Greg Ferreris on and on and on so the the legend and the innovative mind that was

[30:32] Steve Cortec really worked with I would say the legends of the industry or the sort of the

[30:38] modern legends of the industry and now those legends are sort of inspiring the the next

[30:44] cumbers up when you look at individuals like Eric Minier who says his last name wrong it's actually

[30:52] Eric Minier and you've got individuals like Keith Ellwyn who are now working with some of the

[30:58] the next generation sort of mentors of course one person that was brought in around this time

[31:05] Python Angelo our topic today Python was born in Transylvania Romania I can literally hear him

[31:13] saying that in my head because that was a weird Transylvania Romania and it'd be like it's like

[31:19] you can't be serious really as crazy as he was it's like and you were actually born in Transylvania

[31:25] this is it's like too perfect yeah being born in Detroit just wasn't good enough no no it cannot

[31:31] be nearly as cool as being born in Transylvania Romania January 1st 1954 by the age of four Python

[31:38] could draw much better than he could actually speak he would draw for six to eight hours and a

[31:43] single sitting and it was often his grandmother and aunt that would help him and inspire him to

[31:50] keep drawing which as a parent of two children under five during a massive pandemic I will say is

[31:59] just a way to keep him busy because it is very difficult dealing with young children he would say

[32:06] that he often grew up in poverty and that gave him the gift of a creative mind he had to

[32:13] bend his mind and play games and have imagination as opposed to have things sort of fed to him in the

[32:18] ways of I don't know like television or books or movies or theaters or today's you know video

[32:24] games maybe he would often say that he played pinball in a place in the black sea pinball is in his

[32:30] mind like a miniature amusement park yeah Python would say kids changed into a ball and had power in

[32:37] their fingertips for 25 cents I put that quote in our show notes because it's like the way that he

[32:44] thinks about it right is that you are you're one with the machine you're transforming it you're the

[32:51] one that's being able to manipulate it sort of out of your head and with your hands but still be

[32:57] immersed in it is is a theme amongst I would say is a theme along this this podcast today where he

[33:05] thinks of things and describes them very oddly after studying art and animation in Romania and in

[33:11] the United States he won various art awards and universities and in fact if you go back and you

[33:18] look in October 27th 1974 Chicago Tribune they actually devoted four pages to Python angelo and

[33:25] this was well before his pinball career 1974 to 1980 he actually had two art studios one called

[33:32] pen and ink and the other called art force in Chicago my assumption the reason he had two art

[33:38] studios is probably because as an artist you don't make any money and it goes under and then you

[33:43] go somewhere else and start a new one he actually has done TV guides he did giant murals for the

[33:49] Chicago animation and commercials and film industry a lot of creative writing he spent a lot of

[33:56] time doing creative writing and writing stories and of course one of the things that he mentions

[34:01] almost all the time and everything that he does for on he worked as an animator for Disney until 1979

[34:07] he often talks about his time at Disney being maybe not as fulfilling as he wanted it to be

[34:14] but he always told people that he worked at Disney well you have to be good really good to be an

[34:21] animator Disney that's probably why he said it and I would I would think even then Disney was probably

[34:26] too corporate for him would be my guess because I'm sure they told him what to draw which probably

[34:31] wasn't something he was into yeah the Disney in that time right they're making some of those

[34:37] just absolute epic Disney movies sort of in that time period right so they know what they want

[34:43] and your job is to sort of you know animate now enjoy it what epic Disney movies where they make

[34:48] like black hole that's one I could think of I think that was late 70s it has nothing to do with the

[34:53] Gottlieb game black hole yeah because because Disney was dead by that time that's when they were

[34:58] that's when they were doing some crappier movies I would say Robin Hood come on Robin Hood was

[35:05] an awesome there's literally a break between 77 and then 81 and then between 81 and 85

[35:10] they weren't doing shit yeah yeah it was because they were hiring people like Python and you know

[35:15] who weren't doing any work because they were not killing it then yeah I loved Robin Hood Robin Hood

[35:20] was great and Winnie the Pooh come on I never like Winnie the Pooh the rescuers the little mice

[35:26] and they're in the thing with the hats come on I think the jungle book was probably the biggest one

[35:31] they did in that period after Disney was dead yeah I mean like let me let me adjust the word

[35:37] epic to being pretty good now Python never really elaborated much to what he did at Disney but he

[35:44] would often say that it wasn't really one of his happier jobs so he left Disney for Williams and

[35:50] he would always say this in all of his interviews that he took a 50% pay cut because he thought video

[35:56] games had more potential than traditional animation I mean I don't know what he's making at Disney or

[36:01] if he's hyper inflating what he actually did but he must have been making you know mad money at Disney

[36:08] because I'm sure that video wasn't necessarily paying you know introduction wages what were some of

[36:14] the games that he first sort of worked on at Williams when he jumped over well he's got to hit

[36:20] immediately joust 1982 he did the art and animation yes classic game animation of the actual

[36:27] the bird flying which if you want if you ever played again that's one of the highlights it looks

[36:33] realistic is as much as they could do with the graphics then it the very effective flying animation

[36:40] with the bird it was a huge hit to the point where they made a sequel joust two which wasn't as big

[36:45] a hit and they actually did a head to head pinball of it yeah and that's sort of sort of where you

[36:52] got first kind of introduced to that side of the business he did bubbles which is another great

[36:57] game it takes place and he was the designer and art on that he actually got a big piece of that you

[37:02] are a bubble you're in a sink and you can grow and get bigger but certain things can kill you it's

[37:09] very it very very interesting games back then it was it was a different world in video games then

[37:17] now video games will fall into one of four five categories you know shooters sports games whatever

[37:23] back in the early eighties every game had to be completely different yeah and they were they

[37:28] were they were creating an industry at that time right so you didn't know what to make until you

[37:32] made it yeah but the games were unclassifiable how do you classify well in this game you're a bubble

[37:37] in a sink you know in this game you're a chef and you throw pepper at things you know in this

[37:43] game you're a carpenter well it was originally carpenter who's getting barrels thrown at you by

[37:48] a gorilla yeah here in this game you're drawing circles and squares oh god kicks I hated kicks

[37:57] so he did sinister he did the sound recording in that he was a sound recordist in fact in 1983

[38:03] sinister is kind of cool uh played once awesome uses a 49-way joystick to get the smooth

[38:12] turning and the sound is epic it has speech samples that will sound wrap out of the

[38:18] ears yeah it is that has a huge like sinister head that comes at you it's awesome yeah it

[38:24] there he did star writer where he did the design concept and artwork it also in 83 and in

[38:29] ferno 1984 he was the designer of that game and you know you spend some time in video it seems like

[38:37] a lot of the current generation of pinball designers um you know around that from from 1980 all

[38:44] the way up to you know the 2000s they spent some time one way or another in video yeah well

[38:49] that's because the pinball industry took a dump around 81 82 video games took over so that makes

[38:56] perfect sense that he would be doing video games and then when pinball started to come back in the

[39:00] mid 80s he finally gets to work in pinball he would say he would say that he wanted to make art that

[39:05] wasn't for the elites that art for anyone to appreciate and what better way to do that was was

[39:12] was thinking in pinball and you know when you think of art for elites of course he's classically

[39:18] trained in Romanian the US in art and art theory and all of that stuff are like those you know

[39:26] Picasso kind of names right like he wants to make art that everybody can can enjoy today all the day

[39:33] and enjoy it for what it is and he saw that I guess in one way or another as video and now we're

[39:38] moving into his pinball time Python as a creative and we'll talk about sort of a creative mindset

[39:46] if you're a creative you have a really kind of weird way to think of things and that's why people

[39:51] often call them like eccentric or strange because they just think of things just differently and it's

[39:56] hard to have conversations with those people Python says I don't nine to five and pretend I'm working

[40:01] I work when I'm creative work two days work for 16 hours work for three hours which is funny

[40:07] because there's all kinds of William stories with Python where he had something do a deadline and

[40:13] didn't even start it yet and was panicking and then would do it all like in a day or two days and

[40:18] send it yeah and then it would be like some amazing you know peace yeah because they they need that

[40:24] pressure sometimes right it's one of those deals where he's you know I'm creative artist but I think

[40:29] a lot of the fellow employees around and we're like now you just put it off to the last second yeah he's

[40:33] just yeah he's just forget this procrastinating right but that's how that creative mindset works

[40:39] right this is when you're a creative you're you're different one of my favorite creatives that I

[40:44] that you could see today modern is is a Christopher franchi you know this guy in his art and his design

[40:52] he's got Easter eggs he's got he's a perfectionist through and through he's doing his super awesome

[40:56] pinball show podcast with with Ed and Christian line he's he's doing art for various companies he's

[41:04] doing art for apps he's selling trans lights like he's just he just loves doing those things but

[41:09] you know he can sometimes rub people the wrong way or when people critique him he he he pushes back

[41:17] but that's because they're creatives and they're putting they're all and everything into it and

[41:21] they think differently than most people right like you're an IT guy right I'm a sales guy you know

[41:27] when we you know we talk differently which I think is probably why are the podcast well yeah you have

[41:32] a weird accent I talk normally that's right you you have that slur where you sound slower I sound

[41:39] like I'm super fancy that's how it works it's balance and creatives talk differently than us and

[41:46] it's it's interesting because when you go through the quotes and we'll go through these through at

[41:50] the pod Python is insane he's like a creative creative so what was his first game comments so let's

[41:59] take a I once threw up off of her roller coaster stats here with com it that's a true story

[42:06] com it is a theme park under glass it was June of 85 it was a standard body to 8,100 units

[42:15] designed by Barry outslur who did Goregar space shuttle doctor who pin bought jackpot and of course

[42:23] the greatest game of all time pop by saves the universe best super pin all right yeah no

[42:31] software by Brian Dalatowski and finished by Bill Futson router see I can say that one

[42:42] Futson yep can't say the other guy's name could say Futson router who actually worked at the old

[42:48] Stern electronics we may have mentioned him in our stern episode yeah he's a very very important

[42:56] individual especially in this kind of mid 80s early 90s and of course artwork by Python

[43:03] Angelo say a sound by Dave Zabrisky did I say that one right looks right to me tails of the

[43:09] Raven Knights scared stiff bad girls and the epic cactus jacks this game this is a cool game

[43:18] because it's so different it's it's it's in that era you know Python a good timing there he was in

[43:24] the resurgence of pinball in the mid 80s when we started cranking out these these huge hit games

[43:31] right place right time 8,000 was a ton for that era that's that's when it started to come back

[43:38] I got to say as well during this time it is maybe right place right time but it's also he's part

[43:46] of creating that right place right time right his art coming together new designers like Barry

[43:51] Osler software by a bill Futson router who's able to now draw on the new world that is the Williams

[44:01] controllers right games are definitely becoming more the I hate to keep using the turt the world

[44:06] under glass where yeah we're going to use a lot of that this time so if you don't like that term

[44:11] this is not your part because this is truly a you know it's it's not like you just slap a

[44:17] a title on a game or like no the entire game is based around a theme and everything has to be

[44:24] part of the theme and that's new right that's not something that really was staying not really

[44:29] I mean high speed kind of started the whole the story thing the whole game is the story

[44:34] and they just ran with it so every every game now has to be a full experience

[44:41] yeah the art has to speak to the code to speak to design toys they have to make sense so if you're

[44:46] going to have it we'll we'll get into other games later on but things like when you have

[44:50] fish tails and it has a real in it but of course it does it's fishing it makes sense you know or

[44:55] common is really amusement park through and through again we like to bring up the ipdb

[45:02] internet pinball machine database and really kind of dive into some of the photos they've got some

[45:07] really cool the old flyers from some of these things and again they get into that salesy stuff

[45:14] not just a fantastic new pin not just all the fun of an amusement park but a chance to make a

[45:21] million million yeah there you go perfect I didn't do it justice million I miss some of the flyers

[45:29] just the descriptions of these things like wow these are the coolest games ever may yeah this is

[45:34] like it doesn't get any who wants to go to a real theme park when you could just play a pinball

[45:38] machine of a theme park so what python says about comment we argue for two months on the art

[45:43] to make an amusement park like walking in the gate I went to an amusement park and paid them

[45:48] two thousand dollars to turn around the seat so I'm looking backward so I could watch the riders

[45:53] for the back glass yeah I don't know if that's hyperbole from python or I can't see them actually

[45:58] doing that I don't care how much you paid them I can't see any world where like oh yeah we'll

[46:02] take the front seat and turn it around so you can yeah yeah but and that's that's very python also

[46:10] he might stretch it a bit let's say he said a lot of things about you know he had things about

[46:15] spies and and other he had a lot of crazy stuff believe me if you hung out in a bar with him and

[46:21] he got going there was a lot of crazy stuff he would say he would say that he wanted to see the

[46:26] riders faces of joy and excitement and fear he wanted to have that correctly on the back glass

[46:32] for his inspiration and I mean what a maybe it happened you know maybe he had you know been drinking

[46:43] a little bit it's a great story though right yeah it's it is a great story now you alluded to this

[46:49] with your million shot call out there just a second ago what was something that was such a big deal

[46:55] in this machine it's the first one with them one million shot which probably isn't true because

[47:01] we have a node on here first solid state with a million shot but there was an EM including

[47:05] Williams 1957 arrowhead score inflation Ron can you can you describe score inflation to me

[47:13] ah the scores kept getting bigger and bigger and as the manufacturers kept making a bigger

[47:18] the other man like for one manufacturer does it the other one's got to do it and they just kept

[47:22] getting bigger and bigger up to around probably attack for Mars era like 95 where you get like

[47:28] skill shot 10 million other ridiculous ridiculous and then they paired back quite a bit so you got

[47:34] things like medieval madness for the scoring is way lower they kind of said that we went a little too

[47:39] far yeah Jersey Jack you know they're basically down into the hundreds of thousands now

[47:43] and they do Jersey jacks are kind of if you get a million it's kind of like old school if you

[47:48] get a million that's a science you you've really achieved something like a million you know pithons

[47:55] pithon I guess he said he was such he was such a driver or a force to have this million shot so

[48:02] the way that it works right is that there's like this weird kind of ramp off to the right and it has

[48:10] consecutive smaller holes so the idea is you're standing at the bottom you know you do your series of

[48:16] things and you have a chance to make a million shot and you got to shoot it up this ramp and it has

[48:23] to kind of jump over two holes and into a third hole and that gives you a million points and you get

[48:30] this big million point call out that's new I guess but you know it's the concept of a hurry up right

[48:37] isn't that really kind of what it is I've actually never gotten it and I probably only played two or

[48:41] three games of comment my life it was a big big big reward so back in the day you know if you

[48:46] got multi-ball that was like your reward it wasn't easy to get where multi-balls now or you know

[48:52] you can get it by accident most of the time this was like your big reward was this million point shot

[48:58] and is it that great I'm sure it was for the time they sold over 8,000 units so I would say a lot

[49:04] of people thought it was a really great thing I guess I mean yeah Python says and the callout was

[49:11] done by Steve Corte the million point call out Python says I wanted the player to be fully immersed in

[49:16] a miniature amusement park using a one million shot on the game was my first daring idea and pinball

[49:22] design I wanted the voice of Steve Corte to call the shot as this was the first game to score such a

[49:26] high score with a perfectly time shot it's funny because it's like he needed to get somebody epic

[49:32] to do the call out the person he chooses is sort of the mentor figure at Williams at the time

[49:39] who's already been in the industry almost 50 years at that point right so is he sucking up a little

[49:44] bit here does he want him to do it because he wants to you know this is such an important shot it's

[49:48] Python who knows and in his top cast interview you know he didn't have much nice to say about

[49:55] Steve Corte which is funny that he would choose him to be such a you know important piece of this

[50:00] key yeah he he was consistent though I'm sure you wouldn't find any interviews where he said he

[50:06] likes Steve Corte if he said he didn't like him I don't get it what do you think of the back glass

[50:10] of Python's back glass the faces are awesome back glasses insane Barry outslur is the last guy in

[50:16] the back there Scott is mustache and his hair either look happy or completely terrified yeah it's

[50:23] so fun and into the faces and the the detail on the faces is so unique and different and you'll see

[50:29] that with pythons designs all of his art going forward is that they all kind of have a similar sort

[50:34] of color saturation and things you know he adds a lot of these like Easter eggs and strange little

[50:40] bits through it like there's a you know there's a person sitting in the third row whose face is

[50:45] completely covered by the terrified women's in the second row her hair is flying back because

[50:51] they're going so fast it's hilarious there's like a child or something in there who shouldn't be on

[50:56] a comet tons of fun what what a weird weird thing Python would also say that when you look at

[51:05] that play field right so you're standing there as the player and you've got this weird top down

[51:09] thing right you can it's like there's an amusement park under there and people are walking around

[51:15] and they're going to get concessions and they're going to you know various rides and they're sitting

[51:19] on the rides well when he did the pencil designs Python rearranged all the lights on the play field

[51:26] to make sure that they integrated with the artwork and he would say that I wanted the player to be

[51:31] totally immersed in a miniature park before you just sort of put the the lights where you need them right

[51:37] you just sort of put them there and you drew around the art where it's almost like he's changing the

[51:43] way that you do it and you're integrating the lights into the art and we'll see later on you know

[51:50] the eyes of something are the flashing lights right I thought it would also be the type of person to say

[51:56] I invented that no one did that before me yeah which there might be some

[52:03] but I wouldn't say that it is the truth yeah it's what makes Python Python yeah outslur would also tell

[52:09] IPDB that Python wanted the top roll over inserts so again you plunge the ball it comes up to the top

[52:17] of the play field it has these switches that you roll over there's like four lanes and that would spell

[52:24] that would be the letters 1986 in recognition of Haley's comment and that would fly by earth

[52:31] in 1986 and in Canada numbers or letters obviously that's right that's right because we're speaking

[52:38] the Queen's maths Haley's comment is every 70 how many years

[52:44] I will not live to smile I'd have to be like 90 I'd have to live as long as Steve courted

[52:50] yeah I'm not I'm not googling that so if you want to send us an email to silver ball chronicles

[52:54] a gmail dot com 70 something or you can send it over to our facebook page at facebook dot com slash

[53:00] silver ball chronicles regarding comment Barry ouster would say comment wasn't the original name

[53:05] it was going to be called river view named after the amusement park that used to be across the river

[53:09] from Williams after discussions with management and some of the big distributors Barry changed the name

[53:15] and used one of the roller coaster names from that park yeah that's kind of cool comment was

[53:19] common name for roller coasters back then along with cyclone and hurricane which will probably come

[53:25] into play later on I think so so Steve Richie's next big project at Williams was high speed and he

[53:33] brought in python angelo to do the high speed back glass and this is one of my favorite back glass

[53:41] arts ever it's a good back glass this back glass became sort of a bit of a

[53:51] contentious point I guess is a diplomatic way to say the the relationship between Steve Richie

[53:57] and his vision and python angelo's art and his vision the guidance from Steve was that you were

[54:03] outrunning the police in a police chase it was more about the story of a chase and getting away

[54:10] from the police python would say that he didn't like that you were going to be running from the police

[54:16] he preferred that you are the police chasing a speeding car now that sounds very similar right

[54:26] not really one way you're as a player you are technically breaking the law and running from the

[54:31] cops and pythons view you would be the cops trying to arrest the player who broke the law or

[54:38] something or you are the cop trying to arrest someone right it's a different perspective but in

[54:44] in the grand scheme of things it's still about a car getting away from the police right it's just

[54:48] it's just who are you the antagonist the protagonist right you're technically both you're the bad guy

[54:53] you're breaking the law but you are that's you you are the player and you want to get away so you

[54:58] can imagine and and we know Steve Richie is all passion when it comes to his design and its idea

[55:04] behind that like it's not irregular that we hear stories about Steve Richie getting into fights

[55:08] with like a Dwight Sullivan or getting into arguments with somebody over mechanics or McKin or

[55:14] or the pieces that go into their games like you know when you're dealing with passionate individuals

[55:18] that passion bubbles to the top and now you've got somebody like a python angelo who we've said is

[55:22] it's completely nuts and you've got Richie who in his own way is kind of nuts and they're both

[55:27] kind of clashing over well what is the vision of this right no I'm I'm not running away from the

[55:33] police it's like you are the police trying to catch them like no no you are the guy trying to get

[55:37] away and we'll talk about we'll talk about high speed in the future in in our next Steve Richie

[55:42] episode but you know that nuance difference you know can cause a lot of contention a lot of

[55:49] lot of arguments yeah he says Steve didn't like the idea you were being chased by the cops and

[55:53] Steve didn't like that you were the cops Steve was busted by the cops you chased the player the

[55:58] only reason he liked it was I put him in a Mazarradi and Kingpin and he was getting away

[56:03] yeah so he sort of used this um psychology of of well you're the guy in the car Steve you're the one

[56:10] that's that's that's being chased by the police and then immediately it's like oh he changed it but

[56:16] I mean I'm pretty sure Steve Richie is a little bit smarter than that like give me a break

[56:21] why did python care so much that he put you the player in the squad card chasing the criminal

[56:28] because python said he didn't like that rap or violent music was encouraging you to do bad things

[56:33] pythons argument was that violence and drugs is in what artists should do with their medium which

[56:38] is such an interesting statement yeah he said he wanted to be a moment in a spiritual force for

[56:45] entertainment he didn't want to be a force of evil in the universe right which is kind of weird

[56:52] like it's a game come on so python would leave the project um sort of you know partially

[56:58] complete and he would give the rest to uh mark uh spanger yeah and honestly that's one of the things

[57:04] that always bothered me about high speed is I like when the games have the same artists for the back

[57:09] glass the play field art the cabinet art because it all it's it's ties together it all speaks with one

[57:16] voice it's very obvious when you look at high speed that a different person did the back glass that

[57:21] did the play field the funny thing is you know what the Williams and in Williams they would have

[57:28] should I say unflattering names for their games they would do as like a joke like high high speed

[57:34] was called high cost that's what they called it in the company but they actually had a name for

[57:38] that back glass the high speed back glass do you know what they do you know what they called it I don't

[57:44] zombie cops from hell oh no that's what they call it is it because that back glass because they have

[57:50] like weird facial features I I see the colors I don't know but that's what they called it the coolest

[57:57] part is the mirror because the mirror python put a mirror on the top so when you look at you're

[58:04] looking at you you are on the back glass yeah so cool it was and it's got that sort of python facial

[58:14] like high high detailed cartoon style facials if that makes any artistic sense whatsoever like

[58:21] they're very detailed but they've got sort of odd expressions and and things like that the other

[58:27] funny thing is it's a Maserati but the actual incident where Steve got pulled over I believe he

[58:32] was driving a Porsche very cool I really look forward to our next Steve Richie episode because we

[58:36] get into some really good I'm the best one one bit that I really like about this back glass is that

[58:45] you're sitting in the squad car you've got player one player two player three and four those

[58:51] are say speeder one two three four and those are like this the the radar detecting gimmicks

[58:59] very cool you got one officer just yelling into his microphone the other guy is just trying to

[59:06] chase down the car there's a there's a lady in the in the in the Lamborghini Maserati looking

[59:14] looking back like in fear and you've just got somebody going flat out down a southern California

[59:20] highway it's so so cool Steve Richie got pulled over for doing 146 miles an hour and that's actually

[59:26] on the back glass too that's on that that's on the speed gun 146 miles an hour and I mean that

[59:32] game sold 17,000 units which is which is a lot according to python the game sold because of Steve's

[59:39] genius kinetics in my back glass yeah he's so he's so humble yeah so humble now he would move on

[59:47] to the project where they needed some extra help and I guess we could talk about the not so grand

[59:54] lizard stats and it's a fantasy battle theme April 86 standard body this one only sold sadly 2,000

[01:00:02] units really that seems crazy because I've seen so many of the he's yeah well 2750 so I mean I'll

[01:00:09] give it a few more there designed by Barry Osler python only did the back glass and Paul Ferris did

[01:00:17] the playfield so here's another one of those sort of projects where they need to get somebody in

[01:00:21] there to kind of finish it yeah jumbling it together about this is Paul Ferris did he did the

[01:00:27] back glass too and he did two versions of it and neither of them were used they did he did two

[01:00:32] different versions and completely different I mean the style match what was on the playfield it was

[01:00:38] it was for numeric displays instead of alpha numeric and he did two different versions with the

[01:00:44] score windows in different spots and then python came in and did the final back glass which was

[01:00:50] had this had the score displays in the position for the alpha numeric displays do you like grand

[01:00:56] lizard um it's I get I have to play in tournaments and in tournaments you just hit it up to the top

[01:01:03] part and hit the drop targets forever and never go for multi ball and it has the bongo drums and

[01:01:09] animals making sounds it's got the cool like lizard head like I like that theme for the most part but

[01:01:15] for some reason this machine just it just doesn't like this one sorcerer the opinions expressed by

[01:01:21] the members of the podcaster are there's a little it doesn't really you know I don't know everyone

[01:01:26] always calls it the upper playfield when it's not an upper playfield it's the upper part of the

[01:01:30] playfield people think it's like a by-level game it's like no it's single level the interesting

[01:01:36] thing is uh Barry Owls are pretty much ripped off uh his solar fire design it's literally almost

[01:01:41] the same thing uh the this lizard at the top it looks like it was like it looks like one you'd like

[01:01:48] like a gecko you'd peel off a highway you know in like Arizona or something like that like it's

[01:01:54] flattened out and squished and you know I don't know man it's it looks horrible just horrible

[01:02:03] the back glass is pretty cool the pre-production back glass and they've got this on ipdb it's

[01:02:07] gonna you know it's got some pretty cool stuff going on there you know like Harkin's back maybe to

[01:02:13] you know Paragon lost world but just not done is cool well it's just done by the same guy

[01:02:19] yeah it's it's interesting that he did two pre-production back glasses and they didn't use either of them

[01:02:27] and and I think they're better much better than pythons oh my goodness how dare you

[01:02:32] I this is probably pythons worst I would say it doesn't it doesn't do it for me he's got like

[01:02:37] so pythons back glasses like there's like a lady chain to this lizard thing and there's like a

[01:02:43] super muscular back of a knight fellow like a he-man kind of thing and he's attacking him and

[01:02:50] you know it's got like lots of really kind of neat things on the back glass but when you look at

[01:02:54] when you look at the the pre-production back glass which you can bring up here it's so much more

[01:02:59] detailed and paulferris has a guy punching a baboon in the face like come on how much cooler do

[01:03:07] you get to punching a baboon in the face awesome there's a story here that I couldn't find as to why

[01:03:13] they changed the back glass and why they didn't get sort of the original designer of the art

[01:03:19] package paulferris why he didn't do it there's something going on there and I couldn't quite find

[01:03:24] what that is so if you know what that is you know shoot us an email at silverballcroniclesatgmail.com

[01:03:29] if you kind of know why they just didn't get paul to do a new back glass with different windows

[01:03:34] I was a first machine have digitized sound audio samples that sound designer bill parod

[01:03:40] which I'm probably saying wrong but yes so a new sort of a new team a different introduction I would

[01:03:45] say to the way they use sound and sound samples and digitization of those samples so we're moving in

[01:03:50] now we've moved from kind of solid state being you know rules and scoring and sound and things

[01:03:57] like that into more sharpening that pencil on sound it becomes less about you know just having sound

[01:04:04] we're also getting into system 11 these games now these are all system 11 games it advanced over

[01:04:11] the old system three to seven or system nine there that that is their board set their technology

[01:04:19] behind the game is now advancing allowing them to do more stuff yeah and and more complicated stuff

[01:04:27] you know just not refining like we're totally changing the way things work and and I would say a

[01:04:32] machine that changed everything is pinbot well thousand units space fantasy theme

[01:04:40] October 86 Barry Ausler and Python who did a million games together um bill foots and

[01:04:47] router on software Python and bill they would spend a lot of time working together even a cap

[01:04:53] com they both went to capcom and here we're going to bring in somebody really really important

[01:05:00] who who I would say is a is a major ground breaker when it comes to sound and that's Chris

[01:05:06] Granner he's the sound guy along with Bill Pratt now what are your memories of pinbot uh well

[01:05:15] it screams python I'll say that this is definitely something python would make it's it's it's the

[01:05:21] first time I think it's the first time they used to motorize well it's a five bank in that game

[01:05:25] which was cool I don't know if that had been done yet they had the grid in the front when was the

[01:05:29] first time that you had seen pinbot well I didn't get into pinball until the mid 2000 so then

[01:05:36] when you saw it what it what was the first thing you were like what was the first thing that drew you

[01:05:40] in pounding the five bank and having to go down then you put it in the the visor comes up and

[01:05:45] yeah first time I saw pinbot was on the pinball arcade video game and immediately the first

[01:05:54] thing there was the sound was like whoa yeah whoa what's going on here it was it was it was amazing

[01:06:00] so it had it had all of these different pieces that drew people in from from all these different

[01:06:07] angles right one person would see the sound one person would see the the robot that is inside the

[01:06:12] glass another person like you would see the mechanics right like it really had everything

[01:06:18] and I'll tell you what I loves me some pinbot I don't have a pinbot I don't know if I would ever buy

[01:06:24] a pinbot but man every time I see one I'm like this game is awesome and and really around this time

[01:06:31] in 83 pinball was starting to sort of recover from that kind of crash of video games and gaming

[01:06:37] most definitely yeah pinbot was an example of how Williams really started to gain traction in

[01:06:44] the industry again it's it's finally they stopped spinning their wheels after a couple of years

[01:06:48] you could see there was some exponential growth and one thing that makes pinbot truly unique in

[01:06:54] comparison to most I would say games of that era or pinball games of that era is it was and Python

[01:07:01] would say take that with the greatest salt is it was originally storyboarded in early 83 and

[01:07:07] storyboard like like a like a movie right like you draw the overall vision and then you break down

[01:07:13] each piece in in in a in a in a flowing story almost kind of like a comic book I guess if you

[01:07:18] want to think of it like that and you can see that original art in the pinball compendium book

[01:07:24] as well as you can google it you can look at it at ipdb it's very very cool Python would say a

[01:07:30] pinball machine is a robot it let it's like an exoskeleton your finger controls the robot and

[01:07:38] it is an extension of you that is a weird way to say that you flip a ball around on a playfield hey

[01:07:47] that's a very normal way to say it if you could Python according to Python he said pinbot was a

[01:07:51] big risk it was very outside the box Steve Richie and Larry to Mark told Python not to do it then

[01:07:56] spent a lot of time according to Python again this is according to Python telling him and Barry

[01:08:01] don't put that there don't create that Mac and Barry and Python did it anyway.

[01:08:05] Ken Fidesna of VP at Williams approved the project and here's what Python said that what a

[01:08:10] courageous decision on Kenny's part it was more controversial as a pinball and I was the

[01:08:14] creative wacko behind it so some some feedback that I got I asked everybody on pinside and on our

[01:08:20] Facebook page to what are some thoughts about some of these various topics and Mike P said

[01:08:25] that pinbot is an amazing starter pin for somebody looking for their first machine here's some

[01:08:31] top reasons the price is more than fair for what you get which is around 15 to 1900 us it has a

[01:08:37] multi ball mode and it has a ramp of course pinbot was my first pin but when I was looking for my

[01:08:43] first pin I wanted all three of the things listed above and pinbot nailed it plus it's a fun game

[01:08:50] it offers many other different things for an inexpensive game including a whole awesome skill shot

[01:08:56] ramp upper play field interactive drop mac and an awesome sound and voice package.

[01:09:04] I guess we you know you mentioned the five bank target kind of at the the the mouth quote unquote the

[01:09:09] mouth of the of the pinbott the robot stand up targets with a with a mac that lowers down so

[01:09:14] the idea is you there's a grid and that grid has lights that are moving and you fill up the grid

[01:09:20] and the mac drops down now you can also shoot to the right of the drop mac to complete the grid or

[01:09:28] kind of like a skill shot or pre-skill shot is that if you can shoot the one lit light right off

[01:09:33] the get go it'll drop the bank right away and that was designed by somebody who's very near and

[01:09:39] dear to your heart joe joe yes joe joe originally from stern yep stern electronics designer you did

[01:09:45] games like quick solver dragon fest when you went to Williams if you look at his game list he was

[01:09:50] primarily more of a mechanical engineer he's a guy to get this got this stuff working he gave

[01:09:55] somebody gave him an idea and said hey just run with that I wonder why they never let him design

[01:09:59] anything that's a great question that'll be on the jo joe some yeah episode whenever we have that

[01:10:05] yeah exactly you know pinball was never the same without a mechanically animated sculpture on

[01:10:11] the play field and some sort of interactivity with the player the game and the theme were melded

[01:10:17] together and he would say that he would humbly say that he was the one that did that with pinball

[01:10:24] that all the sudden not only do you have a quote unquote world under glass not only do you have a

[01:10:30] story like Steve richie and high speed but you would have the theme integrate some sort of sculpture

[01:10:37] or some sort of toy or mechanic underneath the play field that would actually do something in

[01:10:45] furthering the story in in furthering the vision of what is under that class and he might not have

[01:10:52] been a hundred percent the cause of that but he certainly had a part in it let's put it that way

[01:10:59] oh my goodness the sound of pinball python says kris garanor composed an orchestral masterpiece never

[01:11:05] heard of pinball as well as a stunningly realistic package that brought pinball alive

[01:11:10] granor made the most original music not a copy of hollywood under my direction he made the most

[01:11:16] amazing music i want better than two thousand one a space odyssey i want space he was the guy yeah

[01:11:22] yeah it was it was all pythons direction without pythons direction granor wouldn't when i read these

[01:11:26] quotes i can literally hear his voice in my head saying that it's amazing there is a mock reflection

[01:11:32] of you playing the game in the pinball that is used as a separator between the world's pin

[01:11:37] and bot on the translate yeah so there's a couple of really neat little easter eggs in here i was

[01:11:43] able to sort of pull them from online and one of them is if you look at the back glass and on the

[01:11:52] back glass there's between pin and bot there's like a it's almost like a planet or a little circle

[01:11:58] and it's a reflection of you it's it's shiny it's not really a mirror but it's a shiny bit of the

[01:12:04] back glass and it's designed to be an abstract vision of you because you are the extension of the

[01:12:10] pinball robot right you are the pinball and you're in the middle between the game and the individual

[01:12:19] really weird another thing is on the back glass there's a comet which has a face

[01:12:26] and that's very very very similar to to the comet in the game comet oh did you know berry

[01:12:35] outslur is the voice of pinbot i did not know that yeah so that's kind of that's neat now it's

[01:12:40] highly distorted but i think that's one of the coolest parts about pinbot is that robotic voice

[01:12:46] it's so strange and unusual it's so cool another thing that that python talked about this were

[01:12:53] royalties paid to the individuals who designed the game we talked in the stern episode episode two

[01:13:01] about um Steve Kirk putting names on the play field his name yeah yeah specifically his name

[01:13:08] python wanted everybody's name on the play field the designer the music and things and not only

[01:13:12] that he wanted royalties for machines being paid um and i mean royalties like whatever that

[01:13:19] means i mean a commission for the amount of things that are sold but you know again everything

[01:13:25] that python says is like is he is he completely full of is he sort of partially full of right like

[01:13:31] did they actually get like a dollar a machine like python said he went to kenny fedesna this is

[01:13:36] a quote from python i went to kenny fedesna i want to put on the play field the entire design team

[01:13:42] kenny didn't have an issue the play fields were printed then you know what all the money grabbers

[01:13:47] all the control freaks yelling he can't do that yeah yeah he said that a lot about money grabbers and

[01:13:54] yeah yeah he was very concerned about how much people were making and where they were making money

[01:13:59] huh i guess the way i would describe it is python was really giving that little extra to the design

[01:14:06] teams that he worked with he was like the the sizzle on the stake you know the the flipper fingers

[01:14:12] on the robot arms for example so if you look at the flippers it's almost like the arms of the pin

[01:14:17] bottom the robot are coming down into the flippers and the flippers of the fingers which are really

[01:14:22] just strange but it draws you in you might not notice it right you might not look at it and be like

[01:14:27] oh those are the fingers but you know you you sort of subconsciously notice very cool uh what was

[01:14:33] this next game run big guns your favorite i'm sure right it's okay yeah big guns big stats big

[01:14:40] back box really big big box huge it's like a space castle siege fantasy theme

[01:14:47] october 87 we're getting really close to the nineties now system 11b from uh from Williams

[01:14:53] it sold 5,250 units designed by mark richi and python angelo software by the foots bill

[01:15:01] foots and router artwork by python angelo and sound by chris granner and brian schmit

[01:15:07] so mark who's mark richi steve richi's brother yeah and the master of the catapult he did like

[01:15:14] firepower two like 83 84 somewhere around there also has a lot of really cool innovative designs

[01:15:22] just like his brother now he's not he's not steve richi but he's you know i wouldn't mind saying

[01:15:26] some more mark richi games but then again i like road kings so people think i'm crazy yeah yeah

[01:15:32] that's that's embarrassing i wouldn't mention that to people okay now what's unique about this game

[01:15:36] is actually designed in mark richi's basement um over a bunch of pints so you know we might have

[01:15:42] alluded to this but uh but python was a was a was a bit of a drinker little bit yeah a lot of his

[01:15:49] creativity would come at the weirdest of times when he was you know hanging out

[01:15:55] having some pints and this is really a game and a theme that sort of came from that

[01:16:02] and the art in here let's because we're not focusing on really mark richi today but we'll talk

[01:16:07] about some of the the bits and pieces of this pin one of them is hidden champagne glass so there's

[01:16:13] actually a hidden champagne glass on the translate between the land separations of the planets

[01:16:19] it's like this theme where you're laying siege to a castle and there's like tanks but there

[01:16:27] tanks from the past in the future with like with like it's crazy and there's like a bag of tail

[01:16:35] in the back yeah and the castle itself has a face which i just noticed right now oh yeah

[01:16:41] see the eyes and the nose there's a whole thing going on there now it's a little bit of a it doesn't

[01:16:45] quite have the same um facial animations and design it's a little bit different with python now it's

[01:16:53] less sort of clay less cartoony but it's still very very neat this back box is huge that it is that it

[01:17:03] is isn't the biggest back box i doubt it there's always going to be something bigger a bingo a bingo

[01:17:10] but yeah you better make sure if you got a shorter ceiling in your basement or something that

[01:17:14] this game's going to fit they the reason now um what what i've what i have read through my research is

[01:17:21] the way they were able to sort of get it approved is that they told Steve courtic that the back box

[01:17:26] was inspired by Apollo which was an original design that he had done in 1967 and that's why they

[01:17:33] needed the four extra inches at the top of the back box and then one would assume that Steve went

[01:17:39] to those kind of around the office and accidentally lobbied to allow them to make this game because

[01:17:46] you know he was part of the inspiration behind it right kind of funny so lord of the ring breath

[01:17:51] from pin sight says i assume that's what l.o.t.r means at pinburg last year i happened to get big guns twice

[01:17:58] i won the game both times my strategy was simply keep sending the ball up top and pick off as many

[01:18:03] targets as possible i didn't totally ignore the locks for multi ball but just took them as they

[01:18:08] happen i had very little experience or time on big guns and found it a little funny that i won

[01:18:13] both times i played it and big guns is another one of those steel locks games so in the head to head

[01:18:18] situation you may not want to actually lock balls yeah you know kind of any game we'll talk about

[01:18:22] that probably more in the mark richie thing you know it's it's cool it's got catapults in the ball

[01:18:27] flies through the air yeah it's not so much ramps in the voice of the evil king is Steve richie of course

[01:18:33] because when you had a bad guy you get see richie do the voice oh who else would it be

[01:18:37] their next sort of adventure when it came to it was to revisit a theme that they had done before

[01:18:43] but change it up and that's with cyclone so let's circle around the stats you know like a like a

[01:18:50] circle cyclone goes circle around the stats dead silence yeah okay super super again theme park themed

[01:19:01] february eighty eight this is a system eleven b we're getting back up there again nine thousand

[01:19:07] four hundred units very outslur bill foot's and ruder criss-granner sort of the the four piece band

[01:19:14] that really i think melds well together part of that might be because nobody else can work with

[01:19:19] python but we'll leave that cyclones kind of neat i haven't played one you played one oh yeah

[01:19:25] again world under glass it's got actual uh uh ferris wheels yeah this cyclone is the one ferris wheel

[01:19:31] but again you feel like your new amusement park got ferris wheel on the side it's got some wiggly ramps

[01:19:36] you get crazy ramps crazy wonderful plastic ramps an absolute terrifying clown at the bottom oh man

[01:19:44] why does everyone hate clowns now it's terrifying i'm okay with clowns but this guy looks like he's

[01:19:50] gonna murder my dog in front of my children so we have we have clowns we have I guess that we have

[01:19:55] ferris wheels we have long flowing ramps that are supposed to be like the roller coaster great

[01:20:00] skill shot probably one of the greatest back glasses interactive back glass with a moving

[01:20:06] mystery wheel yes it's got the jackpot builder upper light gimmick on the left side it's very

[01:20:13] nice machine unique i don't know if it's a great let you long-term player and we have Ronald

[01:20:18] and Nancy Reagan for some reason on the back glass yeah i got a great quote about that he said the

[01:20:24] world loved or hated the Reagan so why not put them on the back glass Nancy at the time let a

[01:20:28] huge campaign against drugs so i added say no to drugs on her shirt i always loved adding some

[01:20:34] humor to games the the only reason i would ever own this game is for the Reagan's on the back glass

[01:20:40] i mean i don't remember the Reagan's i was too young for that i mean i lived through you know

[01:20:46] their years but i don't remember their years but having having her kind of on the back with her

[01:20:52] glad with her hair and the say no to drug shirt and she's literally waving like she's waving to

[01:20:57] the public meanwhile Ronald Reagan is like screaming terrified terrified it's again it's it's a take on

[01:21:05] what he had previously done but then sort of ramping up some social commentary this is where we get

[01:21:11] into i would say a transition period for python where a lot of the art that he starts doing now has

[01:21:19] this extra social commentary layer where before it didn't have that it was sort of just unique fun

[01:21:25] art snow he's got like a punk rock or dude on there on the rollercoaster now he would talk yeah he

[01:21:31] would talk a lot about this game in the top cast interview and then all of a sudden he starts

[01:21:37] tossing bombs over berries way he worked with outslur a lot and he did his best work with berry

[01:21:44] so i don't know why all of a sudden just randomly starts tossing sort of negativity over his way

[01:21:51] i don't get it what an odd odd guy so python comments on the back box animation it was made possible

[01:21:58] by jo jo so originally from stern electronics who did the mechanics programmer bill farts

[01:22:04] puts in rudder i enjoyed working with these gifted men so so he says that and then all of a sudden

[01:22:09] he starts tossing out some bombs to to berry i you know i don't know if the relationship soured

[01:22:14] later on uh but you know i don't get it now couple of the neat little bits uh mark richi he's the

[01:22:21] voice of the carnival barker because he's not a bad guy so the good guy is always mark richi

[01:22:27] the bad guy is always steve richi right carnival barkers never met an unhonest carnival barker

[01:22:34] right so good uh okay uh a duck can be seen on the back glass and two cows can be seen on the

[01:22:41] play field near the advanced x light yeah so let's get into the one that i enjoy i enjoy a lot

[01:22:51] so let's hail some stats like a taxi and talk about taxi which is i guess car theme

[01:22:58] it's august 1988 it sold 7300 units its design was mark richi with python on the concept software by

[01:23:08] ed boon artwork python angelo and sound by the legend chris granner so good and when you say

[01:23:16] python on concept there was no doubt it's python on concept i don't know who else would think of

[01:23:21] we're gonna have pew we're gonna have a taxi driver picking up passengers and the passengers are

[01:23:25] gonna be santa claus Dracula a kell gorbucho off pin bot at maril and roe i mean who thinks of that

[01:23:33] i'll tell you who thinks of that bat crazy python angelo so joe bob from pinside he wrote me and he

[01:23:40] said what i love about taxi first off it's an easy to understand game you can have someone step up

[01:23:46] to the machine and all you have to say is try to pick up the lit passengers that's it the plunge

[01:23:52] is enjoyable it's very important to have a good score especially in ball three when it's where three

[01:23:58] times the value you can steal locks locking a ball is only one shot and starting multi ball is only one

[01:24:07] shot which makes it quite achievable for players of all skill sets once multi ball starts there are

[01:24:13] multiple stages to completing it to get more points the music is great you will start saying hey

[01:24:21] on the gorbie collect can't ever complain about an included topper it also has a bell if you like

[01:24:28] loud noises i love a game of the bell love it i had a tag team from godly pet a bell awesome

[01:24:35] overall i just find this game fun you don't have to overthink it or prepare any complex strategy

[01:24:43] it's approachable for pretty much anyone and it is great to play as a group because the ball

[01:24:48] times can be fast you can steal from each other and it's simple but still enjoyable for advanced

[01:24:57] players would you agree with that yep 100% i think this era of games is so good at the do the thing

[01:25:07] and then the thing continues to escalate in its complexity they really nailed it at this time this

[01:25:13] they couldn't have got it any better did one thing that is very cool and again i spoke about this

[01:25:19] in the previous pin we were talking about python adds a lot of social commentary and python is

[01:25:25] himself the taxi driver in the back glass and it is his eye in the taxi drivers mirror that is a

[01:25:31] self portrait of what he felt he was like at that time python says i sometimes would make social

[01:25:39] statements with my work since the majority of Vietnam veterans were working as taxi drivers can

[01:25:43] you imagine how they would feel picking up Gorbachev python in the back glass is wearing like a

[01:25:47] military vet sort of jacket right a lot of these guys are coming back from Vietnam you know this

[01:25:53] is before we had support for PTSD this is the first war where people came back severely injured

[01:25:59] you know there's a whole commentary there that he's picking up Gorbachev the president of Russia

[01:26:04] the Soviet Union get it right this is the 80s the Soviets the Soviets yes

[01:26:10] right so there's a hole there's a whole commentary going on there right in that movie with

[01:26:15] was that movie rocky for what no the one with deniro oh it's called taxi

[01:26:23] that's that's taxi driver that's a lot different that would be like if python was going around

[01:26:28] killing all the passengers right but but taxi driver right he wore the military jacket right

[01:26:34] i only saw the movie once i don't remember uh also drawn on the playfield near the right flipper

[01:26:40] there's a cow sitting on the side of a motorcycle so what like there's another cow we're getting

[01:26:47] into a thing here there's this whole controversy around merlin and lola it's not it's not really

[01:26:54] controversy they use merlin and roe and they didn't have license to use their likeness and they

[01:26:59] were strongly advised to change that so they did they changed it to lola so they made her a red head

[01:27:05] and they just changed it in the software so whenever it would say merlin it would just say lola instead

[01:27:10] yeah they got into a whole thing because merlin Monroe was copyrighted they couldn't use her likeness

[01:27:15] in name so then they had to kind of fudge it a bit right the meter hair shorter change the hair

[01:27:19] collar change the call out and it's all done well you literally i don't think they made her

[01:27:23] shorter if they literally just made it red that's it she looks exactly the same she's just red

[01:27:28] coriina roger sharp he says the feist to say that we did have some limited run of machines featuring

[01:27:33] a blonde merlin and i don't know if these were for international only they weren't however we were

[01:27:38] informed that there were rights that needed to be secured in order to use merlin and the decision

[01:27:42] was made to just alter the artworks that the female character was renamed lola for the main production

[01:27:46] run i can tell you i have seen as many merlins is all of us almost half and half there were a ton

[01:27:52] of merlin's made that's where the controversy comes from this taxi was the game that was used for

[01:27:59] expo tournament in um october of nineteen eighty eight and they sort of had a whole row of

[01:28:04] taxis and they were all merlin's there's that's where that controversy comes from here like

[01:28:08] they're so rare you know do you have not rarerlin they're not rare roger sharp also says if memory

[01:28:13] serves and i can't say with certainty there might be games that were manufactured with a brunette

[01:28:17] lola first before the red hat i've never seen a brunette lola so i if there's one that exists that's

[01:28:23] probably the rarest taxi of all yes to stop worrying about the blonde merlin and start looking

[01:28:29] for the brunette lola you have like the ultimate according to mark richi is explained in the pinball

[01:28:35] compendium he says at least two hundred sample games were in the process of being shipped with

[01:28:39] merlin before the change had to be made had to be more than two hundred you also explain the name

[01:28:43] lola was taken from a nineteen seventy song by the kinks about a transvestite chosen to be fit her

[01:28:49] muscular arms as she was depicted on the back glass there you go we're getting into all these

[01:28:55] weird easter eggs and things like before pinball was just sort of pinball right that was it it was

[01:29:00] a medium now there's all these like extra meanings and inside jokes and little bits shoved in here

[01:29:07] there that only means something to the people that are making the games next they did jokers so we'll

[01:29:13] do some stats with a zed because you spell jokers with a zed for some reason the thing is this is

[01:29:19] the one Williams stereo game who although i think pinball two thousand was in stereo but as far

[01:29:25] but far as a regular the rest of their games this was the one game for whatever reason that was

[01:29:30] decided yeah we're going to do stereo with this one this one is card game December of 1988

[01:29:37] it's uh... five thousand four hundred units berry uh... outslur python angel with concept bill

[01:29:45] foot in ruder and this is the first time we're going to see john yosi and sound but chris granner

[01:29:51] python says on the theme he says the play field had no theme until kenny asked me to join in i

[01:29:57] designed the upper play field the social irony of kings and queens playing cards for fun with our

[01:30:03] little jokers lives on the line a metaphor symbolic game wow i did not know that but yes so he's

[01:30:09] like oh here's the here's the elite the elites are sitting at the table and they're playing cards with

[01:30:15] all of us jokers around them but for the jokers in there the elite can't we kill them see that would

[01:30:20] be more fun oh what are you france now something like that i guess that's trying to quiet we are playing

[01:30:27] some of the call outs and yes super cool now the back glass was done by yosi that was his first

[01:30:33] back glass and there is a joker on the back glass that is a self portrait of him yes and john

[01:30:39] yosi who would end up doing artwork for a ton of pat lawler games yes next they would move on to

[01:30:45] police force don't you mean batman of course it was supposed to be the michael keaton batman which is

[01:30:51] the only batman what's they lost out to daddy east on the license so they had to re-theme it which

[01:30:56] to me means that the animals in police force because there's all the different animals they had to

[01:31:01] have been the villains so i i kept thinking like which one was supposed to be say the joker maybe

[01:31:07] which one was supposed to be a good point you know the penguin that kind of thing had to be what

[01:31:13] they were going for and the car is a was supposed to be the bat mobile yep and the back glass

[01:31:20] does a very reminiscent of high speed it's yeah it's like a bit of a riff instead of the zombie cat

[01:31:25] cops from hell we have the animals in the cop car yeah it's still still in the center it's almost

[01:31:31] like the dashboard of the car right yep the on board mobile police computer now some other

[01:31:36] little bits in here the yellow taxi on the back glass is the taxi from taxi and he's getting

[01:31:42] chased by the cops for some reason yes and a cop car says say no to drugs on the back yes as it

[01:31:48] always does which just from knowing what i know about python i can see no world where he did not

[01:31:54] take drugs at least some it's sometime if i were a gambling man i'd put all my chips on white

[01:32:02] listing a list or to the show Dylan he would say that i love this game there are so many strange

[01:32:09] Easter eggs in the art it's very fun when the rules are adjusted properly in the software for example

[01:32:16] calming down the center ramp you want to talk about center ramp all day on this i know that's the

[01:32:20] pinberg strategy yeah just smash that center ramp this era you can tell that there's something

[01:32:27] about this whole era of pinball machines like they just started ramps right ramps were connect they

[01:32:33] were they were around for a while but they were like trying to figure out what else they could do

[01:32:38] with well they were still wants to start to get in the plastic molded ramps then they could get

[01:32:42] absolutely crazy what would they could do with these these ramps you can make them curve around

[01:32:47] things you can make them just exit the entire playfield go out the back panel come back in you

[01:32:52] could do so much of plastic ramps yeah they could zigzag and at this time they were like well like

[01:32:57] put a ramp in the middle of the playfield and that became a thing and i don't i don't know it just

[01:33:01] part of me doesn't like the aesthetic of that part of me doesn't like the way that it gets in

[01:33:05] it gets in the way or that you're always using it nonstop like like police force you're just in

[01:33:11] the ramp in the ramp in the ramp in the ramp you don't have to play it like that but i'm not a really

[01:33:16] great player so when i'm shooting the ball and i just accidentally repeat a ramp even though

[01:33:22] when i'm not trying to i find it quite frustrating and if you go to ipdb you will actually see

[01:33:28] the original concept artwork for police force when it was Batman oh you know i should have

[01:33:34] looked at this okay so okay so it was supposed to be now this is original concept this is before

[01:33:39] playfield was even done so but it does have the car there yeah it has it has the car down the left

[01:33:44] side with the the lock completely different playfield though yeah it looks like a better playfield

[01:33:49] in my opinion it's before the center ramp was sort of thrown in it's got a right side ramp that

[01:33:56] goes all the way up it's got Batman in the middle and his utility belt are like the the lights

[01:34:01] and it looks like the idea of doing redoing the high speed back glass was there even then yes

[01:34:07] yeah very very cool go check that out ipdb dot org looking up it's it's it's i like police force

[01:34:14] i you know i don't think it's amazing but i like it it's fun it the best part of it is the art

[01:34:19] really it's so cool so off the wall i don't want to talk about these two but i'll mention them

[01:34:25] oh no bad cats was a favorite of python yeah probably one of the i think it was the last

[01:34:32] Williams game they did that was single ball that had no multi ball and it had it had the big plastic

[01:34:39] ramp in the center um it's got actually i actually i have grown to like this more because it is goofy

[01:34:44] meow meow meow meow meow meow meow just the the callouts are hilarious on the game it has

[01:34:50] mechanical back glass mechanical action going on there pythons on the back glass he is a snake

[01:34:56] he is a pinball python there's like a build up there's like a build up jackpot down to that there's

[01:35:02] a there's a python snake and there's python angelo yes and it's got his head is is the head of

[01:35:09] the snake in his tail is a instead of a rattle it's a flipper it's one of those games it's so i like

[01:35:14] goofy and this is this is totally goofy i spoke before about how the art and the lights in pythons

[01:35:21] games are all integrated well at the bottom of the play field the the the multipliers are the

[01:35:27] eyes of these cats and they're like these amber eyes they're really bright there's one of those

[01:35:35] spinny wheel things underneath the play field what are those called like a roulette roulette

[01:35:41] roulette yeah yeah yeah i got it my hat me am yeah me am yeah i haven't played a bad cats great sound

[01:35:47] package one more time it's like yeah you're a big fan of mousen around right well when you hit

[01:35:53] the ramp it's just did that clock me am yeah me am yeah me am yeah me am yeah me am yeah and again it's

[01:35:58] got that friggin repeatable ramp in the middle right you actually it's it is too repeatable ramps

[01:36:05] left and middle yeah so it's just like let's just keep smashing those ramp oh yeah that's pretty much

[01:36:10] what you do yeah i still find it fun it's cool it's just packed with the artwork is insane yeah you

[01:36:17] could tell that he they were like oh let's get something done here now the quote uh from python was

[01:36:23] that they were looking for a way to fill a gap in the line and bad cats was the way to fill that

[01:36:28] the other way to fill the the line at the time was bug's bunny birthday bash you you got it wrong

[01:36:34] to everyone does that wrong it's bugs bunny birthday ball not bash and we'll never talk about bugs

[01:36:41] bunny's birthday ball no no no yes we will because it's a significant it's significant and one of

[01:36:47] the things python was very adamant on is if you've noticed it so far is there's no licenses

[01:36:52] there's no license game everything is original yeah he did not want to do any license games

[01:36:57] period only original you want to create a control but they knew there would be one exception

[01:37:03] there would be one thing he would not be able to turn down and that was the chance to draw

[01:37:07] bugs bunny and the loony to his characters yeah and he could not turn it down so he went

[01:37:12] against his normal policy of you know no license games and he did bugs bunny which he said

[01:37:18] which he said was I mean the artwork is the artwork is the highlight of the game

[01:37:23] uh and if you look at it python said like they would give you style sheets on how you're

[01:37:27] supposed to draw the character but he said it was a pain because you had to send it off

[01:37:31] approval and if you had just one little thing wrong with an eye or or something you'd have to

[01:37:37] redo it yeah but that was the one way they got him to do a license theme they cave in one he could

[01:37:42] not turn down because as an artist he just could not turn down the opportunity to draw bugs bunny

[01:37:48] I've never played it but I hear people just hate it uh it has a weird uh

[01:37:54] john chardot trying something thing on the left with the flipper and the ball comes the other way

[01:37:58] and yeah just leave it at that yeah just leave it at that another high point I would say the

[01:38:05] the birth of sort of a pinball series right of of another machine with a similar theme that is

[01:38:12] part of the same sort of pinball universe and that's the machine bride of pinball technically the

[01:38:17] birth of the series would be pinballed itself but yes he called this his dream sequel oh yeah he

[01:38:23] was so excited to do this one and he put a lot a lot of himself into this machine I I prefer pinbott

[01:38:33] you bring her to life yeah I can hear him in my head I just heard him say this so many times yeah

[01:38:40] so the idea is that you have pinbott in the first game you built pinbott and now he lives and he

[01:38:46] sees and he goes around the universe getting into taxis and taxis and and and that's what he does

[01:38:52] well you know he's lonely and he needs a lady friend and what you do is you get to build pinbottes

[01:38:58] lady friend the person who is known as the bride of pinbott the machine and things get weird you make

[01:39:05] her see maker um you know I can speak make her talk and she can become a living woman with probably

[01:39:11] one of coolest sound light shows ever when you do the metamorphosis where she becomes human

[01:39:17] the whole game stops in her heart beats it is it is it is it's a moment it is yeah what is probably one

[01:39:24] of the best pinball moments I can think of that they have this ever been done Python would say I wanted

[01:39:29] the bride to morph into a living woman and this was accomplished by using three faces that made a robot

[01:39:36] see speak and think I could make the perfect woman and that was done with what he called lady

[01:39:43] parchenko so yes you in the middle of the play field while the top middle of the play field there's

[01:39:50] like a face and it's of a woman and her mouth right and you shoot up the left ramp and the ball will

[01:39:59] divert into there and it will plop into her mouth and then the face will rotate right and then

[01:40:06] you could put balls into her eyes and you shoot the two balls up the left ramp it goes up diverts

[01:40:13] one into one I one into the other and then it turns again and she's a human it's it's out there man

[01:40:24] it's out there and it's got this weird sort of robotic sex appeal thing right the the back glass

[01:40:34] the bonus is her leg and she's wearing these like high heel shoes and she's got that stereo type 32

[01:40:47] 28 32 kind of hips waist chest thing the visuals of the face are very like soft and

[01:40:57] really symmetrical like he's like I'm going to make the sexiest robot anybody has ever seen and put it

[01:41:07] on the back glass it's being built by like little little little trucks they're like building pieces of

[01:41:15] her of her of her leg you know what an odd odd concept now there's another champagne on its

[01:41:27] translate as well champagne glass so that's again another weird signature of python was adding these

[01:41:36] little bits and pieces it's on the bottom left side yeah it's quite large right behind her hand

[01:41:42] yeah she's supposed to be drinking it it's her champagne glass yeah I don't really like the game

[01:41:48] that much I find that the shots are are way too close up the play field I find them really tight

[01:41:54] I find it specifically tight getting up that sort of rocket ramp into the into the locks you know

[01:42:00] what I find I find that the birthdays of people and family members associated with making of the

[01:42:04] game show up on the display when the game is slam tilted or power cycled these birthday show up

[01:42:09] only on the actual birthday the only way to make these appear is the slam tilt the game or

[01:42:14] enter and then exit test mode and if you are in new years or Christmas or on bill foot and

[01:42:21] routers birthday and you slam tilt on that day up on the screen happy birthday will appear or

[01:42:28] Merry Christmas or happy new year how weird is that a there's a there's a flipper code you put in

[01:42:33] in the beginning and then you do certain things on the game and you can play old McDonald all

[01:42:39] McDonald had a farm and the machine will reply back EI EO it's it's it's either they had too much

[01:42:46] time on their hands or they were working really really late to kind of amuse themselves one of my

[01:42:50] memories of bright a pin bot is one of the expos after the uh banquet is probably one in the

[01:42:57] morning and that in those have been an expo it doesn't close like the game room stays open

[01:43:02] into the next day so it's like one in the morning and python is playing bright a pin bot with a

[01:43:08] what's your other uh collectors then he is someone inebriated and every time he hits the ramp and

[01:43:15] like locks up always doing a dance and it was very entertaining what a guy a what a riot the follow-up

[01:43:22] to that is hurricane which is an another amusement park game it's the trilogy the third of the trilogy

[01:43:30] this is the era where all of a sudden there is a series of games you know there's a sequel there's

[01:43:36] a follow-up you know there's a trilogy and this is really uh the last one and I would say probably

[01:43:45] probably the low point of the amusement series would you say out of the three it'd be the one I

[01:43:50] liked the least not a bad game but you know huh it's all right again with this thing there's a

[01:43:57] picture of a cow accompanied by a moo and a picture of a huge eye on the play field what is with

[01:44:05] cows as a running joke in pinball the cows is because of the what miss miscellaneous cow that

[01:44:12] tipped over the whatever the lantern that caused the great Chicago fire that's where the cow

[01:44:18] comes from that's why there's so many cows but in this era of Williams Brian Eddie of

[01:44:25] tack for Mars medieval madness I guess stranger things fame he was really into cows you have cows

[01:44:32] stuff like all over his house so originally he started Williams is a programmer so he started

[01:44:37] putting cows in every game he worked in and all the other programmers followed suit and it became

[01:44:42] their thing so every game had a cow in it somewhere dad at East they had a thing where they thought

[01:44:46] they were making fun of Joe Kamikau oh I see yeah yeah cuz yeah but it had nothing to do with that

[01:44:53] and it's so funny like if you play no fear and you get a high score and you put moo in as a high

[01:44:58] score or as the initials the skull will move I've always wondered what is with the cows and now I

[01:45:08] know Chicago it's I think Miss Liri or O'Leary or whatever that that was the whole thing

[01:45:14] of how the great Chicago fire started her cow tipped over a lantern and knocked a lantern and

[01:45:20] into hay and it started the fire and yeah because it's on even before Brian Eddie started it

[01:45:25] Williams they did they had a cow in they had a cow in fire the game fire obviously because you have

[01:45:31] of course we start the game I think it doesn't move because it's the cow he started the fire that's

[01:45:37] great that makes me smile I love cows yeah I actually like cows cows are right and I think of

[01:45:43] Williams now every time I see cows it's like oh it's weaves her cane's okay but what Python would

[01:45:48] say is that he that his primary goal was to create feelings and soul he wanted to make humans feel

[01:45:56] and to tell a story with a beginning and an end and he wanted to take them on a roller coaster ride

[01:46:03] just like an amusement park which is I guess why amusement parks constantly pop up in Python's work

[01:46:11] very neat let's move on to I would say a very popular very exciting game in which I hate

[01:46:18] we're wrong but that's okay so while working on bride the machine bride of pin bod he went fishing

[01:46:25] with Mark Richie and over of course a few beers and fish tails was born and that night Python

[01:46:33] went home and he designed a storyboard for fish tails we have in my hometown I live in a very

[01:46:41] small hometown in New Brunswick we only have two machines on location one of those machines

[01:46:49] is fish tails it's in a laundromat it's not level which drives me insane and the theme is weird it's

[01:47:00] like fishing it's got this southern country music soundtrack oh yeah which just gets stuck

[01:47:10] in your brain and you can't get it out it drives me crazy this game I was liked it one of my

[01:47:18] favorite video modes ever is knocking people off of jet skis yeah you hit them and they'll just

[01:47:24] scream so the idea behind this game is that you're a fisherman you are out on the lake you're you're

[01:47:34] going after a fish in these big monster fish these tropical fish in your lake you you can shoot

[01:47:41] the ball into the tackle shop which kind of is an up kicker that kicks it into like a like a real

[01:47:48] like a fishing reel which then launches the ball during multi ball kind of up a ramp and around

[01:47:54] into the flippers the catapult surprise mark richie trade mark king of the catapults it's got a taxi

[01:48:02] ask sort of flowy center right left ramp so ball comes down you shoot it up the left side of what

[01:48:09] looks like a like a boat and it kind of goes up and then it comes down to your left flipper then you

[01:48:14] shoot the left flipper up the right side of the boat which flips around and goes to your right

[01:48:19] flipper do I get that right yeah sounds right it's crisscrossing so crisscrosses up and down and you

[01:48:24] build up a value into a monster fish and has a captive ball in the middle like it's it's a cool

[01:48:29] game but it just it's just it's an earworm it's it's weird and it has a friggin fish on the top

[01:48:37] that's great fish topper the fish topper so what playthoughts is about the fish topper you

[01:48:42] wanted the topper to move and talk and be a character in the game but Williams cut the idea

[01:48:47] he said the money man didn't want to do that because of the talking fish that was popular at the

[01:48:51] time I do remember that they had those they're talking fish right it was like a bass you put on your

[01:48:56] wall with batteries it would sing songs and move its mouth well that's what python wanted he wanted

[01:49:00] it to be a character to antagonize you and to bother you and to mock you but I guess you know

[01:49:06] Williams was like that's too expensive and he didn't like that so what are your favorite parts

[01:49:11] about fish tales that's goofy so automatically gets that tongue in cheek kind of it's just two

[01:49:16] different strategies you can either do the monster fish to try to score points or actually go for

[01:49:21] the multi ball and try to get the super jackpot which is where you get the scores and the billions

[01:49:26] it's it's a cool game right you know like I said one of my favorite video modes

[01:49:31] denna denna denna they just come across the screen and I just love hitting the jet skier

[01:49:35] and hearing them scream yeah yeah because you're on the you're on the lake yeah and there's these

[01:49:40] jet skiers and there's other things you shoot but the jet skier is the only guy makes any noise

[01:49:46] hilarious yeah it's got a fishing rod like is the shooter just the little little little integrations

[01:49:51] and things like that I mean the ramps are it's a boat ramp I mean it's a boat it makes perfect sense

[01:49:57] there's a real 1991 rolls around right and that's when Steve Richie kind of makes the the gun

[01:50:03] handle from t2 and and now this is kind of an evolution of that they started just using yet guns

[01:50:10] and reels and pretty much anything anything other than a plunger anything other than a plunger is

[01:50:15] now game what are lightning flippers their flippers that are an eighth of an inch shorter than

[01:50:19] standard that's probably another reason I hate this game standard flippers are three inches and they

[01:50:25] would typically use the the lightning flippers the eighth and eighth and then shorter and they would

[01:50:30] use them on games due to their biggest distributor and they sold a ton of games to Europe especially

[01:50:36] Germany I can't remember the name of the company but they were like one of their bigger the biggest

[01:50:40] buyers they had and they wanted to games to play harder DOS all so that's why you got those

[01:50:45] lightning flippers on games like that you got them on Dracula had them but almost all those games

[01:50:52] were designed originally with three inch flippers and then they went to the lightning flippers when

[01:50:57] they went to production I'm like I said I'm not a good player right so if if I bought a fish

[01:51:02] tails and I switched it out to regular flippers am I cheating yes so I am as a tournament player I

[01:51:09] would say yes but as if it's your game do you want you you can go with the knowing that that's

[01:51:15] what Mark Richie intended that makes me feel nice because because it was designed with three

[01:51:19] inch flippers yeah you can see the original concept art on ipdb as well and I've seen this in the

[01:51:25] pinball compendium book and I've seen it in a few other places of pythons original designs and I

[01:51:30] think one of the coolest features of this game is that bottom third of the playfield the where the

[01:51:36] slings are the flippers the flippers are like the bottom jaw of the fish and that is you know a theme

[01:51:44] that carried over even into the real the production the final the final production product because

[01:51:51] pythons original playfield was quite a bit different he had a reel but it wasn't as far left

[01:51:55] and he had a boat but it was way in the back left and it didn't have any of the criss-crossing ramps

[01:52:00] or anything yeah it's it's I would say that that again the storyboard the concept comes together the

[01:52:07] collaborative sort of juices flow with a mark richie whose whose designs are always one where there's

[01:52:13] some sort of criss cross there's sort of a quick back to the flipper flow sort of like his brother

[01:52:19] as well I thought it was you know it's a cool game it just it just I don't know what it is I want to

[01:52:25] like it I want to play it's not good enough at it I think that's probably it's probably it um

[01:52:31] you know I just need to play better yeah play better and you'll like it and the other thing is I

[01:52:36] think I think python just did the concept the original concept I don't think he was involved with

[01:52:40] the actual production game at all like none of the art is his one of my favorites on the side of the

[01:52:46] boat it says I am a dv8 meaning I am a dv8 nice like there's a lot of like weird little easter eggs on

[01:52:54] there and you have a ton of notes on this game that you hate I know I think you really like it

[01:52:59] I think secretly I maybe I do I don't know if I could just change the song the song just get

[01:53:06] in my head we get to the end of his Williams era so one would assume that python had some sort of

[01:53:15] blow up and then he had to leave Williams well the blow up the blow up was going to be this game

[01:53:22] called pinball circus pinball circus this was this was python angelo's vision this was how he was

[01:53:30] going to revolutionize pinball pinball circus was going to be like Steve Cortex flippers right

[01:53:39] this was going to change everything and it changed everything so that we don't know pinball today

[01:53:44] like we did back then right yeah I don't get I don't get pinball circus I mean I understand what

[01:53:53] is going on but I don't I don't get it now have you ever played it to fully understand this people

[01:53:58] have to first Google it and bring it up on IPDB or bring it up on some sources and just and just

[01:54:04] take a look at it and you can sort of see it and try to kind of get it that's your first step the

[01:54:10] next step is to somehow play one which is almost impossible and then sort of be able to draw the

[01:54:16] conclusion as to what was going on there so the idea right is it's three dimensional pinball so

[01:54:25] it's not just a play field that's forward and backward and some ramps it's like forward backward

[01:54:31] and then an upper play field and then and then another upper play field and another one it's it's

[01:54:37] pinball in a video game cabinet yeah a very large video game cabinet thing is huge you've seen

[01:54:43] this right you've played one I played one there's only two and there's only private collector in

[01:54:47] Europe has one the other one in your notes here or wrong it was actually a Steve Cortex private

[01:54:52] collection Steve Cortex had the other one it actually says that on IPDB it said Steve Cortex

[01:54:57] oh that's right her too it was Steve Cortex and he he granted it I don't think he I don't think

[01:55:03] they even bought it I think he donated it to the Vegas pinball Hall of Fame where it currently resides

[01:55:09] which is well close right now because of the pandemic but when it's open that's always one of their

[01:55:14] main attractions is the pinball circus game and I played it and it is very unique I'll say that

[01:55:20] what Ken Fidesna would say is this game was a brainstorm of Python Angelo he had this idea for

[01:55:27] a pinball game that had play fields and ramps mounted in three dimensions it was designed to fit a

[01:55:33] video style cabinet the game tested okay but it would have been extremely expensive to build the

[01:55:39] earning that that game brought in would never have justified the price Williams would have to sell it

[01:55:45] so the game never went into production Python says pinball circus was my greatest dream because the

[01:55:50] hardest I worked in fought for a pinball game never to get to market it at five play fields four

[01:55:56] horizontal and one vertical a mechanical elephant in a giraffe that took the ball from one play field

[01:56:02] to another the ringmaster was half sculpture and half for matrix display why did Python say that

[01:56:07] this didn't happen because of business because of business the money men the money men no it didn't

[01:56:13] happen because if you play the game it means very unique and it's fun it's fun to play to try to

[01:56:19] get it to the top you try to get the ball from the bottom all the way to the top into the clown's

[01:56:23] mouth and then you win yeah more clowns so you win but once you do that that's it there's no you

[01:56:31] just do it again that's the problem with it it's like it's it's cool until you accomplish it and

[01:56:36] then there's really no reason to play it anymore I've seen video of me in my video my video

[01:56:42] I had one of the first videos of it when they had it x-ball the one here um but I mean that's

[01:56:47] kind of the issue once you do the thing it's you just do the thing again and and it was very I

[01:56:53] mean it's very complex all the multiple play fields all the max in that game I could see that thing

[01:56:58] being just horribly expensive to produce that thing and heavy can you imagine well it's very heavy

[01:57:03] because it's it's in an arcade cabinet but think more like like one of the cabins they would use

[01:57:07] for a multiplayer game not maybe not that wide but it's taller and it's just it's huge yeah I

[01:57:13] mean like video game cabinets have a monitor and a PCB board and that's kind of it this thing has

[01:57:19] the boards sort of the the mechanics the metal ramps the the dot matrix displays like it's kind

[01:57:27] of be brutal and top heavy yeah he real like this was the the straw that broke the camels back

[01:57:35] for him and Williams I would say I haven't been able to find a whole lot like all I can kind of

[01:57:39] find in this era was that is is really from him where he says people didn't see his vision and you

[01:57:46] know they were worried about money and profits and not about revolution and not about yeah recreating

[01:57:53] everything and this was gonna change at all they're very very Python quotes there right so that's

[01:57:57] what his thing was but I mean really you know if you can't make any money around this time what

[01:58:03] happened is Capcom decides they're gonna get in a pinball and as part of that a lot of a lot of

[01:58:08] Williams employees start defecting to Capcom I always wondered if they were offering more money or

[01:58:13] or what the whole pitch was for that but a lot of the Williams employees left including Mr.

[01:58:17] Mr. Fudsen router yeah Python Granger Chris Granger so they all went to Capcom and Mark Richie would

[01:58:23] come over he came over and then Williams sued to prevent him from designing anything are they

[01:58:28] also put the brakes on Python being able to do something like pinball circus because they kind of

[01:58:33] own the intellectual property to that sort of design style of games so they put the brakes on that

[01:58:38] and Python would obviously get upset about that because caused a bunch of issues so right out of the

[01:58:44] gate Capcom is is stumbling and having issues I don't want to get into that today we're already

[01:58:49] running a fairly long podcast today we'll talk about Capcom some other time Python was say that he

[01:58:54] didn't go to Capcom for a pay increase he went over there for creative freedom and then he started

[01:59:00] to make some major mistakes Python was no longer just a creative force where somebody else took care

[01:59:09] of all of the day to day business all the sudden Python Angelo Mark Richie were running a team

[01:59:17] and more or less running a company or a division of a company which was not what Python did before

[01:59:22] before Python did art he drank beer he went hunting he came up with ideas he worked with other

[01:59:28] people to implement those ideas he had amazing engineers to design the mechanics to go along with

[01:59:35] those major ideas he wasn't running staff meetings he was just in a staff meeting right he wasn't

[01:59:42] doing the TPS reports somebody else was doing the TPS reports this is where the major issues started

[01:59:48] so Chris Granger would say Python Angelo had a lot more say about what was going on at Capcom

[01:59:53] than he ever did at Williams good and bad it was pretty chaotic there was a lot of drinking there was

[01:59:59] a lot of throwing the party before the product was built that was the problem management didn't want

[02:00:03] to hear about crazy or crazy or ideas from Python he felt the same old pin to make sure they make

[02:00:09] money approach was a disease that infested the whole industry he felt the proof was seen when all

[02:00:15] the pinball companies closed yeah it's Python was nuts we've talked about that and he didn't want

[02:00:24] to manage around a budget he didn't want to manage around anything he wanted he wanted to just

[02:00:29] create but you have to balance sales manufacturing you know balance sheets with creativity and that's

[02:00:38] the struggle this industry has always had people don't want to be told to take a mac out of a game

[02:00:44] because you can't make enough money and it might only be a hundred dollars a game but a hundred

[02:00:50] dollars a game over 40 games this was a problem that Steve Kirk would have as well they would talk

[02:00:55] about the creative crisis that was in the industry everything was managed around a budget and that's

[02:01:02] you know that's the reality of the beast yep Python says everyone talked about profits smaller

[02:01:08] bills and material small inventories and maximizing profits no one wanted cared or dared to genuinely

[02:01:15] just talk plan and work to create a great pinball yes we had a few tries to capcom after all we had

[02:01:21] foot mark richie Chris grander and others but we didn't have joe joe's can for business courageous

[02:01:26] crazy calls or Roger Sharp's pinball wizardry and honesty yeah Python didn't flourish in that space

[02:01:32] he was given too much business and he couldn't spend time being creative we had meetings

[02:01:39] business plans schedules and budgets and while this was going on great pinball games were being lost

[02:01:45] on unused bar napkins and fishing boats so there's a callback that he has that the greatest creative

[02:01:54] ideas are the ones that come up on bar napkins you know are are the ones that you come up with on

[02:02:00] fishing boats like fish tails that is when things bubble to the top that creativity comes but if

[02:02:07] you're spending all your time doing business planning and schedules you're not able to do that

[02:02:13] capcom would close in December of 1996 Python might might have had a direct influence on that

[02:02:21] closing but it may it may involve a game called zingy bingy yeah and I got some great quotes on zingy

[02:02:29] if you want to google it go ahead but make sure you know make sure you're not on the bus

[02:02:34] your children are not around and stuff like that I have never played zingy bingy so yes there's

[02:02:39] something I have not played there you go after capcom he he he more or less sort of retired from

[02:02:48] quote unquote retired from pinball and working with pinball companies that's probably because

[02:02:54] it's very difficult to go anywhere when all of the bridges that you have are burned right

[02:03:01] there's a huge gap in our coverage today really from the closing of capcom to today because I

[02:03:07] couldn't really find much of what he was doing at the time um you know he's working at a

[02:03:14] couple of video game companies he's doing some some art here there he's he's going to expo and

[02:03:19] selling stuff there but he's not he's not greatly and deeply involved in pinball um he would always

[02:03:25] give like a vague I'm working on ways to change pinball because he still he still wanted it to be 1988

[02:03:32] right he still wanted it to be the mid 90s where his creativity exploded and that was gone he spent

[02:03:39] all that time trying to get in his time machine and go back I think he didn't really talk about what

[02:03:43] he was doing it was more vague in 2012 python began his fight with cancer and he still made out to

[02:03:51] all of the pinball expos that he could for example he attended the pinball expo in the fall where he

[02:03:57] shared a bunch of humorous stories of his cancer treatments and even entered the room as Hannibal

[02:04:02] Lecter oh yeah that was there yeah so I've included this expo uh video in our show notes if you

[02:04:09] want to go back and and talk about it and one thing that I find particularly interesting is that

[02:04:16] even through a difficult cancer treatment and consistent I'm sorry constant cancer treatments

[02:04:23] python still has this humorous you know story teller creative engagement with the crowd right

[02:04:30] like he's going through a really difficult time but you know what he's still having at least

[02:04:34] presenting the fact that he's having fun there's a video in 2012 which I've included in our show notes

[02:04:40] called pythons world and this more or less focuses on python as an artist it talks about some of

[02:04:47] his pinball machine work but it mostly focuses on his his artist background and it was shot by I believe

[02:04:53] his nephew right out of the gate in this video he's in what looks to be like his house which is in

[02:05:00] like rural Michigan oh it's it's rural he would he would have the outdoorsman outfit and he wore

[02:05:08] that to expo one year like where he just didn't bother changing he just drove straight from his place

[02:05:13] there and showed up and had the whole get up on it was awesome he's got like a crazy hat with a

[02:05:18] huge feather he's got a lamb he literally has a lamb hanging in his kitchen without skin on it

[02:05:25] and he's making a lamb soup and there's a lamb's head in a friggin pot and they're just shooting it

[02:05:31] like and he's talking about you know creativity and growing up when he was younger and this is how

[02:05:36] his family you know made food and you know I'm you know I can break down a chicken I do that

[02:05:42] fairly regularly I'll buy a chicken I'll cut out the chicken breasts I'll cut out the legs and

[02:05:47] the thighs and the whole thing skinning a lamb and having it just hanging in my kitchen it's not

[02:05:53] really my thing okay throughout his cancer treatments python would continue to draw and do his

[02:05:58] work and he would continue to go to expo pythons health would continue to decline through 2013 and

[02:06:06] he found it very difficult to sell his works in a 10 conferences so a friend started to go fund

[02:06:12] me in 2014 to help with his medical expenses the total raised by the pinball community so as a

[02:06:18] community all of us pinball folks you know really stood up and they raised $18,600 to help python

[02:06:26] so the other thing about that go fund me in the last years of his life he became friends with

[02:06:31] um these knees Paul Kiefert I'm probably saying it wrong and James Loughlin who used to

[02:06:38] James Loughlin was for years the ramp guy if you wanted a ramp like I want some I need this ramp

[02:06:44] for my Adam's family or I need this that's where you get new ramps from his company I think they

[02:06:49] were called pinball ink back in the day okay um the both of them they they became good friends with

[02:06:55] python and and when python would come to the shows that's who he would come with he would be over

[02:07:00] and they're both like signing autographs or or selling his artwork so and they and they and after

[02:07:08] python die they try to or still trying to get the pinball circus made I think they they're calling

[02:07:15] like pythons circus or pythons pinball circus or something like that now okay but they're also

[02:07:20] working on getting the capcom kingpin made it was uh in March 9th 2014 that python head passed

[02:07:27] away with brain cancer I've included a link in our show notes to um the go fund me page because

[02:07:33] there's some you know there's a video in there from python a few other things a bit you know

[02:07:36] it's depressing um but it's part of you know pinball history and I mean it's really difficult

[02:07:43] to sort of square this circle right you've got python at the beginning he comes into pinball

[02:07:49] he changes things he's adding sculptures he's creating storyboards you're engaged in pinball he's

[02:07:56] he did change pinball you know but in that time he also you know burned a lot of bridges and said a

[02:08:02] lot of mean things and and then at the end of his story you know he's going through this difficult

[02:08:10] time and and people stepping up and and that I think that's one of the cool things about our community

[02:08:15] is that we're a mix of social classes of of of different jobs of different personalities you know

[02:08:21] some of them rubbing against each other negatively one way or another but but for some reason we

[02:08:25] all still come together and rise and try to help those around us even though you know python was a

[02:08:31] difficult difficult individual from some who work with him yes you could say that yeah and

[02:08:36] others would say that he was the nicest caring person they were in yeah well as far as the pinball

[02:08:40] community everyone loved him you got to remember that thing is there's there's people within pinball

[02:08:46] who don't necessarily like the attention or being you know recognized or things like that they

[02:08:53] may show up when they have a new game out and then disappear then there are other people like say

[02:08:59] see for a cheat or python who 100% you can tell they enjoy the attention yeah it's awesome it

[02:09:05] adds for it adds for entertaining podcasts on the pinball network and you could tell python was

[02:09:10] very comfortable in that environment partying with the fellow pinheads to the wee hours of the night

[02:09:18] there you go Paul Keyford or hope I'm saying his name right I'm sorry if I'm not Paul

[02:09:23] Paul formerly of pins and vids with that outwarner they did a bunch of videos back in the day

[02:09:29] Paul says he was the organizer of the GoFundMe he says over the past couple years I've been

[02:09:33] fortunate enough to know the man behind the legend and become part of a team that was able to

[02:09:37] give him great joy in his last months I could say with a hundred percent certainty and with the

[02:09:41] help of this great pinball community we were able to deliver a great joy and happiness during his

[02:09:45] final time on this earth and that the legend most people knew will continue to be honored for

[02:09:50] generations to come the bottom of my heart I thank you for being a part of delivering this happiness

[02:09:54] to python I've only begun to learn about python and sort of what he has done and what he's done

[02:10:02] for the for pinball in general and and I could say that that Paul is right that there is a legacy

[02:10:08] that he's leaving behind and hopefully a podcast like today you know bringing up some of the

[02:10:14] interesting tidbits and quotes and hidden things in backlasses and and that kind of stuff continues

[02:10:20] to sort of build on that legend but we also need to back that up with the form that that he was a

[02:10:25] difficult individual you know he did burn bridges and toss bombs and and and and and fight above and

[02:10:32] beyond where most people did before it and you know you got to you got to present a realistic

[02:10:37] background of that let's end on a quote that I pulled from Chris Granner that I I think really

[02:10:44] sums up python yeah Chris Granner says python did for pinball with someone had to do he said we're

[02:10:50] making a pinball come to life that's amazing gift to pinball it was big and we shouldn't forget

[02:10:56] that whatever wild stories people can tell about python that's the most important one that brings us

[02:11:01] to the end of our podcast this month Ron you know what do you think what is there anything else that

[02:11:06] we missed here that you wanted to bring up is there any other comments or things that you think

[02:11:10] that that people will bring up in in inevitably their their angry correction emails to silver ball

[02:11:16] chronicles that you know don't sure there always be corrections probably on certain name pronunciations

[02:11:21] but what I would say is just go out there and we'll put the sources of a lot of this material

[02:11:29] listen to the top cast episode listen to his expo seminars they're the best the best thing you

[02:11:35] can listen to to figure out what he was all about and get the full experience of python when you

[02:11:40] see his games you know walk up and take a look at them right like walk up to a taxi stand over

[02:11:47] a taxi or a comment take a look at some of the finer details and then you know stand next to a

[02:11:53] game that was made by a different designer and a different art team and take a look at that one

[02:11:58] and you can see the contrast in that but then shortly after that if you're looking into like the

[02:12:05] late eighties early nineties you can see that his influences started moving into other designers

[02:12:13] and other artists so you know imitation is the highest form of flattery and you can see that he

[02:12:18] did actually change the way things went and worked and a python was here he'd be happy to tell you

[02:12:22] that he did that and he was the main reason run next month we are going to leave it up to the

[02:12:30] listeners of silver ball chronicles to pick a topic so what we're going to do is we're going to

[02:12:37] put a poll up multiple choice thank god that was that was good because you don't want to just let

[02:12:42] them freeform a topic because who knows what you're end up talking about could be something you

[02:12:46] don't want to talk about so some of the topics that we can we can pull from how about stepping on

[02:12:54] rakes the god leaves system ones wow we can do our episode two of Steve Richie called Steve Richie

[02:13:02] the mullet ears that's a follow up on our first episode well yeah he had that thing where you
