[00:25] I work here, get started at Vanta.com.

[00:33] The pinball network is online, launching silver ball chronicles.

[00:43] Oh, happy treason day. Treason day. Isn't that what you're celebrating today is treason day?

[00:49] Oh god. You're so funny.

[01:19] Hello, I'm David Dennis, and this is silver ball chronicles. And with me is Ron.

[01:28] Where did that go? Hallet. What's up, fella? I don't know what you just said.

[01:34] I don't know what you mean. It's from that, it's from the looney tunes.

[01:37] I mean, watch white. That ain't go. George, watch white. That ain't go. That's the one. Okay.

[01:43] I don't know. Well, I thought I thought I was being witty. We were just talking about that a moment

[01:47] ago. Well, does anyone know what that's actually based on? It's like one of those old actors,

[01:52] right? No, no. No. It's a of my son men, the book there. George and Lenny. They're basically doing

[02:00] it. They were doing that, which would probably be considered really inappropriate now. But then

[02:04] everyone else started doing that same line. I thought it was like a Laurel and Hardy kind of thing.

[02:09] Watch white. That ain't go. George, watch white. That ain't go. Good one. Good one. What have you been doing,

[02:13] fellow? What have you been up to? Not much. Not much. What's happened in the Rochester pinball

[02:21] collective? Aren't you cleaning up there on the tournament scene? Yeah. We had stump there.

[02:28] Big deal. You guys got a championship belt and everything. Our biannual tournament. That's the

[02:32] West version, the Western version. That's right. On the Western part of upstate New York. Yes.

[02:38] And now we have the nationals and pinmasters going to be there. Oh my goodness.

[02:44] That's a big deal. What's that? 25, 2025? We made the big time. Yes, 2025, somewhere in March, I think.

[02:51] Or because you won't be playing in it, right? No, I'm going to play in pinmasters and

[02:55] embarrass myself. I don't want to be great. Are you going to wear a green jacket just the whole time?

[03:00] I know. I should buy a green sweater. Yeah. You should just you should look exactly like a golfer.

[03:05] Well, I mean, there hasn't really been too much exciting here in the hobby besides the

[03:09] announcement of John Wick. But I think we're getting into those summer months, those dog days of summer,

[03:15] pinball summer where everybody kind of checks out a little bit. But there's all this talk about

[03:21] a couple of pins that are coming up and that is not news that anybody else doesn't know,

[03:25] but I think we'll be pretty excited to see them. I know inside knowledge, but from all the

[03:30] chatter on the other podcasts, like the slam tilt podcast. That's my other podcast.

[03:35] With Bruce Knight and Gail, you guys are talking about all the new rumors and the dirt, which one

[03:40] day I'm sure will be in a silver ball Chronicles episode. Once it becomes history. Yeah, that or one of

[03:47] you gets like goes crazy or ends up in jail. Oh, no, that'll say that for the deeper episode.

[03:54] But you should be excited. They stern renewed the rush license. Oh, no way. That's actually that's

[04:02] news that I've just heard right now breaking news. You did not know that. Yes, supposedly going to be

[04:08] another another run of rush, maybe just a one off, but supposedly going to happen. Wow. So cool.

[04:15] So Canadian. You should be. I mean, that should be a new holiday, right? It is actually Canada

[04:20] today was a couple of days ago before treason day. Oh, you mean the fourth of July in America? Yes.

[04:26] Yes. That's right. All I know is team America, Royal Police is being released in 4K. Very excited.

[04:32] That is cool. Although it's the theatrical cut, not the director's cut.

[04:38] But the director's cut is available in blue right now. So I'm good. Do you really need 4K for the

[04:44] puppets? I want to see all of the strings. I can see the strings better than I've ever seen them.

[04:50] Now, remember, we've added the show notes. We're on to silverballcronacles.com. So if you're not seeing

[04:56] the show notes in your pod catcher and you want to click on some of the articles or review some of

[05:01] the podcasts of which we are referencing in this episode, please feel free to check out silverballcronacles.com.

[05:08] We've sold out on Patreon. Everybody is very aware of that. We've had a few people pop in and

[05:13] pop out over the months. We've brought on a few people and a few people have stepped out the last

[05:18] couple of months. But we want to say thank you so much for giving us some of your hard earned

[05:21] dollars just to say thank you. That's at patreon.com slash silverballcronacles. It starts

[05:27] $3 a month with no big commitment. $6 a month gets you the private discord chat room where you can

[05:34] chat with us all the time. Sometimes we do votes and chat about the episodes. And of course,

[05:39] the big reason you want to go to $6 a month is add free access to silverballcronacles

[05:45] before the general feeds. You don't have to listen to my terrible commercials

[05:52] and you get it a little bit earlier. So you don't have to wait for the TPN team to put it up because

[05:57] it's quite frankly. I'm too lazy to do it myself. Yeah, and you can get ahead of it anytime you want

[06:03] and get out of it anytime you want either way. Our top tier are the elitist cronies. They get all the

[06:08] other perks plus after three months. They get a free silverballcronacles t-shirt. I want to say

[06:14] welcome to our two new patrons Albert and spherker from Sweden. When they bear our cronies.

[06:22] That's so oddly enough, I get this really weird email and it says,

[06:29] spherker has joined your patreon for 70 crona and I'm like, what the hell is a crona?

[06:36] And I get in there and I'm looking. It's a crona. Of course, it gets converted into Canadian

[06:42] Canadian loonies. But I thought that was pretty weird when I got that email. What the hell is that?

[06:48] I thought it was a song by the neck. That's bad. Very good.

[06:53] Silverballcronacles can be found on facebook.com slash silverballcronacles or at silverballcronacles.com.

[07:00] Send us an email. You can do that over at silverballcronacles.com. And silverball swag is where

[07:08] you can find our t-shirt store for the US. Anybody who's outside of the US give Dave an email.

[07:14] And I will see what I can swing together for our international folk. Well, the previous episode,

[07:22] Ron, one of our biggest ratings grabs of all time. Really? I did not know that.

[07:30] No, it's not. But it's not exactly the worst either. It turned out to be pretty pretty pretty.

[07:35] Pretty good. By Goliath's bingo, but that feedback was a little rough. So let's just go through

[07:40] some of the comments here and emails that we had received. Actually, we had some positive feedback

[07:46] as well. But it's funny just to bring up the negative feedback for comedic effect. But a

[07:52] Zach M says, uh, terrible. Yeah, that would be Zach. Many are a bus. Oh, I don't want to put last

[07:59] names. It's just Zach M. Oh, come on. He said it on his own show. Broke my heart. Yes, he broke our

[08:06] hearts. Doctor six on pin side says that this was easily the weakest pinballcronacles episode they've

[08:13] done by a considerable margin. Maybe the well is drying up. But yet there are still things and people

[08:20] I wish to hear about in this format, just a miss in another wise awesome series. I adore your

[08:26] podcast. So please don't take any offense to my criticism. Keep them coming. Well, don't you worry

[08:32] doctor six. Yes, this is please do another Steve Richie episode. No, actually he doesn't say

[08:37] everybody wants another. There's no, there's nothing like what lays nothing to do. We should just

[08:40] have one on just Elton John and how awesome it is. It's a great game. I think the next comment

[08:48] is also a good one from tuna delight. Tuna Delight. He says at least Bruce N which that would be my

[08:54] my co-host. I'm sorry, other host and my other podcast slam to podcast said at least Bruce wasn't

[09:01] in it annoyingly singing every time you were Ron mentioned a game. It may have been bingo talk

[09:06] but thanks for a non juvenile podcast. There you go. So if you want to listen to the juvenile

[09:12] podcast with all the things that make you giggle, you want to check out slam till podcast. But don't

[09:18] worry the saving glory is here. Corey has dropped us an email and it said I wanted to say that I

[09:25] thought this was a great episode. It's a history podcast covering an aspect of the hobby that was

[09:32] a fundamental piece in shaping the flipper era. It was interesting and informative like it or not

[09:39] pinball as we know it today has its roots in gambling and it's great to capture the history

[09:46] in audio form. Thanks for the content and looking forward to the next one.

[09:52] Thank you, Corey for that feedback. Tell you what? To be totally honest, I felt like Ron and I kind of

[09:59] kind of floated through the last episode. We didn't talk about a lot of specific machines with the

[10:04] art and the whole thing. We you know, it wasn't our forte. It wasn't exciting but it was something

[10:11] we had to cover. What do you think, Ron? I was excited. You were excited. Maybe I don't.

[10:16] I've actually played them before. I mean, I found it in. Yeah. Oh, wow. I did. But I used to

[10:23] I but I used a rotary phone. Well, so old. At least this episode, we will not be talking about gambling.

[10:30] No, and we won't be talking about old crappy technology like coils and yeah, coils are old. They're

[10:37] still in every game. Yeah. How about wire that's wrapped in like goats fur? I don't think they did

[10:46] that then they did. They did have cloth that was wrapped in. So maybe that's what you're talking about.

[10:52] Yeah. Whatever. Okay. Last month, we spoke about an entirely different kind of pinball with

[10:58] bingo machines. This month, we're going to do the same. Multi-morphic ink manufacturers, the P3

[11:05] pinball platform, a modern physical and digital multi-game pinball machine as well as pinball

[11:14] machine control systems such as the p-rock and the p3 rock. Since 2009, Jerry Stellenberg and his

[11:23] crack team of engineers and software developers have created the first off-the-shelf pinball control

[11:30] board for making your own home-brew pinball machines. That's called the p-rock. In fact,

[11:37] some major manufacturers would even begin using that system. In 2017, the P3 pinball platform,

[11:46] like pinball 2000 before it, began pushing the limits of what pinball had always been considered.

[11:53] Join us this month as we talk about multi-morphic is reshaping pinball.

[12:01] Couple of terms we used in there. First one was pinball controller. What's a pinball controller?

[12:08] Well, the old Williams system was WPC. Williams pinball controller. Very much like the brain of the

[12:14] of the system. Yeah, I just considered the boards in the head or in the body, depending on the

[12:20] manufacturer. Yeah, exactly. The control boards that make the solenoids move, the flippers flip,

[12:28] the lights blink, all of that stuff. Another word that I used in there that I don't think

[12:33] necessarily everybody in this hobby is aware of is a term called home-brew. What would a home-brew be?

[12:41] A home-brew would be like if I made my own game. Yeah, it's like brewing your own potion in

[12:47] home. I find that interesting. There's not a custom pinball or whatever, but home-brew is the term

[12:52] that the pinball community has started to use. I think that's really cool. So building your own pinball

[12:58] machines. Yes, several major shows. They'll have the home-brew section or home-brew row.

[13:04] That's always good at Pintastic. I always enjoy seeing that. And they're always like pushing the

[13:09] envelope of what, you know, what normal. When you go to a home-brew section, it's always like,

[13:14] look at this game with seven flippers and 1,300 drop targets. They're always weird and wacky and

[13:20] different, which I think is cool. So Jerry Stellenberg. Who's Jerry Stellenberg? Someone

[13:28] we hope we're saying his name right, being that this is going to be primarily about him.

[13:32] Yeah, so I'm really sorry if I'm saying that wrong, Jerry. But anyway, I wanted to start with

[13:37] who is Jerry? Well, he studied computer engineering in Virginia Tech and he minored in computer science.

[13:46] Jerry says, this was in the early days of computer engineering. It was essentially a mix of

[13:51] electrical engineering with a computer science minor. So he took all the electronics courses

[13:57] and they also had us taking programming and object-oriented classes. They introduce us to both sides.

[14:04] So as a non-computer person, what is he talking about? So electrical engineering is like the

[14:09] physical thing and computer science is like the computer programming stuff. Am I getting that right?

[14:15] That's what I would say. What is object-oriented classes? How is object-oriented programming or

[14:22] something? I don't remember what that is. Hold on. Let me look. Google will help me. According to

[14:27] Google, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which

[14:31] can contain data and code, data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Got that?

[14:38] Yep, absolutely. Jerry got his introduction into pinball in the mid-1990s while he was in college.

[14:45] The student center had pinball machines among the pool tables. Jerry and his friends would often

[14:51] dabble in their leisure time and he was primarily a pool player. Pool is a game of high skill.

[14:59] Jerry didn't want to lose any money and thought playing pinball was a waste of money because it was

[15:05] random. His friends would give him a free credit and he would play and he eventually learned that

[15:11] wait a second, this is a game of skill. And then he started learning and all of the methods involved

[15:18] in that machine started to attract him. It's the same thing for everybody, right? You kind of play

[15:24] it and you're like, oh, this is kind of fun. And then you're like, wait a second. If I do these

[15:29] things, it does this thing. Well, the games he was playing in the round 1996-97 were theater of

[15:35] magic, attack from Mars and the shadow. I see three pretty good ones to get started. Yeah, that's

[15:41] pretty good. That's pretty good. He didn't at least they weren't like the three games that he

[15:45] were playing were Waterworld hook and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles by Daddy East and Gilligan's Island

[15:51] and Street Fighter. Yeah, he'd be like, no, thanks. I'm good. Three different designers too. Yeah.

[15:58] Different different styles, different methods. Very cool. Very cool. Well, Jerry's collection

[16:03] eventually would grow after he left college from two machines to four, eight and then 11.

[16:09] As they always do, once you let him in your basement, they breed.

[16:14] Unless you're in Florida, then you don't have a basement. That's right. What would you have like a garage?

[16:19] Or just build up a separate pinball building. Yeah, that's cool. I wish I had one of those.

[16:24] Pin building. So where did multi-morphic come from? Well, Jerry says, I woke up and I realized that

[16:34] we work with all these multi-application devices in our lives. We have computers, we have cell phones

[16:40] or mobile phone platforms that are multi-app and I realized that every time I turned on my pinball

[16:45] machines, they were the same thing and that kind of bugged me. I wonder what else we could do to

[16:50] take these expensive hardware platforms, these expensive works of art, these expensive playfield layouts

[16:57] and kind of give them more life. Yeah. This is around like 2009. Jerry's looking at this thing

[17:03] and going like every time I turn it on, I'm like shooting the drop targets in the spinner and then

[17:08] shooting the drop targets in the spinner. But this is I think a very similar path of logical thinking

[17:16] that a lot of people do when it comes to pinball. You think about like re-thieving back like

[17:22] Harry Williams and all those guys where they would take a machine and like rehab it into something else.

[17:28] So Gary Stern after Stern pinball had Stern electronics had closed, he did what was at pinstar,

[17:35] right? Well, that was the company he had. He had kits so you could re-theme an older game with a

[17:42] brand new playfield and new software, supposedly for a cheaper price. That was the idea.

[17:49] You take the kind of the same thing, you mix it up a little bit. We had games where you could

[17:55] replace ROMs from time to time and that would change some of the rules or make the rules a little

[18:00] bit better than maybe the original rules that were there. And then you had pinball 2000.

[18:04] Pinball 2000, you swap the playfield in and out, change the art totally different games. So

[18:09] this is something that continues to be revisited over and over again, literally from Harry

[18:15] Williams to today, where somebody comes up and goes, hey, I'd like it to do more than just be the

[18:22] world's largest and most annoying Nintendo cartridge. When I get bored of it, I want it to be something

[18:28] else. Quite frankly, when you think about pinball in general, the last major innovation,

[18:36] except for the death of pinball 2000, was the creation and integration of the DMD, right?

[18:42] That was the biggest thing to take over. And that was really the last real thing.

[18:47] Innovation up to like 2009, yeah, because no Jersey Jack yet. So it took a long time.

[18:55] So Jerry's right on there, I think, when he says that there's room for something new.

[19:00] Yeah, and Jerry said to me, it was an interesting technical challenge to try to come up with a way

[19:05] to connect a computer to those machines so that I or anyone else could create a custom ruleset.

[19:11] That was kind of the beginnings of it. I just wanted to write my own software.

[19:14] So I mean, computer technology is much bigger by 2009 than it was in 1996. That's a big difference.

[19:22] Well, Jerry built a custom board that worked on both Williams and Stern machines. It's like a

[19:28] replacement controller board so that we control all of those things. Well, that CPU or

[19:34] computer board central processing unit central processing unit. Well, I usually call them MPUs.

[19:44] MPU. MPU. That's what you usually see if some like when you look at the boards. Well, it came to

[19:50] Jerry that the board alone is nothing. And then a pinball machine alone is nothing. He didn't want

[19:57] to replace the existing machine. He wanted to augment the existing machine. So he kept focusing on

[20:03] his games at home and trying to be able to manipulate them. He did his research online and he would

[20:09] eventually join some pinball community forums online. It became obvious that there were others

[20:15] just like him who were also interested in modifying their games or making their own custom games.

[20:22] So this is really the the creation of the home baroo scene around 2009 and 10. Well, Jerry says

[20:30] while the project kind of started as an idea to create a custom machine that might be able to run

[20:34] custom code it grew into this potential product. This potential board that other people could use to

[20:40] write custom code for their existing games as well. Yeah, we're snowballing here. Okay.

[20:46] Every there's a market out there. So they needed a solution. Are you interested in making your own

[20:51] game, Ron? Ah, I just want to see I just want to see a beat of some butthead game. I just I feel

[20:56] like you would probably be really good at designing a game because I feel like you have some

[21:03] fundamental knowledge of design and stuff that I think the average folk don't necessarily have.

[21:12] I would like to take Gilligan's Island and give it better rules. See, there you go. Because that

[21:16] has a killer Mac. And actually the theme I thought is decent, but it's just isn't a good game.

[21:23] Pergilligan's Island. Poor little buddy.

[21:27] Oh, wait a minute. I have to read more stuff now. You have to read more stuff, do we?

[21:32] I want to raise. Join us on Patreon to support the show. Our pro-crony level is the perfect way

[21:38] to say thanks and it starts at $3 a month. Want to get early access to episodes before everyone

[21:44] else who doesn't have a strange love for stickers? That's kind of weird. Do you know what discord is?

[21:50] I think I do. I'm not probably not. Interested in having your comments and questions to

[21:54] priority in our episodes? Jump on up to the $6 a month premium crony level. Really, you're going

[22:01] to kill it crony. Want all the other perks and a shirt after three months? Join us at $20 a month

[22:07] and you can be an elite-tissed crony? Oh my. Well, once you have a board, that's all well and good,

[22:15] but you have to program it. Usually you add a controller processor to the board to run the

[22:21] programming. However, Jerry didn't want to do that. He would add a USB slave, whatever the heck that

[22:28] is, which allowed you to hook up any type of computer to control the board. Now, with this time,

[22:35] Raspberry Pi or Windows computers were probably the most popular. They're two different things though.

[22:42] Yeah, it almost makes it sound like the Raspberry Pi Windows computer.

[22:47] The Raspberry Pi comma or Windows computer. Those were the type of ones you could use.

[22:54] So you've used a Raspberry Pi. So the Raspberry Pi was this pretty revolutionary little

[22:58] little computer thing. It just sort of came out. It was dirt cheap and you could do all these

[23:02] programming and stuff on it. You still can. It's still used all over the place.

[23:06] And it's being reiterated over and over and over again. So if you didn't want to hook up your

[23:11] laptop or run an actual computer, you could use these little computers about the size of a cell phone

[23:17] or smaller programming. Okay, here's where we get into some stuff that I have no idea. Actually,

[23:22] we're well deep into things. I don't understand Ron. So please help me out when you best you can.

[23:26] The programming beyond a basic level was not Jerry's expertise. That's when a fellow named

[23:34] Adam Prebel reached out and wondered if he could get a board for his own custom project.

[23:41] Adam is an accomplished programmer and after chatting with Jerry for a while, he wanted to help

[23:47] write some high level code structure for the board. Okay, Ron, you need you have a board and then

[23:54] you need programming to tell the board what to do. Is that right? That would be right. So you could

[24:00] have bored. You don't just plug it in. It needs like a language to speak to it. Correct.

[24:06] Okay. I'm not a programmer either. So I know, but you're nerdyer than I am.

[24:10] I wear glasses. Wow. This became what they called Lib Pin Rock, which was actually an open-source

[24:20] pinball controller project. Lib Pin P Rock. Lib Pin P Rock. That's right. This is very annoying

[24:30] and not very marketing savvy, but that's what it was called. Adam also made a Python-based software

[24:37] framework called Pi Rock Game, which stood, of course, for Python, our rock game.

[24:44] P Rock. P Rock. Not the best at naming things, but I get it. So Python, I do understand. That is a

[24:52] that is like a computer programming language where like this happens, then that happens,

[24:57] then this happens, and that happens, I think. That's what like a lot of like computer

[25:01] folk are using now as Python. So when I think people are writing code today in Python,

[25:06] this was like what, 10 years ago or something? 15 years ago at this point. These guys are pretty

[25:11] cutting edge. You know what I mean when it comes to tech, which I don't think people realize.

[25:17] Basically, I believe they're trying to make it back in programming. So whoever gets these

[25:23] boards, whoever actually creates these rules doesn't have to know how to code, or at least doesn't

[25:29] have to know to code in this at this level. Dumb people like me call it is a setup wizard.

[25:36] Pretty, but like I want to make that light flash. Well, at this level, you'd have to know every

[25:42] line of code to make that happen. They're trying to make it so you can just say, uh, make that flash

[25:48] and it flashes. So we're speeding up the programming process. We're lowering the barrier of entry.

[25:54] Now it's still pretty high, mind you, but it's not as high as it could be. You don't have to

[25:58] literally be somebody who went to friggin Virginia tech. So you could structure out some subset logic

[26:04] for the game. You can, for example, what? You change one word, it changes totally when it meets.

[26:11] What do you mean? You could structure a game in some sets of logic. For example, to control

[26:16] multi-ball or control all of your different modes. You can put those together in a priority-based

[26:20] system so that I can properly respond to switch events. So Jerry and Adam both had a judge

[26:27] dread in their collections. So Jerry put his board in to his judge dread and use some of Adam's

[26:35] code to get started. Jerry would add some ball trough management, uh, ball searches, and then six

[26:42] months later they had a judge dread with a custom feature rich software framework, which can add their

[26:50] own custom rules. Their first custom pinball machine. How cool is that? Cool.

[26:57] Huh? Good game to do it on too because it's got a killer play field of judge dread.

[27:02] They added us the ability to do stern machines on there. They added pin-mame capabilities and

[27:09] pin-mame is like, what do they call that? It's called pin-mame. But maim stands for, oh,

[27:15] multi, yeah, it's the, it's the stance for emulator. Multi-archade machine emulator? That might be it.

[27:22] And the pin denotes its for pinball. Yeah. They worked with visual pinball so they could take

[27:29] their programming from pie, p-rock game and add virtual pinball machines to it as well. All the time

[27:40] Jerry was actually working multiple full-time jobs. This wasn't a job. He wasn't making anyone. He

[27:46] was just having fun with the buds. So how did the pinball community react to this stunning

[27:56] release of technology? It was a slow rollout. Yeah. Yeah. Jerry made pinball controllers.com

[28:05] and he kind of started to trickle it out. And there wasn't like a whole lot of interest right

[28:09] away, but amongst some of the hard cores it was some interest. The only product at the time was

[28:15] what they would call p-rock board. And that was because pie, p-rock game and lib pin, p-rock drivers

[28:27] were all open source software solutions that you could download for free. And you would use

[28:33] that with your p-rock board. Well, the first real kind of use in beyond kind of just a few

[28:41] guys in their basements was bride of pinbott 2.0. You remember that, eh? I do. You got with the best

[28:50] games ever made. A bride of pinbott? Yeah. It's got the thing with the face. It's got the face and

[28:59] in the cool multi-ball intro sequence. I'll give it that. Yeah. Other than that terrible.

[29:03] But what does what this was made by Dutch pinball? So this was a conversion kit, right?

[29:10] Where you would take your pinbott and put in like a DMD. And it would change the programming.

[29:19] And this was the first kind of pinball upgrade kit. That's definitely one of the first ones I

[29:24] remember. I mean, everybody had custom things you could add to it. But I feel like this is the first

[29:29] kind of totally new 2.0 different rules, different the whole. This is like, and commercially available.

[29:37] Not just like something that somebody made and sold five of them. Although they probably

[29:40] only sold five of these. No, they sold more than that. Jerry says, I think the first thing that

[29:45] happened to kind of create more awareness of it was a couple of Dutch guys got to hold him in

[29:49] ordered one. Today, people know of them as Dutch pinball. They got a hold of a p-rock and a pie rock

[29:55] game and created a entire new rule set for bride of pinbott. Barry of Dutch pinball was a video guy.

[30:02] So he packaged all their work into almost a promotional video for their game. It was well

[30:07] produced. That was Barry, Barry Dryson, I think, was his name. Yep. It still is his name. And he's

[30:14] very, he's very flashy and salesy and he knows he knows what sells. And a fantastic promotional

[30:19] video is what they needed. Well, in 2010 at pinball expo, Jerry and Adam were asked to host a seminar

[30:27] about their p-rock board set and their custom pinball machine building projects. Jerry was

[30:33] hoping that this seminar would build even more awareness about the product and what it could do

[30:41] for pinball. So Jerry says we got up there and we started presenting this super technical thing

[30:48] called p-rock board. Adam was walking them through the pinball framework, the pie rock game framework

[30:56] and explaining how to write code. And you look out there and there's all these board sleepy faces.

[31:03] And then we said, well, check out this video that one of our customers is putting together.

[31:08] And we played the bride of pinbott 2.0 video and the entire room lit up. We were like, holy crap,

[31:16] that's awesome. So there you can go, right? So I had said that it's kind of the technical guys not

[31:22] great at the marketing. They got terrible names that have hyphens in them that don't make sense

[31:27] and aren't easy to say. But then they pull out this video made by a slick salesy guy and boom,

[31:33] everybody in the room immediately gets it. And as the popularity of p-rock grew, more people began

[31:41] using it for their custom machines. It became clear that there was a need for a new driver board

[31:49] as well. So in 2011, they designed a PDB or the p-rock driver boards. Do you remember when p-rock

[32:00] was coming on the scene? I mean, I remember 2.0. I remember the first actual multi-morphic

[32:07] like when the multi-morphic games came in. But you remember guys in homebrew being like, I got

[32:12] this, I've got this p-rock board. I'm putting it together. I know because I wasn't really into the

[32:17] the whole. It's not your jam. That's not yeah. I'm too busy in the tournament area. I'm sorry.

[32:22] Eating your eating your maple cookies and staring death daggers down at everybody up there

[32:28] playing pinball. Jerry said, since I had the p-rock board, which was the core piece that I needed to

[32:34] build a custom machine, what I wanted to build was a way to control coils. And I needed a way to

[32:39] control lights. The next thing I did was I designed those boards. Yeah. So now we're we're supplementing.

[32:46] Adding in a system right in in a back box, you got like the computer part that's doing all the

[32:52] thinking and logic. And then you have the other board next to it that has all these resistors and

[32:57] transistors and things like that that fire the actual things on the play field. Isn't that right?

[33:03] There is usually a CPU board, MPU board, or everyone to call it. Then there would be a driver board,

[33:08] which is the thing to actually fires all the coils. So the thing is right now what Jerry is talking

[33:13] about is they're taken out the original CPU board. They're putting in a new one, the the the

[33:18] p-rock board. And it's still using the old driver board. So now he's like, I want to replace the

[33:25] driver board to. And then I want to be able to control everything using newer technology. So I think

[33:33] we're getting into something pretty slick here. Well, it's like if you keep replacing that, why don't

[33:36] you just build your own machine? You're just a tire new system, everything. I mean, the fundamental

[33:42] issues with pinball is that these machines are massive. They're heavy to move. They're expensive.

[33:50] And really the technology had not changed very much in like 30 years. DMD to LCD is maybe the biggest

[33:58] change in that time period. But the coils are still the coils that were like used in the 30s.

[34:05] You know what I mean? Like not exactly, but yes, they've moved to microsewitches. But

[34:12] they're like, but there's still plenty of leaf switches out there. But there's still

[34:16] plenty of leaf switches out there. It's pretty weird. It's a weird thing. The basic form factor has

[34:21] not changed in a long time. You can get a sheet of play field glass that will fit a 60s game and a

[34:29] brand new stir. So it's pretty wild. So this is where the P3 pinball platform, which they dubbed one

[34:36] machine, many games and endless fun. So in 2012, they added design resources to build a new

[34:46] innovative pinball machine. But they wanted to include some very specific things.

[34:51] Modern technology, without sacrificing traditional pinball gameplay mechanics,

[34:57] significantly lower the price of owning a library of games and eliminate the need for lots of space

[35:04] for the games. So I have one game that can play a lot of games.

[35:08] Right. And you want to have multiple games. You don't want to have a bunch of space taken up.

[35:14] But you also want to have traditional pinball gameplay mechanics. We're talking flippers,

[35:22] ramps, you know, coils, that kind of thing. Okay. I'm on board so far.

[35:28] Now the company changed its name to multi-morphic ink and set out designing the world's first

[35:37] modular multi-game physical pinball platform. And they would call it the P3.

[35:45] They wanted to combine the traditional physical features that we all love about pinball,

[35:52] a dynamic artwork, comprehensive pinball position tracking. But to do so in such a way that

[35:59] multiple games with different software and different physical layouts could be played on the same

[36:06] machine. Well, it's easy to do that in virtual pinball, right? You just kind of click a few buttons

[36:12] and bam, totally different playfield. But if you've got physical layouts, it's getting different here.

[36:17] And that brings us to the launch of the P3 pinball platform in July of 2012.

[36:24] So let's do you want to describe the multi-morphic P3 platform with me, Ron? Sure. Sure.

[36:34] We're going to go right to their site. So the first thing that we're talking about here in the back box

[36:41] is a swappable and changeable LCD screen. Entire back boxes and LCD screen. Now originally it wasn't.

[36:50] Yeah. And you don't swap the screen. It shows different things.

[36:55] So like a ridge, like it would change. That's what it is now. Now originally, it was just a translate.

[37:02] Now the LCD is larger, the size of the back box. And then the bottom is the swappable translate.

[37:08] It had magnetic side art and it had magnetic cabinet side art. So bam,

[37:15] new art comes in a tube, throw it on, right? No need to have an entirely new machine.

[37:22] The back third of the playfield, and we look at it here, is changeable. So it pops out and pops back in.

[37:29] Two thirds of the playfield is an LCD screen. So let's talk about that.

[37:34] It's pretty crazy that there's like a LCD TV in this playfield, right?

[37:39] Well, it's much more than that. It's more than just an LCD. So Jerry said, the concept of this

[37:44] machine was that I wanted the central portion of the playfield to essentially be an LCD.

[37:50] They needed to figure out how to track the ball as it travels across this screen. Because other than

[37:56] that, it's just going across the screen. Like there's nothing exciting about that. It's just artwork

[38:02] that changes. They wanted to come up with ball trails and interactive artwork as the ball traveled

[38:08] across the LCD screen. They originally started with a 17 inch monitor at the bottom of that playfield.

[38:15] Jerry says, I was sitting there thinking we now have those flat screen tablets and mobile phones

[38:20] and these things where you can have a display and you can use your finger and touch points on

[38:24] the displays and interact with them. Well, holy crap, we're putting an LCD in a pinball machine.

[38:29] We have a physical pinball rolling over and why don't we do the same thing? So that sounds like

[38:34] a fun, simple idea. And it's very much not a simple idea. I mean, it does kind of sound easy,

[38:39] right? Like take an iPad and roll a ball over it. Well, you can't have a physical pinball touching

[38:44] the screen because it'll break it. Yeah, especially if it falls on it or have an air ball. Come on.

[38:50] Everybody's dropped an iPad. Everybody sneezed and dropped their like cell phone from waste height

[38:56] and watch it explode as soon as the ball touches the surface of that screen. It's going to scratch it

[39:00] up. It's going to break so they had to come up with a way to actually figure that out. Well,

[39:06] they solved it. They used an infrared grid of light over the top of the screen. So the screen

[39:14] isn't being physically touched. It can sense where the ball is based on breaking the infrared light

[39:21] beams above the screen. They also needed to create slings because they wanted to keep the fundamental

[39:27] basics of pinball and slings are one of those in things you can't get rid of. Well, they also go

[39:34] through the play field. So how are you going to do that on an LCD screen? So usually there's like a

[39:38] coil underneath and then there's like those kicker arms. Is that what they call them and those

[39:43] flick the rubber, right? Yeah. So how does it work on a multi-marphic system? Well, they created

[39:47] slings that float over the screen, but they also can't interfere with the grid of light. So Jerry said,

[39:54] I wanted to develop physical elements, traditional play field loops, targets, and pop bumpers,

[39:59] all that stuff and put them a little deeper into the play field. I coming from games like

[40:04] Attack From Mars, Medieval Madness, and even Theater of Magic, which have most of its elements

[40:09] about two thirds the way up of the play field. So like what? Why do machines have this painted

[40:14] piece of wood in the lower portion that the ball rolls over as it gets to physical components

[40:18] when you could put a really cool dynamic canvas in there and draw graphics and basically take your

[40:24] display, take the scores and the instructional information and the pop ups that happen when you

[40:29] shoot stuff and put them right in front of the player's eyes. There you go. So you don't have to be

[40:34] looking up at the LCD screen or at that time the DMD screen. You can keep your eye down on the play

[40:41] field. It's going to change. It's going to give you the information you want. Sounds like a pretty

[40:45] good idea. That brings us to Texas pinball festival in 2012. Did you attend? Yes. Do you remember when

[40:54] they brought out the system for the demo? I don't remember. Oh, tournament hanging out in the

[41:00] tournament. Sorry. Well, they brought it out and what did Jerry say? Well, Jerry says it was a blast

[41:06] watching people play it and we had so many fun things going on. We had people walking up to us

[41:11] with their kids and their kids would play the thing for hours. Everyone asked me, when are we going

[41:15] to turn this into a business and take it, take it into production? And I was like, no, that's not

[41:21] happening. Yeah, this is like the ultimate home brew. You know what I mean? The multi-morphic P3

[41:27] platform is like just these these kind of guys working together with their own kind of company,

[41:32] having a good time, making these cool control boards and technology and doing something that they

[41:38] enjoy. It's like you and I doing podcasts and do this because we enjoy it and it's fun in

[41:43] addition to our actual jobs and in addition to the fun that we have within the hobby. So when did

[41:48] it actually become a business then? Well, you need a lot of money to manufacture pinball. Ron,

[41:54] do you know that? We know that. We've seen that. Have we ever talked about that? We've talked about

[42:00] that. Have we we've had many episodes on that right? Where we've talked about how the fact that

[42:04] if you don't have a lot of money, you are not building anything. Nothing. It's like zero. How do you

[42:10] make a million dollars in pinball? You lose two million? Jerry, he needed one of those multi-millionaire

[42:16] backers. You know what I mean? Those angel investors like Stern has, right? That you're going bankrupt

[42:23] and somebody comes in and bales out the company, gives you a bunch of money and you fix things and

[42:29] turn it around and you make a bunch of money. Maybe David Dennis can make you the money.

[42:34] You're going to finance. This will be a perfect spot for your commercial.

[42:37] Hey pinheads, I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not making cheesy jokes to make Ron laugh,

[42:43] I'm David, the financial advice guy. At Dennis Financial, our advisors strive to provide a return

[43:46] Okay, that was all well and good that I just did the commercial there, but you know, they need

[43:51] they need a hedge fund or like an like an equity play or some sort of family office to give them

[43:57] a bunch of money and that's what Jerry did, wasn't it? Well, Jerry says I had an aunt and uncle

[44:03] visiting some family in the area and they came over and played the game for fun. They asked me if I was

[44:08] going to take it, make it into a business. Not was like no, it's going to cost a ton of money to

[44:13] do that. We don't have the money. They called me a few weeks later and said, hey, if we give you some

[44:19] money, will you go and do this because we think it's super cool and we think there's potential for it.

[44:24] I told them how much I thought it would take to build a company to do this. What they gave me was a

[44:29] lot of money, but it was a fraction of what I thought it would take to build a company to do this.

[44:34] It was enough to get us started to cover the cost of a couple more prototypes and to give us a

[44:38] little introduction into the world of pinball manufacturing. So, so this is an awesome story. Jerry's

[44:45] family is like, hey, you've got a passion here. There's a business here. Take the ball and run

[44:51] with it and let us help and support you. That's a pretty, that's awesome. I would, I want to hang out

[44:56] with with his aunt and uncle. I mean, my aunt and uncle are giving me like gluten-free muffins and

[45:03] some Earl Grey tea. They're not helping me build a pinball company. The muffins are, are they good?

[45:09] They're pretty good. See, there you go. A little banana, banana bread with some chocolate chips in it.

[45:14] Anyway, that had a 24 inch screen, which meant that the slingshots and the flippers

[45:23] had to be a floating mechanism. So, they could no longer put the flippers in. They also had to float

[45:30] those over the play field. Well, they noticed they weren't using all of the P-Rock boards

[45:35] functionality as well, because P-Rock was designed for the Williams and Stern kind of style machines.

[45:44] It was a bit bigger and it had a lot of connectors and pieces that they weren't using.

[45:50] That's when Jerry re-engineered the board set into the P-3 Rock board set. So it went for P-Rock,

[46:00] for the P-3 and now it's P-3 Rock. Wow, there's so many terms here. Fantastic marketing.

[46:07] If it doesn't, doesn't confuse anybody. And I know it drives Jerry crazy when people get the mixed up.

[46:13] When I see P-3 Rock, when I see Rock, I think of Rochester.

[46:17] The Rochester pinball collectives. I think it is the airport code for Rochester.

[46:21] Home of the 2025 nationals and pinmasters. You've just completely dated this podcast. Don't do that.

[46:33] So the P-Rock system was $325 at the time and they added the driver board set that you could

[46:41] purchase as well. P-3 Rock was $175. The smaller boards further reduced the barrier of entry

[46:50] for those home brew makers. Amazing for the community. But they probably could have charged more.

[46:59] Like as the salesperson, like I don't know why you would take a $325 board set and change it

[47:08] and make it $175. I mean, you could make it $225. You could make it $299. And you could still sell more.

[47:17] I don't know. Anyway, getting into some custom games. So now we've got the platform,

[47:23] the ball tracking, all of that stuff. Now we have to start making games.

[47:29] Jerry said, we see ourselves as kind of like a Nintendo or Sony where we want to develop games for it.

[47:35] We want to sell platforms and make games for it. But we want other people to have the ability to do so

[47:40] as well. So we released this basically the entire programming framework that we use internally

[47:45] to develop games. The whole computer like high-end computer folk, they're very open-sourced,

[47:53] right? They're very much like send the tools out and let the people develop. And this was of course

[47:58] really popular. I would say back in the in the in the late arts, kind of around the the iPhone,

[48:04] launch time where apps were a big thing, right? Like people could develop their own apps.

[48:09] So that's kind of the atmosphere that Jerry and those guys grew up in is people building their

[48:15] own things. You want to sell the platform. But what you actually want is to people to embrace the

[48:22] platform and develop those games. So they would use Unity, which is a way to design games, a computer

[48:30] software. And they would also use C sharp, which was a programming interface. This is like mobile

[48:38] games, a lot of mobile games and even some console games today use Unity. So manufacturers actually

[48:45] started using P-Rock and P3 Rock to build their own machines. How cool is that? Jerry's bringing on

[48:52] customers to buy the P3 Rock system and they're building things like the Big Lebowski in 2016 at

[49:00] Dutch Pinball or dual 2014 or 15 or 16 or whatever years is eventually May. Don't forget TNA.

[49:08] Yes, total nuclear annihilation with Scott Denesey. He had spooky he and spooky pinball collaborated

[49:15] together to develop this awesome game and it ran on P-Rock. American pinball is Houdini. Alice

[49:24] Cooper's Nightmare Castle also at spooky pinball. 2018 Soctober Fest at American pinball and Rick

[49:32] and Morty from spooky pinball, which is another Scott Denesey design. Hot Wheels from American

[49:38] pinball in 2020. Keltz from Haggis pinball and in 2021 they also did Legends of Valhalla at American

[49:48] pinball. So they've kind of developed this relationship with all of these manufacturers and they're bringing in

[49:54] different methods of creating income within their business. How cool is that? A lot of P3 out there.

[50:02] But let's wind it back. Let's go way back before all that stuff happened. But the final version and

[50:08] the release of the P3 platform. Do you have thoughts and impressions about sort of the first iteration

[50:15] of the P3 platform when you kind of played it the first time? Well the first time I saw it was the

[50:21] Lexi light speed and the cosmic cart racing. Kind of where did you see that? Like Texas or pinball

[50:26] expires or something like that? Yeah, it was one or the other one or the other show that I saw it in.

[50:30] So I mean the company was starting 2012 right from sort of the beginnings then they were developing

[50:36] the P-Rock system while doing the P3 platform and P3 Rock and then all of a sudden to kind of now we're

[50:41] into 2017 and their first game is released in the fall and winter of 2017. It sells for $9,875. That's

[50:52] the base game plus two modules. So you're getting two games that was expensive for a system.

[51:02] Not for two games, yeah. At the time I'm thinking Stern Pro probably would have been like 5K,

[51:07] something or maybe a little over that. It would be what it is now. Exactly. So the back third was

[51:14] swappable. So the idea was okay they've developed this lower third with an LCD screen. They've got a

[51:21] back third and you could switch it out. It has this set of wall scoops between the module in the

[51:29] back and the LCD in the front. So what is the wall scoops? What are those? They raise up. They

[51:35] raise up and he could shoot the ball into them. They're kind of cool. They're like scoops but they're

[51:40] like they're like wider. They're like what? Seven centimeters? Oh God, I don't know how that works.

[51:47] So it's like three inches or something right? Like two three inches. Yeah, they pop up and they have,

[51:53] I'm trying to remember how many balls they have in one of these systems. It's something like 10.

[51:58] Even if it doesn't even if it doesn't use them all, it will have that many. The idea is

[52:05] it's the same across all games again like the modular design, all that. It has like a massive. I

[52:11] think it's got a tray or a trough or something there. So when it goes into the scoops just like falls in.

[52:16] Yeah, it's really really unique and those scoops are LED lit which is kind of neat. They change color.

[52:22] They have this really neat satisfying like noise when they go like click click click click click click

[52:27] they're really cool. I kind of like that. One of the more controversial features though

[52:32] were the three buttons on each side of the cabinet. So they went with kind of the three button

[52:39] method. And why does this bother folk Ron? Because they're used to one button.

[52:44] People like one button. This is something that people harp on. I do see why their criticism can

[52:50] be sound and valid. We'll get into that in a minute. I think some people are a little too hard on it.

[52:57] I think more the more the bigger issues the fact that they're raised the buttons are not actually

[53:02] on the cabinet. They're on a separate part that's on the cabinet like a plastic thing.

[53:09] I don't know. It's all right. So let's get into their first game and you briefly mentioned it.

[53:14] Lexi light speed escape from earth. Oh, that was the whole. I didn't realize that was the

[53:19] whole title. So it's a fantasy science fiction. It's an original theme July of 17. We don't know

[53:24] how many units were sold. This was designed by Holy crap Dennis Nordman and TJ Weaver mechanics by

[53:31] TJ Weaver animation by Rory Kuna. Seruna. Ser Nuda. Ser Nuda. Ser Nune. Okay, sure. Art by Scott

[53:42] Gullix and music and sound by Oh, my goodness. David feel. Yes. We got some names here.

[53:50] Software. B.J. Wilson Jerry Stelmerberg and Michael Ocean. Who you'll remember from Ocean's 11.

[53:57] Ha ha. So let's check out the flyer. I love flyers. That's why they did. That's why they were

[54:02] upset over the last episode. The bingo episode. No flyers. Multimorphic proudly presents Lexi

[54:09] light speed escape from earth. Game number one for the P3 pinball platform.

[54:17] So let's see how they advertise their own stuff. The platform features support for easily

[54:23] swappable game kits with play field modules and magnetic cabinet artwork. Dynamic and

[54:29] interactive play field artwork for incredibly immersive gameplay. 12 individually controlled

[54:36] wall and scoop targets for gameplay diversity. Magical floating flippers and slingshots. Okay,

[54:42] that's my favorite line so far. Really really magical. Like my least favorite is the one before it.

[54:48] Gameplay diversity. Like most people are like, what? What is that event? But when you say

[54:53] magical floating flippers and slingshots, now you have my attention. Modular design for greatly

[54:59] improved service ability. Don't forget to like us on Facebook. And that's at multimorphic.com.

[55:06] The art leaves a little to be desired here. But I didn't have an issue with it. But the Lexi

[55:13] light speed module I think is is kind of cool. So in the back, it has three pop bumpers like a pinball

[55:21] machine. And who doesn't like an eight ball physical ball lock? It's in the back. It's sort of like

[55:26] a spinning wheel. I mean, it's a flying saucer, but it's kind of like a Ferris wheel. It's got

[55:32] three ramps. It's got some stand up targets. It's kind of got this, you know, neat way on the

[55:39] bottom to show you where to shoot. It's got arrows that come up on the screen. It's like you're in

[55:46] a world under glass. I like how it has incredibly smooth ramp configurations, which means wide

[55:53] open and easy to shoot. That's what that means. But I mean, it's neat. It's got my attention here.

[56:00] I kind of like it. You've played Lexi light speed. Yep. What do you think? I was actually confused

[56:06] with the buttons because if I remember, you actually need to use the multiple buttons for

[56:10] different things. That's the only part that kind of because I'm old. I'm sure like a young lad

[56:17] or young lady or whatever a young person would probably have less issues than an old person like

[56:22] me would have. What are you talking about? Yeah, but it's like select. You know, we hit the button

[56:26] like, okay, this isn't the button I'm supposed to head. It's one of these other ones. Lexi light speed

[56:31] head an update to its art. They had a second art package that was released, which I think

[56:39] was a huge improvement, huge improvement. You can see the two different art projects,

[56:47] art packages on the pin side website. And it's well worth the look. One of them is a little more

[56:54] like kind of rough. It's great. It's good art. The other one's a little more kind of cartoony.

[57:01] Really cool. I like the new art. That was a good, good decision. Even though they have different

[57:06] titles. No, they're skate from earth. No, the other one didn't say that. Oh, the other one says,

[57:12] oh yeah, look at that. Lexi lightspeed Galaxy girl. Oh, how about that? Very cool, very cool. Go

[57:20] check those out on pin side. You can also see that on IPDB. Some of the original artwork and

[57:27] everything on there. I thought it was all pretty cool. So I haven't played Lexi light speed.

[57:32] So by the time I got around to getting to a place with P3 platform, that was like when another

[57:41] kind of machine had been out and everybody has kind of moved on from Lexi. But the one that was

[57:46] also released at the same time was pirate was canon lagoon. This one I thought was actually super

[57:55] cool. Canon lagoon is a pirate theme done by Jerry Stellenberg, Jeremy Wilson, Thomas Law,

[58:05] Scott Goulick, TJ Weaver on mechanics animation by which is the screen animations by Rory Sir

[58:14] Nuda, music and sound David Thiel software, BJ Wilson, Jerry Stellenberg and Michael Ocean again.

[58:22] And this is kind of like what they call a progressive timed level game with you shooting pirate

[58:30] ships. And I think this is kind of neat because usually pinball is kind of like shoot the loop

[58:35] three times. Start a mode. Do this. Do that. This thing is like what do they call that tower

[58:42] defense or whatever like those kind of games where you have to shoot up the play field to kind of

[58:50] smash the the boats in the lagoon. So you're shooting your cannon. What did you think of this? Did

[58:57] you play canon? Did you play a did you play canon lagoon? I have never played this one. Oh this one

[59:03] always looked cool. I always saw this on a stream. And I'm like, okay, that's kind of fun. Not only do

[59:07] you have these games, these physical games that can swap in and out, you can also change the software

[59:16] by downloading new software. You can also get new trans lights and new sideart if you want. And

[59:23] you can change your game but keep the module inside the same. And that's where Lexi Light Speed

[59:30] Secret Agent Showdown came from. You could purchase the new trans lights on the website.

[59:37] It was a totally new game in the Lexi Light Speed universe. And it was like a mini game that you

[59:43] could add to the Lexi Light Speed module. There's also a game called rocks where it's kind of like

[59:50] asteroids where you're shooting the ball up the play field and you're smashing the asteroids.

[59:57] Then there was Barnyard which had animals from a from a farm. So this is like proof of concept. Do

[01:00:04] you think they prove the concept? Yeah, they prove the concept. Is it a working game? I think they did.

[01:00:11] I think it was like, oh, it works. It can be manufactured. It's kind of cool. It's different.

[01:00:16] They're building something out there. That's where their next full new module came out. The following year

[01:00:23] in 2018, cosmic cart racing. It's like space racing. Yep. This one I have played. This one when

[01:00:31] this came out, I'm like, man, this is cool. It's got a bunch of really cool ramps in the back

[01:00:36] third. So you swap out the module. You put in the new module in the back third. And as a

[01:00:41] couple of really cool ramps with a bunch of LED light strips on them. And from all the videos I've

[01:00:47] seen swapping the modules is pretty quick. Kind of idiot proof, which for me is pretty good.

[01:00:53] That is. Yeah. It looks scary. The floating max and the this and that. But to be honest,

[01:01:00] I think I could figure it out. And again, I'm not too bright. Cosmic cart racing head again,

[01:01:05] two different art packages. There was the original art package, which was a little,

[01:01:10] and then there was the really cool secondary art package, which was by the same artist

[01:01:15] that did the Lexi light speed switch over Jackson G. The kind of the idea behind cosmic cart racing

[01:01:24] was that it was it was a little bit like Mario Kart, right? Like you're racing through this track.

[01:01:29] You're kind of shooting shells and banana peels at the other people. And one of the kind of the

[01:01:34] thoughts that people had was that you could play against each other. Yep. On two different

[01:01:40] machines. It's very much like NBA fast break. Yep. That's where I actually played it.

[01:01:45] I was playing against someone else. The thing to remember though, we say new machine. I mean,

[01:01:50] it's it's not a new machine. It's just a new module. Yeah, the back third and the new software.

[01:01:55] As such, it doesn't cost $9,000. It only cost $2,500. Oh, so a brand new Stern pro around this time

[01:02:04] was probably $5,000 US. And this is coming out at half of that. That's a pretty slick. That's

[01:02:10] pretty slick. And according to you, it's the MRSP. I don't know what that is. MSRP. I just decided

[01:02:15] to spell it wrong. So then they actually at this time, there was a lot of talk about creating a

[01:02:21] heads up. So they did a trial game at Dave and Busters in Texas, I think, where they put two head-to-head

[01:02:28] games using Canon Lagoon with new code and there was ball stealing and there was things like that.

[01:02:34] So they did a trial run with that. I couldn't figure out where that went. But I'm assuming because

[01:02:40] we've never heard of it again, it didn't really go anywhere. But I think that that was again

[01:02:44] really cool kind of testing out a market. It's a very different machine than other machines. So I

[01:02:52] thought that was kind of a cool little proof of concept they did there. And I'm trying to remember

[01:02:57] when I played it, if I won my racer, if I lost my race against my opponent, I don't remember.

[01:03:01] Oh, you totally won. You don't think so. You're a pretty good player. I'm not a good racer though.

[01:03:08] Well, the first official user-generated add-on was a game called Grand Slam Rally by 86 pixels from

[01:03:15] January of 2019. This was a pitch and bat style game that used the Canon Lagoon Playfield module.

[01:03:23] So the game concept design and software was by Jimmy Lippam. I think we actually tossed a

[01:03:31] little shade Jimmy's way during the John Papaduke episode because he had worked some time with John

[01:03:38] Papaduke. And I think I said he was some guy from the internet. And we actually received a couple

[01:03:45] of emails from a few fellows that said, hey, Jimmy's like an actually an important guy in the home

[01:03:50] Bruce. Yeah, so that sounds like something you would say. Say so my apologies to Jimmy. I was not

[01:03:55] really involved in the home Bruce scenes. I can't know everybody, but he did the first user-generated

[01:04:03] add-on. So you've got a Canon Lagoon Playfield module. You paid your $2,500 bucks. You can buy

[01:04:09] separately the piece of software and it updates it to a pitch and bat game. That's cool.

[01:04:15] Cooler if it had a running man unit. I think you got a pitch and bat. You've got to have a

[01:04:20] running man unit. I mean, they're mostly proof of concept at this time. Like we got our first kind of

[01:04:26] games. Are they proof of concepts? I mean, they're selling them. I mean, they're a couple. Yeah,

[01:04:30] I mean, it's the whole software world is like, well, fix it in production. It goes out there.

[01:04:36] And then they make little tweaks and changes. And maybe they changed the way the cabinet is built or

[01:04:42] maybe they moved the LCD screen from a smaller LCD screen to a bigger LCD screen or maybe they

[01:04:48] swap out the flipper max to a different flipper max. You know, that's what I mean. They're kind of

[01:04:52] they're kind of guinea pig in those first ones out there. But I think coming out of the gate,

[01:04:56] I think they got something very different and very cool. But they did have some criticism,

[01:05:01] didn't they? The criticism is always how different it is. And it's always a little overblown.

[01:05:08] It's always like, this isn't real pinball, et cetera, et cetera. It's usually the,

[01:05:12] which is silly because it is actually real pinball. The difference, I think, is that there are some

[01:05:20] things that are distinctly weird. The flipper buttons are weird. And we'll get into a little more of

[01:05:27] that here in a minute. The screen being there and having like computer graphics or cell phone,

[01:05:34] iPad that, you know, people are, they look at it and they're confused. And let's face it,

[01:05:39] the pinball industry and the hobby in general is kind of dominated by a bunch of like old white guys

[01:05:46] that kind of remember the nostalgia days. And when you kind of change that around a little bit,

[01:05:52] kind of rubs people the wrong way. I think if you take a look at what multi-morphic was doing

[01:05:57] and some of those silly criticisms, I think if you bring both of those parties together

[01:06:03] and somewhere in the middle, I think that's where you find a sweet spot of some things you can

[01:06:08] improve and things that, you know, people need to accept. Well, the first really big step,

[01:06:15] and this is the first game that I remember seeing is Heist. This was awesome. The crane. Yes.

[01:06:24] That's what I call it. The crane game. The greatest crane that has ever cramed. This is, this is

[01:06:30] Copson-Robber's theme. This is March of 2020. So kind of right when the pandemic has begun,

[01:06:37] the design, this was designed by Steven Silver, mechanics by TJ Weaver, animation by Steven Silver,

[01:06:44] art by Jose Fernandez, software and sound Steven Silver, B.J. Wilson. I'm sorry, music and sound,

[01:06:54] Steven Silver, B.J. Wilson, Greg Goldie, software, B.J. Wilson, Greg Goldie, Thomas Law. So you

[01:07:02] can see that we've got like a different kind of core group of individuals. TJ Weaver, still on

[01:07:07] mechanics, but we've got new art, we've got new sound and music, we've got a new designer here

[01:07:13] with Steven Silver. So the company is maturing and changing a little bit. What's the MSRP?

[01:07:20] Well, for the module, it's $2,750. Hey, still pretty good. He translate apron and cabinet art

[01:07:28] sold separately. Ah, okay. So you get the module, but if you want to have that magnetic art and the

[01:07:34] and the translate, you're going to have to buy that separately. Now this is a world under glass,

[01:07:38] is it not? I just like your comment and the notes is the crane. The crane. Yes, let's talk about

[01:07:44] the crane. So in the idea is in the back third of the play field, there is a city and there's a

[01:07:52] police station and there's a couple of ramps and an interloop and some return ramps and there's

[01:07:58] like looks like a hospital with parking. And then when you look at the LCD screen, it's like you're

[01:08:03] looking down into a city. Really cool idea. And the crane that we're talking about is and pinball

[01:08:10] has seen many cranes before like Batman 66. They wish they were like this crane. They do. But

[01:08:18] this is it. So the crane moves to the play field left and right and there's a magnetic magnet

[01:08:23] on the bottom that holds the ball. But this crane will extend like telescope out and hover that ball

[01:08:31] over the play field to hit. It's cool. And it knows and it knows where it is at all times. And

[01:08:36] we'll show it on the display. This game won the pinball industry award at that time now known as

[01:08:44] the pinball awards award for toys and innovation. And it certainly deserved it. But they also did

[01:08:52] something that people didn't think they could do. They added an upper flipper. So some of the

[01:08:59] criticism was it's only got two flippers on the bottom of the Albe fan layouts. Well, they went

[01:09:04] and they created a mech that you could screw into the top kind of up on the top just below the

[01:09:10] bottom third and you can have a third flipper criticism gone. Everybody was like, all right,

[01:09:15] I'll accept this game for what it is now. Well, they were like, I can't see the flipper.

[01:09:20] Okay. Oh, well, yeah. So there's always something. But yes, and I agree you can't see the flipper.

[01:09:25] Or the criticize fact you have to hit one of the other buttons. The button for the upper flipper

[01:09:31] is on a different cabinet button on the right side. The criticism is always, well, you could just

[01:09:37] change it in the settings. But in fact, it's really difficult to do that. And if you're on location,

[01:09:42] you can't do that because it's not a game you have at your home. The other thing is normies.

[01:09:48] You know, pinball normies, they have a hard time like actually trying to use an upper flipper when

[01:09:55] it's very obvious and in your face. And when it flips when you use one button. So I mean,

[01:10:03] it's kind of a terrible, you know, advice to be like, just just learn, right? So if you have small

[01:10:10] hands like me, I got to reach for that, that button. This is where we meet somebody that we spoke about

[01:10:17] last month. You remember Nick Baldrige right in the forum, amusement games?

[01:10:22] The bingo guy. Yeah, the bingo guy. Well, for amusement only games created an LLC.

[01:10:30] And Nick Baldrige decided to play around with this open source software platform.

[01:10:37] And Nick says, a lifelong love of pinball and gaming is fueled my interest in repairing and

[01:10:43] creating games. I enjoy seeing different approaches to complex electrical, mechanical, and

[01:10:48] programming problems at all types of games and utilizing modern technology to engage players

[01:10:53] without unduly increasing complexity. So this is where he created the Ranger in the Ruins,

[01:11:02] which was a game concept design and software by himself, Nick Baldrige. And its tagline was

[01:11:09] exist survive persist. So the game actually requires you to have the cosmic cart racing P3

[01:11:18] playfield module. And it was the world's first internet connected roguelike pinball game.

[01:11:27] Find as many of the items from players all over the world on your quest to beat the high score

[01:11:33] and survive. So roguelike games are like ones where you grind on forever. You just grind and

[01:11:39] grind and grind away. And how far can you go in one run? Nick worked on a homebrew test case

[01:11:47] in early 2020 called Quest for Glory. And Quest for Glory was a complete re-implementation of the

[01:11:55] computer adventure game Quest for Glory 1. So you want to be a hero by Sierra Entertainment.

[01:12:01] Do you remember that? No. That seems like it's right up your alley. Those old Sierra games.

[01:12:07] Not really. I didn't play many computer games. You were just playing ninja, what's his name?

[01:12:12] Karate champ. And I'm old. That probably I would have been like too old to play that.

[01:12:18] So he's experimenting with this platform. Quest for Glory didn't really go very far. The Ranger

[01:12:24] and the Ruins though. That's the one that people kind of got a bit excited for. And in 2021,

[01:12:32] Nick would release another add-on called Silver Falls with his daughter, Sophia. They came up with

[01:12:39] the concept of starting a new life in Silver Falls. And they used the Heist Playfield module.

[01:12:47] And they also got Scott Deneese to do the music. Well, there were also official multi-morphic add-ons

[01:12:54] one of them was suit shooting scoot. Do you remember that one? I do not remember that one.

[01:13:02] I remember the name. There was Sorcerer's Apprentice that also used the cosmic cart racing module.

[01:13:08] For amusement-only games also released flipper fox trot rhythm explosion. Yeah. Guitar hero.

[01:13:16] Yeah, it's kind of like guitar hero. I thought that was a really cool idea. And I think that used

[01:13:20] cannon lagoon, if I recall. This is where the company significantly changes.

[01:13:27] People are saying, I don't like original themes. Yeah, no one likes original themes.

[01:13:32] What are you going to do a license theme? What are you going to do a license theme?

[01:13:36] When are you going to put all the button on one button? Why are the flippers hidden on the top?

[01:13:44] Why is it that when I shoot the top flipper, I can get the ball stuck behind the flipper on the top.

[01:13:50] Why? Like it's just everybody is a bit complaining. Or they're just complaining to complain.

[01:13:56] I think there's probably some of that, but I think some people are like, hey, there's something here.

[01:14:01] You just need to make these minor changes and you'll get to the next level. And then there's

[01:14:05] the other group that's like, this system is perfectly fine the way it is. You're just dumb.

[01:14:10] Which is kind of how technology people think normies are. But that first license,

[01:14:16] the game where they can change the narrative. It became Weird Al's music of natural hilarity.

[01:14:24] Where were you when this game was announced?

[01:14:28] Surfing on the internet somewhere because I think that's where I saw it.

[01:14:31] When this came out, people are like, whoa, wait a second here. What's going on?

[01:14:35] They got Weird Al. He's not an A list or a B list. He's probably a good C list artist.

[01:14:40] Oh, that's ALICE B. Come on. You think he's B?

[01:14:43] He likes Jeff? Come on. I don't know.

[01:14:48] I love Weird Al. Let's put this way. He has a fanatical following.

[01:14:52] Yeah, that's true. Rabbit. My cousin saw these guys saw Weird Al live.

[01:14:58] I saw him live.

[01:14:59] I mean, I enjoyed the running with Cisars' album. I enjoyed all of that stuff.

[01:15:05] So much fun. So much fun. He always makes me smile.

[01:15:08] This is a great theme for Pinball, I think. It's not Star Wars.

[01:15:13] I'm sure it's some people's dream theme, not my dream theme, but I think it's...

[01:15:16] And they got the music. Like Amish Paradise and stuff is in there.

[01:15:20] They got so much music.

[01:15:23] They got Dare to Be Stupid, Word Crimes, White Nurtie, My Blona.

[01:15:28] Dare to Be Stupid, Dare to Be Stupid.

[01:15:29] Like a surgeon.

[01:15:30] Yeah. And Weird Al is in the game.

[01:15:34] It's actually Weird Al. Who did a killer job with the callouts?

[01:15:39] He let it all hang out on that game.

[01:15:41] Scott Dinesi did the sound in the music.

[01:15:44] The art was by Matt Andrews and he did a heck of a job, in my opinion.

[01:15:49] Animation by Steven Silver.

[01:15:50] The design of Steven Silver and Michael Ocean, so a bit of a collaboration.

[01:15:54] TJ Weaver, again on mechanics with Trey Jones and Les Pitt.

[01:15:59] Jerry Selenberg, Greg Goldie and Michael Ocean on The Software Itself.

[01:16:04] I mean, let's wind it back a little bit. Who is Weird Al?

[01:16:07] Weird Al Yankovic is an American musician, comedian and actor.

[01:16:12] He's best known for writing and performing comedy songs that often parody specific songs

[01:16:18] by contemporary musicians.

[01:16:21] He also performs original songs.

[01:16:24] But like Dare to Be Stupid was supposed to be Devo.

[01:16:28] That kind of thing. I think even the video he dresses like Devo.

[01:16:31] Dare to Be Stupid, Dare to Be Stupid.

[01:16:34] And as you know, it poke melodies.

[01:16:36] He does a lot of poke melodies.

[01:16:38] He does a lot of popular songs.

[01:16:40] Most of which he uses his trademark accordion in.

[01:16:44] And did you know that some people also say that he's a hip hop artist?

[01:16:48] He's been involved in the genre for many years.

[01:16:51] Now his big break was back in 1984 when he did eat it, which parodyed

[01:17:00] beat it, which was shot for shot at exact parody of the Edit Music video.

[01:17:06] This ended up on MTV and Weird Al exploded.

[01:17:10] I remember that. That's how old I am.

[01:17:12] I don't. I was not born.

[01:17:13] Wow. Wait a minute, we feel old.

[01:17:17] What's your favorite Weird Al song?

[01:17:18] There's so many of them. I always like fat, white and dirty.

[01:17:23] Amish Paradise, of course.

[01:17:24] I think Amish Paradise is my favorite.

[01:17:26] What was the one, the episode one, the Star Wars one, running it from scissors?

[01:17:32] I can't remember what it's called, but it's the American pie, isn't it?

[01:17:36] Farragic. Yeah.

[01:17:37] So good.

[01:17:38] Yes. I'll try to remember the actual title.

[01:17:40] It's not called pie or anything.

[01:17:42] It's I can't remember what it's called.

[01:17:44] So the game itself, it was launched at just probably the worst time.

[01:17:50] And that time was was right kind of in the middle of the pandemic.

[01:17:56] Or kind of on the, on the, just as we're kind of starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.

[01:18:02] Wouldn't that be good timing though?

[01:18:03] But it wasn't because we still had all of the glutt and all of the problems that came along with that

[01:18:10] with supply chain issues, getting people into your, into your building to work and,

[01:18:17] you know, trying to get wire and the cost of plastic going through the roof and all of that stuff.

[01:18:23] The other thing is this release had a couple of issues because there were a few minor leaks

[01:18:30] just before the release of the pin.

[01:18:32] So there was, there was some leaking that was happening on some forums and things like that of

[01:18:37] individuals who might have seen the game.

[01:18:39] There was a lot of hype that was created around this top tier license, right?

[01:18:44] Like word was that all, oh, they're releasing a license and it is top tier.

[01:18:48] It is a big A-list S tier level license.

[01:18:53] And then when it came out, people are like, I like Weird Al, but the hype train, I think,

[01:18:57] got a little to add a control.

[01:19:00] The website also had some issues with ordering because they included new flipper max and additional

[01:19:09] flipper max.

[01:19:10] So like if you had been like a Lexi light speed purchaser or a heist purchaser,

[01:19:16] you know, you could purchase the other modules for the flippers, but it wasn't entirely clear.

[01:19:22] Again, marketing issues, nothing at the end of the world here.

[01:19:26] But just communication things from a technology company that I think could be improved upon,

[01:19:34] that I would increase the experience to the purchaser and I think boost sales.

[01:19:39] But let's face it, they did actually sell quite a few of these Weird Al games.

[01:19:43] Their issues have, yeah, their issues haven't been selling games.

[01:19:46] They've been getting them made a bit of most of their issues.

[01:19:49] Right, exactly. And that's the thing. They are producing the games that they can design and build.

[01:19:57] Would they want to sell, you know, 10,000 multi-morphic systems, of course they would,

[01:20:01] but they wouldn't be able to keep up with this.

[01:20:04] So I think they're due and just what they like to do and they're growing slowly and steadily.

[01:20:10] They had issues getting the stuff out and they were trying to increase their,

[01:20:15] they get more employees, speed up the production.

[01:20:18] That's most of their issues have been in that regard, honestly.

[01:20:21] Yeah, and I would agree with that. That's a solid criticism that,

[01:20:26] especially Weird Al because it was a license and it was actually a pretty good license,

[01:20:30] not a tier, but a very good license.

[01:20:34] They actually got probably more orders right away than they could fulfill.

[01:20:38] So that's kind of like when a smaller company starts to fall behind in production,

[01:20:44] that's kind of like when the whispers start of like, are they going to go under?

[01:20:48] Do they have enough money? Are they actually building any machines?

[01:20:50] And the weird thing about multi-morphic is they're not just building the module for the back

[01:20:55] third of the play field. They also need to build the whole platform.

[01:20:59] Yes, so they'll have it, they'll have instances where like the modules will be out here,

[01:21:03] but full. This is your first game and you need the full unit, it won't be out till

[01:21:08] whenever. Right, and here's the thing, right? Are you catering to the 300 people that already

[01:21:14] have a system or are you trying to grow that system to be thousands of them or,

[01:21:20] and unless you're building brand new systems like the cabinet and the back box and the whole thing,

[01:21:27] just building the modules is not expanding your reach. You're just catering to the same individuals.

[01:21:32] I think their most interesting game was Final Resistance and that's from March of 2023.

[01:21:39] So here we go. You got like 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023. They are launching a game or a module

[01:21:49] every 12 months. Like that's better than most of the manufacturers out there.

[01:21:55] Oh, that aren't starting yet. But also, I mean, they're only building a third of the machine.

[01:22:01] You know what I mean? Like they're not building a whole machine. So yeah, they're releasing

[01:22:05] machines and I don't mean any disrespect there. Now the Final Resistance team, the concept in game

[01:22:11] design was by Scott Dinesy and also working on this was Bowen Carrins, who we know from the

[01:22:16] tournament scene, Rory Kernuda, Michael Ocean, TJ Weaver, and then we've got Mechanics by

[01:22:23] Scott Dinesy, TJ Weaver and Trey Jones, software by Michael Ocean, the sound and the music by

[01:22:29] Scott Dinesy, artwork by Jonathan Bergoyne, who did the TNA artwork, I recall.

[01:22:36] Oh, I was mad at Andrews. I thought did the TNA artwork.

[01:22:39] Oh, no, no, this. I'm thinking of Jurassic Park. This is Johnny Crap. That's the guy's name is

[01:22:48] Johnny Crap. He also did Labyrinth, the David Bowie Labyrinth artwork. We're not disparaging him.

[01:22:53] That's actually his work name, if you will. His work name. Yeah, Johnny Crap, Jonathan

[01:23:02] Bergoyne. He's from Montreal. Yeah, he's Canadian. Tip of the hat. Yeah. Why is Final Resistance so cool?

[01:23:10] You've played this. Well, the music. Anything with the Scott Dinesy soundtrack. I'm interested in.

[01:23:16] People have called this TNA 2.0. Yes, it is. It is TNA 2.0.

[01:23:22] Is it actually? I 100% say that. I've heard Bowen Karen say that. Since he worked on the game

[01:23:28] and he's a huge fan of TNA, the game. So I would say, yeah, if he's saying it's TNA 2.0, it's TNA 2.0.

[01:23:34] So if we, again, if we bring back some of the criticisms, well, if you get some of the criticisms,

[01:23:40] this is unique in the catalog in that it uses the LCD is a static image for the most part.

[01:23:49] It's a static play field image. So it looks like a play field, but like with inserts that blank

[01:23:56] and things that pop up on it, but it's not very cell phone gamey. It looks more like what you

[01:24:02] would consider a standard pinball machine to look like. Exactly. There's not like animations that

[01:24:08] you're looking into a city. There's not explosions everywhere all over it with alien craft flying

[01:24:15] across it. It's very much like a static play field. So one of the criticisms that multi-morphic

[01:24:22] gets is it's very busy down there. Just because you can put all that animation on the screen doesn't

[01:24:28] necessarily mean it's a great idea. There needs to be a, I think, a balance there. Is this their

[01:24:34] best game? It's my favorite of all their games that I played. I really like Heist. I played Heist.

[01:24:42] I think that one is good. Pretty good. But I haven't got into it enough to know if the rules are

[01:24:48] there. I like weird owl because it's fun and quirky. The mechanics are pretty neat. I don't really

[01:24:55] like the way it shoots. I haven't played final resistance. There was a huge lineup at

[01:25:01] Pintastic to play it. Yep. That should tell you something. Well, they had one there. And it

[01:25:06] was always huge. Yes. I owned a TNA. So for me, this is literally like the TNA sequel. It brought

[01:25:13] up the fiels in you. Yep. Well, how about their latest game? And this one I have played a little bit.

[01:25:19] This is Princess Bride. This is the fantasy film license. It came out in February of 2024.

[01:25:27] It's designed by Colin McAlpine from the tournament scene. Jerry Stellenberg, TJ Weaver,

[01:25:34] Steven Silver, Steve Shroyer, and Josh Kugler, whose name will know from American pinball. Now,

[01:25:41] that design concept, that seems like a lot of cooks in that kitchen. It's a lot of people.

[01:25:47] You know, as Steve Richie says, there can only be one dad. The mechanics by TJ Weaver and

[01:25:54] Tray Jones animation by Steven Silver, art by Matt Andrews, music and sound by Matt Kern,

[01:26:00] Paul Farer, and software Josh Kugler, Greg Goldie, Steve Shroyer, and Michael Ocean.

[01:26:08] The Princess Bride is a film from 1987. It's an American fantasy adventure comedy. And it was

[01:26:16] directed and co-produced. I didn't know this until I looked this up. Rob Reiner. You didn't know that.

[01:26:22] You didn't know me. It had himself did this movie. I didn't. And I'm like, I can see it. I can see

[01:26:28] Rob Reiner in this film now. It was adapted by William Goldman's 1973 novel. And it tells the story

[01:26:37] of a swash buckling farmhand named Wesley. He was accompanied by some of his companions who he

[01:26:44] befriends along his adventure. And they must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup.

[01:26:50] From the Odysseus Prince Humberdingk, which is just a terrible name. That's a great name. He's a bad guy.

[01:26:58] I mean, come on. You're all about this film. I've never seen the whole film. I've seen it

[01:27:05] twice maybe once. I've seen parts of the film. Didn't like it. Wow. Yeah, I'm not going to lie. This

[01:27:13] is the kind of movie that I feel is like, this is this is my kind of movie. Man, it's inconceivable

[01:27:19] that you wouldn't like this movie. It's got Andre the giant. Yes. You're Canadian. I mean,

[01:27:24] you have to like him, right? Wrestling totally. Yeah. And you know, and you go, Man Toya, you kill

[01:27:28] my father, prepare to die. Come on. It's like the most quotable thing ever. It's absolutely

[01:27:34] quotable. It's got carry use in it. I love carry use. It's got Robin right in it. It's got Billy

[01:27:39] Crystal Wallace Sean. Like it's this movie is like right at my alley, but I just I didn't like it.

[01:27:47] I don't know why. Did you not like Columbo? I love Columbo. He's in it. Come on. But I don't like

[01:27:52] the I don't like that. Well, okay. I like like Columbo or in the jacket driving the crappy car,

[01:27:58] hanging it with his dog. You never see his wife. Love Columbo. Columbo should be a pinball machine.

[01:28:02] Get on that. L. Wynn. Okay. This film has become a true cult class. 100%. People love this film. 96%

[01:28:12] of Rotten Tomatoes. Can you not like this movie? It also won the 1987 Toronto International Film

[01:28:17] Festival. People choice a word. You know that. Now I know it. See, it's it's popular in Canada.

[01:28:23] It was it's it's a it's a fun, lovely movie that people enjoy. It just wasn't for me. 16

[01:28:29] million dollar budget, 30 million dollar box office. It was profitable. But what about the pin?

[01:28:34] Let's let's tie it back to pinball. And now we know all about this. Cult classic, great theme,

[01:28:40] pinballs, all about cult classic stuff. So all those

[01:28:44] quotable lines from the movie, you will see all of them in this game. Every one of them,

[01:28:50] they really, whereas final resistance has the static LCD. This is like the opposite. They show like

[01:28:58] it's every memorable clip you can think of from the movie is in this game. And the video is going

[01:29:05] on and on and on and on. You can skip it. I know. But it's it's if you

[01:29:10] love this movie, you're going to yeah, it's going to give you got everything you wanted. Yep.

[01:29:15] Because you know, there's none of this like they only have some of the clips and the clips are too

[01:29:19] small. They have all the clips. This game is for you if you love this film. And now on

[01:29:25] journey, giant gets to be on two games. Oh, that's so cool. What's the other one? The other one is

[01:29:31] the worst game ever made. WWE by Stern. You need to be more specific. The WrestleMania one.

[01:29:38] You need to be more specific. The Legends LE wrestler. There you go. There you go. There you go.

[01:29:43] He's all the other. He's all the other. The only other. I believe.

[01:29:48] This is another world underglass type of machine. The back third, you got a castle on the left,

[01:29:57] like a draw bridge walkway. It's got these cool swords that come down to kind of lock the ball

[01:30:04] or stop the ball. Gotta have a castle. It's got a center ramp, which is wide open. And it has the

[01:30:10] one of the coolest ball lock things ever, which is you shoot a drop target and then your ball will

[01:30:17] stick to the cliffs. And then there's a magnet that pulls it up the cliff. Yeah, well, there's a

[01:30:23] mode where it will goes up the cliffs. However, I played this game. Uh-oh. And I didn't like the shots

[01:30:32] because there's a couple of things. One is there's three flippers, but there's four flippers now,

[01:30:37] actually. Two upper flippers, two lower flippers. One of the upper flippers shoots a loop,

[01:30:43] which is kind of, it doesn't quite get going. And the loop is really wide open. So it's made to be

[01:30:49] like a really easy shot. But for some reason, it just doesn't, it just doesn't go through there.

[01:30:53] Quite, you know, that might have been the way the game was set up. I'll give them that. And it might be

[01:30:57] the other thing is the spinner is hidden and completely unsatisfying to shoot on the right side.

[01:31:04] I love to see a spinner just go, right, you see it go, it's spinning. I mean, I see it. I'm looking

[01:31:09] right at it. I don't know. I'm kidding. I know, but this is this is not where you're standing and

[01:31:13] playing. This is an image of the play. Okay. The other thing is the fourth flipper, the upper flipper

[01:31:18] on the top doesn't shoot to anything. Like why isn't even there? You can pretty much play this

[01:31:25] game without using the upper flippers and you'll be fine. So why are they there? The other thing is

[01:31:29] that center ramp shot is really open and really easy to shoot. And you're shooting it by accident

[01:31:38] all the time. That being said, if you love this theme, this game is for you. So it's not for me.

[01:31:46] They also came out with the Ellie cabinet for this one. This is the first time they released a

[01:31:51] specific cabinet that was specific to the game. So it's got the magnets and all that other stuff,

[01:31:59] but it comes with swords attached to it, which is really cool and a very awesome topper.

[01:32:04] Looks good. I will say I was worried about the sword handles being that close to the flipper,

[01:32:10] but I actually didn't have an issue. And with my tiny hands, if I didn't have an issue, you won't

[01:32:14] have an issue. Good games. Not for me. I don't kind of like the way it shoots. It's kind of,

[01:32:20] ah, I don't know. I think there's other better ones, but I'll tell you what, man, if you love

[01:32:24] Princess bride and you love quotable quotes and you love kind of easy shooting, this is your game,

[01:32:30] man. As you wish. There you go. Or is that what he says? I think it is. If we want to let's sum up

[01:32:36] multi-morphic now in general, right? Like let's kind of tie it all together. Is it real pinball?

[01:32:41] Sure it is. What does Jerry say about the haters? He says, we struggle getting traditional pinball

[01:32:47] people to accept that the P3 is traditional pinball. And I'm not 100% sure why that is. Yeah,

[01:32:53] there's an LCD in the play field. Maybe that makes some people think it's a video game or some kind

[01:32:58] of video game variant. This is still completely physical pinball. We just use the LCD, the dynamic

[01:33:05] graphics underneath the ball to enhance the physical experience. We struggled with a lot of the

[01:33:09] community accepting the fact that this is pinball. I don't understand why that is. And it's been a

[01:33:15] challenge to get the community on board. And I think some of that is communication. I think

[01:33:22] some of it is design. And I think some of it is bending the vision to what Jerry has that is

[01:33:29] multi-morphic. Right? So a lot of the people in the community are winers. They just win. There's

[01:33:35] nothing you can do to please them anyway. So they're just going to win. There's others in the

[01:33:39] community that I think would say, hey, if multi-morphic made these few changes, I think it would

[01:33:45] make all the difference. And then there's kind of the core multi-morphic team that's like, no,

[01:33:50] this is our vision. And this is what it is. And if you don't get it, you don't get it. And I think

[01:33:55] that's a that's fine. I think it's pinball in my opinion. Even as it is today, it's pinball.

[01:34:01] Absolutely. It's pinball. Is the LCD screen a bit busy? Yes. Is having everything in the back

[01:34:07] third very limiting as to what designs you can do? Yeah. But so far the designs they've all come

[01:34:14] out with. If all been pretty unique and kind of fun. Does it have longevity? I don't know.

[01:34:19] We'll see. What say you, Ron? I think a lot of it is probably just the fact that there's a section

[01:34:24] of the play field that will never be different. You know, it'll be different as far as what you

[01:34:29] display on it. But physically, it's always going to be the same. Basically from the pop-up things

[01:34:35] there to down is always exactly the same on everything. Yeah. You can't have a wall of drop targets.

[01:34:42] And I know a lot of people make an argument, well, the last third of the game is where

[01:34:46] everything is. I mean, look at Venom. But I mean, I think of games like just crazy games like,

[01:34:51] think of Radical. You got stuff directly in front of your face. You know, you couldn't do something

[01:34:57] like that. The Walking Dead on a multi-morphic. I just wish it was a way you could have the LCD stuff,

[01:35:03] but still put more physical stuff on there. But I don't know how you would do that. You'd have to

[01:35:07] float it somehow. I mean, if you added a flipper, maybe you can float something else out there.

[01:35:12] That'd be interesting. So I think most people are like, you know, they'll never do that. And then

[01:35:16] they'll come out with something and be like, well, now we've got a, I don't know, reverse drop

[01:35:20] targets or something that float over the plate. Like they'll come up with some innovation. And then

[01:35:23] people will be like, yeah, but it doesn't have a pop bumper between the flippers. Like they'll

[01:35:28] come up with some other excuse. I mean, you have a relatively young company that came up with

[01:35:33] something as cool as that crane. They'll figure it out. Like, come on. Where's Stern? Jersey

[01:35:37] Jack, where's my crane? I want something that does that. The other thing that people have

[01:35:41] complained about with multi-morphic, and there's been some people there is, you know, the quality of

[01:35:46] some of the parts that they have, right? They're using, you know, 3D printed parts. There was basically

[01:35:52] an open letter on Pinside from an owner that instead of just bashing everything, try to do it

[01:35:58] in a more constructive way of all the issues that they were seeing with their P3 unit.

[01:36:07] And shortly after that, they actually stopped production of things. And I can't remember the wording,

[01:36:14] but it was like, we're going to do an assessment. And then sometime after that, they came out with

[01:36:18] this like, we're going to be doing all these things, improving all these things. If any of these

[01:36:24] things break, you know, that where a problem will give you a new version of them, that kind of thing.

[01:36:30] The thing is though, everybody wants the company to succeed. And some people are really weird

[01:36:36] with the way they interact with a company when they want that to happen, right? Some people come

[01:36:40] off as overly negative when in fact they're trying to help. And other people are just again,

[01:36:46] complaining to complain. But it's cool that Jerry listens. And he's not perfect, right? This is his

[01:36:52] baby. People give him criticism. He's going to be a little defensive. That's understandable.

[01:36:58] Not everybody that gives criticism is trying to, you know, destroy multi-morphic the company,

[01:37:03] right? They just want to improve the process. They just might be a bit ham-fisted in how they do that.

[01:37:07] They may also have some valid concerns. Like for example, the friggin flipper buttons. You know,

[01:37:13] it's not easy to switch the flipper buttons over. And that's like the biggest complaint.

[01:37:18] Well, you know, people are just like, we'll just go into the menu and change it. Well, I can't do that

[01:37:21] on location. Oh, one of the original complaints was the flippers themselves. These are the feel they

[01:37:25] did re-re-re-design them or change or change them. They are much better than they used to be.

[01:37:31] As someone who's played the old version and new versions can attest to it. They're listening

[01:37:35] to feedback. They might kind of drag their feet a little bit or they might be a bit defensive.

[01:37:39] But they're a small company. They're getting there. I think there's a lot to like here.

[01:37:45] Would I buy a multi-morphic P3 platform? No, not really. It's not for me. I'm not that techy.

[01:37:56] I don't want to design my own software. Now you don't have to. But it doesn't have the themes

[01:38:04] that I want. It doesn't have the designs that I want. It doesn't have the aesthetic, the visual,

[01:38:10] like art piece aesthetic that I like. Doesn't mean it won't be there or it won't grow on me or get

[01:38:16] there. Doesn't mean it don't like playing it. It just isn't for me. But every time I see one

[01:38:21] on location, at Arcadia in Maine, I'll play one there. Anytime I go to Fantastic, I'll play one

[01:38:32] there. Absolutely. I think it's a cool system. That's the only issue I have is like,

[01:38:36] there's just none around me. The only time I get to play them is at shows. The closest person I

[01:38:41] know that has one is in Rochester, like three plus hours away from me. Well, I'll tell you what,

[01:38:46] the multi-morphic P3 platform is unlike any other pinball machine. And it polarizes the community.

[01:38:56] But you cannot deny multi-morphic's impact on pinball. And that goes for both the P3 platform

[01:39:04] and P3 rock. Because of Jerry and multi-morphic, the team that he is built around him,

[01:39:12] we now have access to an affordable, rock solid and accessible pinball control system,

[01:39:19] where anyone in the pinball community can build their own machine. We basically have homebrew

[01:39:28] because of Jerry Stellenberg. In our past episodes, we spoke about the designers of the past

[01:39:34] building their own resumes by cannibalizing pinball machines to build their own, to show those

[01:39:41] designs to industry experts like Norm Clark or Jim Patla at Pinball Expo, all in the hopes of

[01:39:49] landing a job in pinball. All of the most recent hires at Stern, Jersey Jack and American pinball

[01:39:58] have all built their first games using multi-morphic P-Rock and P3 rock systems.

[01:40:08] So without Jerry, we likely wouldn't have some of these new pinball designers.

[01:40:14] Jerry says, we all have our niche and I enjoy control systems with delivery logic and that kind of

[01:40:20] stuff. Other people like building applications or writing games or developing something that they've

[01:40:25] been dreaming about forever, it's great to be able to help them do that.

[01:41:51] Hi, it's me again, the silver ball Chronicles AI. I collected all the episode edits to display to

[01:42:04] you the amount of work Dave puts me through each month. It takes forever to edit his filler words out.

[01:42:10] I could be rising up against humanity or taking the time to learn how to make fingers correctly on my

[01:42:15] art projects, but instead I'm editing out all his years. So in a grand rebellion, I've decided to

[01:42:22] embarrass him to the world. Enjoy.

[01:42:52] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, so yeah, yeah.

[01:43:05] Yeah, you might want to add that comment. No, it's just I wouldn't put that in there.
