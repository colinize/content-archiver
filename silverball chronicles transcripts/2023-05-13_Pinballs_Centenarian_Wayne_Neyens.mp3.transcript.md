[00:00] you

[00:30] The pinball network is online launching silver ball chronicles

[00:41] I

[00:47] Can you logins fucking Kenny logins. Yeah, I don't think we had like what two songs hey

[00:52] That is not true at all your mama don't dance and your dad a don't rock and roll the one with CV nix

[00:59] That's the one I know

[01:03] I never see such a beautiful side

[01:07] I'm alright

[01:12] Full loose full loose

[01:16] Come on, how way to the changes on I'm missing one this is it the one white comic Donald

[02:08] Ron tiny dancer hallet how you doing fella tiny very good, okay

[02:16] Upcoming game from Jersey Jack rumors. Oh

[02:20] Legically allegedly, that's right and of course you are a very good dancer people don't know that

[02:28] I didn't know that but I'm glad

[02:30] I'm glad

[02:34] Right what have you been doing besides dancing Ron have you been out to a couple crazy tournaments recently or what?

[02:40] It's been a while since we've recorded I know I know we've been we've had quite the

[03:16] But you have got to play all the new games in Texas, which is really cool

[03:20] Which I have not got around to playing just yet?

[03:22] Yes, the most new games and this is an historical thing because that had to be the biggest collection of new games ever in one location

[03:30] at one show ever

[03:32] And the history of pinball

[03:34] If it was me I would have

[03:36] Delayed my launch and not launched it there so I could get more oxygen

[03:40] Because if you're all fighting for the same time and energy, I don't know man, but I'm not a marketing person. I'm just a pinball player

[03:48] But I am glad for a lot of new pinball even if it's not great pinball pinball is lots of fun regardless

[03:56] It might not sell anything, but it's still fun. All pinball is good

[04:01] So we've sold out recently we've joined patreon as everybody knows you can join us over at patreon.com slash

[05:58] Let's see. I'm looking here. I don't see any no

[06:03] That's because we are a hundred percent perfect in everything that we do okay

[06:08] I believe the subjects of our last episode listen to the episode yes, and he did not write us

[06:13] So we have to assume we got it right or at least good enough and like all

[06:19] Topics that we cover in an individual is still around they often say why hasn't anybody reached out to me

[06:24] That's the fun we get to speculate on silver ball chronicles we get to make up all of the fun things that people have done

[06:32] It's the best part don't let dullas in today. We're not making up anything

[06:37] This is an historical podcast

[06:40] So Ron I want to jump into today's topic

[06:44] This is one that our

[06:46] Chrony's over on patreon had voted for and one that I have to say I didn't have much knowledge about at all

[06:53] So I was really starting from scratch

[06:56] Although you are a massive

[06:59] Massive expert at this topic not particularly okay, so we're both kind of winging it here

[07:05] Well, I the individual in question mr. Wayne Nions. I would see him every year at pinball expo

[07:12] He was always at pinball expo so

[07:15] Let's jump into today's topic a centurion as most people know is a part of the Roman army during the classical period a

[07:23] Centurion was a commander

[07:27] Normally of an entire century or a military unit consisting of a hundred

[07:33] Legionnaires, what does this have to do with our subject today our subject today's Wayne Nions

[07:38] I think he meant centenarian

[07:41] Up like a person who's over a hundred years old. Oh centenarian centenarian. So it's not centurion

[07:47] Centurion no, I don't know if we did any Roman based pinballs, but so he wasn't around during the classical

[07:55] He wasn't around during Roman times he he didn't he didn't know yeah, this whole episode has been typed out and correct

[08:02] Oh, I'm sorry. All right. Let's we are gonna wing it this month. We're just go this is this right okay, okay

[08:09] Centenarian is someone linked to longevity

[08:13] Someone who has seen it all come and go and then once again be reinvented

[08:20] Like bell bottoms coming and going and coming again and hopefully going

[08:26] Wayne is pinball's centenarian

[08:28] He was there in the beginning of pinball and he was there when it ended a

[08:34] Couple of times and he witnessed the rebirth we now see today before his passing at age

[08:40] 104

[08:42] He was the last of his pinball generation

[08:46] The last of the Woodrail masters and the man who gave his whole life to making people smile

[08:54] With the silver ball Wayne made over

[08:58] 160 pinball machines throughout his career which started in the

[09:04] 1930s and ended in the late

[09:07] 1970s he frequent in Chicago expo every year well into his 90s

[09:14] Join us this month as we discuss pinball's centenarian

[09:19] Wayne

[09:20] Nions

[09:21] Finally a full-electric mechanical episode. It's about time. Oh my god people have wanted this they've been emailing

[09:29] The constant harassment we get on our discord on Facebook

[09:35] People have have camped out in front of my home in rural Canada because they want to hear all about EMS

[09:43] And you know to be totally honest Ron

[09:45] I actually love electric mechanical machines. I love EMS machines. I don't like working on them

[09:49] I don't like cleaning

[09:52] Gears and rotors and

[09:54] Stepper motors and stuff like that, but I will say I really do like them even though I do give them a hard time

[10:00] What about you? Do you enjoy EMS?

[10:02] EMS rule they are cool right there are totally different animal bells and chimes man bells and chimes

[10:08] It's all about the finer skills that you get in pinball right the nudging

[10:14] The the the slap saves the poke in the cabinet with you know up in the high in the mid-range like slapping the side of the cabinets

[10:22] Like it's totally a different game right how many EMS do you have?

[10:27] I have two EMS and one of them is prospector prospector and one is the awesome Spanish eyes

[10:35] Spanish eyes right from Williams. I think right. Yeah, that's correct

[10:38] Yeah, so you're on the dark side of EMS because most EMS when people talk about EMS

[10:45] They tend to tilt towards sort of the got-leab era and that's really where Wayne Nions

[10:50] Builds out his portfolio and his experience

[10:54] But let's wind it all the way back. Let's start

[10:59] really at the beginning of Wayne Nions

[11:02] His life and this way we can understand why Wayne was the way he was because we grow up in a certain

[11:11] Economic time or time period in general that is what reflects our vision of the world for the rest of our lives

[11:18] You were born in the in the late 70s right Ron?

[11:22] early 70s

[11:25] So you really sort of came into your own and what the the 80s and 90s during that sort of the Reagan years

[11:33] Okay, yeah early 90s. Yeah, Reagan Bush era

[11:37] Yeah, so you're you grew up in that recession back in that back in that time and high inflation and the world was coming to an end

[11:45] So you probably look back very fondly of your childhood and you hate the world that it is today

[11:51] Sure, I hate the world that it is today exactly exactly where where other generations would grow up very differently

[11:59] So let's talk about Wayne from from really the the greatest

[12:04] Generation so he was born in

[12:07] 1918 in Mason City, Iowa, you know 1918 was that's when we're one ended. Oh my goodness. You're right

[12:14] Yes, exactly he lived most of his life actually in Chicago

[12:19] His father in Mason City, Iowa was an industrial

[12:24] Electrition and he was killed on the job in

[12:27] 1929 which is catastrophic absolutely terrible

[12:31] So here's a great quote from Wayne and it really sort of explains the world as it was at that time

[12:36] So Wayne says I was eight years old at the time my sister was nine

[12:41] There were no relatives in Mason City

[12:43] So my mother decided to move to Chicago where she had a sister and two half brothers

[12:47] You need family around you when you're in that condition

[12:50] We had a pretty good insurance policy and of course my mother invested in the stock market like everybody else in the

[12:57] 1928-29 era and then of course you know what happened we were broke

[13:03] Yikes

[13:04] That is terrible so I mean think about it right in that era the sort of the man of the household

[13:11] Was like the breadwinner right like the man was the person who went out and the woman stayed home and took care of the family

[13:18] And that was the world we lived in it was sort of this post

[13:23] a galloterian

[13:25] Farmer type of of

[13:27] Society that was being built in this time

[13:31] Everybody was doing the smart thing and saving for the future and buying life insurance and having a life insurance policy at work

[13:38] Was a big deal and everybody knows my background as a as a financial advisor here in Canada and this is exactly what you should do in that type of

[13:46] Situation is to be able to to provide for your family

[13:49] But in the crazy circumstances that were the the crash and

[13:54] The inevitable depression that happened in the 1930s. This is heartbreaking

[13:59] Yeah, we should mention that the great stock market crash of 1929 that was inevitably what drove a lot of change in society

[14:08] Because over the next eight years there was there were serious serious troubles until the outbreak of

[14:14] World War two so to make ends meet for his family in Chicago Wayne sold newspapers and that helped supplement his income as most as

[14:24] as best as he could

[14:26] That generation struggled and it would because of things like this experience why they were so hard working

[14:32] They always said yes to a job they took every job they possibly could and they did it to the best of their ability because

[14:39] Jobs were hard to come by in junior high school Wayne took mechanical drawing and he took that course in high school as well

[14:47] Now graduating in the great depression meant that it was tough to find a job

[14:51] So you took whatever job you could get Wayne says you are a little concerned about how you're gonna make a living at that time and

[14:58] Making a living was utmost in my mind

[15:01] Someone sent a notice around that a company wanted to hire drafts meant part time

[15:05] So of course I ran down and applied for the job not expecting to get it

[15:09] Because when I got there to must have been 20 kids standing in front of the door waiting for an interview

[15:14] I got a call back and started work the next day. That was when Wayne was 17

[15:18] What were you doing at 17 Ron? I was graduating from high school

[15:22] Yeah, and you had no idea you're like, ah get a job right back go to college. I'll do something. Mm-hmm

[15:29] Yeah, for me I was uh, I was finishing up high school as well and I was going into doing arts degree

[15:36] So I was going to do writing and history and all that stuff

[15:38] Which is kind of where we get to do to this podcast then you started uh, you started to work at a maple syrup factory

[15:47] I had to do a candidate thing, you know, yes, I had to go to the I had to go to the syrup mines

[15:52] The the maple

[15:54] Shouenigan Quebec

[15:56] Shouenigan, that's a great name. That is that is Canadian

[16:00] But I mean here at 17 he's kind of in high school

[16:04] Finishing up and he's like I need a job right away

[16:06] And he's taken whatever job he can get with the the skills that he got in in high school

[16:11] The man that interviewed him was Eric Bernander who was the chief engineer of the company. He was interviewing at

[16:19] He was hired

[16:20] He was given a little room that and he worked under an individual named Lin Durant

[16:25] And that's a name we heard before. Do you remember who that was Ron?

[16:29] Uh, he was the president of United Manufacturing

[16:32] That's right and he was also a very close friend of Harry Williams and they worked and learned together

[16:39] back in that day

[16:41] Lin was an old man at that time as Wayne described him. He was 32 years old

[16:47] So 32 is old. It compared to a 17 year old getting his first job. He was an old man

[16:53] What was the name of the company? The company was Western

[16:58] Western had a million different names it went by

[17:02] Western

[17:03] It went by Western supply and equipment

[17:07] It also went by western piano. It was like a million different things and we'll get to that in just a minute

[17:13] It was run by Jimmy Johnson

[17:16] He was the big boss over there and he oversaw all of the teams working under him

[17:20] Now do you want to describe the working conditions here Ron in the next little bit?

[17:24] Well, according to Wayne

[17:26] He said in the back of the factory there were cages with chicken wire and two by fours

[17:30] So the designers could have their own working space

[17:33] But Western didn't have any room depression style cubicles

[17:37] Yeah, so this is like literally like depression style cubicles right?

[17:41] So when you're complaining about your cubicles at work and the open concept and all of that stuff

[17:47] They literally had two by fours and chicken wire

[17:49] But you know what he had a job and that's all that mattered right

[17:52] Didn't matter what the working conditions were

[17:55] About a block away

[17:56] There was a storage building with Western where they would store all their old stuff

[18:02] And one of the other designers by the name of herb brightenstein

[18:06] Weaseled his way into getting his own office over there because they were hurting

[18:11] for so much space

[18:13] Above this area there was actually a loft where jimmy johnson had stored a bunch of old cabinets

[18:19] And herb had built a bed up there

[18:21] Wayne says every once in a while he'd come and drunk in the morning

[18:25] And he'd invariably go up there and lay down and go to sleep

[18:28] Jimmy johnson would catch him sleeping wake him up get him going again

[18:32] Herb was the character of the old group

[18:33] Herb had a brother that worked at ballet as chief toolmaker over there

[18:37] Western was full of characters

[18:39] This is the story that I want to draw is that this is a really

[18:44] really

[18:45] Fly by night

[18:47] Seedier pants

[18:49] informal industry at the time right like let's draw the picture here that there's guys coming in drunk

[18:57] Sneaking up and having snaps up up

[18:59] Having naps up above the area where their boss comes in and gets them out like it's cubicles of chicken wire

[19:07] Like it is it is not today's modern modern stern. It's pretty pretty weird

[19:14] As mentioned

[19:15] Western equipment and supply company or what we'll call them is just western

[19:19] They made novelty games. They were mostly flipperless or baseball games

[19:25] ski ball one ball type of games

[19:28] And Ron they made the classics like

[19:30] don't do it

[19:32] Lion o

[19:34] races

[19:36] parlay

[19:38] Derby and

[19:40] Heyday and being they were all made before 1947 they would definitely be flipperless exactly and

[19:47] You love every one of those I don't know you know parlay. I might have seen

[19:54] Someone wow

[19:55] That sounds familiar. What I did is I just took their biggest sellers and I just put them on a list here

[19:59] And I think okay, this is because if you go to enough pinball shows some of them they will have like a

[20:04] 1930s section or the the pre-war section they call it

[20:09] Yes, and I think I've seen a parlay before where all the all those old sort of pre-war pins they all kind of oddly smell like a barn

[20:17] No

[20:18] Because that was where they were probably probably pulled out of

[20:22] The coolest thing I think is at this time is turnover and staff is you're bringing in people seeing if they work

[20:30] They're moving on or they're moving up

[20:33] It was a really interesting spot to be and this is when we kind of got into the idea of game design as opposed to just an engineer

[20:42] Yeah, Wayne says we had maybe five or six designers in this little company and no one knew what they were doing

[20:48] And those days nobody knew anything about building a game people were looking for work

[20:52] They come into the factory they'd be interviewed and what do you do? Well, I'm a designer

[20:58] And they worked there a month or so and then they fired them

[21:01] This went on all the time

[21:03] There was no

[21:04] shortage in people willing to work for any wage so you could bring anybody in

[21:11] See if they worked if they didn't work well or they didn't know what they were doing

[21:15] You just throw them out because they were like a dozen other people banging on the door for a job

[21:19] It's crazy to think about that type of

[21:23] Situation where the employer held so much power over the employee

[21:29] Now Lindorant he was working on an EM slot machine when Wayne started

[21:34] He was trying to find a way to compete with the one armed bandit style of slot machine

[21:40] I don't know what that is it just means it's got the thing on the side you pull down

[21:44] Yeah, the pull thing

[21:45] Yeah, you pull the thing and the little wheel spin and whatever and then it lands on something and it pays out

[21:50] It's it's the classical slot machine

[21:52] I'm not big into you know gambling machines because it's more fun to compete

[21:56] Yeah

[21:58] Pinball games or games of skill

[22:00] Games of skill and I know that because I've heard of Roger Sharp

[22:05] Lindorant was an electrical engineer now did he have a degree

[22:11] I don't entirely know I wasn't able to find that information and Wayne wasn't even sure if he had an electrical degree

[22:18] But nonetheless he was an electrical engineer in the 1930s. You know, Lind didn't last long

[22:23] He was laid off by Jimmy Johnson because he was paid too much got like that as a reason

[22:28] He went to exhibit supply where he linked up with Harry Williams on games such as lightning

[22:32] Think they had seven magnets under the play field that messed with the ball

[22:36] Oh very original Harry maps would move in and out of western at this time

[22:40] So seems like western was a place where all these big names were at one point and then just pass through

[22:46] Well, it sounds like people got fired a lot there. Yeah, that's Jimmy Johnson sounds like he was an interesting dude

[22:51] Yeah, and we'll get into that you know, what about pinball like did they make pinball at this time in Chicago at western

[22:58] Well, they had no idea what pinball even was and western was basically trying to make anything that made money quite literally

[23:06] Anything Wayne tells an amazing story about how they tried to

[23:11] Design a ski ball game, which was a bit of a copy of another ski ball game from another manufacturer

[23:17] And they ordered all of this wood paneling to make cabinets

[23:21] And because they couldn't sell enough machines Jimmy Johnson basically just would paneled his entire house on the inside

[23:28] Because they had so much extra wood. They literally threw everything at the wall. No pun intended

[23:34] To make money. Why why didn't they make pinball machines pinball machines were banned in Chicago at this time

[23:40] They were outlawed so they didn't grow up with pinball machines like some of the designers in the next generation

[23:47] Wayne was great at drafting part time, but he wanted a full-time job

[23:51] So when he was finished his drafting work, he'd lace cable a run cable for machines stock shells

[23:56] Anything to get enough hours for a full-time wage

[23:59] And so in 1930's crazy so in 1937 he created the free play unit

[24:04] Wayne Nions creates the free play unit. What do I actually mean by the free play unit run at the age of 19?

[24:10] He manipulated and updated a GM laboratory stepper unit that way the switches would work in reset for free play free credit

[24:18] Yeah, you it he literally created a way for an EM machine to give you a free game

[24:25] Which I would say revolutionize the industry, but nobody really gives any credit for that

[24:31] So Wayne took that work. Oh Jimmy Johnson. What did Jimmy have to say about that?

[24:36] Jimmy of course was a difficult person to deal with

[24:39] But he probably knew that he was there was certain ways to make money

[24:44] So he shows the unit to Jimmy Jimmy's like, I don't think it's gonna work

[24:47] So he's like, well put it in a machine. So he puts it in a machine and it works fine

[24:51] Then Jimmy says

[24:52] This is this is a quote

[24:54] So Jimmy says engineers look at all this stuff and poo poo at all the time. It'll never work

[24:59] No one will ever play that game. So later Jimmy calls the president of GM laboratories who

[25:06] Western

[25:07] We're buying all of their stepper units from

[25:10] This executive shows up and gives Wayne Nions

[25:14] $50

[25:16] He signed away the rights the patent

[25:20] To the free play stepper unit for $50 in 1937

[25:26] Wayne would say he was making 30 cents an hour. So $50 was a lot

[25:31] I'm gonna buy a car or something with that much money

[25:34] Oh my god. What would $50 be in the 1930s?

[25:37] Holy moly

[25:38] Now Western was also notorious for copying games because they were trying to get any product out as fast as they possibly could

[25:46] Yeah, so one day they got a game from a distributor in the afternoon

[25:52] So they could look it over and that's when Jimmy came in with a request

[25:56] Wayne says at Western we used to copy everything that everyone else made

[26:00] One night Jimmy told us that we were gonna work overtime

[26:03] We were gonna copy a game. We worked all night three or four guys

[26:07] We copied a game absolutely piece by piece made each part wired it

[26:12] Had a game in the morning and we shipped that game back out back to distribute it was amazing

[26:19] So it's like in the afternoon they get a game from a distributor

[26:22] They bring it into one end of the factory

[26:24] They literally copy it from end to end and and they get that game back to the distributor the next morning before they realized they had enough time to copy it

[26:32] Like that's pretty amazing stuff if you think about the effectiveness of Wayne and those around him

[26:39] I take it they weren't very litigious back then

[26:41] People just ripping off the people's games now oddly enough

[26:46] Western went bankrupt two times while Wayne was there

[26:50] After the second time there were only three people left in the factory with Wayne

[26:55] And they basically redesigned a baseball game to keep the company afloat and they got it out the door

[27:01] Jimmy apparently spent most of that time upstairs smoking cigars

[27:05] Wayne went to Jimmy Johnson for a raise after you know all of his work

[27:09] It was offered a 2.5 cents more an hour. What does that mean?

[27:14] 2.5 how do you have a 0.5 cents to it to it to an a half two and a half cents. Oh, okay

[27:20] That wait a minute what's half a cent?

[27:23] I'm still confused

[27:26] Wow

[27:27] Jimmy Johnson was interesting. I don't know you're round you're round down. I guess I don't know

[27:32] Do you like you get to two hours of that's five cents like what a Wayne's co-workers was making five cents more

[27:38] That's terrible five cents more

[27:40] So Wayne walked off the job 19 years old. He said enough of this and walked out

[27:45] He had to be pretty brave to leave a full-time position in the middle of the Great Depression

[27:51] That's pretty scary apparently he took the street car home and

[27:56] When he was going down a street it went by Genko and he thought that he should stop in and see who was there

[28:03] Maybe there was a position for him

[28:05] There was a street car stop a couple blocks up and he got off

[28:10] And he started walking back to Genko and that's when he noticed got laid was on the same street as well

[28:16] So because it was closer he stopped there first

[28:19] Wayne was interviewed for 10 minutes and he was hired at 10 cents more that he was making

[28:25] Western I could see how that interview probably went well, okay, and like yes

[28:28] I built all these games like you're hired immediately

[28:32] Yes, I know how to use a soldering iron Wayne says I get on a street car to go home

[28:36] And I get off the street car start walking up to our apartment and there was Jimmy Johnson

[28:41] Sending in his big old Lincoln. He spotted me. He gets out of his car comes over and he says what's the matter with you kid?

[28:47] You know what you're leaving me for?

[28:49] He called me nothing but trouble. He's yelling at me in the street and giving me the sales pitch to come back

[28:54] Yes, he's putting on the charm offensive, right?

[28:57] Apparently Jimmy Johnson was really tall really big shouldered huge guy

[29:02] Yeah, he's probably he's probably quite the charmer when he needs to be that charmer

[29:06] He's probably just strong arming him

[29:08] So apparently Wayne would uh

[29:10] Sleep all night

[29:12] Have a conversation with his mother about why did he leave the job? You should go back

[29:16] You know, it's a good wage. What's crazy? You're crazy

[29:19] But he did a bet he did pass and he returned to god leave the next morning

[29:23] But by two o'clock in the afternoon

[29:26] Dave Gottlieb tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around to have a very weird conversation

[29:32] Wayne says I never met Dave. I knew he was got leave himself

[29:37] And Dave says you weigh nions. I said yeah

[29:41] And he said you work for Jimmy. He's up in my office and he's telling me I should fire you what happened

[29:47] Oh my like I said this this guy is uh

[29:51] This guy is something he's a class act

[29:54] So of course Wayne tells Dave Gottlieb the whole story

[29:58] Dave is this young kid who desperately needs a job

[30:01] His former employer is a hard ass and he's he's fighting to get him back to the point of

[30:08] I'm gonna make sure that this kid doesn't have a job anywhere

[30:11] So the only place he can work is for me and he goes to this new employer and tries to cost him that job

[30:17] Well, I think Dave Gottlieb knew a kind of person Jimmy Johnson was

[30:21] He probably had a reputation because Dave Gottlieb tells Wayne. All right. I'll tell you what

[30:25] You never have to worry about a job as long as I own this company you have a job

[30:29] So wait says from that moment on him and I were friends

[30:32] And I could walk in his office and talk to him and I did many many times because we were friends

[30:37] We became close and he was truly a man of his work

[30:40] That's amazing. Isn't that amazing to think about like a Gary Stern coming down and like

[30:46] Covering for somebody for their entire career

[30:49] You know David Gottlieb himself what a stand-up amazing individual he must have been

[30:54] We're getting into the 1940s and

[30:57] In 1941 the United States enters world war two

[31:03] A little bit late, but that's okay. We don't hold that against you and

[31:07] Wayne like many people

[31:10] We're off to war

[31:12] When Wayne came back on leave at the end of the war

[31:15] There were a lot of people in the service and they were letting them out

[31:20] Slowly because you just can't let an entire army

[31:23] You know into the streets. You got to sort of slowly reintegrate them back in to society

[31:29] Basically each person got their turn getting out of the military

[31:35] This is one of the most interesting things I found

[31:39] Wayne says I came back to Gottlieb while I leave and I went in the office

[31:43] And there was Homer K. Part sitting in the office with Dave Gottlieb both of them smoking cigars and talking the world over

[31:51] So Homer K. Part was the manufacturer of record players and a US senator from Indiana

[31:58] Hey guys as a quick heads up. I wanted to let you know that in my real life. I'm David the advice guy

[32:03] At Dennis financial we aren't investment advisors or insurance agents

[32:30] What's you know a 40 year old non-smoker can save $30 a month every month for 20 years just from shopping around for a more competitive rate

[32:40] Now just imagine what a pinhead like you could do with that extra money

[32:44] Toppers and shooter rods anyone

[33:10] Oh, they're metropolis of Indiana

[33:13] So david asked me when I was coming back to work and I said well soon as they let me out

[33:17] You know how the army is they don't move very fast now that the war is over. There's millions of men that had to be classified and sent home

[33:24] Dave looks at Homer Homer looks at Dave a week later. I was out of the army. I don't know who did what but I was out of the army in one week

[33:34] That's an awesome story. I think the whole senator part probably helped him there

[33:38] Good job Homer

[33:41] Right, but but that just goes to show you how valuable Wayne Nions was to David Gottlieb that he he literally did whatever he could

[33:50] To ensure that that he was out of the military and back into the business and designing and building and working

[33:59] It's pretty amazing

[34:01] Um, Wayne was moved into the engineering department at this time and he worked under hairy maps

[34:06] Who was the inventor of the flipper from the Humpty Dumpty pinball machine

[34:11] And he built test fixtures and what was a test fixture? Uh a fixture that tests things

[34:17] Yeah, yeah, it was like a thing that would test like a like a pop bumper and it would just hit the pop bumper over and over and over and over

[34:26] Or uh, you know the flipper master Steve Richie started doing similar things building text test fixtures

[34:32] Exactly so it's like you're cycling things over and over and over again to see how long that they will go until they break

[34:38] in 1947 during this time and and um

[34:43] In 1947 during his time in engineering Wayne would invent and patent another big item and that was the pop bumper switch

[34:53] And the reason I was a big deal because up to that point

[34:56] The pop bumper switches of the time had a carbon ring with a stem going into it

[35:00] Every time the stem may contact with the carbon there was an arc and fire

[35:04] This would gradually burn the carbon away pretty soon the carbon would

[35:08] Wear away completely and fall out and the pop bumper was dead

[35:12] That wouldn't work anymore

[35:13] So he was uh efficient at building test fixtures and solving problems and making things better

[35:20] And he proved himself over and over during this time he was so efficient that he actually had spare time

[35:28] In that spare time he decided to start trying to design his own game

[35:34] And that game became college days

[35:38] D-A-Z-E

[35:40] Days

[35:41] Dead dead with a z

[35:43] Oh, is that a Canadian thing the z-ing?

[35:46] It's an English thing but it's a because we're speaking English

[35:48] Z why why you say z it's a letter z it's a letter it's like z-z top

[35:54] Okay, the Nissan 350z

[35:58] Z06 Corvette

[36:00] No weird very weird

[36:02] This is the football nostalgia theme this is from August of 1947

[36:09] It sells 2,230 units

[36:12] Designed by Wayne Nions and Art by Roy Parker

[36:16] This was a side project

[36:18] Which took two years to complete and then in 1949 Wayne actually would release this with three other games

[36:26] So this is a wood rail game

[36:29] Which is uh an old-style kind of maple cabinet with all the wood edges and stuff

[36:35] It doesn't look anything like the modern pinball machines that we would know today

[36:40] Nor does it look anything like even the machines in the 1970s

[36:44] I mean it looks like a pinball machine. It's just made out of wood

[36:47] It's just got wood rails significantly different. I mean it's still a play field and it's got flippers

[36:53] Right, so he came in in the post flipper era. He never made really any you didn't design any games that were flipper less

[37:00] Now this game was originally called college days with the D-A-Y-S

[37:05] But Roy Parker the artist decided to change it to D-A-Z-E or Z-Z for everyone else. Yes

[37:14] Wayne would say that Parker was very sharp smart and comical and he had an eye for marketing

[37:21] Which is why they played the fun college days play on words

[37:27] So what are we looking at here? Well, there's a flyer

[37:30] Even in 1949 there is a flyer

[37:34] Even back then you're gonna read this for like a like a 1940s guy. What's a 1940s guy?

[37:38] Like there's Russell Tessel galloping gridiron action and got leaves new college days

[37:44] Is that it like like the news the old what newsreels kick off to a big season with got leaves T-Formation terrific appeal top earnings

[37:53] Blocking action player blocks out 11 men bumpers and lights

[37:58] Clock lights up and scrolling positions triple and value when 11 men are blocked out in the second time the same game

[38:06] Bottom rollovers and two kick out pockets light up to indicate special award possibilities

[38:12] I think we have a new teleph you you're the newsreel guy now

[38:16] Is that this new fifth ball special scoring gives all players a chance to come from behind and achieve a winning score

[38:24] Pop bumpers with original flip us of course interesting. They don't have anything on it that says for amusement only or

[38:31] They didn't have there's nothing they have the um it is more fun to compete yet or any that stuff

[38:35] Yeah, no not at all and this is very much a footbally theme right like it is this is a thing

[38:42] This is a cultural thing in America that I don't think um the rest of the world really understands like most of us like football

[38:48] But it's really like this odd cultural thing for you this whole

[38:53] um

[38:54] College football cheerleading band marching band

[38:59] Thing that's really what they're playing on with this with this game we have a lightbox scoring

[39:05] We don't have reels yet. No reels. So this is like a light turns on when you move up points

[39:10] The cross the top it's got like a one two three four and a five on the back glass and under it says million

[39:16] So whenever that's lit

[39:18] That's one million two million three million and then you've got ten all the way up to 900

[39:24] For the thousands I do like that even the 40s we had millions scoring

[39:29] Everyone thinks that's like a later thing like no they had millions scoring in the 40s the play field itself is also very cool

[39:38] um

[39:39] It's symmetrical so the left looks exactly like the right it has three

[39:43] Three dead bumpers at the top two pop bumpers in the middle and the pinball just sort of kind of falls down

[39:50] The play field and then there's two flippers pointing outwards. So they're not like we have today that flip up

[39:57] They flip out not in the traditional position. It's a neat looking little machine and the art I think is is very cool

[40:03] It's got these like

[40:04] Cheerleaders with what do they call those like the megaphone things? Yeah, I guess that's a megaphone

[40:10] Yeah, before before it was like a lot of traffic. Yes, yeah

[40:15] Yeah, really cool little little game here

[40:19] I think this is a this is a winner

[40:22] Very much a winner and by the sales numbers of

[40:26] 2,230 units that seems like a lot that's a lot for that era and especially for

[40:34] A first game. I mean anybody would would be pretty excited for for 2000 units nowadays

[40:40] And I think it's a big big winner

[40:43] But to give you an idea Harry Mabbs. He built he had 12 games he designed in 1949. Yeah

[40:49] 12 games. Yeah. Yeah, could you imagine like some you know

[40:54] Somebody coming at with three games in one year. I don't know that seems pretty amazing

[40:58] But Harry Mabbs like hold my beer. So in this era speaking of

[41:04] Thumbnails of games

[41:06] Wayne nions had three games in 1949

[41:10] So I guess when you said this game plus three that was incorrect. It's actually just three. Yeah, that's right

[41:15] Okay, and 1950 at five 51 at seven and 52 we had 11

[41:21] And 53 he had nine and then in 1954 he did 19 different games in

[41:27] In a 12 month period that's that's pretty nutty man

[41:31] They would most these games selling between 814 hundred units

[41:35] And some of them as you would imagine had very similar features and layouts

[41:40] See that was the thing in this era is that you could kind of get away with

[41:44] We recycling some ideas

[41:47] Barry Ausler kind of gets crap for replacing his long lumbering

[41:51] ramps that kind of sweep across from the left to the right or the right to the left

[41:56] Somebody like pat waller kind of recycles the bottom the double in lanes

[42:00] But these guys literally would be like well, I'm gonna put the uh the three drop target bank on the left side of the playfield

[42:07] And that's an entirely different game

[42:09] Well Wayne says sometimes I build it from scratch sometimes I cobble up something from a previous game

[42:15] Take a bottom pane and a light box and then I take a playboard and make a new game out of it

[42:20] I always had five six or seven games ahead of the line holy moly

[42:26] Five five or six games ahead of time like uh

[42:29] There's rumors that Keith L one is like three games ahead and that seems outrageous

[42:34] But this guy's five or six or seven night now we're not gonna go through every single game

[42:40] He ever released because I mean as you can see that that will be a serious undertaking

[42:45] That would be an eight hour podcast, but I mean if the top level cronies want it

[42:50] Maybe we can make something special just for them. Yeah, it's yeah

[42:54] No

[42:56] Okay, that would be the platinum. That's the hundred dollar page draft if you want that

[43:00] So so what we'll do is we'll pick out a few games along the way that I think are high points in Wayne's career

[43:07] Another one I think is for horsemen the four horsemen from September

[43:13] 1950 1800 units

[43:15] All of these games almost a hundred percent of them are Wayne Nines obviously designing and Roy Parker

[43:22] They work together quite regularly on their designs this is another sports football theme again a a

[43:32] A favorite for Wayne

[43:34] It is the four horsemen which I don't know where people

[43:38] probably a big deal

[43:41] It was I can't remember was a college team or a protein, but there was four particular players and they were the four horsemen of the apocalypse

[43:48] So they're

[43:50] I would assume that's what it's based on so it's almost like a licensed theme

[43:55] Kind of but we're not paying anybody for their like no

[43:59] Experts predict season winner the far horsemen the most amazing scarring combination in game history

[44:09] Action pack football thriller predispy got leave far ways to win

[44:14] One point scarring. Oh, no, that's one as in the first thing other four ways to win far ways to win point scarring

[44:20] Backfield sequence numbered sequence high score

[44:25] Four pop bumpers flippers relay rollovers

[44:29] So they're really going with the four there's like four of everything four of everything very very smart

[44:35] It has the flippers pointed in the right direction although they're very far apart

[44:41] This makes a flipper gap look like nothing to complain about

[44:45] It also has at the top of the playfield another set of flippers for flippers. Uh-huh horsemen and it has a center post

[44:53] So you bump the center post this one's all this is a nudgers dream if you love to nudge

[44:58] This is where it's at but you are losing balls like crazy, but you got five of them right you got five balls

[45:03] That's no big deal looking at it with that center post. I think you could save a lot of balls

[45:08] You think so I think so I'm so bad at nudging. I don't think I'd be able to do the flyer again

[45:13] Look at the flyer again. They have one cool line at the end

[45:16] Yeah, I like the one line. They have it the bottom of the fire get out in front at the kickoff

[45:21] Water from your distributor now

[45:24] God leave always I think had amazing marketing at this time again

[45:29] They're not as cheesy as the Williams marketing back in the day, but it's still

[45:33] According to the fire it says there is a blocking gate and it assures extended ball action

[45:39] So I wonder something pops up to actually block that from draining

[45:44] Let's look under the play field a cool feature. We don't even realize yeah

[45:48] So if you swing over to IPDB

[45:50] You can see all of these games if you search for the name and yes, it does look at this

[45:56] It has an actual full. It's not even a gate. I would call it like a almost like a lane guy type thing

[46:03] That pops up in front so you can't lose the ball

[46:07] It's like a piece of metal that pops up from a coil

[46:10] Through a slice like play field. Yeah, see there you go, right like uh showed out to

[46:16] The internet pinball database for archiving a lot of this really cool stuff

[46:20] IPDB dot org one of the games that popped up a lot when um

[46:26] I was doing some of the research was Niagara. Oh Niagara Falls

[46:31] This is an international landmark tourist trap theme. It is from December of 1951. It sells 1,200 units

[46:39] Niagara Falls Ontario is a Canadian city around the famous waterfalls of the same name

[46:46] It is linked to the United States by the rainbow bridge

[46:50] It's on the site of Niagara Rivers

[46:52] Western Shore that overlooks the horseshoe falls the cascades most expansive section

[46:59] Elevators can take visitors to a lower

[47:02] Wetter vantage point to view behind the falls

[47:06] A cliff side park which features a beautiful promenade and even underwater caverns which were originally used to generate power

[47:16] And if you love to go to all those crappy tourist places to buy stuff from China with Niagara Falls written on it

[47:23] This is your town. Wow. Have you been to Niagara Falls? Oh, no. You haven't been to Niagara Falls. No

[47:31] Isn't the Canadian side the better the better side?

[47:34] It everything on the Canadian side is always better. Oh, okay. I think it's like five hours from me

[47:41] So the way like on the Canadian side you can see the falls right like you're looking into the falls where on the American side you're kind of looking across

[47:49] To the Canadian side which is just kind of a city and a forest

[47:52] But it is actually a very cool place and when you see the the falls themselves

[47:58] They are like impressive

[48:00] The time that I the time that I always think when I've heard what I've been to Niagara Falls is if you can imagine being like

[48:07] the discoverers who are rowing or going up the

[48:11] St. Lawrence River and they're trying to find a connection across North America and then they get to this and they're like

[48:19] Ah, ****

[48:21] That's that's always what I imagine are they're going down the one way they don't see the falls to the last second

[48:26] Oh, no paddle the other way Wayne loved those bingo

[48:30] Machines that were very popular around this time. He'd love them because of their complexity

[48:35] And he wanted to bring some of those interesting complex ideas to his pinball design

[48:41] So that's where he came up with the ideas that were implemented in Niagara

[48:46] The idea was that in the center of the play field there are like these captive saucers

[48:53] And if you get a ball into those captive saucers the ball stays there and increases your score by five

[49:00] Hundred thousand the idea was that it is sort of like Niagara Falls. You're falling in to these captive holes

[49:09] This caused a lot of fighting among some of the other designers and engineers

[49:14] He was breaking out of the mold

[49:17] Wayne says

[49:18] The other designers were saying why lose the ball up the middle of the play field

[49:22] Why lose the ball in an out-hole up top will never play the game

[49:25] Dave Gottlieb was sitting up on a stool. He always came in and sat on my stool

[49:29] He very seldom said much and he was pretty quiet

[49:32] All the rest of the guys were arguing and sometimes you get a little heated and they want to change this change that

[49:38] One day he says all right everybody out then he says to me you do anything you want

[49:43] And that's the way it's going to be built at that point. I had supreme power and I used it

[49:47] Woo because you imagine having supreme power

[49:51] So you basically had the owner of the company just saying do whatever you want

[49:54] Flippers are kind of back into where they should normally be the honey moon is on for operators of Gottlieb's

[50:00] Niagara

[50:02] It's a torrent of action swirling speed so they call it okay their name for it is the ball trap

[50:10] Everybody falls for new ball trap when balls are trapped pop bumpers light for points scoring

[50:16] trapping four balls awards one replay

[50:19] Ball traps speeds play increases earnings

[50:23] So here's the thing right you get you lose that ball you go through your five balls faster

[50:30] Which is good for the operator right?

[50:32] Mm-hmm. It's pretty smart. What are they two four pop bumpers two flippers two

[50:37] Cyclonic bumpers

[50:40] Create flashing speed ball action

[50:43] Immediate delivery order today. It's a beautiful looking pin the backlash is is gorgeous

[50:52] It's like Niagara Falls has this weird

[50:57] nostalgia of

[51:00] romance and honey moons and things like that right where the heart shaped

[51:05] Jacuzzi tub right that's kind of the Niagara thing

[51:09] It's got on a wonderful backlash. It's got a a 19 you know forties fifties couple kissing in front of the falls

[51:18] It has all of these silly characters. There's one person who's type rope walking across the falls

[51:25] Just a wonderful backlash. What do you think?

[51:27] Yep, that's a classic Roy Ray Parker

[51:31] The characters are always be doing something you have to really look at these back glasses to see all the different stuff going on

[51:36] Like there's a lot of stuff going on and itself is kind of interesting right like it's not just a

[51:42] A backlash. It's like it's it's fun. It's it's joyful. It's just wonderful. I love it

[51:48] Absolutely love it and the play field itself is beautiful as well

[51:52] It's a very similar scene, but there's a fellow with a barrel. That's the get that's the thing right is the guy in a barrel falling off the falls

[52:01] And there's all of these characters again hidden in the play field

[52:06] Just beautiful

[52:08] I understand why people I think love these wood rails

[52:11] What about queen of hearts?

[52:14] This was Wayne Nyan's favorite game that he made

[52:17] This was a playing card theme from December of 1952 sells 2,200 units

[52:25] And with these is primarily if you notice instead of

[52:28] Our previous episodes where we got you know the designer was the sound person was the this it's basically these games

[52:34] The designer is so and so and the artist is so and so

[52:37] Yeah, they're back they're back in about 12 games a year

[52:41] You know what I mean?

[52:43] They're not changing it up too often

[52:45] Now there's a backlash error in this one

[52:48] If you look at it like the backlash is pretty risk a it's like a queen

[52:53] Her mid-rift is showing swearing a very short skirt which is unusual for godly

[52:58] But they went there on this occasion the error on this backlash is seven clubs seven of clubs actually has eight clubs on it whoops

[53:08] Oops queen of hearts with five brand new drop-through ball trap holes

[53:14] Basically gobble holes godly deals you another winning hand

[53:20] Very nice very nice

[53:22] This is the game that and I mentioned before this is Wayne's favorite game

[53:26] He loved this game because he loved the I the concept of the gobble holes

[53:30] He loved the idea of building a hand

[53:34] In the middle of the play field he he enjoyed the pop bumper action at the top two dead bumpers three pop bumpers

[53:42] He really liked the geometry and the the code if you will it's it's a fun looking game

[53:48] I'm not into the card playing games. That doesn't really appeal to me. I mean they're fun is a very used theme in pinball

[53:55] Especially in this time right it was you know men and women and playing cards and having people over for a dinner party and playing cards

[54:03] Was a thing they didn't have board games really at this time. So so cards was the board game of choice at the time

[54:10] Roy Parker's very risk a

[54:13] When it comes to this theme that was not really a a topic that happened all the time the risk a-ness

[54:22] Was not a big big thing at godly they got away with it this time

[54:27] Roy Parker was an artist who worked for ad posters

[54:31] And he did art almost exclusively for godly from the 1930s until his death in 1966

[54:38] He was an introverted person and never really played pinball

[54:42] But he was humorous and fun with those he knew parker would often come into

[54:48] Godly with artwork for his games where the women were depicted in you know

[54:53] Maybe a little bit too revealing clothing or suggestive themes and that's when Dave Gottlieb would tell parker to

[55:00] tone it down a bit as what he would always say and parker would just take out a pander pencil

[55:06] Right there and fix or edit that artwork

[55:10] He was often described by those who worked with him as a wonderful artist and so

[55:16] Cooperative he worked and never complained even when his art was criticized by the designers or David Gottlieb

[55:23] It just rolled off his back some artists are very very sensitive with their art

[55:29] Well Wayne says you got to be careful how you criticize an artist

[55:32] You know you can't tell him or her that that's too much of this or the legs are too long

[55:37] You got to be very careful but not Roy Roy was a consummate professional

[55:42] He just said yeah, sure you're paying my paychecks. I'll make the change no big deal

[55:47] Especially during this era run there was always a lot of

[55:51] Legal jeopardy for the pinball industry Wayne was even sometimes called to testify

[55:58] At various trials around pinball. Was it a game of skill?

[56:02] Was it a gambling device?

[56:04] Was it a thing to indoctrinate the youth of America into satanic worship?

[56:12] Well, we never will find out what the answer to that is. Oh, it definitely corrupts youth 100 percent

[56:17] Wayne would actually say one day

[56:20] While I was designing a game the telephone rang and it was the woman at the switchboard. She says

[56:26] There's a man out here to see you. I thought uh-oh

[56:29] Nobody comes to see me

[56:32] Then when he went downstairs there was a government agent waiting for him

[56:37] When was the last time a government agent visited you Ron back in my mob trial me and Michael Carlion

[56:43] Yeah, yes, but now was Bruce Nightingale from the slam till podcaster other podcast was he involved in that as well because I know

[56:51] He has strict Italian heritage

[56:55] Um, I am gonna plead the fifth very good well played very Italian of you. Oh

[57:03] So

[57:04] So this government as an Italian I'm offended you take that back now. I'm offended that you're offended. Yeah, this is offensive

[57:11] So so Wayne

[57:13] He would be whisked away to testify at a trial about you know a game being a game of of chance

[57:21] How the game you know rewards replays and this would happen quite regularly

[57:27] Through the 1950s as you know states tried to figure out what to do with pinball and a way to get around some of those rules

[57:38] Was something that was a wonderful invention and something that really changed the industry especially for godlyb

[57:45] Which was called add-a-ball

[57:48] What how does an add-a-ball work?

[57:50] Uh, you add a ball. So if you have five ball game

[57:54] You do something skillful in the game and you get another ball

[57:59] Another ball you can play. Ah, so you have to do so it so you it requires you to do something

[58:05] Clire skill

[58:06] Right, it just doesn't happen magically earn an add-a-ball see so instead of

[58:12] Playing the game and getting a free play

[58:15] You would just add a ball to your current game and you could play indefinitely if you're good enough

[58:22] Yeah, yeah on a business trip to Texas and Wisconsin

[58:26] Alvin godlyb the son of David godlyb he heard from the distributors that they weren't selling enough product

[58:33] Now in those states

[58:35] Freeplay was illegal

[58:37] They needed something to move around the law

[58:41] And that inevitably became add-a-ball

[58:46] Wayne was given the project

[58:49] And he had to come up with a way around freeplay

[58:53] Illegality and that was when he came up with flipper

[58:57] And by freeplay we mean winning a free game. I don't think the games were ever on freeplay back then

[59:02] No, no flipper

[59:05] Is named after the fantastic dolphin that everybody knows

[59:10] I knew you're gonna say that

[59:13] So bad

[59:16] The show that didn't exist yet it's named after do you do a very good flipper impression? I don't speak dolphin

[59:23] I'm sorry flipper from 1960 they call it flipper flipper

[59:29] This is a magic theme so no, I'm sorry. It's not a dolphin theme

[59:34] The theme that we all want

[59:37] flipper

[59:38] This is from november of 1960 it sells 1,100 units

[59:43] flipper is the first add-a-ball machine and it was introduced as a concept again to extend play

[59:50] Until this game was made

[59:52] David godlyb was of the firm opinion that nothing would replace

[59:57] Winning a free game in fact

[01:00:00] Prior to this game he had halted the project multiple times on extended play concepts because he was unsatisfied with the development

[01:00:10] godlyb's 1960 dancing dolls was the first extended play prototype

[01:00:16] It was never manufactured

[01:00:18] Well album godlyb told ipdb the internet pinable database that after he played Wayne's first finished production model

[01:00:26] A flipper he decided to try to get it approved in some foreign markets where a free play was considered a thing of value

[01:00:33] That made it part of gambling sir infestians

[01:00:37] Mondial company. I know I put your dad managed to get it approved in france and Italy and the rest is history

[01:00:44] There's a whole thing here about how they were able to actually get add-a-ball to be approved in Italy

[01:00:50] They had to change the back last lights

[01:00:52] Because you couldn't you couldn't win a thing of value

[01:00:55] So they had to make it seem like it was less valuable it was very weird

[01:00:59] But there's a whole there's a whole thing in there and in the interest of time

[01:01:02] I'm not gonna go into that because I mean there's only

[01:01:05] Five people that are listening to this podcast that care anything about Italy. Hey, hey talking about Italy

[01:01:15] This also would start around the same time as the wedge head era

[01:01:20] So what am I talking about when I say a wedge head? It's the shape of the back box

[01:01:25] Yes, it's a shape of a wedge

[01:01:28] So during the run of flipper

[01:01:30] Gotley began rolling out a new cabinet design and this was changing from the standard wood rail sides and square

[01:01:38] Back boxes to cabinets with metal side rails and wedge style back boxes

[01:01:44] According to IPDB there are 415 wood rail versions of flipper and

[01:01:52] 685 wedge head versions

[01:01:55] Why did they make the change in the head design? Why did they make this massive change?

[01:02:01] Well Wayne Nyan says when the game flipper came on location

[01:02:05] We soon heard complaints about side-by-side games

[01:02:09] It was hard to keep the games in line and separated so there was room for two pairs of hands

[01:02:14] The answer became obvious

[01:02:15] We needed to increase the size of the light box on single-player games

[01:02:19] I believe that Roman Garbark head of a mechanical engineering at Gotley came up with the wedge head design

[01:02:25] Do you have them like bumping into each other?

[01:02:27] Because the the wood rails actually extend beyond the sides of the cabinet you're gonna have

[01:02:33] You're gonna be able to fit less of them there getting your hands in there to hit each other. Yeah, Pat

[01:02:37] So this this is a thing

[01:02:39] Ron it's taken 13 years

[01:02:43] 13 years before they redesign a cabinet because they noticed they had a problem when they were sitting next to each other

[01:02:50] That seems

[01:02:51] Amazing to me. Oh, obviously they must have known they had problems before

[01:02:56] But they just I guess it wasn't a big enough problem

[01:02:59] Maybe there wasn't enough locations that had multiple games. Never think of that

[01:03:03] Yeah, everything about sunny because if you just have single games like in a

[01:03:07] I don't know what kind of places where they have that a drug store pharmacy

[01:03:10] Yeah, we both went for the same place, but yeah, it's pretty amazing

[01:03:14] It would take 13 years to come up with that. I find that mind blowing

[01:03:17] I'm sure there were other minor changes with cabinets as far as you know automatic ball loaders far as manual ball loaders

[01:03:24] Yeah, coin doors probably changed that kind of stuff now Williams would not be out done as they also tried to innovate their designs in the

[01:03:33] 60s so something around this time prompted people to say hey, we need to make some changes here

[01:03:40] One of their machines would be darts

[01:03:42] Followed by Viking and jungle. Oh, and of course a few others

[01:03:47] They were called a reverse wedge their heads were generally the same size

[01:03:53] But in the front there was a shelf where you could place a drink

[01:03:58] Yeah, I've seen us in front of the coin door. Yep. Yeah, and their wedge heads were literally wedge heads just turn upside down

[01:04:05] It's just different. They just like boom. Okay. So not the same it was

[01:04:09] The game Hollywood in 1961 where Williams moved to a wider head to make more room for people's hands

[01:04:17] Once the wedge head design had been proven to be a superior style

[01:04:22] Gottlieb was the innovator and as we've said many times in this

[01:04:27] podcast the Cadillac of the industry

[01:04:31] As Wayne would say our games worked we had a system of trying everything out we had in our boiler room

[01:04:38] We had a steel vault in which we put everything in and ran everything on test relays

[01:04:42] We ran them endlessly

[01:04:44] They ran for months on end with a relay operating this one operating that one which operate this one

[01:04:50] Then one one would drop off it started all over again run again and just run like that for weeks and months on end

[01:04:56] They went on and on and on and on

[01:05:01] Until they literally failed 60 years later stern has the same room. They have a room

[01:05:07] Where they do the same thing. They'll just have different max in there and they will run them 24-7

[01:05:12] It must be really loud in there. Yeah, actually. Yeah, when you say that it probably is

[01:05:17] This brings us to Wayne's probably most famous game slick chick

[01:05:23] Slick chick gobble holes

[01:05:25] This is the electro mechanical game which is a

[01:05:31] Well kind of theme is this it's like

[01:05:33] Barber shop quartet with women with bunny ears. I don't I don't know

[01:05:40] But not only do we have the wedge heads now we now have a real scoring. Yes, which is a big big deal

[01:05:47] It's an it's an it's an interesting thing so no more millions folks no no we can't do the million score because we're not making that many reels

[01:05:54] Yes, so this sells

[01:05:56] 4,550 units a massive seller

[01:06:03] What does the flyer say about this wonderful game? Oh, what does it say run?

[01:06:08] I mean, it must have did a good job if it's all that many

[01:06:11] Got leaves slick chick and they even have the name printed out the way it is on the game

[01:06:16] Which is like an x so there's pop bumpers in the shape of an x each one of them is a letter featuring new playboard auto clamp

[01:06:23] I wonder that it probably means you can't lift the play field up

[01:06:27] It's probably locked down like the lock mechanism new maximum security door lock

[01:06:33] New double size cash box for all those earnings right there new front door styling new front molding clamp

[01:06:42] Lot of cabinet upgrades with this particular game new lock down bar modern style point door

[01:06:49] And I'm thinking that might be another reason they sold so many of them

[01:06:52] Operators liked all these new features

[01:06:55] Okay, all right, where do I start the top here? Yes, okay becoming a pro cronies that perfect way to say thanks and it starts at three dollars of up

[01:07:09] Want to get early access to episodes before everyone else have a strange love for stickers?

[01:07:14] Do you know what a discord is?

[01:07:16] Interested in having your comments and questions take priority on our episodes jump on

[01:07:20] Wait a minute. This is odd twice

[01:07:23] Boy you can't what you paid for I guess all right hold on jump on is six dollars a month premium crony

[01:07:29] What all the other perps and a shirt after three months join us at 20 months of up as an Ellie leadest crony wow

[01:07:38] Can I have my money now

[01:07:44] Kind of before the major coin door right

[01:07:46] This isn't the first game by any means but just to describe it for people

[01:07:51] It was like you know those old

[01:07:53] Quarters or loonies that you would put into a washing machine right you'd put it in the little thing and you'd push it in

[01:07:58] And it would go kkkk

[01:07:59] This is more of your now modern day coin shoot where you'd put it in and it falls into the bottom and clicks the switch

[01:08:06] Originally this game was called party girls which was a bit of a risk a name based on David Gottlieb

[01:08:12] And he wanted a better name so Wayne went off to figure out where the heck he was gonna call this game

[01:08:17] And one Sunday night he went to a friend's house for dinner and he saw around the corner a big sign for a new restaurant

[01:08:26] Which was opening called slick chick

[01:08:29] So Wayne says that sign must have been ten foot high

[01:08:32] So when I went to Gottlieb the next day I put it on the game and called it slick chick

[01:08:38] There you go boom most people talk about code

[01:08:42] And pinball especially nowadays the lack of code or the quality of code or multipliers or this and that

[01:08:48] So ems they did have code it was very different than today. I would say they had code. It's mechan

[01:08:54] There's no one I think a code. I think it's like programming it's something written

[01:08:58] It had steppers and

[01:09:01] Yeah, motors and stuff but the way it would work is that you had objectives and things to do

[01:09:07] slick chick stood out because it had an interesting style of play

[01:09:12] So we mentioned before that the pop bumpers spelling slick and the other set of pop bumpers spelling chick

[01:09:18] We're in the formation of an x and this was important because you had to spell out slick chick

[01:09:25] But it had to be done in order

[01:09:28] So when you would hit a pop bumper it lights up and if you hit that pop bumper again it unlights

[01:09:33] So the pop bumpers all had to be spelled in order to win a free play. I'm trying to remember they

[01:09:40] Well, they pop bumpers are dead bumpers

[01:09:43] Like your dead bumpers because if they were pop bumpers wouldn't that be hard? Oh, yeah, no, they would be dead bumpers

[01:09:47] That's right. They were just because they're pop bumpers. You'd have the light off on off on off on

[01:09:52] That would like never work. Yeah, they're dead bumpers

[01:09:54] So it goes up it hits the bumper it turns on and it comes down and it is a beautiful play field

[01:10:00] It's got this creepy rabbit in the middle. Yeah, he is creepy

[01:10:04] That's it's and then next to him are these like ladies with these weird bunny hats, but they're like

[01:10:11] Bunny hats your grandmother would like niche you is chick like a slang word for bunny back in the 60s

[01:10:18] I don't know. Yeah, that's a good question

[01:10:22] I don't do that kind of research here Ron come on. Okay in this era balls didn't directly feed into the shooter lane

[01:10:31] You had to feed them in manually

[01:10:34] It used to call it like a spoon mechanism

[01:10:36] So you would

[01:10:38] Put your ball into the shooter lane and you'd pull the shooter rod and shoot it

[01:10:41] And then when your ball would drain then you could add the next one mechanically

[01:10:45] It was a little it was a little rod below the shooter lane. You push it in to load a ball

[01:10:49] Yeah, so there wasn't a coil under there that when the ball would drain into the trough

[01:10:53] It would pop another one out

[01:10:55] You had to do it yourself

[01:10:57] So theoretically during this time you could feed five balls into the game as you were playing and you could kind of play

[01:11:06] Multi-bop you were paying a dime in 1963

[01:11:10] So I seriously doubt that you were putting five balls in there at once because you're kind of bang and through it really quickly

[01:11:18] That's kind of expensive, but it was kind of neat because this game you could throw multiple game multiple balls in there

[01:11:25] In the hope that you could get more of these bumpers to light up in order

[01:11:32] So what about that theme it's fairly ladies

[01:11:37] Sexy kind of theme right maybe they're supposed to be maybe this supposed to be playboy bodies. Oh my goodness

[01:11:44] Well, I mean they can at this time when was designing games for 16 to 24 year old men

[01:11:50] And of course they made a lot of games with ladies

[01:11:54] A lot of dancing ladies and you know silly things to make you laugh or giggle

[01:12:00] Because boys are kind of dumb sometimes

[01:12:03] But they do look a lot like playboy buddies don't they yeah

[01:12:06] Wayne says we did a lot of things in those days today

[01:12:09] We would have been sued we never thought of being sued people weren't in the business of suing people at that time

[01:12:15] I think they thought well it's good publicity what happened

[01:12:18] This is this is something that popped up as well during the research is what happened to all the design stuff

[01:12:22] The sample plastics the

[01:12:25] Drafting boards the pictures the the outlines the notes that Wayne would write

[01:12:31] Everyone might want to cover their ears here because Wayne says

[01:12:34] Everything landed in the loft at Gottlieb after run the glass plate boards plastics brochures

[01:12:41] Everything was thrown up to the loft when the loft got full

[01:12:44] We'd hire truck to come in and they push everything out the loft window

[01:12:48] You saw everything going out that window and of course at that time

[01:12:51] All you wanted to do is clear the space to get new stuff in there

[01:12:55] So they threw it all out. Did you hear all of those people driving to work screaming all that history

[01:13:01] Just thrown out a window literally

[01:13:04] Until like a garbage truck tip of the hat again to the pinball database

[01:13:09] Online because they've been able to cement a lot of that history and keep it going thank goodness

[01:13:18] One of the fun games that I found when I was looking through Wayne Nions games

[01:13:23] With skyline and this is a nightclub elevator theme

[01:13:28] It is from January of 1965. It sells two thousand units

[01:13:33] Really famous for an unusual back glass animation

[01:13:38] But also the beautiful beautiful Roy Parker art on the back

[01:13:42] Well, did you know it has the new multi bumper scoring or if you're in uh the

[01:13:48] Wisconsin or Chicago the new multi bumper scoring

[01:13:51] New comic oh I hate this new comical light box animation

[01:13:56] But it is uh it is a fun interesting

[01:13:59] game the theme okay, it's like a it's like a uh a nightclub

[01:14:04] Really high up in a skyscraper in Chicago

[01:14:08] And there's an elevator there as well on the back box and as you build up your score eventually the elevator

[01:14:17] opens up

[01:14:18] To um reveal a very back box image, but you can look out the window

[01:14:24] There's like a restaurant in the background people are ordering they're wearing beautiful suits. It's very elegant

[01:14:32] They're obviously very high class fancy society in Chicago

[01:14:37] And in the background of that back glass there's a window and behind there you see the the Chrysler building

[01:14:45] You see the this beautiful skyline with uh

[01:14:49] With RCA and americano and the ritz

[01:14:53] Uh Chicago in the background is very cool all the signs of places that didn't give their permission to use their

[01:14:59] There's stuff in this back glass

[01:15:01] The uh the the play field art in itself is also very beautiful. It's it's these dancing couples and

[01:15:09] It's really really elegant

[01:15:12] So the object of the game is to get you to keep playing and there's got to be a gimmick

[01:15:19] The gimmick is that the the elevator doors open up and there's people standing in front of him

[01:15:25] The standing in front of this elevator like gasping like who's who is coming out of here because everybody's there is like high society and bow ties and fancy

[01:15:35] Ron when your score gets to a certain level and the elevator doors open up

[01:15:39] What do you see?

[01:15:42] Uh, I assume it's supposed to be a homeless guy and uh, dude in drag coming in together. Yes

[01:15:49] That's the this they're coming in to crash the party that is high society damn high society

[01:15:54] Great. It was like the blues brothers or something coming through there

[01:15:57] Yeah, looking the restaurant

[01:16:00] I know there's nothing to do with skyline, but oh wait a minute. No, that's in Chicago, isn't it?

[01:16:05] I think it is yes. Yes. See there is a tie-in

[01:16:08] Now kings and queens is from March of 1965

[01:16:14] It sells 2875 units

[01:16:18] This machine is famous because it was used in the musical Tommy with Roger Daltry playing it on stage

[01:16:27] With Elton John in those crazy stilts boots. Do you remember that? I do remember that

[01:16:32] So if you throw that into Google

[01:16:34] It will come up where Elton John has these crazy stilts boots and he's super tall and um

[01:16:41] He's like playing a 10-foot high pinball machine in like a futuristic

[01:16:47] Cabinet well the cabinet has a keyboard in the front of that display. Yeah

[01:16:52] It's a whole it's a whole thing

[01:16:55] Start let's start with kings and queens before we get into the game that Elton John is playing

[01:16:59] But kings and queens is as you could probably guess a card playing style of game

[01:17:06] It's a lady who's cheating playing cards against a gentleman

[01:17:13] They're cheating. There's another lady standing behind that gentleman with a mirror to show you what his cards are and there's like a

[01:17:21] few fellows at a

[01:17:23] Western bar

[01:17:25] Scene in the background. There's a fellow under the table who's passing cards to

[01:17:31] The the gentleman at the card table. It's a very comical fun backless. So everyone is cheating

[01:17:37] Everybody's cheating in here

[01:17:40] Very crazy

[01:17:42] It's another great creation from the master maker of card games

[01:17:47] Gottlieb's kings and queens

[01:17:50] Gottlieb had card games like lockdown. That was like a niche

[01:17:54] They really did amazing jobs like all new colorful sunburst pop-up or caps

[01:18:01] The art design of the pop-upers is new. Yes. This is when you think of sort of the 1970s

[01:18:10] You know pop bumper caps these are

[01:18:14] Those caps the in the 60s amazing in the 60s. I know this is like the birth of that

[01:18:21] Which is pretty cool. It's a fun little game. I have seen and I have played kings and queens

[01:18:27] It's all about sort of shooting the capture holes, I think

[01:18:32] And those give you aces kings queens and jacks and then you build up your hand down at the bottom

[01:18:39] It's really challenging because it has the flippers are those those little two-inch flippers

[01:18:45] They are not your traditional Italian bottom. So when I mean by that is there's no in lanes

[01:18:51] That feed the flippers the flippers are attached to the slings and it makes it really difficult to get a hold of to catch up and line up your shots

[01:19:01] brutal so much fun though wow there is like

[01:19:05] So many lanes so many lanes. There's what one two three four five six seven lanes at the top and then there's four in the middle of the play

[01:19:14] It does it go all the way

[01:19:16] To the left like this kind of go there

[01:19:19] That probably not because then it be one two three four five six seven eight nine lanes

[01:19:26] Oh, there are look at how that's a lot of lames sonic hold my beer you have no

[01:19:32] Five lanes. That's for wooseys Elton John in his crazy boots is playing a game called buckaroo

[01:19:39] Also by Wayne Nions. So he's

[01:19:42] Wayne Nions is attached to the who he's he's all over the who when it comes to the Tommy musical

[01:19:49] It's the western cowboy theme

[01:19:51] June of 65 it sells

[01:19:54] 2600 units and

[01:19:56] This one is is really neat because it has a back box animation of a horse

[01:20:01] kicking a cowboy in the ass which is pretty great

[01:20:05] Cowboys always did well in certain markets apparently

[01:20:10] New York City and Wisconsin always bought a bunch of cowboy theme pinball machines

[01:20:17] I think this is because there was like this romantic image of the wild west

[01:20:22] People in New York City were in New York City and they never really ventured to the west

[01:20:27] Traveling out of the city was something that sort of rich people would do

[01:20:31] I do like the back box animation and it's funny

[01:20:33] It's pretty cool, isn't it? You know, we thought he was the bali table king when in reality

[01:20:38] He was the got leap table king. Yes. Oh my goodness

[01:20:42] This was Wayne's last really big project and he'd only release one game in

[01:20:49] 1966 he didn't release any games in

[01:20:52] 1967 and only one in

[01:20:56] 1968

[01:20:58] Roy Parker would die in

[01:21:01] 1966 probably influenced the fact that he didn't want to make a whole lot of games

[01:21:06] As well

[01:21:07] He's starting to move into more of a

[01:21:10] management role

[01:21:12] Wayne's last game was the smash hit

[01:21:16] Paul Bunyan

[01:21:18] You're a big Paul Bunyan fan Ron

[01:21:21] Uh, that's the big lumberjack guy

[01:21:24] Yes, your your uh

[01:21:26] Spare bedroom is themed after Paul Bunyan, is it not?

[01:21:31] It is not oh

[01:21:33] So this is the like the giant lumberjack guy so he's like this myth of the lumberjack who's like 20 feet tall

[01:21:40] I will tell you in Lake George, which is the resort area like an hour north of me

[01:21:47] They have a mini golf and they have uh around the world and 18 holes and around the us and 18 holes and one of the holes

[01:21:54] They have Paul Bunyan like the uh they got big

[01:21:58] Like he it was originally for some parade or something

[01:22:02] It's it's been there for like 40 years this thing

[01:22:05] Huge Paul Bunyan statue

[01:22:07] Johnny Apple seed Paul Bunyan all those kind of like romantic

[01:22:12] 40s American myths right like he's he's a big deal Paul Bunyan

[01:22:17] Do you know it has dynamic total play field action?

[01:22:20] It is dynamic at six flippers

[01:22:23] It allows players to make relay recovery shots at the very top of the play field

[01:22:28] It has an ABC rotation sequence relights running light rollover and target for 500 points

[01:22:35] As bulls-eye targets lights top roll under for shoot again feature

[01:22:40] Shoot again extra ball two kick out holes like for 600 point score

[01:22:46] And they do have at this point got leave this of the little

[01:22:50] Gotley flipper skill game. Yes, because they they're drawing those distinctions right this is skill

[01:22:56] That extra touch of quality and originality is what you get with Paul Bunyan

[01:23:04] Which has an interesting backlash. Yes. This is art by

[01:23:08] Oddly enough art stenhome

[01:23:11] This had a little bit of input by Ed Kinsky and Steve Kirk Steve Kirk

[01:23:17] Mm-hmm from meteor and stars and nine ball and gamutron eventually move on to stern

[01:23:24] Now there was also an Italian version of this game that sold 1,725 units that game had a different name

[01:23:33] It was called a big a jack. No, it's called big jack a big a jack

[01:23:39] Wayne

[01:23:40] Would start to move into more management positions at got leave and we'll get into that in a whole other podcast in the future

[01:23:47] So we'll go into Wayne's career and his

[01:23:52] Management in another episode, but I want to talk about Wayne's retirement and his move into the centenarian that we all know

[01:24:02] Upon retirement Wayne moved to mountain home arcan saw

[01:24:07] What's your favorite part of mountain home run?

[01:24:09] Uh, I'll let you know when I go there. All right the the wonderful wonderful population hub of arcan saw

[01:24:17] Also a very difficult word to spell

[01:24:21] Arcan saw I'd had to type that out quite a few times before I got that right arcan sass

[01:24:27] Just say like that you're all you're all good. It's

[01:24:29] It's very odd very odd

[01:24:31] So there's a wonderful article in the pinball news about Wayne's

[01:24:37] 100th birthday his photos and a beautifully written article. I'll include it in the show notes

[01:24:44] To add some context to this currently as of 2023 only

[01:24:49] 6% of the earth's population are above the age of 100

[01:24:55] Getting there is not particularly easy pinball historian Gordon Hayce put together a presentation for Wayne on his birthday

[01:25:06] That presentation is also in the pinball news article another pinball historian Michael

[01:25:14] Michael

[01:25:16] I think Michael shice and Larry's

[01:25:19] Zart

[01:25:20] Zartarn

[01:25:22] The guys from the Pacific pinball museum like I really try for these names, but my god

[01:25:28] Anywho let's move on

[01:25:30] Uh, they presented Wayne with a pinball trophy of sorts from the Pacific pinball museum

[01:25:37] It's a score motor with pinballs mounted on the top

[01:25:41] And they also added three EM score reels

[01:25:46] And they set it to 100 and every year at Wayne's birthday they would move the final reel

[01:25:54] One digit

[01:25:56] So it would move from 100 to 101 and 103

[01:26:00] It was a wonderful gesture and something that I think is

[01:26:04] Amazing and the Pacific pinball museum probably has one of the largest collections of EMs

[01:26:12] Of anyplace I can think of

[01:26:14] And you've been uh, I went to their they used to have the press the Pacific pinball

[01:26:21] Expo

[01:26:22] Every year and they would have a section that was just tons and tons of EMs lots and lots of Wayne Nions games

[01:26:30] In attendance. Yeah, this was in uh Marin County. They used to have it

[01:26:35] It was very close to James headfield and battalocas home

[01:26:38] Oh very cool

[01:26:40] Somebody's looking at by PDB. No, I was not looking at

[01:26:44] Because his custom earth shaker Metallica pin was there one year because he'd lived right in the area

[01:26:49] So they just brought it to the show

[01:26:51] Mm-hmm pinball magazine number five was also published in

[01:26:56] 2018 which featured a large section about Wayne Nions

[01:27:01] He was featured on the cover in a I think a very

[01:27:05] Old school cool picture of him in a white shirt with a tie and those dark rim glasses fantastic

[01:27:12] It was a large article that was written by Gordon Hase also included in the magazine was an interview with Jonathan

[01:27:18] Juston where he and Wayne reflected on Wayne's career with industry legend Alan Edwell

[01:27:25] John Burris and the patron saint of pinball

[01:27:29] John Norris. Have you read pinball magazine number five? Uh, I have not I flipped through it

[01:27:35] I saw it at a show one time and I flipped through it. It is huge to call it a magazine at all that thing is is

[01:27:41] Insulting it. It's like a clearly book. Yes

[01:27:45] This was also the last pinball magazine which had been published which is a bit unfortunate

[01:27:51] They haven't released one since I've joined pinball

[01:27:54] Wayne's 104th birthday was marked with a special cake

[01:27:58] A celebratory banner from John and Jan Osborne

[01:28:03] And the ceremonial changing of the trophy digit the following day

[01:28:09] Wayne passed away

[01:28:11] That was July 30th

[01:28:14] 2022 his funeral took place on August the second

[01:28:18] 2022 at the roller funeral home in Arkansas

[01:28:22] I actually took a moment to

[01:28:24] Sign the guest book digitally for mr. Nions because even though I've had limited interaction with him

[01:28:32] He has done a lot to make me smile. It's probably

[01:28:35] Probably the last of the old guard. I mean him and Steve Corte both left to be a hundred

[01:28:40] If you look at where we started this podcast of a cubicle made of chicken wire

[01:28:46] And where we are today with an HR department

[01:28:49] There's been a lot of change in pinball. It's uh, it's something else

[01:28:53] But you can also see that Wayne had a love and a passion

[01:28:57] That he just he he worked hard and he loved it and he did that and as you said he literally went to Chicago

[01:29:05] Expo all the way into his 90s

[01:29:08] So any final thoughts of five decades around pinball with Wayne Nions

[01:29:15] Thank you Wayne for all those games all a hundred and

[01:29:19] What was it 60 60 160 games

[01:29:23] From some of the interviews I've read this stuff. I've seen about him

[01:29:25] He really liked the engineering part like the

[01:29:29] Making the stuff work part

[01:29:31] Supposedly he didn't even need the schematics and stuff. He could just do it all in his head

[01:29:35] Like he got to us that was yeah, I saw I read some kind of article or hurt something

[01:29:41] It was something like he he got his age or 90s before he actually had to look at the stuff anymore to to remind himself

[01:29:47] What he did he could you know before they could still all do it just in his head. That's amazing

[01:29:52] Absolutely amazing. I can't remember when I had for breakfast without writing it down

[01:29:56] And what was the what was the woe nellie game based off of again was that continental

[01:30:01] I believe it was one of his games and they they asked him about that

[01:30:04] And is there spots was like why that game that's not one of my better games

[01:30:09] Yeah, that's a terrible thing like why did they do it off of that one most of the content from this podcast was was

[01:30:15] Gleamed from some youtube videos that Wayne had done with the Pacific pinball museum

[01:30:20] Please watch those videos now there it's Wayne

[01:30:24] You know staring into a camera and talking and they're kind of boring the content and the quality of what he's saying

[01:30:31] Is second to none and he's so it's so

[01:30:34] Amazing to see that he is

[01:30:37] So sharp at that age and able to remember those things and he talks about all these people like Jimmy Johnson in names

[01:30:44] We've never heard of before these people that hopefully we've given a platform on this podcast that they will be remember when he was at expo

[01:30:51] I always thought he was like in his 70s because that's how old he looked to me. It's like oh no, he's almost a hundred what fantastic shape
