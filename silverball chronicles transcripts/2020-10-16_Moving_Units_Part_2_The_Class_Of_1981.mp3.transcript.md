[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:06] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:15] Ron do you ever get into this spiral where you get new sneakers and you're like, I'm going

[00:21] to use my old sneakers when I mow the lawn and then you don't change them when you mow

[00:27] the lawn and then your new shoes are all like like lawny?

[00:30] No, no, no.

[00:31] I'm just in that spiral forever.

[00:34] I was just looking at my shoes.

[00:57] Another month, another silver ball chronicles.

[01:09] Hello, I'm David Dennis and with me this month, like every month is my co-host, the snappy

[01:15] Ron Hallett.

[01:16] Ron, what's up, fella?

[01:17] Hey, worry me when you said this month.

[01:20] I do.

[01:21] I not know something.

[01:22] Am I going to be replaced?

[01:23] You know, I never have anybody on my short list to replace you, but if anybody would

[01:30] like to replace Ron, just let us know and no, it will not be Zach many.

[01:35] Oh, God no.

[01:36] You're trying to sing.

[01:37] Oh, bad.

[01:38] There's no singing on this podcast.

[01:41] Nope, no singing on this podcast.

[01:43] Exciting announcement in the hobby.

[01:45] Finally something.

[01:46] Yeah, new games are coming out.

[01:47] Who would have thought?

[01:48] The month of September, a big, big month.

[01:51] We have the Avengers launch now with beautiful art and a unique odd layout.

[01:57] Lots of neat little features in there.

[02:00] I don't know.

[02:01] After the reveal stream, I'm a little more, hey, ho hum.

[02:05] I think it's awesome, but I was on the hype train pretty hard, but I think I got off

[02:10] somewhere around that reveal stream.

[02:12] So I've calmed down, I've relaxed, and how about you?

[02:15] A lot of half a trails.

[02:17] A lot of half a trails.

[02:19] I think you were going for an airborne record trying to take on Capcom's airborne

[02:24] habit trail record.

[02:25] Who all those aluminum tariffs that the American government has put on must be really

[02:31] impacting that game.

[02:32] I'll tell you that crazy stuff.

[02:34] Deep root is announced at least at date.

[02:36] We'll be able to chat about that next time, either an epic announcement or an epic

[02:40] flame out, but either way, it'll be tons of fun.

[02:43] We've heard that the latest JJP, the Jersey Jack Pitball game is well through its development

[02:49] cycle.

[02:50] And hopefully you've got your dad rock pants on.

[02:53] Oh, yeah, it's supposed to be guns and roses.

[02:56] No, spoiler.

[02:57] Spoiler what's it going to be?

[03:00] Oh, it's going to be.

[03:01] It's going to be guns and roses.

[03:03] Oh, I've heard it's in Australia already.

[03:07] Ooh.

[03:08] Anywho, swing on over Facebook.com, Silverball Chronicles, engage in some posts with us.

[03:27] Not that you would want to do that.

[03:27] You would want to check out all the other wonderful podcasts on the pinball network.

[03:31] What if you just wanted to make sure that you knew right out of the gate with an automatic

[03:35] download?

[03:37] You can search for us directly under Silverball Chronicles.

[03:40] While you're out there in the internet, please take a moment, jump over to this week in pinball's

[03:46] promoter database.

[03:47] Give us a five star review.

[03:49] That way when others are searching for podcasts, they'll be able to see the ones that people

[03:54] love the most.

[03:55] Most of you do know we've sold out to this weekend pinball.

[03:58] So if you'd like to support the hobby, they kick back 25% of the profits on their Patreon

[04:04] at patreon.com slash T.W.I.P.

[04:08] Ron, what did you do with your $1.50 last month?

[04:10] I got $1.50.

[04:11] Well, I kept it, but you did.

[04:13] Oh, okay.

[04:14] Cool.

[04:15] Yeah.

[04:16] Thank you.

[04:17] So we have some comments.

[04:18] Is this from the Twitch page?

[04:20] This is from the promoter's database.

[04:22] We love to recognize everybody who leaves us a review and it also feeds my ego, which makes

[04:28] all of this worthwhile.

[04:29] Yeah, Joel E says, I find history very boring.

[04:32] Oh.

[04:33] I mean, it already happened, right?

[04:34] Who cares?

[04:36] But this podcast is fantastic and engaging.

[04:39] It's amazing how many people in the pinball industry have worked at so many different companies.

[04:43] It's awesome to see their journeys to where they are now.

[04:45] Great dynamic between the two hosts and I look forward to every new episode.

[04:49] Highly recommended.

[04:50] Oh, not just recommended, but highly recommended.

[04:53] Yeah.

[04:54] Thank you so much, Joel.

[04:56] And I think you'll find a lot of the artists we talk about today and that we talked about

[05:00] in the previous episode are still active and working at a pinball company somewhere.

[05:05] This eclectic group was so influential that even today, 40 years later, they're still

[05:11] so greatly involved in the industry.

[05:13] Games like Kiss, the new Kiss, I believe Kiss themselves said, we want that guy that did

[05:18] the original art on our first game.

[05:20] Can you do this one?

[05:21] And that was Kevin O'Connor and he did.

[05:23] Paul Ferris is with deep root.

[05:25] I can't wait to see what he's going to come up with.

[05:27] Great Ferris is the head of art at Stern pinball.

[05:31] Wow.

[05:32] Man, what a portfolio that these people have.

[05:34] Well, Justin over on the Twit pinball promoter's database, one of my favorite things about

[05:41] pinball is its rich history.

[05:44] So it makes perfect sense that this is one of my favorite pinball podcasts.

[05:49] This podcast is hands down the best for learning the ins and out of everything pinball.

[05:56] The two hosts are excellent to hear that run.

[05:58] It says especially that Ron guy, he knows everything.

[06:01] I don't see that.

[06:02] The info they gather along with the commentary makes it very entertaining slash informative.

[06:08] I hang on every word and I often relisten to each episode to make sure I retain all of

[06:15] the great info.

[06:17] That's a great review.

[06:19] That's an awesome review.

[06:20] Thank you Justin.

[06:21] Hangs on every word.

[06:25] Oh, I see you hung there.

[06:26] You see, see that?

[06:27] Yeah, I like that.

[06:29] That was like cliffhanger with Stallone.

[06:31] Where's my cliffhanger pin there Stern?

[06:34] Get on that.

[06:35] Mike, Mike, oh, also tells the Twit database.

[06:38] This podcast is different than most of the others.

[06:42] Love their takes on the best pinballs as well as the new stuff they put in the mix.

[06:48] Thank you.

[06:50] Past pinballs, not best pinballs.

[06:53] I'll just cut that all out.

[06:55] Thanks, Mike.

[06:57] Oh, I mean, Dennis doesn't always get the past pinballs right.

[07:01] I mean, he thinks a lot of them are good that aren't and vice versa, but we'll forgive

[07:05] them.

[07:06] I'm here to set everyone straight on what the actual good games are.

[07:08] The ones that are really worth getting.

[07:10] Yeah.

[07:11] Cause opinions are a fact, of course.

[07:13] If you do enjoy the show, you'd like a shirt swing on over to silverballswag.com.

[07:19] Take a look at some of the hoodies or mugs or stickers.

[07:22] And that's a way you can support us and actually get something in return that you can physically

[07:27] put on your body and think of Ron.

[07:29] Oh, my, if I go to a pinball show and see someone with one of those shirts on, that's

[07:35] going to feel weird.

[07:36] Yeah.

[07:37] Somebody like Daniel from California, he ordered a couple of shirts and he is now the coolest

[07:42] guy at work.

[07:43] In fact, I think he should just burn all of his other clothes and just wear his silverball

[07:48] chronicle shirt.

[07:49] I agree.

[07:50] Corrections.

[07:51] Maybe this episode we've got a couple of things here.

[07:53] Oh, finally.

[07:54] We got some.

[07:55] Okay.

[07:56] Good.

[07:57] I like being wrong.

[07:57] How many scoops does Paragon have?

[08:01] I think I said two and it's three.

[08:04] Hmm.

[08:05] And that's my podcast mate, Bruce from the slam till podcast, which I have to plug or he'll

[08:10] yell at me.

[08:12] Now I told him once again, why don't you just write in and supposedly other people at

[08:16] comments and I said, please write in, please write in with these corrections and no one

[08:20] ever writes in.

[08:21] So if you don't write in, it's fact.

[08:25] That's right.

[08:26] It's solid written in stone.

[08:27] There is a flat unless you write us and tell us it's round.

[08:30] That's right.

[08:31] Just send us an email over to silverballcronicles.com.

[08:33] We got a lot of emails, a couple from Grant, Glenn, San, Jim, Jared and Mike.

[08:40] Really, really, really great.

[08:41] Thank you so much for the interaction.

[08:43] We love to chit chat back and forth.

[08:45] Some of the other comments, Ron, we've got a couple of them here for you.

[08:48] Mike, did you talk about Volt-Han, Escapes Cosmic Doom?

[08:52] Yeah, the famous game that was a very short production run, art by Dave Christensen.

[08:59] We mostly cut that out of time because they didn't really make a lot of them.

[09:04] And it might have a record for the most text in a speech bubble.

[09:08] Yeah, that's a good one.

[09:10] There's a, maybe Dr. Dude might have more, but man, this one's close.

[09:14] There's like a whole paragraph that the guy, what is it?

[09:18] This was a great place once or something.

[09:21] And then she says, forget about it.

[09:23] Ron are away or something like that.

[09:25] And they're flying off into space.

[09:27] Yeah, Christensen did a lot of those speech bubbly things that were pretty cool.

[09:32] But you know, if you've got some corrections or comments or things you'd like us to address,

[09:36] shoot it into us.

[09:37] We love to hear from you.

[09:38] And again, you can check out Facebook.com slash silverballcronicles at that something

[09:41] you want to check out too.

[09:44] Ron, anything else you want to add before we jump into today's topic?

[09:48] Ah, not really.

[09:50] And except with corrections, just like I said, feel free to send in corrections because

[09:54] sometimes even the people involved with the history themselves don't remember it correctly.

[09:59] Yeah, we've got a few comments actually today on some of the artists talking about, you

[10:06] know, when people ask them like, how many units did it sell?

[10:08] And were you excited about sales?

[10:10] There's some interesting comments that we have about that.

[10:12] So they're in the middle of it, the mix.

[10:14] They probably don't remember more details than most of us do because we've got the space

[10:19] in our head to remember that stuff.

[10:22] As mentioned in our previous podcast, moving units, the Valley Art Revolution during that

[10:28] time, Valley produced some of the most beautiful and bestselling art packages ever.

[10:34] From 1975 to 1980, Valley changed the pinball landscape and along with their solid state

[10:42] computer board technology were breaking sales records.

[10:47] It seemed that Paul Ferris' art team could do no wrong.

[10:51] That meant the money kept flowing into the art team as they developed new ways to not

[10:56] only illustrate pinball, but also to print back glasses.

[11:01] In 1981, the gaming industry's footing started to feel shaky.

[11:07] In an effort to hold their ground and boost sales, Valley pushed out some of the most

[11:12] creative works ever.

[11:14] The class of 1981 was and still is the pinnacle of pinball art.

[11:22] Today's podcast, Moving Units Part 2, the Valley Class of 1981.

[11:27] And I would say as far as the industry being shaky, more long lines of the pinball industry

[11:33] being shaky, in 1981, the video game industry would have been hitting on all cylinders.

[11:38] But the thing to remember about Valley is they were Valley Midway.

[11:42] So they had the Midway section that did the video games.

[11:46] Currently, actually over the last little while, I've been watching a couple of episodes

[11:49] of the Docky series High Score on Netflix and it covers some of the old gaming of the

[11:57] 1980s.

[11:59] And they talk a lot about how in 1981, the money was just being thrown at video just left

[12:05] and right and everybody was making anything they possibly could.

[12:08] And that's kind of one of the next steps in the industry is that we're on this sugar

[12:13] high and then it just all kind of comes crashing down a little while.

[12:17] Yeah, and even the pinball manufacturers, you had Gottlieb, they made Cuba.

[12:22] They joined in and Stern, electronics, they made Berserk, Williams had Defender, Robotron,

[12:31] those kind of games and Valley had Midway, which mostly did licensing of other games.

[12:37] Like Pac-Man was actually by Namco, but they licensed it in this country.

[12:42] So they're all making money in the video game, land.

[12:45] One thing Ron that I wanted to bring in were the sales numbers of all of the other manufacturers

[12:51] kind of at the time, our previous episode about Gottlieb's system ones, they were selling

[12:58] some decent units, but were falling off by 1980 big time.

[13:03] I've got the sales figures for Williams up right now.

[13:07] They've got games like Firepower and Black Knight by Steve Richie, who are their 10,000

[13:13] plus units.

[13:14] If you want to over 10K, you got to have Steve Richie design it obviously.

[13:18] Yeah, Blackout is a really great one, 7,000 units.

[13:22] I know there's a guy in Canada on the four sale thread in Canada who's looking for a nice

[13:30] Blackout.

[13:31] Doesn't want to pay too much, but he's willing to pay if it's in good shape, so swing

[13:35] on over there.

[13:36] I can't believe there was only 349 Algares because I've played so many of them.

[13:41] You've played everyone.

[13:42] I think I've played every Algar that exists still.

[13:45] We've got games like Alien Poker with 6,000 units, Barra Cora in 1981, the end of 1981,

[13:53] selling 2300 units, even Hyperball sold 5,000.

[13:57] That wasn't even a pinball machine.

[14:00] We can see that we've got peaks and valleys here at Williams, really based on designer,

[14:09] I would say, and theme, things like Pharaoh, although a decent game, sort of lags behind

[14:15] Jungle Queen, 5,000-ish average, maybe if you average them all together per unit.

[14:22] Yeah, in Firepower, it had multi-ball.

[14:25] That was its gimmick, so it sold a ton.

[14:27] Then Black Knight was the first to buy level one.

[14:30] I guarantee based on that, they probably sold a ton of them.

[14:34] What's this?

[14:35] Williams changed.

[14:37] This is the new thing.

[14:39] Everything's got to be a buy level, and that didn't really work out.

[14:44] This diminishing returns thereafter, that's for sure.

[14:47] That's kind of where we're at in the industry.

[14:49] They're selling 5,000-ish units, but there's these peaks and valleys.

[14:55] Let's start at the beginning of 1980, right where we left off from our previous Valley's

[15:01] Art Revolution.

[15:03] Now we're moving into 80.

[15:04] I had someone who asked me, did you talk about Silver Ball Mania?

[15:07] It's like, I think it's next.

[15:10] There it is.

[15:12] Silver Ball Mania.

[15:13] It's a fantasy theme, February 1980.

[15:16] It sells 10,340 units designed by Jim Patla and artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[15:23] I have never played a Silver Ball Mania, but I hear it mentioned a lot for some reason

[15:29] when people are chatting about play field designs and horseshoe loops and things.

[15:34] It's probably because it has a horseshoe, and that's all you ever hit on it.

[15:40] Ever.

[15:41] So what they've done is they've taken the scoop from the top of the play field and gotten

[15:44] rid of it.

[15:45] And then they just put a horseshoe at the bottom to shoot for all the time.

[15:48] And you have the lanes up top.

[15:51] Killer art package though.

[15:53] Killer art package, just insane by Kevin O'Connor.

[15:57] What was happening here is Jim Patla was just banging out play fields, and he gave Kevin

[16:02] a blank white wood and just told him to do whatever the hell he wanted.

[16:06] So Kevin sits back and he comes up with the idea for Silver Ball Mania.

[16:11] This primarily focuses on the back glass, which is like this.

[16:18] Silver man holding a pinball in his hand.

[16:24] All of the color is very silver and metallic.

[16:28] There's a fellow playing pinball on the left side who's really thrustin in there, if you

[16:34] will, to play pinball, he's got some amazing pinball abs.

[16:39] And don't forget the topless woman, but she's a metal.

[16:42] Again, they're going by the old theory.

[16:44] I think we talked about it on the stern, this the stern episode when you had a viper.

[16:50] You can show the nudity as long as it's metal for some reason.

[16:53] Yeah, as long as it's not real.

[16:54] Yeah, as long as it's not real.

[16:56] It's just a metal person.

[16:58] Yeah, the main focus of the silver dude there, that was modeled after a character called

[17:04] Den, D-E-N, from Heavy Metal Magazine.

[17:08] I'll include that in the show notes if you want to take a look.

[17:11] He's also in the movie, played by John Candy.

[17:14] Yeah, Heavy Metal Magazine was a huge influence.

[17:18] We've brought this up three or four times now when we talked about artists and art, that

[17:22] it was such a huge influence of pinball at the time, because that's where all the crazy,

[17:27] cool, off the wall, artists were hanging out at the time.

[17:33] It was Heavy Metal Magazine.

[17:35] There are two self-portraits of Kevin O'Connor in the reflections on some of the outside

[17:41] images.

[17:43] It's not the obvious face on the left side.

[17:47] Kevin actually had a beard at the time.

[17:49] If you get looking at that back glass, he is very much hidden on the left.

[17:59] There's like these wizards.

[18:03] On the wizards, they have beards.

[18:05] Then it goes down on the sides and around the player, windows.

[18:11] On the left side, in one of those pinballs is Kevin O'Connor's face.

[18:16] Ron, do you know anybody that has a jeep?

[18:19] No.

[18:20] No, well, I have a friend with a jeep.

[18:23] He loves to tell me he has a jeep.

[18:25] Anybody who owns a jeep basically loves to tell you about their jeep and how much they

[18:29] jeep stuff.

[18:31] A normal person would generally say, oh, I left my sunglasses in my car.

[18:38] But not a jeep owner.

[18:39] A jeep owner will say, I left my jeep glasses in my jeep and I got to go back to my jeep

[18:44] to get my jeep glasses, because they love to talk about their jeep.

[18:48] Well, Kevin O'Connor, he had a jeep at the time.

[18:51] On the play field plastics at the back of the play field, you can see Kevin O'Connor's

[18:56] jeep if you look close enough.

[18:59] I missed that.

[19:00] I was too busy looking at the horseshoe that I was hitting repeatedly.

[19:02] Oh, it's horrible.

[19:03] It's a bit of a one trick pony.

[19:05] Kind of cool though, the art that's really the tip top.

[19:08] If you really want to experience silver ball mania and really enjoy it, just buy a play

[19:15] field and stick it up on your wall.

[19:17] What do you think of that flyer, though?

[19:18] That's a three page flyer.

[19:20] It wasn't just a front and a back.

[19:21] It was actually a lot of pinballs on it.

[19:25] Lots of pinballs.

[19:26] So silvery.

[19:27] It lights the pinball world.

[19:30] Sure it does.

[19:31] Each silver ball mania letter when lit is worth a thousand points up to a 44,000 bonus

[19:38] points.

[19:39] I do like the supreme wizard bonus.

[19:41] We need to bring that terminology back.

[19:44] We need the supreme wizard bonus.

[19:46] Yeah, get on that, Steve Richie.

[19:50] Yeah, very cool.

[19:54] Up next.

[19:55] Now this is where we get into some shenanigans again.

[19:58] In our previous episode, we talked about eight ball and the use of a guy who sort of looks

[20:02] like fawns.

[20:03] Sure it does.

[20:06] We spoke about sort of the Lucy Goosey, let's say licensing rules at the time.

[20:14] These invaders from April of 1980, the sci-fi slash alien with a lowercase A theme.

[20:23] So wide body machine with 11,400 units, Jim Patla on the design and artwork by Paul Ferris.

[20:30] Is there a largest selling wide body they did out of out of the class of wide bodies?

[20:37] I think we talked about so far Paragon in the last episode and a future spa.

[20:43] Yeah, this is the third one they bring up.

[20:45] Now Paul Ferris would say in an interview that Bally actually passed on the Indiana Jones

[20:50] theme.

[20:51] They also considered Disney's Tron because of all of its ground-baking graphics and really

[20:57] cool art that they could do.

[20:59] But since it did poorly in the box office, they likely dodged a bullet with that one.

[21:04] Well, pinball might have, but their video game department took it.

[21:08] Woo!

[21:09] Actually, George Gomez worked on it.

[21:10] Yeah.

[21:11] It's an iconic cabinet, not a great game, but an iconic everything else.

[21:16] I think it's a good game.

[21:18] I disagree.

[21:19] Yeah, well, there's the part where they shoot like spiders, digital spider things.

[21:24] They actually cut that out of the movie.

[21:25] Yeah.

[21:26] There's a whole part of the game that doesn't even exist in a movie.

[21:30] But shenanigans, but shenanigans because this is Space Invaders, which obviously Bally

[21:35] owned rights too because midway Space Invaders game.

[21:39] So you figure it would look like Space Invaders, but it doesn't.

[21:45] It looks like something else.

[21:46] Yeah, they were doing a lot of this licensing stuff.

[21:51] They figured they could cross over with Space Invaders, but they were doing $6 million

[21:55] man kind of very close to this.

[21:57] They didn't want to do too many licenses.

[22:00] So they decided to go out on their own and just use their own imagination and create

[22:06] art.

[22:07] But I'll tell you, that back glass and play field looks very familiar.

[22:12] Yeah, it looks like a certain movie with Sigourney Weaver called Alien.

[22:17] Like it is literally the Alien from Alien.

[22:20] There's where we get into the weeds here.

[22:22] Now 20th Century Fox pitched Alien to Bally.

[22:29] The executives at 20th Century Fox hadn't shown the Alien because they were incredibly

[22:37] protective of the design.

[22:39] The people at Bally only saw a quick image of like a doll.

[22:44] Paul Ferris was in that meeting and the way he would remember how the meeting went is

[22:47] that he remembered an artist called HR Geiger.

[22:52] He said, wow, that looks this this alien that they've got in this movie looks very much

[22:58] like HR Geiger's art.

[23:01] And he had been trying to convince Bally for a long time to do something similar on a pinball

[23:06] machine.

[23:07] And in the end, Bally decided they would pass on Alien.

[23:11] But they said, let's go for Geiger's style.

[23:14] So Ron, I'm going to bring up a link to HR Geiger.

[23:19] And I want to get your live reaction to what you think of this, okay?

[23:23] What do you think of this?

[23:24] Well let's see.

[23:25] I see Alien.

[23:27] I see Barra Korra.

[23:28] Oh, well, you're getting too far ahead.

[23:31] That's for another episode.

[23:32] Oh, yeah, but I literally see the Barra Korra face completely ripped off.

[23:36] Oh, yes, I see the alien.

[23:37] It's creepy.

[23:38] This guy's got something going on in his head that is very weird.

[23:43] It is all creepy ribs and spacey long arms.

[23:51] It you can tell that this is the influence for the movie alien and it's art style.

[23:58] That's for sure.

[23:59] So if you're going to look that up, that's in the show notes.

[24:04] That will probably give you nightmares.

[24:07] So there you go.

[24:10] After that meeting, the alien meeting with 20th Century Fox, they decided to go with the

[24:18] theme around HR Geiger's images.

[24:21] And leadership at Valley had no problem with that at the time.

[24:25] Now as it turns out, of course, Fox thought Valley took the image of the alien from their

[24:30] meeting around the movie.

[24:32] There was a lawsuit with Fox and of course, in a sequence of events, leadership and consultants

[24:38] and all of those things, they decided to settle with 20th Century Fox.

[24:43] Now, do you think if Paul Ferris wanted this to be the total ripoff of alien that he could

[24:50] have just drawn it to really look like the alien?

[24:53] Well, it kind of really looks like the alien.

[24:55] It's close enough.

[24:57] It's the alien, man.

[24:58] Like it is pretty darn close.

[25:01] It's got this awesome infinity backlash, doesn't it?

[25:05] Once again, the best thing about this game is the art.

[25:08] Oh, I've never played Space Invaders.

[25:10] I have a friend with one.

[25:11] He got one just after the last time I saw him, which about a year ago.

[25:16] And super sad that I haven't played it yet.

[25:19] But it's got some nuance to the ruleset, doesn't it?

[25:24] As I said, the best thing about the game is the art.

[25:28] IPDB has a couple of really cool blank play fields.

[25:36] It's very cool.

[25:37] It's got like blues and purples, but it's mostly gray, which is really cool.

[25:41] It's got these scary Space Invaders things.

[25:44] Do you find it somewhat interesting that none of the aliens in this Space Invader game

[25:50] by the Valley actually looks like Space Invaders?

[25:54] Not really.

[25:56] It does make the background noise from Space Invaders.

[25:59] Did, did, did, did, did, did, you know that.

[26:04] It continues to escalate.

[26:06] Yeah, so you have that.

[26:08] So at least if you were a video game player, which obviously this was to try to catch their

[26:12] attention, you would at least say, oh, okay.

[26:15] It was like brand recognition.

[26:17] But to be fair, most of the artwork on the cabinets of the video games were not even

[26:21] close of what you'd actually see in the video game.

[26:25] So it's almost like it's telling a story that play field a little bit.

[26:28] Now they have thrown in on the inserts, some of the alien pixel kind of look in art,

[26:35] like the squid guy and the brain looking fellow from the Space Invaders video game.

[26:41] They've sort of thrown it in there to be like, look at Space Invaders, but it's like,

[26:45] they could have called it anything out.

[26:46] They could have called it alien, right?

[26:47] Like, like, or they could have called it invaders from space.

[26:50] They didn't have to call it Space Invaders specifically.

[26:52] Yeah, this alien artwork is probably better than the actual alien game artwork.

[26:58] It totally is.

[26:59] And it's off the wall.

[27:00] It's very weird.

[27:01] You can see the HR Geiger influence in there, the sort of mechanical kind of mixing with

[27:08] the organic, very creepy, very weird.

[27:12] Sneat.

[27:13] It's a neat little, neat little effort there.

[27:17] This also came in an advertisement with its own story, its own comic book.

[27:26] Reminiscent of what they did recently for dialed in at its own little couple page art panel,

[27:33] like comic book, like art panel stuff going on.

[27:36] Swing over to IPDB if you want to learn about that story, but basically in the middle

[27:42] of the play field, there's like a four eyed female-esque character.

[27:48] She's the focus of the story.

[27:49] It's kind of neat.

[27:51] Paul Ferris, I think, really kind of really went out there to create this really creepy

[27:56] and weird alien storyline.

[28:01] Totally cool.

[28:02] It's, I mean, it's a bit unsettling, actually, because that's the art style.

[28:07] But there's a picture of the pinball machine coming out of the alien.

[28:10] Yeah.

[28:11] Which is cool.

[28:12] It would be the greatest back box ever if you had a pinball machine that looked like that.

[28:15] Yeah.

[28:16] It's like these little aliens and then they start to like change form and then they rise

[28:22] up slowly from the floor and mutate and then it finally mutates into the pinball machine.

[28:30] Wow, man.

[28:31] That actually sounds a lot like alien in the movie.

[28:33] Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

[28:34] Gee.

[28:35] I don't wonder why.

[28:36] Okay.

[28:37] So let's just put a pin in that one.

[28:41] One of your favorite machines of all time is up next from February of 1980.

[28:45] It's a rock theme sold 5,700 units designed by Jim Patla.

[28:51] Greg Ferris doing art.

[28:53] It's rolling stones.

[28:54] Hey, I'd rather play that than the last two games we just said talked about.

[28:58] Yeah.

[28:59] Yeah.

[29:00] You know what this game needs?

[29:01] It needs Mick on a stick.

[29:02] It would have made it that much better.

[29:03] It plays actual songs.

[29:05] Well, it plays satisfaction.

[29:07] Do do do do do so they were able to do that.

[29:10] They were able to pull that off.

[29:11] Yeah.

[29:12] People can't see, but I'm I'm shifting my shoulders.

[29:14] I'm just like, yeah.

[29:16] Now my brother, my brother is much older than I am.

[29:18] He's a half brother.

[29:20] He told me that he remembers playing this at the rec center in summer side of Prince Edward

[29:25] Island.

[29:27] And this is the game that his is his iconic childhood pinball thought.

[29:34] I got T2 and he got all these rolling stones.

[29:37] So I guess I got the better side of that one.

[29:40] It's not that bad.

[29:42] Rock and roll your way to profit with rolling stones, new hit features.

[29:46] Woo.

[29:47] Plus this actually has all the rolling stones on there.

[29:50] Clean the bass player who is not in the later stern one.

[29:54] They don't have officially have a bass player, I guess.

[29:57] Yeah, they just they just put a tape in.

[29:59] Well, I think they have the same guy.

[30:01] It's played one of the three years, but I don't know if he's a full member.

[30:04] One of those deals.

[30:05] So it has so it has the full group on the back glass.

[30:09] Um, it's got.

[30:11] Mick Jagger looks weird.

[30:13] Mick Jagger looks he's I mean, let's face it.

[30:15] Mick Jagger looks weird to begin with.

[30:18] Yeah, but he just he's got the arms back like he's sort of mid mid prince.

[30:24] You know, he's shaken his shoulders.

[30:28] He's always known for his iconic sort of big mouth.

[30:32] But it represents the license well.

[30:35] It's got all the songs on the plastics and things like that.

[30:38] The detail on the face is fantastic on all of the characters.

[30:41] The ones in the back end, Mick in the front.

[30:43] It's you know, Greg really spent a lot of time focusing on, you know,

[30:50] the real selling point of the art, which is them themselves, right?

[30:54] They were really big and popular and sex symbols, I guess, at the time.

[30:58] And he really knew that he, you know, if they don't look like the characters,

[31:02] this is all for naught.

[31:04] So it looks really, really cool.

[31:05] Now, try to remember, is this one rolling stones in the newer stern

[31:09] as the rolling stones or vice versa?

[31:11] Yeah, that's it.

[31:12] Yeah, I had it right.

[31:13] Okay.

[31:13] So this is actually rolling stones.

[31:16] Technically, the stern one that came out in the 2000s,

[31:19] that was the rolling stones.

[31:21] It's almost the bottom half of the play field is symmetrical, which I think is weird.

[31:27] The whole play field isn't symmetrical, but half of it is.

[31:30] It's got these really cool, sort of mini U turns over a star roll over what you're

[31:36] kind of need.

[31:37] I've never played rolling stones, but I feel like it's probably kind of fun.

[31:40] It's not bad.

[31:41] Not bad, okay.

[31:43] And I think it is.

[31:51] It's either the first, the first ballet game that used their new linear flipper design

[31:57] or the last ballet game that used the previous design, one or the other.

[32:02] Yeah, okay.

[32:03] Okay.

[32:04] Maybe it says it here.

[32:05] I don't think so.

[32:06] It's one or the other.

[32:07] You'll know if you go to Bipart's, they'll have, I want a ballet flipper Mac, and it'll

[32:11] have from this game to this game.

[32:13] And I know rolling stones is always one of the ones listed.

[32:16] Ah.

[32:17] So what?

[32:18] It's now it sells 5,700 units.

[32:20] That's sort of a poor seller, right?

[32:22] For now, well nowadays that would be a great seller.

[32:25] Yeah, that's true.

[32:26] But compared to the 10k plus, that's base invaders all the, yeah.

[32:31] I mean, this time, again, we're starting to see that sort of spin down a little bit,

[32:35] and we can see even from the sales numbers over at Williams, they're sort of suffering

[32:38] a little bit at the time too.

[32:40] They're not, you know, knocking it out of the park to use a nether cliche.

[32:45] The Union Jack on here is very nice, right?

[32:48] That's very iconic of this time of that sort of British invasion.

[32:53] And there are two cabinets out there.

[32:56] One of them with the correct color combination for the Union Jack on the front, and one of

[33:00] them with the incorrect version where the colors, the red and the blue are backwards.

[33:06] Damn Americans.

[33:08] Like get everybody else's flags, right?

[33:10] I won't even get into the World Cup soccer 94 where the flyer shows a picture of a football

[33:17] stadium with a football game going on as opposed to soccer.

[33:20] Ooh, that's awkward.

[33:22] Yeah, we're not good at that.

[33:25] The international market, not so much.

[33:27] Rolling stones was the first to use the linear flipper design, confirmed.

[33:32] So the stales are starting to sort of, let's say teeter a little bit, but how do we boost

[33:39] that up?

[33:40] Well, let's go out there.

[33:41] We've got the Rolling Stones, which is a great theme.

[33:44] We've got a knock off alien, which is a pretty good theme.

[33:48] Let's find something awesome here to really pump it up.

[33:52] And that's mystic from June of 1980.

[33:56] It's like a circus, magic, carnival, conatheme, George Christensen.

[34:06] I'm sorry, George Christian doing the design, art by Kevin O'Connor.

[34:14] This is a great game.

[34:16] I've never played this.

[34:17] Yeah, this has a unique rule set in the middle of the play field.

[34:20] Is that right?

[34:21] It does the tic-tac toe thing.

[34:23] It's got the grid in the center.

[34:25] It also has the wizard dude on the back glass, which has been used in multiple different

[34:32] pinball shows, artwork.

[34:35] They'll use that guy.

[34:37] He's very iconic.

[34:39] He's like a magician.

[34:41] And it does.

[34:42] It's got those awesome white gloves.

[34:44] Yeah, I've seen his face used in multiple pinball, like marketing materials for various

[34:49] shows, but it has a grid in the center.

[34:52] You're trying to complete the grid.

[34:55] It's kind of like OXO.

[34:59] You can, depending on which way it's toggled, you either get one character or another character

[35:05] in the space in the grid, and you want to get the same character all the way across.

[35:10] That grid changes what's chosen based on the drop targets.

[35:14] Is that right?

[35:15] Yeah, I think it slings actually.

[35:18] We'll toggle it back and forth to, if I remember.

[35:20] Okay, very cool.

[35:22] Very cool.

[35:23] The perspective, the interesting thing about this game is it had, it has an eye in it.

[35:28] And in the really early models, the eye was actually 3D thing.

[35:33] It was like recessed into the back glass.

[35:36] I've only seen one of those.

[35:39] It's at the Museum of Pinball and Bannon, California.

[35:42] It's the only one I've ever seen that actually has the original or the very early back glass.

[35:48] Yeah, if you remember Margaret Hudson, she is the person who posed for the eye in

[35:53] that back glass.

[35:55] Kevin O'Connor would say, Patla said, do whatever you want.

[35:59] I was buying magic books at the time and learning about Houdini and magic.

[36:04] So it was a magic theme.

[36:05] So literally, Kevin O'Connor must have loved working with him, Patla.

[36:09] Yeah.

[36:10] So every game, just do whatever you want.

[36:12] I don't care.

[36:13] Just get it just as long as it doesn't suck.

[36:14] And I mean, Kevin O'Connor, even his themes that aren't really that great, the art

[36:21] shines even though it's magic-y theme.

[36:26] But again, this iconic magician wizardy fellow, this was done with airbrush, but he was still

[36:34] using lacquer.

[36:35] We spoke a little bit about his experimentation in using lacquer paints and that it was not

[36:41] very good for you.

[36:43] And this is sort of in that era of him trying to figure out, is this something that we can

[36:48] do on a go-forward basis?

[36:50] It's also done with a black ink brush to add in all of the detail in that backlash.

[36:57] There's an earlier version actually, it has a blue cabinet and it has more yellow tones,

[37:03] as opposed to that.

[37:04] So if you've got one of those machines, keep your eye out.

[37:07] That could be worth $200 more.

[37:10] Now there was actually a production change in this machine to run and you're more of

[37:15] a mechanical kind of fellow.

[37:17] But that change was made to resize the long plastic next to the messenger ball lane.

[37:24] And that's to provide a hood over the stand-up target.

[37:27] So the messenger ball, if it was hit by a hard ball in play, would not jump the lane

[37:32] after hitting the target.

[37:33] Can you imagine that then making a game that needs an adjustment?

[37:37] That's on her, that never happens today.

[37:39] Imagine.

[37:40] How embarrassing.

[37:41] It has some of the early production backlash.

[37:46] So if you want to see what the eye looked like.

[37:48] Creepy.

[37:49] Now I've played a lot of the next game.

[37:52] Really?

[37:53] Hotdoggan, which is a very rare game.

[37:55] Yes, this is in my weekly league.

[37:59] Play it every week.

[38:00] This is all about bonus.

[38:04] All about your bonus multiplier.

[38:06] Trying to stay alive.

[38:09] And although it's really two shots, maybe it is a butt load of fun.

[38:18] And it's about moustaches and skiing.

[38:22] It looks like it has the guy from Future Spa, the totally ripped dude.

[38:26] He's now skiing.

[38:28] He's got out and out on the slopes.

[38:29] It also looks like the same guy.

[38:32] It's Winter Sports theme.

[38:34] July 1980.

[38:35] It's a wide body.

[38:37] Sales 2050 units designed by Gary Gait and Greg Ferres doing the artwork.

[38:43] Now I'm going to include a documentary from the CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,

[38:50] which is an archive from the late 70s where they talk about hotdoggan, which was another

[38:56] word for freestyle skiing.

[38:59] And it's a riot to watch that little video.

[39:01] That'll be in our show notes.

[39:02] I saw a very cool YouTube seminar from one of the old pinball conventions.

[39:11] You remember those, right, Ron?

[39:14] Well, remember, they still have those now because this show can be listened to any time.

[39:20] It's an historical show.

[39:22] There's nothing to do with current events.

[39:24] As far as everyone's concerned, there is no COVID.

[39:27] Everything is fine.

[39:28] Greg actually spoke about his Polaroid camera.

[39:31] So I don't have a Polaroid camera.

[39:33] Do you know what a Polaroid camera?

[39:35] Can you describe that from some of the younger folk here?

[39:37] Polaroid camera.

[39:38] It's just you take the picture and it comes right out of the camera and develops in front

[39:42] of you and you have your picture.

[39:44] It's sort of like how when you take a picture with a digital camera, you can just look at

[39:47] the picture right away.

[39:49] Because before, you used to have to send it off to a lab at your Walmart or photo studio

[39:54] and then a couple of weeks later, your pictures would come back.

[39:57] It's like a photo mat, yeah.

[39:59] They'd all be overexposed and not look very good and you wouldn't know.

[40:04] But a Polaroid camera would spit it right out and you just sort of shake it in the air

[40:09] and it would magically appear.

[40:11] You can get one of those now.

[40:13] It's like a Fuji film in tax or something.

[40:16] Super cool.

[40:17] You should get one of those young folk.

[40:19] Greg Fraer is head of Polaroid camera.

[40:21] What he would do trying to get perspective or focus on body parts like, for example, Margaret

[40:27] Hudson's eye from Mystic, take a picture with the Polaroid and then they would review it.

[40:33] Now they might use a different model for the face or for the inspiration.

[40:38] But if they're trying to get the perspective of somebody or body positioning, this Polaroid

[40:44] method was actually quite innovative.

[40:49] Greg has a huge stack of these old Polaroid camera pictures of people from Bali posing

[40:55] for some of your favorite back glasses.

[40:58] Greg himself modeled in the Polaroid for the back glass skiers in Hotdoggan.

[41:05] One day in the Bali factory, he set up a bunch of chairs and he laid on them strangely and

[41:11] awkwardly while somebody took a picture with the Polaroid camera.

[41:17] He in fact actually brought skis into work and stood on top of chairs upside down to

[41:23] get some photos.

[41:25] If you look at that back glass and you see those skiers doing their splits and flips and

[41:32] jumps, Greg Fraer has actually made those positions on chairs at the Bali factory.

[41:40] The days before health and safety.

[41:43] I think besides Hotdoggan's off the wall art, one of the coolest things is what's called

[41:51] the disappearing kick up mechanic on the right side.

[41:55] It's this really crazy mech.

[41:58] Have you seen one of those Ron?

[42:01] Hotdoggan's the one came I could think of that as it.

[42:03] I can't remember seeing it anywhere else.

[42:05] I'm sure it's probably on some old EM somewhere.

[42:07] The way it works is it's like this kick up.

[42:12] If you've ever shot into a kick out hole, it'll have an arm with a solenoid and it'll

[42:19] shoot the ball back up the play field once it falls in.

[42:23] If you shoot up to the top lanes in Hotdoggan, it goes through K in ski.

[42:29] It will raise up this post on the right side.

[42:34] Once the ball falls in there, it collects your bonus and then shoots the ball back up

[42:40] the play field.

[42:41] Then it disappears.

[42:44] The kicking arm pops up from the bottom of the play field and will disappear from the

[42:50] top of the play field after the bonus is collected.

[42:52] It's actually a very unique and complex mechanic.

[42:57] I'm surprised they didn't use it again because it was so neat, but it's probably due to

[43:02] cost.

[43:03] You want it up too.

[43:05] You don't want the thing to be disappeared or you will drain probably down the right side.

[43:10] Exactly.

[43:11] It will.

[43:12] My favorite part about this mechanic is the way that it will catch the ball, count down

[43:18] your bonus.

[43:19] It shoots the ball back up.

[43:22] It'll hit a pop bumper and come right back down and it'll come right back down just

[43:28] as the mechanic is disappearing under the play field and it will go right down the outlane.

[43:33] I swear and leave the room.

[43:37] Thanks a bunch, Gary Gaten.

[43:39] Ron, do you like beards?

[43:41] Beards are great, especially in the 70s.

[43:43] Do you like drinking a bunch?

[43:45] I don't drink actually.

[43:47] I know.

[43:48] Do you enjoy old medieval and mythical themes?

[43:52] Ah, not particularly.

[43:54] I'm failing here aren't I?

[43:56] Do you like long ships?

[43:58] Sure, long ships are great.

[44:00] Well, Viking is the game for you.

[44:04] July 1980, Standard Body, uh oh.

[44:08] 2,600 units designed by Jim Patler, artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[44:15] Conor stated he designed the artwork for this game, delivered to him as a white wood because

[44:19] he was reading Franz, Gunner, Begg, uh, why'd you give me this to read?

[44:25] I can't pronounce that name.

[44:27] That's because I couldn't say the name so I gave it to you.

[44:29] Ron's gonna beg Tossin's the long ships at the time.

[44:35] So what's again, he gets another play feel and like here.

[44:38] Do some art.

[44:39] The backlash is Kevin O'Connor's version of King Harold's Christmas feast.

[44:43] I love games about feasts.

[44:46] It was a feast where a fight broke out because they're Vikings and that's what they do.

[44:49] That's right, they just fight and pillage.

[44:52] This is the second time with the self-portrait.

[44:54] Kevin is next to the king.

[44:56] The character in green with a beard to the left of the fighters is a self-portrait by Kevin.

[45:01] Do you think that the ladies back then really wore dresses like that?

[45:05] No.

[45:06] It's not very historically accurate.

[45:08] Brook Shields is actually drawn in the background as one of the characters on the right.

[45:13] Next to the king, now Brook Shields, she was a large sex symbol at the time and she's

[45:19] probably best known for being famous as opposed to any work that she actually did.

[45:24] She was also in Blue Lagoon from 1980, which was a big hit, isn't that right?

[45:28] Yes, she was also in a pinball movie.

[45:31] Oh really?

[45:32] A very famous pinball movie.

[45:33] She was a pinball wizard.

[45:35] Look it up.

[45:36] Oh yeah.

[45:37] That's worth it, Google.

[45:38] She was also in, what was the thing that used to have every year?

[45:42] The circus of the stars where they'd have all the networks battle each other.

[45:46] She always did the same thing.

[45:47] She would walk across glass.

[45:49] Mmm, how...

[45:50] She did that like multiple years in a row, yeah.

[45:53] Scary.

[45:54] Now, this was all done with paint and brush and then with that four color process that

[45:59] we discussed in the previous episode, it was all put on to the back glass.

[46:04] Now Kevin, in this instance, wanted to stay away from airbrush and he wanted to have those

[46:12] brush strokes in his final piece of art.

[46:16] And I think that that was a very smart choice because it adds a lot of depth and adds a lot

[46:22] of sort of interesting features that are a bit different than when you sort of airbrush

[46:27] and everything is very smooth.

[46:29] Man, that guy's ripped on the back glass, holding that sword.

[46:33] Everyone's ripped back then.

[46:35] It's amazing.

[46:36] Man, I need to get on a treadmill.

[46:40] So do you like the outlines in that game?

[46:42] Oh, this is...

[46:43] See, this is the thing here, okay?

[46:48] I'm one of those people that very much prefers that very standard boring in-lane, out-lane

[46:58] kind of structure.

[46:59] I don't like silly things going on in the in-lanes in out-lane.

[47:03] Silly skill.

[47:05] You can save the ball.

[47:07] The out-lanes here actually give you a chance to save the ball.

[47:11] You can bounce it off a rubber and it'll go through a gate and save the ball if you

[47:16] time it right.

[47:17] I don't so much have an issue around that.

[47:20] I do have an issue with those pop bumpers that are so close to the in-lanes.

[47:24] Oh, man.

[47:25] Apologize to Viking.

[47:26] Apologize.

[47:27] You are a dragon.

[47:28] You are a dragon.

[47:29] You are a dragon.

[47:30] Power drains out of those things.

[47:31] Or it'll power hit the out-lane rubber and bounce it right back into play.

[47:33] It'll look super cool.

[47:35] It's got awesome drop targets on the left side, which are, I would say, in a really cool

[47:40] position because they're really close to one of those super dangerous pop bumpers.

[47:45] In the return, if it doesn't come down quite right, it's dangerous and you're shot up

[47:50] there.

[47:51] If it's not accurate, it's quite dangerous.

[47:53] It's a cool play field.

[47:54] I have played a Viking actually.

[47:56] I am a fan.

[47:57] I totally enjoy it.

[47:58] Although, when I played in tournaments a lot of times they'll remove the rubber from the

[48:02] out-lane savers.

[48:03] So you're screwed.

[48:04] You can't save it at all, which is kind of mean.

[48:08] And we'll see a lot of interesting choices when it comes to those in-lane and out-lane

[48:14] structures in the class of 1981.

[48:17] Oh, the next game.

[48:19] Now I think the next game is tons of fun.

[48:22] Yes.

[48:23] See, if you look at skateboard, skateboard is flash.

[48:29] It is literally the same play field with some stuff added.

[48:32] Now, it didn't sell quite like flash.

[48:34] This one sold 4,150 units.

[48:37] Classroom and is, if you look outside by side, there is no way skateboard exists without

[48:41] flash.

[48:42] It is the same play field.

[48:44] It's got the same plunge across the play field up to the top lanes.

[48:48] Upper flipper was moved back and down.

[48:51] So instead of being in front of or to the left of where the scoop is, it's now to the

[48:56] right of where the scoop is.

[48:57] Yeah, there's no repeatable top loop basically.

[49:00] One of the lanes was removed and replaced.

[49:03] They made the left upper section a little bigger and put drop targets there and added a

[49:07] flipper.

[49:09] The inner is in exact same spot.

[49:11] Five bank is in exact same spot.

[49:14] They changed the left side to make it non-standard.

[49:16] So you have the in lane is actually the out lane and the out lane is the in lane.

[49:21] And this also has the physical issue.

[49:24] If you trap on the right flipper and you do a quick flip and you can get the ball to roll

[49:28] back and go over the switch, the in lane switch, you do it like five, six times.

[49:35] It will light one of the targets for extra ball and then you hit the target and get extra

[49:38] ball and you can just play all day long.

[49:39] Oh, no.

[49:40] Yeah, that was no an issue with this game.

[49:43] So sometimes when it was in terms, they'd actually caught the in lane switch.

[49:47] What do you think of the art here?

[49:48] Art is awesome.

[49:49] I always love the art.

[49:51] Out of this world.

[49:53] Out of this world now it was actually done by Greg Ferris, Margaret Hudson and Kevin O'Connor.

[49:58] All three of them worked on this project.

[50:00] Greg did the back last.

[50:01] Kevin O'Connor did the play field artwork and Margaret Hudson did the plastics.

[50:05] Greg calls this a fill the line game.

[50:07] Someone gang up and we got to get this out fast kind of game.

[50:11] The van and the woman's chest were lifted from Greg's test back glass from his job interview,

[50:15] which we talked about in the previous episode.

[50:18] Yeah, it's so cool this one.

[50:21] And the back glass is really what stands out, I think the most because it just is like end

[50:27] of the 70s kind of cool.

[50:29] It's got buddy with a mustache.

[50:31] Oh, I have to have the mustache.

[50:34] Guy of course is ripped because just everyone's ripped then.

[50:38] It's got the van.

[50:39] It's very California cool.

[50:41] You got to have the van.

[50:42] We got surfboards, skaters, palm trees, maybe Tony maybe a young Tony Hawks saw this and

[50:48] decided to take up skateboarding.

[50:50] Who knows?

[50:51] Then actually, you know what?

[50:52] That's a true story.

[50:53] Yep, that's what Tony Hawks thought.

[50:54] He thought he played some skateball.

[50:56] It said, damn it.

[50:58] Skateboarding looks so cool.

[50:59] Yeah, little do you know.

[51:01] I think this is a stand up kind of game.

[51:06] Very cool.

[51:07] I know that this is the first game that Albert A. Gar over from the pinball nerds podcast.

[51:14] He had one of these for a while and he loved it.

[51:18] Absolutely loved it.

[51:20] And he thought that Claude Fernandez is probably one of the best forgotten pinball designers.

[51:27] But I think he's crazy.

[51:28] I think Mr. Fernandez had a bit of an issue with designs.

[51:32] Yeah, gripping off other designs, but I will say, although he did rip it off, it's actually

[51:37] a better game than flash.

[51:38] Oh, hot take.

[51:39] There's way more to do on the game.

[51:44] Another fill the line kind of game.

[51:47] And that's frontier from November of 1980 that we're just trying to close out the end of

[51:51] the year here.

[51:53] Another body sells 1,850 units.

[51:57] George Christian artwork again by Greg Ferris, Margaret Hudson and Kevin O'Connor.

[52:03] Greg Ferris told IPDB frontier was loosely based on the lifestyle and appearance of the

[52:08] husband of a Valley executive.

[52:10] Most people just thought we were riffing on the Grizzly Adam CV series.

[52:14] I thought it was supposed to be Kenny Rogers myself.

[52:16] He's so he's so manly in this thing.

[52:19] Let's look at this jump on IPDB, this backlash, it's like buddy with a beard and a fur jacket

[52:28] and a hat like a like a frontiersman hat.

[52:33] It's got he's on a horse.

[52:37] He's being attacked by looks like wolves.

[52:41] And it's like it's it's it makes me feel like I'm not very manly.

[52:47] I know this frontier is actually one of Stern designer Keith L. Wins favorite early

[52:55] solid state games.

[52:57] He actually has a frontier t-shirt he wears on occasion.

[53:00] Well I'll tell you what I'm expecting some frontier callback in the next Keith L. Wins

[53:07] game and hopefully it's a person being attacked by a bear somewhere on that game.

[53:12] As a grid of animals that I guess we're trying to kill the animals and I don't I never

[53:18] understood that I think you're trying to kill them as they go.

[53:21] But there's a frontier bonus.

[53:22] There's the there's multiple bonuses.

[53:25] You got to on the on the flyer I think they're really trying hard.

[53:33] Let's put it that way to pull that theme into this game.

[53:37] It's rugged entertainment from out of the pinball wilderness shoot for the den of predators

[53:44] and frontier track down the grizzly target ride for the right drop target bank.

[53:51] Yeah, it's I am it is it is something else.

[53:56] It's got in line targets on the left which lead up to the top lanes.

[54:01] It's got a orbit spinner.

[54:03] Yeah.

[54:04] Oh yeah.

[54:05] It's a weird sort of capture a hole at the top, but it's kind of in the it's behind a

[54:10] plastic and kind of a roundabout way.

[54:13] Looks like a neat game.

[54:14] They didn't make very many of them.

[54:16] So the art is great and probably one of the most recognizable features is the background

[54:20] sound which is crickets.

[54:23] It's literally cricket.

[54:24] Crickets and they will increase in intensity and number of credit crickets as you go further

[54:29] until it gets insane.

[54:32] It's awesome.

[54:33] It's got that death target there in the middle that's like shoot me.

[54:36] Yeah, that's that they should have called that the ballet target.

[54:40] It's not so many other games.

[54:42] The ballet death target.

[54:44] Actually one of the one of the pictures of the game on IPDB is from Keith Owen.

[54:49] Must have been his frontier or very cool pictures.

[54:53] He took down it down in the in the early production play field around that sort of bonus

[55:00] grid at the bottom was the den of predators.

[55:04] You've got a picture of all of the sort of the different predators you're collecting.

[55:10] You've got a I think frontier is probably one of the forgotten kind of interesting games

[55:17] out there.

[55:18] It's one of those ones where you're like, oh, that's different and weird.

[55:20] Within the hardcore community, it is not forgotten at all and usually commands a high

[55:25] price.

[55:26] We're about to peak here.

[55:27] Okay.

[55:28] When it comes to Paul Ferris and his entire art team, we're at the end of 1980.

[55:38] We're talking about the sci-fi theme, xenon.

[55:43] Cells 11,000 units.

[55:44] We are back in stock here, folks.

[55:49] We've got the design of the play field by Greg, Kamek.

[55:54] And I've written that out phonetically.

[55:56] Oh, so you've got a few comments about how I say that.

[56:01] Music and sound by Suzanne Choney, who was a very famous electronic music composer at

[56:08] the time and artwork by Paul Ferris.

[56:12] Tom Neiman would say at Expo 2013, xenon was an unusual opportunity because it was a

[56:17] property with no immediate brand identity.

[56:21] And do you know what's special about xenon?

[56:25] It's the first ballet game to do this.

[56:28] Talk.

[56:29] And they were a little behind there because you had Williams had Gorgar in 1979 talk and

[56:33] we're at the end of 1980 and Ballet's finally getting their games to talk.

[56:38] Tom Neiman would say that it was the license that usually brought the first quarter in

[56:43] pinball and then it was the designer and the gameplay that kept those quarters going

[56:47] in.

[56:48] Well, they needed that sound and that art to draw you in because they didn't have a license.

[56:53] Paul Ferris would describe the world of xenon.

[56:56] He says it was the theme was a female alien in a futuristic world tied the theme into

[57:01] transformation and exotic and mechanical world.

[57:06] And they made sure to show her butt, you know, art.

[57:09] Because that helps.

[57:10] Yeah.

[57:11] Because the third pinball machine that I owned, I bought one that needed to be broken down

[57:17] and fixed.

[57:18] It had mice living in it.

[57:20] No.

[57:21] I have a special place in my heart for this.

[57:24] And in fact, I would really love to have one back.

[57:28] I think this is one of just the most iconic games of the 1980s because it's so unique and

[57:35] different and weird.

[57:36] And I think some of that comes down to the design by Kamiq.

[57:40] But the art is the selling feature and it's the sound that drives it home.

[57:46] So let's break down each one of those sections.

[57:48] I have my own xenon story.

[57:50] I remember Xeon specifically as a little kid because I remember being scared of the back

[57:56] glass.

[57:57] That's awesome.

[57:58] Because they had this at the tavern my father went to and they'd only have one game

[58:03] there and they rotate like new games in on a regular basis.

[58:07] And I just remember this one specifically because it just freaked me out that back

[58:11] glass.

[58:12] It's very cool.

[58:13] So let's break down each section.

[58:15] So we'll start with Kamiq's design.

[58:18] So one thing when I purchased this game that I was specifically told is there is a hidden

[58:23] red post up on the top left and Kamiq did this on all of his games.

[58:29] And I was told by the person who I was buying it from to repair it that if I threw that

[58:34] post out, he would hunt me down.

[58:37] Yeah.

[58:38] I have a Harlem Glove Trotters and it's on there.

[58:41] But Harlem actually has red post but it's like a different red post than all the other red

[58:45] posts.

[58:46] It's like a solid colored red post.

[58:48] Yeah.

[58:49] You put those in all of his games.

[58:50] I love that.

[58:51] So try the tube shot was one of the sort of the unique bits to this game where on the

[58:57] right side, you shoot it up this sort of clunky kind of ramp by some drop targets.

[59:03] It goes through this weird tube to the left, falls down literally just this little ramp

[59:10] and into a hole.

[59:12] Very, very neat.

[59:14] Every game needed a thing.

[59:16] And this was Zeynone's thing.

[59:18] It also had an infinity back box just like space invaders with lights that kind of go

[59:25] around a piece of glass in the front.

[59:29] And then behind it, the back glass with a bit of mirroring, super, super, super cool.

[59:35] Let's try to paint some word pictures when it comes to the art of this machine.

[59:45] Try a tube shot.

[59:47] Let's start with the back glass.

[59:49] And the back glass is like a blue female alien with big, you know, bold eyes and shoulders.

[01:00:00] It looks like you're looking into a tube.

[01:00:03] And that's really that infinity back glass creating this sort of sense of distance.

[01:00:09] Very cool.

[01:00:10] There's a lady in front that's looking at the Zeynone character.

[01:00:15] And then there's two people like floating down the tube.

[01:00:20] It's very cool.

[01:00:22] I can see why they scared the crap out of you though.

[01:00:25] Yeah.

[01:00:26] I think her eyes scared me.

[01:00:28] The play field is really insane too.

[01:00:32] You've got the Zeynone woman in the middle with your bonus countdown in a circle.

[01:00:39] And they're using blue inserts on the bonus instead of your sort of standard whites.

[01:00:45] It's got the best butt in pinball down there right between the flippers.

[01:00:51] There's two people floating up the ramp to go through the tube just like in the back glass.

[01:00:57] There's like an alien with naked breasts looking up into the pop bumpers.

[01:01:04] There's weird, weird things going on in here.

[01:01:09] What about the orbit on the left side with the spinner?

[01:01:12] What do you think of that?

[01:01:13] Through the spinner.

[01:01:14] There's like a man transforming from an alien into a person.

[01:01:19] I think this game is all about the look in the sound more than the gameplay.

[01:01:25] Oh absolutely.

[01:01:26] You're not going to see, especially with, I don't know, tournament players.

[01:01:30] It's not considered a great player, but it's definitely one of those experience games.

[01:01:35] Yeah.

[01:01:36] Ever like the whole sound package, the art package is very unique.

[01:01:40] And it's not like anything else that has existed.

[01:01:44] It's all about shoot that scoop at the top, right?

[01:01:47] That's the thing.

[01:01:48] That's the thing.

[01:01:49] And it has multi ball, not just speech.

[01:01:52] It's awesome.

[01:01:54] It's so awesome this game.

[01:01:55] I'm telling you.

[01:01:56] And it paid off.

[01:01:58] Gameplay like you said, not so much.

[01:02:00] We've often had these issues with Bali where the use of the female form and women in general

[01:02:08] has always been a bit of an issue.

[01:02:11] This game is a bit different, wouldn't you say?

[01:02:14] Well, Paul Ferris says, one thing I wanted to make clear was that we sometimes get grief

[01:02:19] about having women on our games and subservient roles.

[01:02:22] I wanted to ensure that the woman was not subservient.

[01:02:25] Xenon would be eight foot tall.

[01:02:28] She had this wonderful voice, blue skinned, large eyes, highly intelligent, highly evolved

[01:02:34] woman.

[01:02:35] So it wasn't lost on them that they were getting that critique in that commentary of the

[01:02:39] use of like the slave woman in Paragon and that kind of stuff.

[01:02:44] That wasn't lost on the artists at the time.

[01:02:46] So it's interesting that they said, okay, well, let's make the woman the powerful character

[01:02:51] in this example.

[01:02:53] But let's also put a woman at the bottom with the best but I've ever seen.

[01:02:56] The other thing is the sound on this game was so much better than any sound before.

[01:03:03] Because Williams had the sound samples.

[01:03:06] It would be seven to ten words and they would just record them one at a time.

[01:03:11] And they'd piece them together.

[01:03:12] And they'd piece them together, fire, power, destroyed, you, you know, those were all just

[01:03:17] separate words.

[01:03:18] I am the black knight.

[01:03:20] Yes.

[01:03:21] This game, they're full senses, full senses.

[01:03:26] Try a tube shot.

[01:03:27] Exit pilot one.

[01:03:29] Exit pilot two.

[01:03:30] Tom Neiman, he would say that Xenon didn't have that first quarter appeal of a license.

[01:03:35] But we could bring to life was a concept.

[01:03:38] What we couldn't do with visuals, we could do with sound.

[01:03:42] And they leveraged what they called the soundboard and the vocalizer board versus what would

[01:03:49] come in the future called the squawk and talk.

[01:03:51] Yes.

[01:03:52] They had the vocal, the vocalizer module and the sounds plus module.

[01:03:56] Actually, this sounds plus on it.

[01:03:58] And I would say Xenon probably sounds better than most of their later games because they

[01:04:03] combine the two boards into one squawk and talk board.

[01:04:06] And it just didn't sound as good in my opinion.

[01:04:09] The real foundation to the sound and voice of this game was, as I mentioned before, Suzanne

[01:04:15] Kianti.

[01:04:16] Suzanne Chiani, who was an American musician, sound designer, composer, and recording label

[01:04:23] executive, who found early success in the 1970s with her innovative electronic music and

[01:04:30] sound effects for films and television commercials.

[01:04:33] Her career included works with quadrasonic sounds.

[01:04:38] She had been nominated actually for a Grammy Award for best new age album, five times.

[01:04:46] Her success with electronic music has her dubbed the Diva of the Dio and America's first

[01:04:52] female synth hero.

[01:04:55] The first female voice in a pinball machine was Suzanne herself.

[01:04:59] And female voices were generally not used, Ron, in sound boards because the higher pitch

[01:05:06] of a female voice meant that it needed twice as many bits of information to be saved.

[01:05:12] That's why Williams just used a deep Steve Richie for everything they ever did.

[01:05:18] In 2013, Suzanne Chiani was instructed into the pinball expo Hall of Fame for her work

[01:05:24] on Xenon.

[01:05:25] I was there.

[01:05:26] Actually I have a video of that seminar.

[01:05:28] If you were, if you actually attended that seminar, I'm going to clue that in the show

[01:05:31] notes so you can relive it, Ron.

[01:05:33] She does the voices.

[01:05:34] You can hear it again in person.

[01:05:36] Live.

[01:05:37] It's one of the cool parts of the game is the way that the sound effects and the voice

[01:05:46] are all included.

[01:05:48] It's rather triatube shot.

[01:05:56] One thing for sure, the sound that is in the game along with the voice is certainly very

[01:06:06] intimate, passionate.

[01:06:09] It's really, really something else.

[01:06:14] I don't know if that was the full intent of the game because it was all about transformation

[01:06:21] and space.

[01:06:22] It just came out that way, I think.

[01:06:24] But it does add to why I think the game is so cool.

[01:06:28] What do you think about the sound in an overall sense?

[01:06:32] The sound package is one of the highlights of the game.

[01:06:34] If you didn't have the sound and you were just going on artwork and play style, playfield,

[01:06:40] I don't know if this game is the ultimate package that it is.

[01:06:46] Great mix names on the playfield.

[01:06:51] If you think about that, there's a KMIEC and that appears near the right flipper, which

[01:06:57] is an acronym for Kinetic Molecular Integrated Evolution Cylinder.

[01:07:05] I love that.

[01:07:09] Stay over the top.

[01:07:11] And Margaret Hudson's name also appears.

[01:07:13] Hudson appears on the other side, near the left flipper, near the head of the robot.

[01:07:19] Margaret Hudson did most of the artwork for the playfield.

[01:07:21] We mentioned in the previous episode that they experimented with four color printing

[01:07:27] processes on playfields and Bally tried to come up with a method where they printed

[01:07:32] the artwork on Mylar and then attached that to the playfield as a cost-saving measure.

[01:07:38] Well it turned out that it was very difficult to actually get it to go around the inserts

[01:07:43] and the overlay didn't quite work.

[01:07:45] Almost like a hard top today.

[01:07:47] Now if you look that up on Pinside or something.

[01:07:49] The first hard top.

[01:07:51] One thing that I spent a lot of time researching here was trying to find some more information

[01:07:56] on the design of Xenon.

[01:07:58] And again it falls into a few of those Bally tropes.

[01:08:02] And it was originally called Saber Dance.

[01:08:05] Craig Kameck spent a lot of time playing with different inserts on this machine which

[01:08:09] is a bit different.

[01:08:10] He used blue inserts instead of the traditional yellow and white.

[01:08:14] And then he added the tube.

[01:08:17] And then when he passed it off to Paul, Paul looked at it and said, oh this has to be

[01:08:21] space theme.

[01:08:22] Look at this tube.

[01:08:23] This is, I think the rest is history.

[01:08:25] It's an awesome, awesome, all around package.

[01:08:28] Could have been better like some games.

[01:08:31] But I think this is, if you've got a chance to play one, give it a go.

[01:08:35] It is lots of fun.

[01:08:36] Everything's a metaphor.

[01:08:37] Although technically not part of the Bally Class of 1981, I have to say that Xenon was

[01:08:44] really the beginning of that trend.

[01:08:48] Now we're moving in to 1981.

[01:08:51] The reason everyone is listening to this podcast this month.

[01:08:56] Flash Gordon is the first game out of the gate in February 81.

[01:09:00] It's a movie license, sci-fi theme.

[01:09:03] It is a standard body, buy level game, 10,000 units, and it's designed by Claude.

[01:09:10] I stole this idea from Steve Richie for Nandes and artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[01:09:16] Did you see the Flash Gordon movie, Ron?

[01:09:19] Oh, yeah.

[01:09:20] How do you summarize that movie to somebody who's never seen it before?

[01:09:23] Ah, weird.

[01:09:24] Don't take it seriously.

[01:09:27] There's like flying hawk men and it's very colorful.

[01:09:33] James Bond is in it, or future James Bond.

[01:09:36] Oh, yeah, Timothy Dalton.

[01:09:37] I love Timothy Dalton.

[01:09:39] The best character is the leader of the hawk man.

[01:09:42] Was it Voltaan?

[01:09:43] I think that was his name.

[01:09:44] Oh, and the music is by Queen, which is incredible.

[01:09:47] That's the other thing.

[01:09:48] Yeah, this sort of period in sci-fi movies, everything is like a space opera.

[01:09:55] We mentioned it when it came to the Star Trek pin, when it came to Star Trek the motion

[01:10:00] picked off.

[01:10:01] I wasn't going to mention that movie ever again.

[01:10:04] Anyway, movie studios were looking for sci-fi themes that they could make into a space opera

[01:10:10] like Star Wars.

[01:10:12] This is what they came up with was a Flash Gordon comic strip by Alex Raymond.

[01:10:19] As you mentioned, Queen did the music.

[01:10:21] The whole film cost 20 to $27 million to make.

[01:10:26] It had a 27 million worldwide box office out, so it probably didn't make money.

[01:10:35] It holds an 83% rotten tomatoes fresh rating, though, which kind of confuses me.

[01:10:40] The audience score on rotten tomatoes is 69%.

[01:10:44] And usually the audience score is higher than what the critics say.

[01:10:48] So that's a whole thing.

[01:10:50] I haven't seen Flash Gordon.

[01:10:52] I guess if you go in like you said to just have a good time and don't expect to think

[01:10:58] too much.

[01:10:59] Oh, you've never seen the movie fail.

[01:11:01] Never.

[01:11:02] You go out to see the movie.

[01:11:04] So what's some of the controversy around this game?

[01:11:07] Well, Steve Richie claims that Claude Fernandez stole the by-level design from Black

[01:11:12] Night.

[01:11:13] This Claude was working at Williams at the time, and when he left for Bali, he basically

[01:11:17] saw Steve Richie's concept for the by-level game, and Steve believes he stole it.

[01:11:23] Did you think he actually stole it?

[01:11:25] I mean, it's a different type of by-level to explain.

[01:11:29] It Williams by-level game.

[01:11:31] They use two different sheets of wood.

[01:11:35] You can hit shots that go under the upper play field.

[01:11:37] Bali, they did the cost saving method, which is you just take a play field, and if you're

[01:11:43] going to make an upper part, you cut it where that part's going to go up.

[01:11:46] You have ramps that go up there.

[01:11:48] So you'll notice games like Flash Gordon and their other by-level games.

[01:11:51] You can't go underneath the play field.

[01:11:53] And the ramps fall from one sheet.

[01:11:56] Yes.

[01:11:57] There is a Flash Gordon in my league as well.

[01:12:01] I don't particularly like it.

[01:12:04] I very much prefer Black Night.

[01:12:07] It is the better game, obviously.

[01:12:09] I can see there's some influence there, but when I look at Claude Fernandez's list

[01:12:14] of games and we've got a game like Blackout, he's not this crazy innovative guy that

[01:12:21] just comes up with these concepts, right?

[01:12:23] He's not an all-time designer, in my opinion, like a Steve Richie or even a John Borg who's

[01:12:30] come up with some kind of neat things here and there.

[01:12:33] To be fair, he came up with Electra, which is a three-level game.

[01:12:37] I mean, I don't know if he snagged this idea or not, but I would say it is quite

[01:12:44] convenient that somebody who has never really made really great games somehow comes up with

[01:12:49] at the same time one of the most innovative things of the early eight.

[01:12:54] That's not fair.

[01:12:55] Blackout's a good game.

[01:12:56] Blackout is good.

[01:12:57] It's got three spinners.

[01:12:58] No, multiple, no lane change.

[01:13:00] The thing about this is maybe he ripped off one of the ramps, but I've never, other than

[01:13:07] it being by-level, I've never played Flash Gordon and said, oh, total rip off of Black

[01:13:10] Night.

[01:13:11] No, no, no.

[01:13:12] I'm supposed to play Skateball where I look at that and like, this is Flash.

[01:13:18] This is completely Flash.

[01:13:19] That's way more of a rip off.

[01:13:21] I wouldn't say the shots are the same, but I would say that the idea of raising the

[01:13:26] play field up and having a by-level design was totally stolen.

[01:13:30] Right.

[01:13:31] Like, who would it, like, when we did our Steve Richie episode in the pilot, in our first,

[01:13:38] in our first pilot episode with Steve Richie before the mullet, we spoke in depth

[01:13:42] very much about how many whitewoods he did over and over of Black Night.

[01:13:48] When you play it, you can feel that.

[01:13:51] You can feel that it's a very refined type of design and play field.

[01:13:56] When you play Flash Gordon, you can tell that it is not refined.

[01:14:03] It is like there's something, whatever, what makes Black Knight special is missing in

[01:14:09] Flash Gordon.

[01:14:10] Opinions expressed by David Dennis.

[01:14:14] Not necessarily reflect those.

[01:14:15] That's right.

[01:14:16] So if I ever go to pinball expo or something like that and somebody sees Claude Fernandez,

[01:14:22] please tell me who that individual is so I can avoid them and they don't punch me in

[01:14:26] the throat.

[01:14:27] Well, the thing Claude has been at expo multiple times when Steve Richie's been in the

[01:14:31] same room and nothing's happened.

[01:14:32] So I don't think it's that big.

[01:14:34] Oh, okay.

[01:14:35] Good.

[01:14:36] I just don't want to hurt his feelings.

[01:14:37] I just don't want to hurt his feelings.

[01:14:40] The same reason that Zach many never says anything mean about Duster.

[01:14:45] They had to do this quickly.

[01:14:47] They didn't have a lot of time to do this game and they wanted to get it out when the movie

[01:14:51] was out or at least close.

[01:14:53] Everybody loves mirrored back glasses.

[01:14:55] Kevin O'Connor actually signed his name in mirror on the back glass and he is actually

[01:15:01] quite proud of that fact that he was able to get that in there.

[01:15:05] And at the time, the movie Flash Gordon had like a lot of pizzazz and Kevin wanted to

[01:15:11] bring some of that pizzazz to the art.

[01:15:13] And I think he did that.

[01:15:16] It's black and reds.

[01:15:18] It's the mirror on the back glass.

[01:15:22] The painting really stands out on this piece.

[01:15:25] It really, really blows all of the other things out of the water.

[01:15:32] Some of the design items that were actually changed on this was that Flash Gordon originally

[01:15:35] instead of those in line drop targets, it was supposed to be a capture kind of not a

[01:15:40] capture.

[01:15:41] Scoop supposed to be a scoop.

[01:15:43] It has the two way kick out between the pops, which is actually pretty cool.

[01:15:47] The last time that was used was in 1950 on Gottlieb's Rockets.

[01:15:51] But when you put the ball into the scoop, sometimes it shoots down the playfield.

[01:15:55] Sometimes it shoots up a little ramp into the top playfield, which is very cool.

[01:15:59] In the light swallet, you know, which way it's going.

[01:16:01] So you're not surprised.

[01:16:03] This is the first game that uses the new single Squawk and Talk soundboard versus the

[01:16:08] Bally vocalizer and sound plusboard that they used in Xenon.

[01:16:12] However, if you have a very early Flash Gordon, it will have the vocalizer and sound plus

[01:16:17] boards.

[01:16:18] And it will sound much better than the later Squawk and Talk board.

[01:16:21] Yeah.

[01:16:22] I sent a sample to Dave.

[01:16:25] I will include the link to that in our show notes if you actually want to listen to it.

[01:16:29] It's a person pushing the sound test board.

[01:16:31] But I got to say, it sounds so much better.

[01:16:36] You can actually understand him clearly.

[01:16:38] Ignite death rays, 15 seconds.

[01:16:41] It's like, wow, is that what he's supposed to sound like?

[01:16:44] Very impressive.

[01:16:45] It's very, very nice.

[01:16:48] And the other thing is the strobe light.

[01:16:50] Oh, yes.

[01:16:51] So in the back glass where it says Flash, it's strobes and blinks.

[01:16:56] It's actually quite complicated and dangerous if you touch it.

[01:16:59] Yeah, it's got a big strobe light in the center, which when I listened to Cloth Hernandez

[01:17:04] speak at Expo, he said how there was, that was removed very early in the run.

[01:17:09] And there's very few Flash Gorns that have that, which is not really true.

[01:17:14] As in most Flash Gorns, I've seen do have that.

[01:17:18] It almost never works, but it's almost always there.

[01:17:22] And if it is, if it is working, usually it eats away at the art of the back glass because

[01:17:27] it's so bright.

[01:17:28] I love the spinner sound.

[01:17:31] When you get those spinners lit, so you drop down the left, drop targets and it lights

[01:17:37] your spinner and you drop that again, it lights the other spinner.

[01:17:39] It has just the coolest spinner sound.

[01:17:42] It just grinds on and on.

[01:17:45] And the thing to remember is it's a different era.

[01:17:49] Like if you look at the artwork is primarily red.

[01:17:51] And you look at the back glass that has the stars in there.

[01:17:55] It has, I think it was Max von Sido, who was Ming, the merciless Sam Jones himself as

[01:18:02] Flash Gordon.

[01:18:04] And none of these actors were like, oh, you read you the back glass.

[01:18:08] I don't like the way this looks.

[01:18:09] Yeah.

[01:18:10] And we're just happy to be on a game.

[01:18:11] Like I'm in a pinball machine.

[01:18:13] This is awesome.

[01:18:14] Of course.

[01:18:15] It's, it's, could you imagine being on a pinball machine?

[01:18:18] And they're all on there.

[01:18:19] I just know it's Voltaan.

[01:18:20] Timothy Dalton is on there.

[01:18:21] I can't remember his character's name.

[01:18:23] Timothy Dalton's character is Timothy Dalton.

[01:18:25] The plunge is really cool.

[01:18:26] It goes up and around over these roll overs.

[01:18:29] But one thing that's really annoying is that you got to kind of soft plunge it up there

[01:18:34] or it gets going too fast.

[01:18:36] But when it releases the switch in the shooter lane, it goes Flash.

[01:18:44] And then it'll roll back down.

[01:18:45] And then you pull it again.

[01:18:46] It goes Flash.

[01:18:48] Is that great?

[01:18:49] Oh, it's so annoying.

[01:18:50] Oh, it's great.

[01:18:51] Emperor Ming awaits.

[01:18:52] Emperor Ming awaits.

[01:18:54] Yeah, it's cool.

[01:18:55] It's, it's cool.

[01:18:56] But it's like, I mean, it's too hard.

[01:19:00] It's so deadly.

[01:19:01] Every shot is dangerous.

[01:19:03] There's not an easy shot.

[01:19:04] According to Cloud Fernando, there wasn't really a white wood.

[01:19:06] It was just one shot.

[01:19:08] This is it.

[01:19:09] Boom.

[01:19:10] No time for real refinement.

[01:19:11] Wow.

[01:19:12] It's out the door.

[01:19:13] Wow.

[01:19:14] You can tell, okay?

[01:19:15] Yeah.

[01:19:16] Oh, look at that.

[01:19:17] There's a pop bumper on the top.

[01:19:18] I play field.

[01:19:19] I've never seen that before.

[01:19:20] Yeah.

[01:19:21] And I play, I literally play this every week.

[01:19:22] And I have not noticed that before.

[01:19:23] I was at a three pop bumpers, not two.

[01:19:25] Wow.

[01:19:26] They could have saved some bomb on that if they just took it out.

[01:19:29] Huh.

[01:19:30] Well, the best plastic probably of the era is the one that sits just above the pop bumpers

[01:19:37] on the lower play field to the left.

[01:19:40] There's, it's, it's almost like a window and people are sitting at a table like a conference

[01:19:46] room table and an evil layer.

[01:19:48] And on the screen is, is, uh, general Ming and it's, it's, Emperor, I'm sorry, Emperor

[01:19:57] Ming.

[01:19:58] It's like a, Emperor of the universe.

[01:19:59] Get it right.

[01:20:00] It's like a 3D kind of look.

[01:20:02] It is, it is super cool.

[01:20:03] If you can see, if you can see this machine play it, but, uh, it's really, really, really

[01:20:09] hard.

[01:20:10] This was actually in the pinburg final last year.

[01:20:13] And they made a lot of them speaking of classic games.

[01:20:17] Ron, do you like moustaches?

[01:20:19] Do I like moustaches?

[01:20:20] Of course.

[01:20:21] Especially in pinball.

[01:20:22] Do you like cowboy hats?

[01:20:23] Uh, I'm not really into cowboy stuff, but I'm sure, yes, cowboys are great.

[01:20:27] Do you like riding mechanical bulls?

[01:20:30] Hell yeah, urban cowboys, my favorite movie of all time.

[01:20:33] Well, eight ball deluxe is the game for you.

[01:20:37] It's pool and cowboy theme.

[01:20:39] This is April of 81, 8,250 units.

[01:20:42] So still a really high seller, but significantly lower than the last two, designed by George

[01:20:47] Christian, artwork by Margaret Hudson.

[01:20:51] There's a new name.

[01:20:52] Well, not new, new.

[01:20:54] We haven't heard of this a lead.

[01:20:55] Uh, now Margaret Hudson, through all of the interviews, any time that Margaret Hudson comes

[01:21:00] up in any of these interviews, it's always about her being super detailed and a really

[01:21:06] hard worker.

[01:21:07] And she was the production assistant for Paul Ferris and Kevin O'Connor.

[01:21:13] And this was her first solo machine where she ran the whole show as the lead artist.

[01:21:18] I think the fact that she was super detailed at a very hard worker was very much why she

[01:21:23] was such a good production assistant.

[01:21:25] We mentioned in the last episode that when you're doing what they call a key line and ruby

[01:21:32] lifts and all of those things, you're slaving over a hot light table.

[01:21:37] You have to be calm.

[01:21:39] You have to be a detail oriented person.

[01:21:41] And I think that's why she excelled so well in the pinball industry as an artist and why

[01:21:48] she was given the lead for something like this.

[01:21:51] So who was Margaret Hudson, Ron?

[01:21:52] She started right out of college, Southern Illinois University.

[01:21:57] Her first job at pinball, she answered an ad in the newspaper and they needed a graphic

[01:22:01] artist.

[01:22:02] She needed a job, had no experience and didn't care if it was pinball or not.

[01:22:06] When she thought of pinball, she could maybe remember the dinosaur game.

[01:22:09] She was interviewed by Paul Ferris when Valley was building their in-house art department.

[01:22:14] Margaret says it's always been exciting when the interview for a job.

[01:22:17] I was willing to work in a factory to get a job so to get a job as an artist was amazing.

[01:22:22] She was a production assistant working multiple roles, getting art ready for production.

[01:22:27] She worked primarily with Paul and Kevin.

[01:22:29] Paul Ferris and Kevin O'Connor doing the finer points and finalizing production.

[01:22:33] Paul Ferris would say of Margaret that Margaret started doing play field separations by hand.

[01:22:39] She was an art major from Southern Illinois, very good, very detailed.

[01:22:45] She knew how to take on the role.

[01:22:47] She could screen with detailed art and I appreciated that.

[01:22:52] She could always do what needed to be done with top quality.

[01:22:56] And of course, Paul was ready to actually trust her with her own art project.

[01:23:01] And eight ball deluxe shows that she was truly something special because I think she did

[01:23:05] a great job on her first machine.

[01:23:08] As Margaret says, I got this game because no one wanted to do it.

[01:23:12] No one wanted to do an old pool game and it was my first chance.

[01:23:16] I worked really hard on it.

[01:23:17] Paul had a lot of input but it was my project.

[01:23:19] Yeah, why Cowboys and Pool?

[01:23:22] Because it was dictated to her that's what she was going to do.

[01:23:25] Cowboys and bars were very popular at the time.

[01:23:27] That would have been probably right around the time Urban Cowboy came out with the mechanic

[01:23:31] of ball and the country music and all that.

[01:23:34] Well, look, it's right in your notes.

[01:23:35] I didn't even see that.

[01:23:37] And I just said that before because it's the one movie I could think of that reminds me

[01:23:41] of eight ball deluxe.

[01:23:42] Yeah, she tried to draw women.

[01:23:45] Let's bring this back again to sort of women in pinball.

[01:23:51] And this is, I would say, the woman when it comes to art in pinball.

[01:23:57] How does somebody in an industry that's male dominated, focused on specifically getting

[01:24:03] quarters from adolescent men?

[01:24:08] How does she draw women?

[01:24:09] Well, through her interviews and things that I've read about Margaret Hudson was that

[01:24:15] she tried to draw women in a more wholesome way.

[01:24:18] She wanted them to be less objectified than the other artists at the time.

[01:24:23] And when you look at somebody like a Kevin O'Connor or even a Paul Ferris, of course,

[01:24:27] that is a sound critique of their artwork.

[01:24:31] Margaret says in the beginning, I was very idealistic and you think you can change everyone's

[01:24:36] way of thinking.

[01:24:37] I would get upset.

[01:24:38] We worked in the engineering department and they were all men, older men.

[01:24:41] You can't go into change the way people think of women.

[01:24:44] I just learn how to get along.

[01:24:46] Don't make waves and learn to laugh at things.

[01:24:48] I mean, it's a bit of a sad statement, actually, that she went in feminist or ish.

[01:24:58] And then eventually you're just beaten down, which is a bit sad.

[01:25:02] But I think it's because of women like Margaret Hudson that the use of women in pinball machines

[01:25:09] has significantly changed specifically in the last three to four years.

[01:25:14] And society is changing from where it was back then.

[01:25:18] And I think Margaret was probably part of the generation of women in important roles that

[01:25:25] would eventually influence where we are today.

[01:25:28] Margaret also spent a lot of time helping make changes to the art for production.

[01:25:33] And she was always a perfectionist.

[01:25:36] Most artists are always perfectionists.

[01:25:38] They'll always look back at the art projects they've done and say, oh, if I could just change

[01:25:42] this or add another brushstroke there, I think they would always do it.

[01:25:47] And it speaks to Margaret as that she's always a perfectionist.

[01:25:51] And when asked what she would change on a ball deluxe, she would say, some of the playfield

[01:25:57] I'd like to change.

[01:25:58] Some of it is a little too dainty and not as bold as I would have liked it.

[01:26:03] But it was my first playfield.

[01:26:05] Always the perfectionist.

[01:26:06] It must be tough to look back and always kind of want to change what you've done.

[01:26:10] If you remember we spoke earlier about Great Ferris and his Polaroids.

[01:26:14] Great Ferris is actually the model for the guy on the back glass.

[01:26:19] But it's not his face, but it's his body.

[01:26:22] If that makes any sense.

[01:26:23] When you look at it, it's like a cowboy shooting a pool ball and he's kind of looking directly

[01:26:29] at you.

[01:26:30] And then there's the ball and the cue and then the cowboy.

[01:26:33] And to get that perspective right, Greg worked with Margaret on taking the photo and then

[01:26:41] designing it.

[01:26:42] Now the model of the cowboy, the face and the thing was actually not Greg himself.

[01:26:46] And Margaret says the cowboy was modeled after a friend of mine.

[01:26:50] It was very common to put people you knew into the art.

[01:26:53] He just had the look I wanted.

[01:26:55] If you're just using your memory, you'll miss things.

[01:26:58] If you want to talk about really nerdy mechanical stuff, I mean the stuff that real

[01:27:03] Ali gets Bruce Knight and Gale, your friend from the slam till podcast excited.

[01:27:11] That is little bits and facts like this one.

[01:27:16] This is the first game by Bali to be manufactured using wedge sockets and triple five bulbs

[01:27:23] in production.

[01:27:24] Now there was another machine that they tested them out on, but this was the first production

[01:27:28] game.

[01:27:29] Hmm.

[01:27:30] I'd like to get more clarification on that one.

[01:27:33] Because I know the, because they redid this game twice.

[01:27:37] They had an Ellie version and then they had the 1984 version where they just did it again.

[01:27:44] The 84 version I know has all 555 bulbs in it.

[01:27:48] I'm just wondering if that's what they met.

[01:27:52] If anyone knows, they can email us at silverball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[01:27:58] That's right.

[01:27:59] And we will probably not read it out on the air.

[01:28:02] Oh, I will.

[01:28:03] Oh, hey, no.

[01:28:07] Okay.

[01:28:08] So let's tie a nice bow in on.

[01:28:11] Okay, let me, let me sum this up.

[01:28:13] I play eight ball deluxe in my league as well.

[01:28:16] It's a fun fun game on the right side.

[01:28:19] It's got all the drop targets representing the cue balls.

[01:28:23] It's got all the drop targets on the right side representing the pool balls.

[01:28:29] It's got some awesome inline drop targets on the left side, really, really tight shot

[01:28:35] between the orbit and it.

[01:28:37] It has a side flipper, which is a bit dangerous and useless.

[01:28:42] But at the same time, you use it a lot and it works.

[01:28:45] It's very, very unusual.

[01:28:48] It has, it has some very cool like cowboy art on the bottom.

[01:28:53] It's got like firing guns.

[01:28:56] It's kind of an iconic play field, isn't it?

[01:28:59] I'd say iconic play field, definitely iconic backlash.

[01:29:02] Everyone knows the backlash.

[01:29:04] This, I think this game inspired a lot of people to really love and play pinball and I

[01:29:10] think they still do today because of this game.

[01:29:12] Yeah, they reproduced this game as an LE.

[01:29:16] They reproduced it a third time and you have bad girls.

[01:29:20] It's a got leave game, which is basically this reversed.

[01:29:24] Durn also did Sharky shoot out, which is inspired by this.

[01:29:29] Very popular play field.

[01:29:31] It's, this brings us into the next theme, which is Embrionne, which is a sci-fi theme.

[01:29:36] It's June of 1981.

[01:29:38] It's a wide body, 2,250 units designed by Claude Fernandez, artwork by Tony Romoni, who

[01:29:46] is the first, his first pinball machine with Bally.

[01:29:50] Tony you'll remember from games like Alien Poker, Black Knight, and Bally's Motor Dome.

[01:29:57] This is another sort of alien movie-esque theme in backlash, isn't it?

[01:30:04] It's just weird.

[01:30:06] It's all around weird and it's not like scary weird, like space invaders.

[01:30:12] It's like creepy weird, like gas station sushi.

[01:30:17] Okay.

[01:30:19] You know, this game has the player in charge of some unspecified futuristic eugenics program,

[01:30:23] responsible for growing and birthing various multi-colored humanoids in organic pods.

[01:30:29] Yeah, it's weird.

[01:30:32] For a time of weird art, Tony Romoni really goes out of the, he certainly paints out of

[01:30:42] the lines on this one when it comes to weird.

[01:30:47] Like you're in a facility, so it's got like, you know, walls and metals and walkways

[01:30:54] and things on the play field, but then it also has like an egg in the middle.

[01:31:00] Would you say that in the middle of the play field, this looks...

[01:31:04] It looks like something, alright.

[01:31:06] Something that I won't say on the air.

[01:31:10] I don't think that's what it actually is.

[01:31:12] I think it's more of like an organic pod or something.

[01:31:17] I think it's less of what people think it is.

[01:31:21] But you hit it over and over again to build up, to spell embryon.

[01:31:25] Oh, maybe I'm wrong, then.

[01:31:28] It has speech, has multi-ball.

[01:31:32] It's a packed game.

[01:31:33] It's another one of their wide bodies.

[01:31:36] Now all wide bodies, of course, need a gimmick, right?

[01:31:39] Well this gimmick was that on the right outlaying, there's like a mini flipper that the player

[01:31:44] can control.

[01:31:46] Flip save.

[01:31:47] When your ball comes down that, it flips it through a one-way gate.

[01:31:51] They trademarked it.

[01:31:52] Flip save activated, even says it in the game.

[01:31:54] And if you don't hit it quite right, it's still going to go down the outlaying.

[01:31:58] Like if you hold it up and it rolls down, you actually have to flip it out.

[01:32:02] Yep.

[01:32:03] Does it work?

[01:32:04] Yep, it works.

[01:32:05] Wow.

[01:32:06] It's hard to light.

[01:32:07] It's one of those things.

[01:32:08] The thing in that game is it's hard to light that.

[01:32:11] It's hard to get multi-ball because you have to spell embryon by hitting the center a bunch

[01:32:15] of times without dying.

[01:32:16] Then you have to lock a ball.

[01:32:18] Then you have to hit down targets.

[01:32:20] Then hit a captive ball to try to hit into another target.

[01:32:23] It's just so convoluted.

[01:32:25] Yeah, people don't like hard games.

[01:32:27] Well you would never play it that way.

[01:32:28] All you have to do is hit it to the top right and then use that upper flipper and just

[01:32:33] hit targets and stuff and that's it.

[01:32:35] Just ignore the entire rest of the play field and you're all set.

[01:32:38] Ever played one, probably won't see one unless I go searching it out.

[01:32:43] 2000's not very many for this game.

[01:32:45] Does have very cool artwork.

[01:32:48] But I believe this was the last of their wide body series.

[01:32:52] Oh.

[01:32:53] Kind of ended.

[01:32:54] Let's have a moment of silence for the galley wide bodies of the 1980s.

[01:32:58] So we had, we started in the 70s into the 80s we had.

[01:33:01] I've never gone future spa with a space invaders hot dog in embryon.

[01:33:08] I'm missing one, I think.

[01:33:10] Probably missing one.

[01:33:11] This was the last one.

[01:33:12] Oh, it was right.

[01:33:13] The last wide body does.

[01:33:14] I'm saying these things before I read your notes.

[01:33:17] But the artwork is insane.

[01:33:19] You won't forget it.

[01:33:20] The original concept artwork is actually on IPDB if you want to take a look at it.

[01:33:25] Which is still weird, by the way.

[01:33:27] This brings this into a game that I've played a little bit and I enjoyed it.

[01:33:31] I don't think it has a lot of lasting appeal and that's Fireball 2.

[01:33:35] And it's a mythical demonic theme.

[01:33:39] June of 1981, Standard Body sells 2,300 units designed by Gary Gaiton and artwork by,

[01:33:49] oh, Dave Christensen.

[01:33:51] I thought we said he left the last episode.

[01:33:53] Yeah.

[01:33:54] Back to doing slats and stuff.

[01:33:55] What happened?

[01:33:56] So this game was done.

[01:33:58] The art for this game was done before he had left.

[01:34:02] And what's also interesting is he did the art for the original Fireball and Fireball Classic.

[01:34:08] Look at the fire on this one, Ron.

[01:34:11] This is part of the Bally Superhero series, which I've never heard of before.

[01:34:16] I've never heard of it.

[01:34:17] So Fireball, the Fireball guy, was actually a Bally Superhero.

[01:34:20] Yeah.

[01:34:21] Okay.

[01:34:22] I don't think they ever had a superhero after that in their Superhero series.

[01:34:28] But they did this time.

[01:34:30] It was a limited series.

[01:34:33] And look at this awesome, awesome catchphrase.

[01:34:37] It's a combustible combination of features.

[01:34:41] Whoa.

[01:34:42] I don't want to have that in my barn.

[01:34:43] Burn it down.

[01:34:44] That's crazy.

[01:34:45] It's actually a very good art package.

[01:34:47] Very red because it involves fire.

[01:34:51] The interesting thing about this game to me is what they used in the center.

[01:34:55] It has the ball underneath the play field that bounces up and down.

[01:35:00] When it counts down the boats.

[01:35:02] Yeah.

[01:35:03] Did they have a name for it in their marketing materials?

[01:35:05] Because I'm curious because that is from Doodlebog.

[01:35:10] It was a Williams innovation.

[01:35:13] It's animated captive ball feature.

[01:35:16] Okay.

[01:35:17] This was used in like Doodlebog, Dipsy Doodle, a series of games that Williams did in the

[01:35:22] early 70s that used this toy.

[01:35:25] And then actually Williams brought it back.

[01:35:27] They used it in Solar Fire.

[01:35:30] So obviously they didn't patent whatever this was because Valley used it.

[01:35:35] It's literally the same thing.

[01:35:37] Yeah.

[01:35:38] It sits in the middle of the bonus and there's like a little see through window.

[01:35:41] And when the bonus counts down it just sort of bounces up and down for no apparent reason.

[01:35:45] It pulses the magnet and the ball bounces up and down and it's cool.

[01:35:49] So I still call it a Doodle.

[01:35:51] No matter where it is, it's a Doodle.

[01:35:53] Yeah.

[01:35:54] It's a really tight close play field.

[01:35:57] Drop targets all around but they're really really close to the flipper.

[01:36:01] It doesn't have an orbit.

[01:36:03] It sort of, I mean, it has an orbit but it's not like most of the orbits of that Valley

[01:36:09] era where it goes up into the top.

[01:36:11] It's two ball and three ball, multi ball.

[01:36:14] Yeah.

[01:36:15] That's two ball.

[01:36:16] I'm trying to remember it's two ball but I know you can lock it.

[01:36:18] How you do?

[01:36:19] It does.

[01:36:20] It's multiple balls has speech.

[01:36:22] So we still got all the features going plus the extra little Doodle feature.

[01:36:27] Would you say that it's combustible combination of features?

[01:36:29] Yes, sure.

[01:36:31] It's combustible.

[01:36:32] And it says in the speeches weird.

[01:36:34] It says like zap, wow, bang, whatever when the game ends.

[01:36:38] During the call it's kind of cool.

[01:36:39] Forgot it has the little demon post.

[01:36:41] Yeah.

[01:36:42] It's basically a ball saver in between the flippers.

[01:36:44] And that's kind of a neat.

[01:36:45] It's like a player controlled little little post with a rubber.

[01:36:49] And instead of it having like the Kirk post in the middle or just a post with a rubber,

[01:36:54] it literally will smack it back up the play field.

[01:36:57] And you can build up the amount of little demon hits you can do.

[01:37:02] So you can use it multiple times through the game.

[01:37:04] And we might see it again.

[01:37:06] Ooh.

[01:37:07] Meaning in this episode probably a few games down.

[01:37:11] Hmm.

[01:37:12] Because another one of the class of 81 has it.

[01:37:13] The reason I did not like this game is that I am a bit of a pinball diva.

[01:37:19] And one of those things is in lane and out lane.

[01:37:22] And this thing is annoying when it comes to in lane and out.

[01:37:26] It has regular in lane and out lanes.

[01:37:28] It's just that shaped a little different.

[01:37:30] It will note.

[01:37:31] So it has an out lane and then there's a post.

[01:37:33] And then you got to kind of nudge it to get it to go through a gate.

[01:37:37] Yeah.

[01:37:37] Like it doesn't have a return lane that just kind of comes down and in.

[01:37:41] Or eat like I'm okay even if it's backwards, right?

[01:37:43] Where the out lane is the in lane and then the in lane is the out lane.

[01:37:47] We'll talk about that in a minute.

[01:37:48] But it doesn't quite, I don't know.

[01:37:51] It was so annoying.

[01:37:52] And I don't know.

[01:37:53] At the time I was like, I'm not a very good player.

[01:37:56] At the time I was even worse.

[01:37:58] And it really did not help.

[01:37:59] That was Fireball too.

[01:38:01] Very Christiansen ask the art when you look at it.

[01:38:03] You're like, yep, they Christiansen right out of the gate.

[01:38:06] No mistake in it.

[01:38:07] It looked nothing like every other artist at the time in the class of 81.

[01:38:11] Well, this is the one that everybody talks about now.

[01:38:17] August of 1981, its fantasy and water sports theme.

[01:38:22] No, not that water sports.

[01:38:24] It sells 3,500 units.

[01:38:27] It's designed by a gentleman named Ward Pemberton and artwork by Greg Ferris.

[01:38:34] Now listener to the show Pete says there has never been better artwork.

[01:38:41] This is arcade jewelry.

[01:38:44] He is correct.

[01:38:46] That's why this game sells for an exorbitant amount of money now.

[01:38:50] This thing sells more than Avengers premium.

[01:38:54] This sells for insane prices and it is primarily because of the artwork.

[01:38:59] It is not because of the gameplay.

[01:39:00] If you really want to experience the art of this machine and you absolutely think,

[01:39:06] man, this is the pinnacle of the pinnacle, just by a repro play field and stick it up on your wall.

[01:39:12] Because man, the price is that this thing pulls in.

[01:39:16] $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 US, that's just crazy talk.

[01:39:22] Now, a new name we've got on here is Ward Pemberton.

[01:39:25] Good old Ward.

[01:39:26] Ward, now his father worked at Valley Manufacturing for 22 years.

[01:39:32] And every now and then his dad would be able to bring a prototype back to the house to flip

[01:39:37] and to work on because he worked in the quality control section.

[01:39:42] And one game that Ward specifically remembers is one for some reason that pops up all the time

[01:39:47] is $4,000,000 BC.

[01:39:51] In high school, Ward took a drafting class, which eventually helped him get a job at Valley.

[01:40:00] His father introduced him to Norm Clark, who ran the design team,

[01:40:04] and they needed a junior designer to help them on the whitewoods and production oversight.

[01:40:10] In his own time, Ward would actually spend time doing his own play fields and own designs.

[01:40:17] He was, I guess the best way to describe Ward is he was like that solid backup designer.

[01:40:24] Not really your second string designer, but a third string designer.

[01:40:27] Somebody that you needed to fill the line, who always worked hard and always worked with a great team,

[01:40:34] positive outlook, super nice guy.

[01:40:38] But he was always for some reason the lowest person on the totem pole.

[01:40:42] And when Times got tough at manufacturers across his whole career,

[01:40:48] Ward was always the guy that somehow got the sh** at the end of the stick, you know?

[01:40:55] He did? Yeah.

[01:40:56] So when he was at like, he got canned from like Williams, like first,

[01:41:01] when he left Williams and at Capcom, he got in a fight with Python.

[01:41:07] I thought he just left Williams.

[01:41:08] I think in his interview, I got it on my note somewhere.

[01:41:11] I'll take a look, but I think he said that he was one of the first guys that was let go.

[01:41:15] Now the Fathom play field, if we take a look at just the design himself, it's cool,

[01:41:21] but I wouldn't say it deserves the accolades that it does get.

[01:41:25] It's a good play field, but it's not the greatest play field of all time that demands

[01:41:31] amazing return on investment when it comes to prices.

[01:41:34] But do you think Ron?

[01:41:35] That's cool features as the two bonuses.

[01:41:39] The whole top of the play field was re was used again in eight ball champ.

[01:41:45] The whole orbit, the spinner and the long gate up there.

[01:41:49] It's just literally copy and paste into eight ball champ.

[01:41:53] Who did eight ball champ?

[01:41:54] That's a good question.

[01:41:55] I probably should have known that before saying that, but that an eight ball champ is a really

[01:41:59] good game.

[01:42:00] George Christensen.

[01:42:01] Christian Christian.

[01:42:02] Yeah.

[01:42:03] Oh, George Christian.

[01:42:04] Yeah.

[01:42:05] But the artwork in the artwork in Fathom is insane.

[01:42:12] So for the Fathom play field, Ward Pemberton would say, you design a play field and if it

[01:42:16] played well, you'd put the rules and theme together.

[01:42:18] Great frayers came up with the theme.

[01:42:20] I like Greg sell the marketing team.

[01:42:22] He didn't have to give it to me.

[01:42:23] It's like Jim Patler, I think, was probably very instrumental in Ward's career because he

[01:42:31] had this very samey hands off approach, right?

[01:42:35] Just let the art and marketing guys do it.

[01:42:37] You focus on the play field.

[01:42:39] That's kind of neat.

[01:42:40] Now how does it actually play?

[01:42:41] Because I've never, I've been around a Fathom, but I've never played a Fathom.

[01:42:46] I believe it has the reversed in lane out lane.

[01:42:50] So you probably would not like it.

[01:42:51] No, I'm okay with that.

[01:42:53] I'm just not okay with the out lane.

[01:42:55] You have to nudge every time it goes into the out lane or you get screwed.

[01:42:58] That's okay.

[01:42:59] You're okay with their flop, but not if they're different.

[01:43:02] Yes.

[01:43:03] Okay.

[01:43:04] Yeah, not if they're totally different, just slightly different.

[01:43:07] One thing that I do think is cool about Fathom is you can backhand that spinner, which

[01:43:10] is kind of neat.

[01:43:12] You can forehand or backhand the spinner.

[01:43:14] And I love to be some spinners.

[01:43:16] There's a thick tube ball and three ball multi ball.

[01:43:19] There's the blue bonus and green bonus, I believe it's called.

[01:43:22] I'm going for memory here.

[01:43:24] It's got the fish spinner.

[01:43:25] It's got cool.

[01:43:26] It's got cool sounds.

[01:43:28] It's just the cool droning.

[01:43:29] Like you're under the water.

[01:43:31] Brrr, brrr, brrr.

[01:43:33] Very unique sound package.

[01:43:36] Die again.

[01:43:37] Look at the die of again.

[01:43:40] If you look at the very top of the play field, sometimes it's actually better to find

[01:43:43] an unpopulated play field to look at some of this stuff.

[01:43:46] You look at the very top of the play field.

[01:43:48] There is a woman who is on a dock looking down into the water and that's where all the

[01:43:53] other stuff is occurring.

[01:43:55] Yeah, it's like she's looking like over the boat or something and then she's a diver down

[01:44:00] there and there's the mermaid, the death mermaids.

[01:44:02] And of course this is 1981, so all the mermaids are topless.

[01:44:06] Yeah, because it's not a cold ocean.

[01:44:08] It's a warm ocean in your area.

[01:44:11] So and they're pulling them under even on the on the back glass.

[01:44:15] They're pulling them under ripping his hose out from his oxygen tank.

[01:44:20] His hose?

[01:44:21] Oh, his oxygen.

[01:44:23] This is more like my other podcast.

[01:44:27] But yes, that's fairly empowering.

[01:44:31] I would say they're basically the women are killing this guy.

[01:44:35] I don't know why they're killing him.

[01:44:37] They never explain why.

[01:44:39] I mean, is he just diving down there and they're like, this guy's in our space.

[01:44:43] Let's kill him.

[01:44:44] I never understood the story.

[01:44:46] Could be global warming.

[01:44:47] Like, why do they want this guy dead?

[01:44:48] I mean, was he maybe he was hunting other mermaids or something and you're getting revenge?

[01:44:53] That'll be cool.

[01:44:54] Yeah, it's super, super cool.

[01:44:56] I really always wanted to know the full story of it.

[01:44:59] Like, why are they cutting his hose?

[01:45:00] Why are they trying to kill this poor guy?

[01:45:02] What did he do?

[01:45:03] Oh, with the backwards return lanes, Jim Patlow was a big help with Ward.

[01:45:08] And Ward would say that the reason the return lanes were backwards the way they were is that

[01:45:14] he wanted a constant flow to the flipper.

[01:45:18] And it was much quicker if it went the other way.

[01:45:22] And he was always super humble and gave a lot of credit to others.

[01:45:27] Now it had, it had low sales at the time for such a pretty great game, especially one

[01:45:31] with some amazing harsh.

[01:45:34] And Ward would say, I was happy with the sales.

[01:45:37] There weren't many games at the time that were selling quite like that.

[01:45:41] And Greg Farris said it was a sleeper hit.

[01:45:44] We didn't expect it to carry such weight into the future like it has.

[01:45:47] I.E.

[01:45:49] Really expensive.

[01:45:50] Yeah, one of the most expensive out there.

[01:45:53] Now the name Fathom at Chicago Expo 2012, Greg Farris stated that Ward Pemberton's working

[01:46:01] title for the game was Barakuda.

[01:46:03] Sounds like a horrible name for a game.

[01:46:06] And Greg wanted to use the name Deep Threat.

[01:46:09] And both names were rejected by Balli Management and they settled on Fathom.

[01:46:14] And I think if it was called Deep Threat or Barakuda, I think it would reduce the impact

[01:46:20] of the game.

[01:46:21] I think Fathom is just a super cool name.

[01:46:24] Great Farris would say a lot of people think this is my best work.

[01:46:28] But it's not the style I use currently.

[01:46:30] I was 26 when I did that and I've learned a lot since then.

[01:46:33] And all the pieces I've done, I get a lot of kudos for this piece.

[01:46:36] There you go.

[01:46:37] Again, artists, right?

[01:46:38] There are always like these weird perfectionists that can't help it.

[01:46:42] They just need to find ways to improve their art.

[01:46:47] And no, don't touch it.

[01:46:48] Don't touch it.

[01:46:49] It's perfect.

[01:46:50] The backlash, in fact, let's go back again.

[01:46:53] Greg modeled for the individual on the backlash with the Polaroid.

[01:46:59] What's interesting is he didn't bring in a fish to tie around his body and take a photo

[01:47:05] with this Polaroid.

[01:47:06] Kind of the way the gentleman's arm is holding the mermaids flipper on the back where he's

[01:47:15] dropping his knife, well, he's holding onto it with his other arm.

[01:47:19] He was holding a coffee pot so that he could get his arm positioning just right, which

[01:47:24] is super cool.

[01:47:26] You couldn't do one of those with those cake cup pods anymore, could you?

[01:47:30] I don't know what that means.

[01:47:31] I don't want to cake up is those Tassamo machines.

[01:47:33] There's like one cup of coffee machines.

[01:47:35] You put it in?

[01:47:36] I don't drink coffee.

[01:47:37] I'm not familiar with coffee.

[01:47:40] You've just dropped down a peg for me, my friend.

[01:47:43] Actually, just to smell a coffee makes me ill.

[01:47:45] Really?

[01:47:46] Yeah, hate it.

[01:47:47] I love coffee.

[01:47:48] Coffee, nothing, nothing.

[01:47:49] My favorite part about this play field is the lady on the top looking down into the

[01:47:55] water.

[01:47:56] It's telling this story, right, where the individual, the man is gone into the water and she's

[01:48:01] looking over the top down in.

[01:48:04] And as you get further down the play field, it gets more congested and more scary and dark.

[01:48:10] It's so smart the way it's done, which is almost opposite in some ways, in some play fields.

[01:48:16] Yeah.

[01:48:17] You're simpler at the bottom and it gets more congested near the top.

[01:48:19] Yeah, exactly.

[01:48:20] And the man is being dragged down the out hole on the bottom.

[01:48:25] She's never going to see him again.

[01:48:26] He's a goner.

[01:48:28] So sad.

[01:48:29] Well, if you wanted to know what the story was of what's going on.

[01:48:33] Oh, I didn't know this.

[01:48:35] There's a comic.

[01:48:36] There is another comic.

[01:48:37] This one's done by Kevin O'Connor, but the story by Greg Ferraris.

[01:48:41] You can see this on IPDB or the other link I have in the show notes, which talks about

[01:48:48] the brochures.

[01:48:49] And here is that lady and the fellow on their boat doing some scuba diving.

[01:48:55] And it has really, really cool art.

[01:48:58] Like it is very cool.

[01:49:00] And the boat they're in is the valley.

[01:49:03] Yes.

[01:49:04] Of course it is.

[01:49:06] Will the Coast Guard arrive in time?

[01:49:09] So they are trying to kill them.

[01:49:10] Were those stories the old man spoke of just stories?

[01:49:15] Find out.

[01:49:16] Play Fathom.

[01:49:17] It's cool.

[01:49:19] Online drop targets.

[01:49:20] Tons of fun.

[01:49:21] The only thing is the blue over time seems to kind of change to almost a greenish color.

[01:49:25] Yeah.

[01:49:26] Yeah.

[01:49:27] You want to see by the original flyers the color it's supposed to be.

[01:49:30] Yeah, it's a very dark, rich blue.

[01:49:32] And then in the play field pictures, it's like this green that's faded over time.

[01:49:38] It has ages.

[01:49:39] Would you buy one?

[01:49:40] No.

[01:49:41] Gameplay is number one.

[01:49:42] I have a tier system.

[01:49:44] It has to pass game play before it gets to the next sections.

[01:49:47] And it just doesn't make it for gameplay.

[01:49:50] Not really.

[01:49:51] Like it's not for four grand.

[01:49:52] No.

[01:49:53] Yeah.

[01:49:54] I get any ball champ instead.

[01:49:55] I'd have the top of Fathom.

[01:49:56] Ooh.

[01:49:57] That much cheaper game.

[01:49:58] Yeah.

[01:49:59] And you could just color in the colors if you wanted to.

[01:50:01] With a magic marker.

[01:50:03] Medusa was up next.

[01:50:04] Fantasy mythology theme.

[01:50:05] September of 81.

[01:50:07] It's a standard body.

[01:50:08] 3,250 units.

[01:50:10] You can see that we are on a downward spiral here.

[01:50:16] We're on a downward trend, but they're still trying.

[01:50:20] Yeah.

[01:50:21] By putting more and more stuff in these games.

[01:50:23] This game they brought back zipper flippers, which they hadn't used in forever.

[01:50:28] It's actually the last game that used them as far as I know.

[01:50:31] And you remember that little outhaul saver we talked about in Fireball too?

[01:50:35] It's back.

[01:50:37] I can't remember what they call in this game.

[01:50:38] They call it something.

[01:50:40] Yeah.

[01:50:41] This was designed by Wally Welch and artwork by Kevin O'Connor.

[01:50:44] Who the hell was Wally?

[01:50:45] Who's Wally Welch?

[01:50:48] Very little is published about Wally.

[01:50:50] He was a behind the scenes person.

[01:50:52] He was an engineer at Bally working on a lot of their mechanics.

[01:50:56] And he designed a few machines.

[01:50:59] Medusa being his biggest project.

[01:51:02] Sadly, he's one of those people that has such a hand in all of the machines we know when

[01:51:08] we love.

[01:51:09] But they are often forgotten by time because they aren't given the credit that they deserve.

[01:51:16] He also worked at Alvin G. and Co in the mid-90s.

[01:51:19] And he's currently a design engineer at Jersey Jack Pinball and he's worked on the Hobbit

[01:51:24] Dildin Pirates and Wally Welch on the Chocolate Factory.

[01:51:28] How cool is that?

[01:51:29] Wow.

[01:51:30] I wouldn't have thought that.

[01:51:31] The guy designed Medusa is still kicking it around.

[01:51:35] Now the Medusa artwork is awesome.

[01:51:39] As Medusa herself, of course, on the back glass, the snakes coming out of her.

[01:51:44] Yeah.

[01:51:45] Medusa, the mythological person was that if you looked at her eyes, you would turn to

[01:51:51] stone.

[01:51:52] Stone.

[01:51:53] So the back glass is there's stone on the outside.

[01:51:57] There's one individual in the front with a knife who's going to kill her.

[01:52:01] And to kill her, you have to cut her head off.

[01:52:03] He's frozen in stone.

[01:52:05] There's another guy on the right who's in stone and there's a guy on the left who's

[01:52:09] turning to stone.

[01:52:10] His hands.

[01:52:11] Awesome.

[01:52:12] It's so cool.

[01:52:13] The thing is, the back glass was censored.

[01:52:16] You mentioned zipper flippers, of course.

[01:52:19] Ward Pemberton would say that I always tried to get zipper flipper features in one of my

[01:52:24] games, but I never could.

[01:52:26] But yet for some reason, Wally Welch did.

[01:52:30] Which is funny.

[01:52:32] Good job, Wally.

[01:52:33] Good job, Wally.

[01:52:34] And it had good question mark sales numbers, right?

[01:52:38] So Kevin O'Connor, I was always on to the next, on to the next project.

[01:52:42] The art.

[01:52:43] So originally, okay, the art originally was a magic marker sketch.

[01:52:48] It was deemed too sexy, too overexposed since the, yeah, it was a specific part of her

[01:52:55] clothing.

[01:52:56] You can see on IPDB the original prototype back glass and the clothing that Medusa was

[01:53:06] wearing was very transparent compared to the production back glass.

[01:53:10] You could, you could see how cold it was in the battle that they were having, as well

[01:53:16] as there was a little bit of, yeah, tighter down on the bottom.

[01:53:23] Yeah, we'll just say that.

[01:53:25] I didn't even notice till now, it actually says Bally on the stone arch.

[01:53:30] Yes, around the, around, but it's in, it's written kind of almost in a Greek lettering

[01:53:36] kind of style.

[01:53:37] Yeah, it's a Bally Medusa.

[01:53:39] And then it says Bally Medusa.

[01:53:41] Yeah.

[01:53:42] Kevin O'Connor says, I painted the original revealing version and then was asked to paint

[01:53:46] over the naughty bits with, truthfully, in reference to the groin area was unintentional.

[01:53:50] It was just the way the folds in her gown turned out looking.

[01:53:53] Oh, there.

[01:53:54] There you go.

[01:53:55] That's all cleared up.

[01:53:56] That's all cleared up.

[01:53:57] So it's not a bad game.

[01:53:58] If super flippers are cool, again, the, the art would be one of the highlights of the

[01:54:02] game.

[01:54:03] Yeah.

[01:54:04] Now, it has, it has an upper play field, but it's a single level game.

[01:54:07] Yeah, everyone calls it the upper play field.

[01:54:09] It's like it's not an upper play field.

[01:54:10] You can call it the upper part of the play field.

[01:54:12] It's like Zeus is sitting at the top and he has two Zeusettes, let's say, sitting next

[01:54:19] to.

[01:54:20] And there his guards and he's playing with the universe with his hand there and you

[01:54:26] shoot the spinner, the Gorgon spinner and it goes right up into that like top half

[01:54:32] or top third of the play field.

[01:54:34] The zipper flippers close and you can flip around at the top, at the drop targets at

[01:54:38] the back and it has a capture hole, a Neptune's cove on the left side.

[01:54:43] It's, it's cool.

[01:54:44] It's very unique.

[01:54:45] It's very neat.

[01:54:46] And again, the art is the standout of this game and a couple of features that, you know,

[01:54:51] you don't see very much, which are the shield of the gods, which is the little demon post.

[01:54:56] That's what they caught.

[01:54:57] Okay.

[01:54:58] And the zipper flippers.

[01:54:59] And the other thing about the flippers themselves, the lower flippers.

[01:55:03] The zipper flippers are the two upper flippers, but the two lower flippers instead of using

[01:55:07] the regular flipper bats, these translucent flipper bats with lighting underneath them.

[01:55:14] So when you flip, the whole flipper is lit up and red.

[01:55:18] Yeah, the, the motor of the times.

[01:55:22] I don't remember that before that.

[01:55:24] I don't remember any game having that before that.

[01:55:26] They also have the extra display they put in the center of the play field.

[01:55:31] Yeah, and that would keep track of a few things.

[01:55:33] It would keep track of how many flips your shield of the gods would have left.

[01:55:38] It would also have extended play time units from a, from a different type of play thing,

[01:55:44] as well as your extra ball award.

[01:55:48] I mean, I don't know if that's, I guess they're trying to try something new and fancy.

[01:55:51] Doesn't do it for me.

[01:55:52] This game also has really annoying outlains.

[01:55:56] Oh, outlains are fine.

[01:55:58] The thing is we need to bring back cool terms like shield of the gods.

[01:56:01] Yeah, see that anymore.

[01:56:03] Everything had to have, every feature had to have a name, even if it was just some mundane thing.

[01:56:08] One day thing that they use 30zx, like no, we need a name.

[01:56:12] Yeah, it wasn't just the top left capture.

[01:56:15] It was Neptune's cove.

[01:56:17] Yes.

[01:56:18] And it wasn't just a spinner.

[01:56:19] It was the Gorgon spinner.

[01:56:21] Come up with some really cool names for your ramps there, Helwin.

[01:56:24] Come on.

[01:56:25] Okay, so let's say fathoms like 1a, centaurs like 1b.

[01:56:29] It's a future sci-fi fantasy theme as October of 81.

[01:56:33] Standard body sells 3,700 units of a little bit of a rise in sales there.

[01:56:40] Designed by Jim Patla, probably his best design and artwork by Paul Ferris.

[01:56:45] Now the play field design is something else here on this one.

[01:56:48] Yep.

[01:56:49] Jim Patla says the design was inspired by Bali's balls of poppin from 1956, which had

[01:56:54] a 9 ball trough, 9 ball multi ball balls of poppin, which I have played.

[01:57:00] It's actually a wide body wood rail.

[01:57:02] The name of that game makes me feel awkward.

[01:57:04] It's freaking awesome.

[01:57:07] It's one wood rail I would actually own, just because you're blown away that this thing

[01:57:10] has like a 9 ball multi ball, a ball multi ball.

[01:57:14] And it's it's see if it's this sounds familiar to you.

[01:57:17] Basically in this game, you build your wild ball count, which it keeps track of on the back

[01:57:22] glass.

[01:57:23] Again, no reals yet.

[01:57:25] So it's just like lit.

[01:57:26] Just play balls.

[01:57:27] Just play balls.

[01:57:28] Just play balls.

[01:57:29] Just play balls.

[01:57:30] 4, 5, 6, 7.

[01:57:31] You get it by hitting things in the play field, increases your wild ball count.

[01:57:32] Then there's a saucer in the middle of the play field.

[01:57:33] If you hit the saucer, it'll shoot out.

[01:57:35] However many balls you had in your wild ball count.

[01:57:39] So if you have like seven balls there, it'll shoot out seven balls from the left.

[01:57:43] There's actually a launcher on the left side, and it will fire the balls out.

[01:57:47] And it's insane.

[01:57:49] So that's what the whole centaur is designed off of, even the rule base where you're building

[01:57:54] up an except they call it orbs.

[01:57:56] You're building up your orb count.

[01:57:58] Then you do one of several different things to release the orbs, and they fire out from

[01:58:03] the right side.

[01:58:04] Now there's only 750 balls of poppin that were actually made.

[01:58:09] So it's it's very much possible that not a lot of people have played balls of poppin.

[01:58:16] Nor even at the time had ever heard of that game.

[01:58:19] So when you see something like centaur that has almost like today's auto launcher, it's

[01:58:25] hidden under the shooter lane and it pops up, which is a maintenance nightmare I've

[01:58:32] been told, despite a couple people.

[01:58:34] A good friend of mine, Pete, he had actually done a play field swap to a new CPR gold

[01:58:41] back in the day, and he said he would never, ever, ever do it ever again.

[01:58:46] Because it was that horrible, that whole mechanic, the way it sits, the way it, you got to

[01:58:51] line everything up, horrible.

[01:58:53] Jim Patla, of course, the designer of the game was recently on the Jersey Jack pinball

[01:58:58] podcast hosted by a ghost, a man named Ken Cromwell.

[01:59:03] He would say at the time I was doing centaur, there was only 40 switches allowed in the

[01:59:08] game.

[01:59:09] And two colors.

[01:59:11] It was actually three colors with the red to bring the game on budget with something that

[01:59:15] we really had to do.

[01:59:17] But when we were doing the silk screening, every screen was X amount of dollars.

[01:59:23] So by having only three screens of color on the game, I had more money to spend on mechanisms.

[01:59:29] So I was able to spend the money and make the game I wanted to make.

[01:59:34] So there you go.

[01:59:35] One of the major reasons it was black and white was that he needed that budget for mechanics.

[01:59:41] Because of that, he was able to help Paul Ferris create probably one of the most iconic

[01:59:46] art packages in pinball history.

[01:59:48] Now, it has these really cool attract mode features, right?

[01:59:51] It actually walks you through the rules of the game if you hit the flipper buttons.

[01:59:55] It'll go through all everything's feature or feature, guardian feature, bonus feature,

[02:00:03] and the voice, it uses a, they call it, say it again board.

[02:00:07] It's basically reverb board.

[02:00:09] Yeah, it sort of has like an echoey noise to it.

[02:00:11] The sound is absolutely insane.

[02:00:14] It's very cool.

[02:00:16] It seems like the game is from another era, like it's far ahead of its time when you play

[02:00:22] this thing with the five ball, multi ball, the crazy sound.

[02:00:26] Around this 1980s valley, there was like the guy that did the voice and it was always the

[02:00:31] same individual.

[02:00:33] But this one doesn't, if it is the same person that did that voice, they were able to

[02:00:37] modify it in a way that it doesn't sound like that person at all.

[02:00:41] And the art is ridiculous.

[02:00:42] The backlash you have ridiculous.

[02:00:45] What is he's sent are, but he's instead of part man, part horse, he's part man, part

[02:00:50] motorcycle because that's far cooler.

[02:00:53] He's like a man bear pig motorcycle.

[02:00:55] Yeah.

[02:00:56] And his girlfriend's there who has like bug eyes.

[02:00:58] Yeah.

[02:00:59] So they had to make the game stand out and to get your attention, they wanted to do something

[02:01:04] totally different.

[02:01:05] And that's this black and white mad max style art.

[02:01:10] And of course it was quite controversial at the time, but it certainly got a lot of

[02:01:14] plays.

[02:01:15] They really ended up jolting people and shocking them into playing the pinball game over

[02:01:20] the video games at the time.

[02:01:22] So pinball was growing year over year and now pinball was starting to struggle.

[02:01:26] So this is, this is the, the ideas that they're bringing to the table.

[02:01:30] Let's really start kind of jolting people getting them to play the game.

[02:01:34] Paul Ferris says you'd kick ideas around in the factory, a biomechanical parallel universe

[02:01:41] like the HR Geiger Space Invader influence.

[02:01:43] The woman was insect light, light sensitive biomechanical implant for her eyes.

[02:01:50] What?

[02:01:51] This is what goes on in Paul Ferris's.

[02:01:52] Oh my god.

[02:01:53] The man was a motorcycle.

[02:01:55] You create a mythology and draw to that story.

[02:01:58] And they, they use the four color process, which is kind of funny, even though there's

[02:02:01] only three colors blended in with grays and reds.

[02:02:05] So you know, they're still there.

[02:02:07] There's some really cool stuff going on in this like in the back glass, you've got like

[02:02:14] the pig guy that's ripped and he's the front of the motorcycle where like the handlebars

[02:02:20] are.

[02:02:21] And the girlfriend all in like leather with like some sort of fur shawl on and but his

[02:02:30] legs.

[02:02:31] So the guy has like horse legs on the back, but there's still wheels for the motorcycle.

[02:02:37] And then the orbs are sitting in the front.

[02:02:39] There's like five orbs sitting on the play field.

[02:02:43] It's got studs all around it, right?

[02:02:46] Like these metal button studs all around the back.

[02:02:49] Yeah, the artwork was so good that lady Gaga used it for an album.

[02:02:53] Yeah.

[02:02:54] She has an album that is very obviously inspired by this back glass.

[02:02:58] Oh man.

[02:03:00] One thing that is I would say good, but kind of a disappointment as well is that it has

[02:03:04] in line drop targets on the left side.

[02:03:06] So there's like a captive ball that you can smash and it'll go up and hit down drop

[02:03:11] targets.

[02:03:12] There's four of them in a row.

[02:03:14] And then there's like another target at the top of that for West where you get your

[02:03:18] special challenge.

[02:03:21] And it was the captive ball feature, I think is what it's called, right?

[02:03:25] It's I don't know.

[02:03:26] I think if that were in line drops without the captive ball.

[02:03:29] I think this game would be just so much better.

[02:03:33] What do you think?

[02:03:34] Like it's good that they didn't just cycle in like drops like they have been for every

[02:03:38] game we've talked about over the last two podcasts.

[02:03:41] But at the same time, it's like there's a reason why they kept using it because it was

[02:03:44] awesome.

[02:03:45] And they had a pat not.

[02:03:46] Yeah.

[02:03:47] No one else could use it.

[02:03:48] The other thing is in the middle and you spell orbs.

[02:03:50] So if you spell orbs in order.

[02:03:53] Insevaltiball.

[02:03:54] Right into the gate.

[02:03:55] But if you screw that up and you hit the or or the or the R the B or the S first, you're

[02:04:03] not you know, it's going to have you're going to have to get them all down and reset it.

[02:04:06] And then you're not going to get instant multi ball again.

[02:04:07] It's also one of the first games I can remember that actually had in lanes, you could change

[02:04:11] the lights.

[02:04:12] Yeah.

[02:04:13] Move the lights around on the in lanes and it has a magnet in the upper right.

[02:04:17] Yeah.

[02:04:18] Yeah, I really like it.

[02:04:19] Now this has different in lane and out lanes, but they're still there's still a return

[02:04:23] lane in the middle and you can save it from the out lane, which I'm good with.

[02:04:27] I'm okay.

[02:04:28] All of Viking.

[02:04:29] Yes.

[02:04:30] Same method and black flipper bats to match with the with the black entire everything.

[02:04:35] Yeah, black apron.

[02:04:36] So cool.

[02:04:37] At the bottom, there's this woman like sitting on her legs like with her feet out and she's

[02:04:42] raising up an orb in the middle to release the power orbs.

[02:04:47] This is awesome.

[02:04:48] So awesome.

[02:04:49] That's why it's so expensive.

[02:04:51] Another one that is just I guess artwork is a huge part of that.

[02:04:55] They were able to get enough gameplay to be unique and cool.

[02:04:59] Arch that is just stellar and out of the ordinary and a couple of features in there that just

[02:05:05] stand right out.

[02:05:06] And because they got eights across the board.

[02:05:09] Well, let's say art is a 10, you know, play fields like an eight.

[02:05:15] There's no.

[02:05:16] Oh, man.

[02:05:17] If you know the the gameplay is horrible, but the art is amazing.

[02:05:21] Or the or the gameplay is the greatest game I've ever played, but the art is the worst.

[02:05:25] They were able to get it high enough on each piece.

[02:05:27] Now would you want a fathom or would you want a centaur?

[02:05:31] I take centaur over fathom.

[02:05:32] If I had to pick one or the other, I think I would too.

[02:05:35] I really, really would.

[02:05:37] There's some original play field artwork on IPDB that's done by Paul Ferris.

[02:05:44] Well, Ron, that brings us to the last game of 1981.

[02:05:50] Electra.

[02:05:52] Electra club for NAND is again.

[02:05:55] Yes.

[02:05:56] I don't need to see the notes on that one.

[02:05:57] That's a big meh for me.

[02:05:59] Ah, man, it's just anti-club.

[02:06:03] Poor Claude.

[02:06:04] This is a three level design because two are not enough.

[02:06:09] And one of the levels will never ever have play field where.

[02:06:12] Why is that?

[02:06:13] Because it's actually covered with a surface.

[02:06:17] It's like plexiglass.

[02:06:20] Actually, it might say in the IPDB what it actually is.

[02:06:22] I think it's like plexi.

[02:06:23] So this is from December of 1981 sells 2950 units.

[02:06:30] It's a fantasy theme, art by Tony Ramoni.

[02:06:33] And it's packed.

[02:06:35] And again, this looks very much like his previous game.

[02:06:40] It's got his sort of style to it.

[02:06:42] It's very soft and cartoon as opposed to sort of very serious or European style like a

[02:06:49] Dave Christensen.

[02:06:50] It's very embryonic.

[02:06:52] Yeah.

[02:06:53] And again, it's another one of those like what exactly is this?

[02:06:56] What is Electra?

[02:06:57] What does this mean?

[02:06:58] There's different.

[02:06:59] There's what is it?

[02:07:01] Time units.

[02:07:02] There's a lot of units going on.

[02:07:04] It has two ball, three ball, multi ball.

[02:07:07] And speech has an extra display in the play field.

[02:07:11] It has three levels.

[02:07:14] It's just packed to the gills.

[02:07:16] And it's fun to play.

[02:07:18] It's an interesting game.

[02:07:22] Would you rather play this or Flash Gordon?

[02:07:25] Flash Gordon.

[02:07:26] Yeah, me too.

[02:07:27] But this is a very interesting game.

[02:07:29] The scoring is kind of skewed because you want to get to the lower play field.

[02:07:33] That's where all the points are.

[02:07:34] So you want to try to get as many time units as you can so you can get down to the lower

[02:07:38] play field.

[02:07:39] The artwork again, we got just like Embrane.

[02:07:42] We got a lot of faces going on.

[02:07:45] It's, I don't really know what it.

[02:07:48] The story is, I wonder if the flyer explains what world we're in.

[02:07:52] Does it the flyer say what happens in the world of Electra?

[02:07:56] There's two pages of just art pictures.

[02:07:59] Yes, and crystals of some kind.

[02:08:01] A three level electrifying experience.

[02:08:05] So we're going to plug the three levels.

[02:08:08] So this would have been, this is probably a four haunted house.

[02:08:11] Yes.

[02:08:12] So they beat Gottlieb there, but it has all these great features.

[02:08:17] You could see that they noticed that things were starting to kind of trend downward.

[02:08:22] We were throwing everything at it.

[02:08:24] Yeah, we went from things like strikes and spares selling 12,000, almost 13,000 units,

[02:08:31] kiss selling 15, star trek selling 16.

[02:08:34] Like at this time a miss was like rolling stones or mystic.

[02:08:41] And then it just starts kind of slowing down.

[02:08:45] And then xenon flash Gordon gets a good bump.

[02:08:48] Eight ball gets a good bump.

[02:08:49] And then it starts to come back down again real slow.

[02:08:53] Dan video games.

[02:08:54] Yeah.

[02:08:55] This is the end of 1980, 81.

[02:08:58] And can we keep trying to shove stuff out and seeing what we can get?

[02:09:02] Well, it's really only one more after this.

[02:09:05] Only one more that matters.

[02:09:07] What do we got?

[02:09:09] So after this, they do vector.

[02:09:13] Vector was kind of their last attempt that we're going all out.

[02:09:18] We're putting everything in this game.

[02:09:21] Everything in this game.

[02:09:24] It was an experiment because I believe they had multi, it was multi designed.

[02:09:28] Yeah.

[02:09:29] Like a team, a team effort.

[02:09:30] It was from February, February of 82.

[02:09:33] To save pinball from video games.

[02:09:35] So it has crazy our package, just totally unique.

[02:09:41] Greg Ferris.

[02:09:42] They created this new sport.

[02:09:44] I don't know if the sports call it vector, but it's some kind of weird.

[02:09:48] I don't even know.

[02:09:49] They're like on kind of motor side.

[02:09:51] I can't even explain it.

[02:09:53] That's how great it is.

[02:09:54] You can't even explain.

[02:09:55] You have to see the artwork.

[02:09:56] What's that sport where you throw the ball?

[02:09:59] Highly.

[02:10:00] Highly.

[02:10:01] It's like highly.

[02:10:02] It's like a segue, a single, single tired segue.

[02:10:06] So here we go.

[02:10:07] We got the infinity back glass lighting going on.

[02:10:11] Two back glasses.

[02:10:13] We have bi-level play field because one isn't enough.

[02:10:17] We have multi ball, speech.

[02:10:20] Then we have the extra display in the middle of the game.

[02:10:23] We have a feature where it times you.

[02:10:27] You hit this one orbit shot.

[02:10:29] If you do it fast enough, it'll keep track of your time.

[02:10:33] If someone else beats it, it'll go, new vector record.

[02:10:36] So how does it track the speed?

[02:10:38] Or is that just BS?

[02:10:39] Switch.

[02:10:40] No, it does.

[02:10:41] It detects when you enter the orbit and then when it goes to the end of the orbit.

[02:10:46] And there's a timer on the little mini display in the center of the play field.

[02:10:50] Which they must have taken from what they had in Medusa?

[02:10:54] Or it's probably just a standard six digit display.

[02:10:57] OK.

[02:10:58] But it's packed to the guilds that they have levels of drop targets.

[02:11:04] To get up the left orbit, you have to knock down like three targets.

[02:11:08] And then three more.

[02:11:10] They're like in a row.

[02:11:11] It's like there's three in a row.

[02:11:15] And then another three in a row behind it.

[02:11:17] They just went all out.

[02:11:18] It has saucers on the outlay.

[02:11:22] So if you bounce it, you can get into saucer.

[02:11:24] And it'll save your ball.

[02:11:26] It has everything.

[02:11:28] If you lift a play field up on this thing, it's just got so much crap in it.

[02:11:31] It's insane.

[02:11:32] And this really was their last effort to try to compete with the video games.

[02:11:38] So we're going to throw everything at this.

[02:11:40] You got to innovate.

[02:11:41] We got to do it all.

[02:11:42] Since it's the art episode, the art is excellent.

[02:11:46] As in all these ballies, there's no downturn on the art.

[02:11:48] It's still top notch.

[02:11:50] It's weird.

[02:11:51] It's weird, but weird is good.

[02:11:52] But it has, I mean, really all out.

[02:11:54] You hit the left orbit.

[02:11:55] It goes into the saucers on the right, which I don't think Dave's ever seen this game.

[02:12:00] Are you familiar with Circus Fall Terre?

[02:12:01] Yes.

[02:12:02] You know, the juggler on the, when you hit it on the left and it goes into saucer and it

[02:12:05] bounces it to another saucer and it bounces it to another saucer?

[02:12:08] Yeah, very cool.

[02:12:09] That's what this does on the right saucer.

[02:12:10] So there was one of these for sale, not too far for me.

[02:12:14] And I was like, oh, that looks kind of neat.

[02:12:16] But then I'm like, I'm not really into highlight, future highlight.

[02:12:20] But it is packed.

[02:12:23] It didn't really sell.

[02:12:24] Is it fun?

[02:12:25] No.

[02:12:26] So it's kind of like 10 pounds of crap and a five pound bag.

[02:12:31] It's unique.

[02:12:32] You really try to get the multi ball started and you think something cool is going to happen.

[02:12:37] Like for example, on Centaur, anytime you start multi ball, it flashes the GI and it

[02:12:41] says like, it's like pulses.

[02:12:43] Yeah, this thing just says, what does it say?

[02:12:47] It says like one line and it just starts releasing balls and I was just so let down.

[02:12:51] Like that is so lame.

[02:12:53] I thought something super cool was going to happen.

[02:12:56] Yeah, they didn't have it.

[02:12:57] They didn't get it like Williams where it was like a no, they never got it like Williams.

[02:13:01] No one only Williams understood the beginning of multi ball should be the super cool event.

[02:13:06] But yeah, Dave's looking at the pictures here, the multi blared back glass.

[02:13:12] After this, they basically did, they started doing the, well, they did the Mr. and Mrs.

[02:13:21] Backman pinball like the combo pinball that actually sold 10,000 units.

[02:13:27] So they actually they had one little last try there.

[02:13:32] But then they they used the leftover cabinets.

[02:13:34] Well, actually, I think they had that rapid fire, which was the rip off of hyper ball.

[02:13:39] Yeah, it's very much like a high ball, which sold, which they made 5,000 of, but they

[02:13:43] had so many hyper ball.

[02:13:44] They said so many rapid fire cabinets, just like Williams reused the hyper ball.

[02:13:48] Oh, God.

[02:13:49] They reused them for their limited edition series, the eight ball deluxe limited edition

[02:13:55] and the Centaur limited edition.

[02:13:57] Yes, yes, Centaur two.

[02:13:58] And then they sent our two, they called it a sequel is always better.

[02:14:02] Yeah, and spectrum literally was we have left over parts.

[02:14:07] We don't care if this sells what kind of weird game can we make?

[02:14:11] And that's what they did.

[02:14:12] They literally that's what they did.

[02:14:14] We have leftover parts.

[02:14:15] We don't care if this doesn't sell that much.

[02:14:17] We're going to make this game so they made a game based on masterminds.

[02:14:20] Now Margaret Hudson would say that this is the her real 100%.

[02:14:26] She came up with the theme, the ideas and everything.

[02:14:31] You can tell when you look at it that it is super cool.

[02:14:37] Super based on masterminds.

[02:14:40] If you don't know the like I get confused playing this thing and it's super detailed.

[02:14:45] The art even on the play field is like you can tell it's Margaret Hudson because it's

[02:14:48] just it's so perfect.

[02:14:51] The faces on the play field, the transistors.

[02:14:54] For a 100 what people would do.

[02:14:57] It's like we don't care if this makes any money.

[02:14:58] Just make whatever you want.

[02:14:59] We have these leftover parts.

[02:15:01] This is what Valley decided.

[02:15:03] This is what we're doing.

[02:15:04] Man, yep, spectrum.

[02:15:05] It's got yeah, there's even little diodes on the play field like all these little intricate.

[02:15:11] So that was kind of the end of the ballie story.

[02:15:14] Yeah, the ballie manufacturing.

[02:15:16] They would eventually they would change their name at some point.

[02:15:21] They would become Valley midway.

[02:15:22] Valley midway.

[02:15:23] BMX was the last game I think they had.

[02:15:25] They actually had the just pure ballie.

[02:15:29] But most of those artists would still be there and stick around all through the 80s.

[02:15:34] Yeah, they didn't go very far.

[02:15:36] Now they would start sort of pairing down the production teams.

[02:15:40] They would move into Valley midway where they would more or less come into the midway.

[02:15:45] The video more or less ran them.

[02:15:47] They would develop that new Valley midway cabinet and boards.

[02:15:52] Yeah, they've been new.

[02:15:54] They set with the they had the keypad that everyone loves.

[02:15:59] Everything would get cheapened down.

[02:16:00] The squawk and talk became the cheap squawk.

[02:16:03] You'll notice like after vector, it's like either the game is going to have multi ball

[02:16:07] and not talk or maybe it'll talk but not have multi ball.

[02:16:10] But not both.

[02:16:11] Yeah, just because of cost.

[02:16:13] And then it would eventually become Valley midway Williams.

[02:16:17] Eventually they started kind of coming back.

[02:16:21] I mean, well the whole pinball started coming back after high speed around that area.

[02:16:26] So they started making some of the really crazy games like Lost World, Blackwater 100.

[02:16:31] Yeah, you can really tell the plastic in it.

[02:16:35] They got blocked by Williams and most of the lot of the crew that we see here, Great

[02:16:40] Ferraris, like Warpemberton.

[02:16:43] These guys they would transition on over to Williams.

[02:16:48] It was a it was an interesting time because we went from we went on this rocket ship ride

[02:16:54] right from the late 70s to 80 just just nonstop upward motion and then sort of a little

[02:17:01] bit of a faltering and then a slow come down.

[02:17:04] And then by 1983, 84, you know, things were in trouble, big time trouble.

[02:17:10] It was interesting to see when you put the money and the dollars and the experience behind

[02:17:16] it, the things that you were able to pull out and the Valley class of 81 I think is a prime

[02:17:20] example of that.

[02:17:22] Paul Ferris would say one of the wonderful things of doing pinball art was when I was traveling

[02:17:27] in Europe and I walked into a bistro in Paris and there was my artwork on a machine.

[02:17:32] It was very overwhelming at first.

[02:17:33] Yeah, your art is everywhere, right?

[02:17:35] So if you have if you paint a famous painting, it's it's locked up somewhere or it's in a

[02:17:40] gallery or it's online in just a photo, you don't get to see it or experience it.

[02:17:45] Well, if you're a pinball artist, it's in people's houses everywhere.

[02:17:49] People experience that all the time.

[02:17:51] I think one of the reasons Valley art team was able to soar to such high highs was that

[02:17:58] everyone on that team was so close.

[02:18:01] The creativity was able to flourish and everybody wanted to dream and draw what they wanted

[02:18:07] to do.

[02:18:08] Greg Ferris would say we all stayed lifelong friends.

[02:18:12] Kevin O'Connor, Pat McMan, Margaret Hudson, Paul Ferris.

[02:18:16] This was the best fraternity I could ever be in.

[02:18:20] Do you have anything else you want to say, Ron, to sum it up here at the end?

[02:18:24] Art rules.

[02:18:25] Yeah.

[02:18:26] I think you'll find Stern figured that out somewhere around Metallica that maybe we should

[02:18:31] in Photoshop everything and art could actually sell games.

[02:18:35] It has sold games for them.

[02:18:37] I mean, the artists now are known as much as the programmers and the designers are.

[02:18:41] Yeah, you basically just have to say something like Christopher Franchier, Zombie Yeti and people

[02:18:46] immediately go like, huh?

[02:18:47] What?

[02:18:48] Or Dirty Donny, hopefully he comes back.

[02:18:49] I'll tell you what, next month, Ron, we're working on something.

[02:18:52] We're going to go to one of those designers that I really, really enjoy.

[02:18:56] But we're going to leave that for everybody else to figure out.

[02:19:00] Ah.

[02:19:01] Well, as always, hold on.

[02:19:04] What?

[02:19:10] Yeah, I'll let him do it.

[02:19:11] I'll let him do it.
