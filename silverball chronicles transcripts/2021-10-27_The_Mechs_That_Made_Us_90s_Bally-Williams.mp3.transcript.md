[00:00] The Pinball Network is online.

[00:06] Launching Silver Ball Chronicles.

[00:11] Nordman, oh god.

[00:16] Have you heard Nordman?

[00:17] Nordman has his own shirt.

[00:21] Nordman, the Silver Ball protector.

[00:24] Yeah I want to have done this.

[00:26] Nordman has any idea.

[00:27] Where to me?

[00:28] Put some foam core on it.

[00:30] I have a throat problem, I'm sorry.

[00:57] Hello everyone, I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles with me this month

[01:09] like every month is Ron.

[01:11] Godzilla, hallet.

[01:13] What's up, fella?

[01:14] Uh, roar.

[01:15] As I hit you with my atomic breath.

[01:17] There you go.

[01:18] Godzilla, holy moly you are over the moon.

[01:22] You got your Ellie order in?

[01:24] Uh, no.

[01:25] I don't buy Ellie's.

[01:27] Are you in on the topper?

[01:28] I haven't seen a topper.

[01:31] You got the shooter rod all ordered in the art blades?

[01:34] I really haven't seen those either.

[01:36] All the things that used to come with pinball machines that we'll talk about this month.

[01:40] Plus this game Godzilla has a really cool neck.

[01:43] Ty's in very well this month, doesn't it?

[01:45] Yes it does.

[01:47] Woo.

[01:48] Well, I'll tell you what, I've been doing a lot of stuff.

[01:51] I've been very busy.

[01:53] I was part of episode 72 of the pinball show where I covered deep root pinball and uh,

[02:01] woohoo, that's a whole thing.

[02:03] Go back and listen to that summary if you'd like, but we want to move on from deep root.

[02:07] And that is Godzilla, ultra man, Halloween.

[02:10] The wheels are sort of turning in pinball again.

[02:13] Yes, the wheels are turning in pinball, golly G.

[02:17] That's right.

[02:18] Finally we have pinball machines, but you know what?

[02:20] You can't get them.

[02:22] They're there, but you can't get them.

[02:23] So and if you can, you got to pay a fortune for them.

[02:26] So that has turned me a bit sour as of late in the last few months.

[02:32] So when I'm not really sort of busy doing TPN and, and chronicle stuff, I'm being incredibly

[02:37] better because I've been priced out of the market.

[02:40] And our listeners probably don't care.

[02:43] They don't care about you or me.

[02:44] They don't.

[02:45] They care about pinball history.

[02:47] And joining us on social media over at Facebook.com slash silver ball chronicles where you can engage

[02:53] with us in our musings, swing on over and drop us a line.

[02:57] But also when you find us on your regular pod catcher, we've updated our RSS.

[03:02] We're on most of the pod catchers except for Spotify because it is hell getting on Spotify.

[03:09] But if you do find us anywhere, leave us a five star review so others can find us.

[03:14] We also get lots of wonderful feedback.

[03:17] Some of it from this week in pinball's promoter database.

[03:19] This week in pinball is a sponsor of the podcast.

[03:22] Give us a two dollar kick back every month to give them a little plug.

[03:26] But swing on over to this week in pinball for some of your news as well as the pinball promoters

[03:31] database where you can leave us a quick little review.

[03:33] A review?

[03:34] Yeah, Joe left us a review.

[03:36] Do you want to read that for the folks?

[03:38] The only pinball podcast worth your time.

[03:41] Unlike other pinball podcasts, which devote hours to discussing a single pin sight thread,

[03:46] Silver Ball Chronicles is actually interesting.

[03:49] Yeah, there you go.

[03:51] We've also got Simon H. He emailed in to Silver Ball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[03:58] He was talking about our Steve Richie episode, our big three hour finale for Steve Richie,

[04:04] which I would say is quite fitting.

[04:06] He said that my friend forwarded me your last Steve Richie part three podcast.

[04:12] I have to say it was such a good listen.

[04:14] I immediately listened to parts one and two, seven hours later, few black night was the

[04:21] game in early 1981 that took this 14 year old kid from playing video games to pinball.

[04:28] I used to play that game so much.

[04:30] I can remember when I finally cracked three million points.

[04:35] The memory still sits with me today.

[04:37] When black night sort of rage came out, I had to get an alley.

[04:41] The only alley I have ever bought brand new and I'm glad I did.

[04:45] Thanks for the great podcast and I'll have a listen to some of your other episodes.

[04:50] Plus, I'll check out Ron's slam tilt.

[04:52] Ooh, there you go.

[04:54] There's your slam tilt plug.

[04:55] Okay, you said few, but it meant like, shhh, like that, that was supposed to be a sound

[05:01] effect there.

[05:02] And you got to wipe your hand over your forehead.

[05:05] And he listened to part one of Steve Richie, which by the way was our pilot episode.

[05:09] It's significantly more rocky than we were today.

[05:12] Podcast better.

[05:13] It was a good episode, but there was some formatting changes and stuff that we made,

[05:17] which were all the difference.

[05:19] And yes, he mentioned slam tilt podcast, which is my other podcast.

[05:22] So this is far too professional for you and you want something really silly and stupid.

[05:27] Give us a listen.

[05:28] And if you want to listen to somebody talk for 30 minutes about changing out of coil,

[05:33] that's your podcast.

[05:34] Or if you want to watch a Stern Army member literally tell one of the programmers

[05:39] to retire, then you can listen to our podcast.

[05:43] It's well worth your time.

[05:45] Rob Osoh emailed in.

[05:47] He got this one came in just before we started to record.

[05:50] So I made sure I included it.

[05:51] Rob says I just wanted to drop a line and say that you have the best football podcast.

[05:55] Absolutely.

[05:56] Love listening to it.

[05:57] I thank you for doing one on pinball 2000 platform.

[06:00] I was there at expo 99 and I was in the room in the video with George talking about it

[06:05] and Star Wars episode one.

[06:07] I also took the factory tour.

[06:09] The infamous factory tour.

[06:11] He got the last factory tour ever and there are newer location.

[06:14] They'd actually moved to a new newer state of the art facility.

[06:17] It looked really cool.

[06:18] They all like pinball 2000 shirts on and stuff there.

[06:21] Well, little did they know like probably two or three days after they were at that factory,

[06:26] that was going to be it.

[06:27] Well, if you wanted a t-shirt from us here at Silver Ball Chronicles, which I'm actually

[06:31] wearing at this exact moment because I didn't have any other clean shirts, swing on over

[06:36] to Silver Ball swag dot com.

[06:38] That's where we have hoodies, mugs and stickers and a bunch of other things.

[06:41] We sold two shirts last month.

[06:43] Oh, that's why the PayPal said we had money.

[06:45] That's right.

[06:46] We are in the money now.

[06:49] Next time you're at the Rochester pinball collective, you can buy yourself a bag of chips.

[06:54] You're welcome.

[06:56] Also we've got corrections and comments because this is sort of a historical-esque podcast.

[07:03] We are spending some time driving in sources for multiple locations.

[07:08] Often, we will have comments and corrections.

[07:10] We'd love for you to send those into Silver Ball Chronicles at gmail.com.

[07:15] Last month, I was super confused with what those dynamite things were called in the last

[07:20] episode, like the ones that Wiley, Kayota used to use.

[07:24] I called them a plunger.

[07:25] Bo Jimmy emailed in and he said it was called a detonator, which does seem correct, but

[07:31] I did some Googolin.

[07:33] Its actual official name is a TNT blasting machine or a shot exploder.

[07:39] It's a detonator.

[07:41] No, I'm telling you, man, plunger.

[07:43] It's not a plunger.

[07:45] Google it, Google it in, TNT plunger, and it comes up.

[07:48] Then it actually goes to the real article that says TNT blasting machine.

[07:52] I had a correction.

[07:53] Oh.

[07:54] I'll say I'll save this one.

[07:56] This is a correction from Bruce Nightingale, the slam to a podcast.

[07:59] I don't even remember saying this.

[08:00] I certainly don't remember saying this in the last episode because it was the Steve

[08:04] Richie episode.

[08:05] I guess I made mention that the factory where Stern was for years was all through data

[08:12] East days up to Stern pinball.

[08:15] A few years ago, they moved to their new facility.

[08:18] I was told that was wrong that they were in their original factory when they were

[08:23] data East and then sometime around where they became Sega, they moved into a new factory

[08:29] and that's the factory they were in all the way up to a few years ago before they moved

[08:33] again.

[08:34] There, there.

[08:35] I've made a correction.

[08:36] There was also a correction that Dennis Creasel let me know that you indeed said something

[08:40] also incorrect.

[08:42] You're following a part here, but he said he asked me if he should email it in.

[08:47] He should have.

[08:48] Yeah, he should have.

[08:49] You can't tell me I'm wrong and they're not telling me what it is.

[08:52] And I forget things all the time.

[08:54] Maybe he's telling me my name isn't Ron Hallett, somehow I screwed that up.

[08:57] It's possible.

[08:58] Ted at pinball prices.

[09:00] He also sent in some interesting bits about pinball 2000 and video game pinball.

[09:05] He says I recently came across a Chicago coin super flipper game.

[09:09] A video game disguised as a pinball machine up for auction.

[09:12] Have you guys ever talked about it on the show?

[09:15] So I did some looking up on the IPDBE for the Chicago coin super flipper game and it is

[09:20] classified as a flipper like not pinball.

[09:25] It says not pinball, which is why when we were kind of looking up stuff, it didn't come

[09:29] up on the list.

[09:30] Although when you look at it, it's pretty much pinball and it's pretty neat.

[09:34] So if you're interested in checking that out, I would go and take a look.

[09:38] It's really cool how we get some of this feedback stuff.

[09:43] In the last episode, I said that George Gomez was on just another pinball podcast with Joel

[09:48] Engelberth, where I used a couple of George Gomez quotes.

[09:52] And that was actually incorrect.

[09:56] Edward sent in an email to let me know that George Gomez spoke on the super awesome pinball

[10:01] shows Fireside Chat number one, where you got some of that information, not just another

[10:07] pinball podcast.

[10:09] And Edward also says I agree Joel Engelberth is the worst.

[10:13] Wow.

[10:14] All right.

[10:16] So should we jump into today's topic now that we've tied a bow on all of the mistakes

[10:20] that you made, Ron?

[10:21] Uh, yes.

[10:22] And now that your ad is probably played, that you'll stick in later.

[10:25] Yeah, I'm going to stick that in a little bit later.

[10:27] Yeah, if you're in Canada, Dennis, financial is for you.

[10:33] The Valley Williams era has often been considered the most mechanically exciting time in pinball.

[10:41] In fact, many of the games in the era still carry a hefty resale price on the secondary

[10:48] market because they still have the magic.

[10:52] Of course, the magic of pinball and the world under glass was truly brought to life by

[10:57] Valley Williams in the 1990s.

[11:01] When pinball all but died after the closure of Williams in 1999, many media personalities,

[11:08] book writers and hobbyists spent the 10 plus years following that dreaming of what could

[11:14] have been if the glory years continued.

[11:19] Many pinball personalities who purchased assets from the major manufacturer spent years

[11:25] trying to finish incomplete games or bring back a new Valley Williams.

[11:32] Of course, they all failed because Valley Williams was unique.

[11:36] It was an industry powerhouse where creativity, competition and magic were created.

[11:43] This month, Ron, we're talking about the mechs that made us 90s, Valley Williams.

[11:50] Of course, everybody loves the Valley Williams games in the 90s.

[11:55] Even the BC and D level levels titles are all sought after in today's market.

[12:02] Isn't that right?

[12:03] Except Gilligan's Island probably.

[12:07] All of them are highly sought after because even Gilligan's Island has a super cool

[12:11] mac in it.

[12:12] Except for Popeye.

[12:14] But even Popeye has super cool mac in it.

[12:17] Yeah.

[12:18] If you want to talk about Adam's family, fun house, you could check out our Pat Lawler

[12:24] episode where we talk about that.

[12:26] We've got Steve Richie's games in the 90s, which are crazy, Star Trek, even games like

[12:31] No Fear.

[12:32] You could bury Ausler, Dwight Sullivan episodes.

[12:35] We've got all those in our archives.

[12:37] You can swing on over to silverballcronicles.com and they are all listed there and you can

[12:41] go back and listen to them or you can go through the, of course, your pod catcher and find

[12:46] those.

[12:47] But Ron, the real question, the thing that drove everybody here today is what is your favorite

[12:51] pinball mech from the 90s?

[12:55] I actually love the supercharger from high speed too.

[12:57] Although it's not really a complicated mech as it, the promotional piece for it, there

[13:02] are, there are promo video they did for it said, the supercharger has no moving parts that

[13:08] is completely false.

[13:09] It has one moving part, which is the diverter on top of it and a massive magnet, although

[13:13] it doesn't move, it's still a big deal.

[13:15] That doesn't move.

[13:16] But the diverter does move and it does break.

[13:18] But they were trying to say it has no moving parts, meaning it'll never break.

[13:23] But it's simple.

[13:24] It's just three magnets that make the ball go around a loop, but it goes around so fast.

[13:30] It literally moves the entire game back and forth as it, as it's going around.

[13:34] And it's a very simple mech, but I thought it was super cool.

[13:38] It's super, super fun to watch.

[13:41] Talk about kinetic satisfaction.

[13:43] Of course, I'm going to have to say my favorite mech in the 90s, although not my favorite

[13:46] game, is the doctor who meets slicer.

[13:50] We'll talk about that right away.

[13:51] The doctor who meets slicer.

[13:53] Do you mean the time expander?

[13:54] Yeah, that's it.

[13:55] The time expander.

[13:56] Which this is the tie-in to when I mentioned Godzilla earlier because there was a moving

[14:00] building on Godzilla.

[14:02] The first thing people were saying is, hey, look, it's Doctor Who.

[14:04] But much cooler.

[14:06] So this is Doctor Who, of course, we're talking September of 1992.

[14:10] It's sci-fi time travel theme.

[14:12] This is a Williams WPC fliptronix II system.

[14:16] It has 7,752 units.

[14:19] This has art by Linda Deal.

[14:22] It has music and sound by John Hay and software by Bill Futzenruder.

[14:27] So of course, Futzenruder, or as they called him, Futs wanted to do a game and designed

[14:33] a play field.

[14:35] But of course, he couldn't get it moving.

[14:37] So he just basically gave it to Barry Ossler.

[14:40] And this seems to be the theme at Williams, which was, I got these ideas and I need somebody

[14:44] to finish it.

[14:45] Let's give it to Barry and Barry will make a killer game out of it.

[14:48] So then it was considered a joint design between Bill Futzenruder and Barry Ossler, who worked

[14:52] very closely together on all the ideas, including the idea of the meat slicer.

[14:58] I'm sorry, time expander.

[15:00] So what's Doctor Who?

[15:01] Are you a Doctor Who fan?

[15:02] You seem like a Doctor Who nerd.

[15:04] Wow.

[15:05] That is one of the requirements of nerd them, right?

[15:08] Like you have to know Doctor Who, watch Star Trek, watch Bonnie Python.

[15:14] Am I getting them all here?

[15:16] But no, I've never really watched Doctor Who.

[15:18] Doctor Who's not my thing either.

[15:20] I got a friend of mine who likes big Doctor Who fan.

[15:23] In fact, Mike from CPR has a TARDIS in his basement, which is awesome.

[15:29] It's not really my thing.

[15:30] I love British culture.

[15:32] My history, of course, seven generations ago was from Britain, but it's just Doctor Who

[15:37] doesn't do it for me.

[15:38] For those who don't know, a TARDIS is the time machine.

[15:41] Yes.

[15:42] What?

[15:43] Yeah, it's like a British police boss.

[15:46] So I think that was like a phone booth back in the day where they would go into the phone

[15:50] booth and call the actual police.

[15:53] I don't know.

[15:54] So Doctor Who, of course, is the British science fiction television program.

[15:57] Do you notice how I spelled program?

[15:59] You spelled it wrong, yes?

[16:00] No, I spelled it very much correct.

[16:01] P-R-O-G-R-A-M-M-E.

[16:04] It was produced by BBC since 1963.

[16:08] The program also spelled correctly depicts the adventures of a time lord called the

[16:14] doctor, an extra terrestrial being who looks human.

[16:18] The doctor explores the universe in time traveling spaceship called the TARDIS, which I guess

[16:22] is spelled in all capitals, so it must stand for something.

[16:26] Its exterior appears to be a British blue police box, which is a common sight in Britain

[16:32] in 1963 when this series first aired.

[16:36] Of course, he's accompanied by a number of companions, the doctor combats a variety

[16:41] of foes while working to save civilians spelled with an S instead of a Z and to help people

[16:48] in all kinds of spellings here.

[16:50] Amazing.

[16:51] And the thing about the doctor that ties into the game is there's multiple doctors.

[16:56] Yeah.

[16:57] The thing is, and that was an originally planned, the original doctor was an older dude.

[17:03] And when he had health issues and was have to leave the show, they wanted to continue

[17:07] the show.

[17:08] So they wrote in the whole thing where the doctor can regenerate himself into a new form.

[17:13] But it virtually wasn't it he can only regenerate so many times and they've already passed that

[17:17] number.

[17:18] Yeah.

[17:19] So one way or another from 1963 to the present with a small break between 89 and 2005,

[17:25] which is actually a long break, they've had multiple doctors along the way.

[17:28] I believe they're currently on the 13th actor who's to play the doctor who is Judy,

[17:35] a Jodi Whitaker.

[17:36] She is also the first female doctor and she's been portraying that since 2018.

[17:43] So they thought this really big British show, which I hadn't even heard of until five

[17:49] years ago, which is kind of weird.

[17:52] Is that going to work in the US, which is the major sort of market for pinball?

[17:57] Seems like a bit of a risk, doesn't it run?

[18:00] It's definitely not.

[18:01] It's more of a geek theme, I guess you could say.

[18:04] Yeah, it's pretty niche.

[18:06] And even within sort of nerdy, spacey nerdy stuff, it's particularly niche, even within

[18:12] that area.

[18:13] But Barry Asseler said, I don't recall too much resistance for management over the theme.

[18:18] If you can show then that you truly believed in a project, they would usually give it a chance.

[18:22] Yeah.

[18:23] And that's sort of, I think that still reigns true at Stern today, right?

[18:26] If they come with a bunch of themes and nobody is passionate about the theme, they're going

[18:30] to pass on it.

[18:32] So it's, I mean, that's, it must be a holdback from sort of some of the Williams executives

[18:37] too, right?

[18:38] They're not going to give you a theme you don't believe in.

[18:39] Where in this time, you could even come with a theme and as long as you believed in it,

[18:43] they would go after it.

[18:45] Now, some of the coolest mechs on here, we're going to, we're going to focus on mechs,

[18:49] but we'll also talk about a few other things.

[18:50] One of them is the topper that was removed from this game.

[18:54] Now there's a thing that's called a Dalek, which is like a British robot.

[18:59] Right.

[19:00] He's got like an arm thing and it's a circle.

[19:03] It's a Dalek.

[19:04] Is it that?

[19:05] Oh, it's bad.

[19:06] See, this is how, this is, I've, how do you know this and I don't?

[19:09] Actually, I'm going to look that up now to make sure I'm correct on that, but I'm pretty

[19:12] sure.

[19:13] It's not Dalek.

[19:15] Let's see.

[19:16] Dalek pronunciation.

[19:19] What does it say?

[19:22] It says D-A-A-L-U-H-K.

[19:26] I would assume that means DA.

[19:29] Dalek.

[19:30] Well, let's see.

[19:31] Well, it's, I think I can make it say it.

[19:34] Yep, it's Dalek.

[19:36] Okay.

[19:37] Good.

[19:38] Good.

[19:39] So, not only do I mispronounce names, I can also mispronounce this.

[19:43] Now, this mech was designed by a person named Zofia Ryan.

[19:48] And if you recognize the names of Zofia Ryan, we mentioned her in the last episode, but

[19:54] she had appeared on the Super Awesome Pinball show episode 24 with David Fix.

[20:02] She's currently over at American Pinball.

[20:05] American Pinball.

[20:06] So she, because she had worked on a lot of these games and a lot of her comments are

[20:10] in there.

[20:11] And she spoke about how great it was to work on this topper, but it was eventually removed

[20:15] for cost savings.

[20:17] The wiring and the software features were all left intact in the back box and in the

[20:23] system.

[20:24] So that actually allows you to reinstall the missing components if you wanted to put them

[20:28] in there, but it was just too expensive to keep it in and they needed to keep the cost

[20:34] savings down.

[20:35] So that's pretty cool that you can actually install it back in if you want to.

[20:39] I can remember seeing them.

[20:43] I know when I first got into the hobby a long time ago, you could get these or the

[20:49] someone was making them, at least a few of them.

[20:51] It was like a kit.

[20:52] It was some kind of kit.

[20:53] I just remember being at a Alan town pinball show and they had three or four of these

[20:58] doctor who's with the topper all set way too loud.

[21:03] So all you heard were the Dalek saying, exterminate, exterminate, exterminate.

[21:07] Yeah, I do know about that.

[21:09] Now the other pit, which is really what I talk about here is watch your fingers, right?

[21:15] The time expand or toy.

[21:16] Now this thing is awesome.

[21:18] And it's funny because I wrote it this episode before, of course, Godzilla has popped up.

[21:26] But this is this seems like a really expensive main toy.

[21:30] And the budget of this game basically went right into this one specific mechanical device.

[21:38] And it was three toys in one.

[21:42] So this is a what they call a change state toy, right?

[21:46] So it will change states or change the shots and things based on where it is positioned

[21:50] or what it is doing on the play field.

[21:52] Do you want to describe the time expand or run?

[21:55] Yeah, it's three levels.

[21:56] And the first level is reminiscent of pinbott actually.

[22:00] It's got two.

[22:01] It's sort of like the cap to the eyes.

[22:02] It's the same thing.

[22:03] You put them in.

[22:04] And then it raises up to a second level where you have these very unique looking targets.

[22:09] They must look like golf balls.

[22:12] Like if you had part of it.

[22:13] Yeah, kind of like the eyeballs in.

[22:14] Oh yeah.

[22:15] Eyeballs in, um, tail, some of the crypt.

[22:18] Yeah.

[22:19] Yep.

[22:20] You pound on those and then it lifts up to the third level where the Daleks are.

[22:24] And they're like little flip up.

[22:25] Little flip up star.

[22:26] You kind of shoot in and they kind of flip up and it goes into the subway underneath,

[22:30] which is pretty cool.

[22:32] The kind of, it goes under the play field.

[22:33] It'll pop up through a vertical upkicker into, uh, I think it's the right side of the

[22:38] play field.

[22:39] Kind of cool.

[22:40] It makes them awesome.

[22:41] It cool sound when you hit one of the Daleks just makes this explosion.

[22:44] Oh, the German.

[22:45] It's a.

[22:46] It's, it's, it's a very unique toy and it, it lowers below the play field and then it

[22:53] will expand up onto the next level and then onto the next level to come right up almost

[22:59] to the glass.

[23:01] And it's, it's really, really impressive to see it in person.

[23:07] I have played some doctor who a friend of mine has them, uh, showed out to Evan.

[23:12] And this is the one machine that has outlasted all of his other machines and he says it will

[23:19] probably never leave.

[23:22] And this is a guy who cycles through a lot of machines and he's not even a doctor who

[23:27] fan.

[23:28] That's how cool this thing is.

[23:30] Now I call it the meat slicer because it's super dangerous to work on.

[23:35] So there's actually a warning that opened when you open up the play field and when you're

[23:38] testing it, it says watch your.

[23:40] Yeah.

[23:41] When you open the coin door because in this era, they didn't have the high power interlock

[23:46] switch on there to cut the high power when you open the coin door.

[23:50] So when you open the coin door, I mean, you can move the thing up and down.

[23:53] So it's just like warning, warning.

[23:54] Yeah.

[23:55] Big time, big time.

[23:56] And this and this Mac is so big.

[23:59] And of course, it goes under the play field.

[24:02] It has this massive mechanical harness to kind of hold it in place so it doesn't jiggle

[24:07] around.

[24:09] And then the subway underneath as well, but it has this rotating motor.

[24:14] It's got a picture of like person getting their fingers jammed in it.

[24:18] Like it's a big, it's a big dangerous friggin toy.

[24:21] So Ron, who was Sophia Ryan?

[24:24] Who at the time was Sophia Bill?

[24:27] She was the first female mechanical engineer hired by Williams Pinball.

[24:31] She owed six US patents on Pinball and casino games.

[24:35] Right out of college, her first American job was at Williams.

[24:38] She was interviewed by Gary Hendrix.

[24:40] As a female in Pinball, specifically as an engineer, it must have been pretty difficult.

[24:45] We had talked at the time about like Linda Deal and Margaret Hudson and sort of how they

[24:51] had to kind of change their demeanor to work in a male dominated industry.

[24:56] Sophia is actually pretty unique because she's Eastern European.

[25:00] So she kind of has this tough, rough exterior, which is really kind of interesting and I think

[25:06] pretty cool.

[25:07] So she was able to kind of put up with that as well.

[25:10] So do you know anything about Gary Hendrix?

[25:12] Jimmy Hendrix's brother.

[25:13] I don't know.

[25:14] So Sophia would say that Gary was a mechanical engineer, a manager.

[25:19] I have to say a real gentleman.

[25:22] I loved working with him.

[25:23] He was a great mentor and advisor and he was just very friendly.

[25:28] So you can see that the engineering team at Williams at the time, of course, was a very

[25:34] close-knit group.

[25:36] Even though there were multiple design teams, there were designers that had wars and fights.

[25:41] That engineering team all shared a collective language and stuff and they built a lot of

[25:46] really great relationships.

[25:48] Sophia said I didn't have a lot of experience.

[25:50] I was a nervous wreck, but I managed.

[25:51] I began my work without designing, helping out with engineering work.

[25:55] So she would work with pool sharks.

[25:58] She would work with the team on pool sharks at Midway.

[26:01] She worked on the machine, brought a pin bot under Python Angelo, the party zone team

[26:06] under Dennis Nordman.

[26:08] And then quickly, Sophia was promoted after every single project from designer to eventually

[26:14] engineer.

[26:15] That's pretty cool.

[26:17] Sophia would say I wasn't even thinking about being a woman.

[26:20] I didn't even know it was a problem.

[26:22] A woman or a man.

[26:23] I felt very comfortable.

[26:25] I became friendly with everyone.

[26:27] We were working our first jobs.

[26:30] So there you go.

[26:31] It was not an issue for her.

[26:33] She just did her job and did it well and she was promoted.

[26:36] She left and right, so good for her.

[26:38] And she is currently the senior mechanical engineer at American pinball.

[26:41] Yeah, that's really cool.

[26:42] Of course, she would leave pinball.

[26:44] She's come back to pinball.

[26:46] And when David fix, he moved to American pinball or API as their director of operations

[26:53] and marketing.

[26:54] He made some internal moves by switching up some of the design groups.

[27:00] One of those moves was to bring in Dennis Nordman.

[27:03] And of course, he was stuck at deep route with no engineer for quite a few years.

[27:08] And that led to his departure at deep route.

[27:11] Some people would call him the canary and the coal mine.

[27:14] And he was speaking to David fix about those who could help out in the engineering department.

[27:19] And he suggested that API hires Sophia.

[27:23] Sophia had worked briefly on Houdini with API before the artwork and everything was completed.

[27:29] And she is somewhat familiar with American pinball.

[27:33] So it was a great fit.

[27:35] So if we go back to really one of the first games that Sophia worked on, Doctor Who, we

[27:41] can talk about some of the different perks that are available on Doctor Who.

[27:45] So you choose a different doctor.

[27:47] Each doctor gives you a different perk when you're playing.

[27:50] Isn't that right?

[27:51] Correct.

[27:52] Which is the doctor you want to choose every time you get this?

[27:54] I have no idea.

[27:56] I'm trying to remember how many doctors there are.

[27:59] I think it's like seven.

[28:01] Yeah, there was seven at the time.

[28:02] So yes, each have different abilities, different perks, which is amazing.

[28:07] I wonder if this game were made today if they would be able to even make something like

[28:11] this because it has the likenesses of all seven doctors on the game, which you think

[28:14] something like that made in today's market would be difficult to get.

[28:17] Oh, especially with like video assets.

[28:20] The rights of everyone's likeness.

[28:22] Yeah, that's one of the things that makes it cool.

[28:24] You can pick your doctor.

[28:26] You got the cool time expander.

[28:27] It's got the video mode, which is pretty cool.

[28:30] You jump over things.

[28:32] I think it's short jumps or one flipper button, long jumps or both flipper buttons.

[28:37] And you try to jump over objects and get into the tarnish.

[28:39] Now, this also has the the berry osler, you know, right or left sweeping, long sweeping

[28:49] ramp, which tends to be some people call it a bit of a designing crutch.

[28:54] But you know what?

[28:55] It's a fingerprint, right?

[28:57] Steve Richie back hands everything.

[28:59] That's his thing while a long sweeping ramp, either on the left or the right is berry

[29:05] osler's thing.

[29:06] Of course, this also has an awesome, awesome drop target, Frank bank on the left side of

[29:11] the thing.

[29:12] I think they're standups with, are they standups?

[29:15] They wouldn't have paid for that many drop targets.

[29:17] No way.

[29:18] Those are standups.

[29:19] Could have been dropped, could have been dropped targets.

[29:22] Yeah, I think with the time expander or cost, there was no way they were putting dropped

[29:25] targets on this side.

[29:27] And the side ramp has the cool sonic boom.

[29:30] You can repeat the thing over and over and you get to the sonic boom stage.

[29:34] Yeah, it's got this really cool like deverter on the ramp where it'll lift up and then

[29:40] the ball will go off that left side ramp and then down into the left side lower flipper,

[29:49] middle flipper.

[29:51] This is a three flipper game.

[29:53] The third flipper is actually positioned really uniquely.

[29:57] It's very, very low on the play field on the left side is basically in the left outlay.

[30:02] Yeah, compared to where they usually are.

[30:04] I found it really difficult when I played this game to get that side ramp shot because

[30:08] I didn't have the timing down.

[30:09] It was very weird.

[30:10] It's a very flowy game.

[30:12] I really like this game, very well designed berry osler.

[30:14] You should be given the props for that.

[30:18] The artwork is just gorgeous by Linda Deal, especially the back glass.

[30:23] I'm not a, like I said, I'm not a doctor who fanatic, but when I look at that and I see

[30:27] all the different doctors and they're in this, it's not, it's not cartoony, but it is,

[30:33] they have taken some liberties.

[30:35] It's not photorealism like you would expect nowadays, but it is really, really well done.

[30:39] I know the guy with the scarf is the most famous one.

[30:42] Yeah, the guy with the, with the afro.

[30:44] Tom Baker.

[30:45] He was the, I believe he was doctor the longest.

[30:48] Yeah, from 1974 to 1981, longer than anybody else.

[30:54] When it comes to the flyer for this game, it's about time.

[30:58] Mm, mm, mm, mm.

[31:00] Yeah, yep.

[31:01] And of course, the doctor is in.

[31:04] Of course.

[31:07] The time expander.

[31:09] Players activate the time expander, while locking two balls on level one of this time distorting

[31:14] a mini play field.

[31:15] Level two will then be exposed in the challenge of restoring earth time back to normal factor

[31:20] zero by lighting all 15 control panel lamps.

[31:23] That is a super, super nerdy sentence that only doctor who has shooting into a door on

[31:29] level three starts multi ball trademark and the chance for Dalek jackpots and Davaro's

[31:35] super jackpots to 300 million points.

[31:38] Ooh.

[31:40] It is like the time expander itself is new, but they did use some pin bot stuff in this.

[31:45] It's the two locks and when you hit the second level targets, it completes a grid.

[31:51] Very pin body, I would say.

[31:53] Yeah, it's cool.

[31:54] I like this game.

[31:55] I'm not, like I said, I'm not a doctor who fan.

[31:56] This is a great game.

[31:57] Now this game you couldn't give away when people were trying to get rid of their balli

[32:02] Williams games, right?

[32:04] Everybody wanted theaters of magic.

[32:06] They wanted the richy games.

[32:07] This one was not one of the ones that was greatly sought after, but in the years recently,

[32:12] it is expensive.

[32:13] It wasn't fast break either.

[32:14] It was it was middle tier, I would say.

[32:16] Is it would you say B level?

[32:17] I would say yeah, C B level.

[32:19] So of course this featured the new Opto flipper button switches as flip tronics too.

[32:24] Mm hmm.

[32:25] What the heck does that mean?

[32:26] It means they don't have leaf switches on the side.

[32:28] They use optos instead, which to be honest, I prefer the leaf switches.

[32:33] You have less issues.

[32:34] Oh, so they, yeah.

[32:35] So now you're getting into another board.

[32:37] Well, again, it's a boring tech talk, but I would prefer that's what Stern uses.

[32:41] That's what that's what's Stern uses to this day.

[32:43] They use the leaf switches.

[32:45] Yeah.

[32:46] Tried and true.

[32:47] It's got a different unique feel.

[32:49] So tons of fun.

[32:50] And of course that is doctor who?

[32:52] You know what you should do.

[32:53] So when we go over all these mechs, you should do like a Facebook thing like on our page

[32:59] and our listeners can vote on what the best mech was.

[33:02] Oh, super good.

[33:03] So what I will do is I will toss up a post about what you think was the best mech swing

[33:12] on over there and type in what you think the best mech that we spoke about is in today's

[33:18] podcast.

[33:19] And of course you can choose anything, even drop targets because those are the best mech

[33:22] ever created.

[33:23] And, and Mr. David Dennis has prepared for this podcast for some time as we have been

[33:28] specifically skipping over certain games.

[33:32] If you've noticed on the previous episodes just because of the mechs, it's almost like

[33:35] a super intricate storyline marvel thing or something.

[33:40] It's all coming together.

[33:41] It is.

[33:42] It is all coercing to actually this episode is the I didn't have enough content for everybody

[33:48] else's episode.

[33:49] So I jammed them on.

[33:50] That's you're not supposed to say that you've just ruined the whole thing there.

[33:55] Okay.

[33:56] Twilight Zone.

[33:57] Yeah.

[33:58] Yeah.

[33:59] Wide bodies make this big return.

[34:01] So somehow somebody at Williams talked management into building wide bodies again.

[34:09] I don't like wide bodies.

[34:10] We're on.

[34:11] They're fine.

[34:12] They're too floaty.

[34:13] The I would say ball takes forever say hardly any of the Williams wide bodies from this

[34:18] era are floaty.

[34:20] Steve Richie just got these these horrible slings.

[34:24] Twilight Zone star truck floaty star trek.

[34:27] Christian is not floaty.

[34:29] Demoman is not floaty.

[34:31] Do I need to continue?

[34:32] Do I need to go through all of them?

[34:34] So so is that well.

[34:36] Okay.

[34:37] We'll skip that one.

[34:38] Roadshow is not floaty.

[34:40] Twilight Zone of course is the sci fi also time travel.

[34:46] Also weird hitchhiker piano theme.

[34:50] This is from April of 93.

[34:51] This is also a WPC flippetronics too.

[34:54] It sells.

[34:55] Are you sitting down run?

[34:57] 15,235 units.

[35:01] The concept and design by Pat Loller, Larry Demar and Ted Estes artwork like all Pat Loller

[35:08] games is done by John Yosey.

[35:11] Dots by Scott Sloanie and Eugene Greer and music and software by Chris Granner, Rich

[35:18] Carskins Carstens and software Larry Demar Ted Estes.

[35:26] This is a pretty special special game, especially if you're talking about mechs because there

[35:30] is a lot of them.

[35:32] This is this is the peak here on on how much crap can we jam into it?

[35:36] Literally, literally.

[35:38] Even Pat Loller said they put too much in this game.

[35:41] They let him go too crazy.

[35:43] Coming off of Adam's family, he was basically told go for it, whatever you want.

[35:47] Yeah.

[35:48] In fact, Jerry Thompson, who's now Stern's epic sound person, saw Twilight Zone pinball

[35:54] in 1994.

[35:56] He fell in love with it.

[35:58] And in 1998, he finally bought a Twilight Zone off of eBay, which was his first pinball

[36:05] machine.

[36:06] So you can see that this machine has inspired the people of today to design and build bits

[36:15] and pieces of pinball.

[36:17] Jerry Thompson's sound designer at Stern.

[36:20] This is his machine.

[36:22] It's quite the machine.

[36:23] And it's designed on the Twilight Zone television series.

[36:28] Of course, Twilight Zone is an American media franchise based on an anthology television

[36:33] series.

[36:34] There is a fifth dimension beyond that, which is known to man.

[36:37] It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition.

[36:42] And it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge.

[36:47] This is a dimension of imagination is an area in which we call the Twilight Zone.

[36:51] Oh, very well done.

[36:53] And of course, it was hosted by Rod Serling.

[36:57] And the episodes are in various genres.

[37:00] They go from sci-fi to fantasy horror thriller.

[37:04] And they often conclude with an unexpected twist and some sort of unusual moral.

[37:11] The first series was shot entirely in black and white, probably the most famous, and ran

[37:16] on CBS for five seasons from 1959 to 1964.

[37:23] They also had a movie in 1983, which I remember seeing a new series in 1985.

[37:31] And in 2019, 2020, there's also been a series reboot on CBS.

[37:38] Now I probably mentioned this in the other episode, but we'll see if you remember what

[37:41] I said, if I said this, Twilight Zone, they actually had to get three separate licenses

[37:47] for this game.

[37:48] Can you name them?

[37:49] Ooh, no, I can't.

[37:51] So they have to get wrong.

[37:53] Right.

[37:54] He was a separate license.

[37:55] So they got that from his wife.

[37:57] The use his likeness.

[37:58] That's one.

[37:59] They have to get the song.

[38:00] Okay, you got the two harder ones first.

[38:01] Yes, they got the golden earring song, Twilight Zone.

[38:04] So the third one should be easy.

[38:06] So it's just the license in general?

[38:08] Yes, from Viacom.

[38:09] Twilight Zone.

[38:10] The only license for Twilight Zone.

[38:12] Wow.

[38:13] I was much better at this though.

[38:15] Yeah, you got the two harder ones first.

[38:16] Seriously, most people would just get the Twilight Zone.

[38:19] This is a great game.

[38:20] I haven't played enough of this game.

[38:22] Every time I've ever been able to find it, it's always had crappy flippers or issues.

[38:26] And it's really tainted the experience.

[38:29] And because of that, I haven't given it a fair enough shake.

[38:32] But answer a new age of pinball where the flyer is all about the max.

[38:37] They even expand the max so you can see them like separately.

[38:41] They're enlarged to show texture.

[38:42] We show the power, the power play field.

[38:47] I think it's called with the power field.

[38:50] Actually, yeah, the power field, which is literally just a mini play field,

[38:54] but it's got two magnets on it that you control instead of flippers,

[38:57] which I never can do that good.

[39:00] It has a gum ball machine that you actually load.

[39:03] It actually loads balls into the gum ball machine.

[39:06] Super cool, Mac.

[39:07] I mean, you could just, you could see it.

[39:09] You could see the balls in there.

[39:10] They pop out.

[39:11] They go into a subway.

[39:13] Then it has the clock.

[39:14] The infamous clock, which actually keeps time.

[39:18] Well, if it's not broke, which it is on most Twilight zones,

[39:21] because the issue with the clock is this is pre LED.

[39:25] So all the lights in the clock are incandescent.

[39:29] And the whole thing is enclosed in plastic.

[39:31] And it would just burst into flames.

[39:33] It would burn horribly, just burn everything up.

[39:36] So that's why the clock almost never works.

[39:38] That was one of the...

[39:39] It's got a bunch of diverters.

[39:40] What's the diverters?

[39:41] It had magnets.

[39:43] It had what the third magnet that was cut before production.

[39:47] Super, super cool.

[39:49] Lots of stacked and loaded gimmicks.

[39:52] It's all about Macs.

[39:53] Even the simple things like the way you shoot the piano shot,

[39:58] but you hit a ramp, it comes up to like a wire form.

[40:01] And then there's a diverter thing that just drops the ball down

[40:04] on the play field, and then you shoot it into the piano.

[40:06] It catches it and then pulls it off of the rail.

[40:08] Like if there's ever a Mac game, this is it.

[40:10] It's all about Macs.

[40:11] Macs, Macs, Macs.

[40:13] It's also...

[40:14] And we mentioned it's a wide body.

[40:16] They convinced them to go to wide body.

[40:18] If you had this in a narrow body,

[40:19] it couldn't cram all the crap in it.

[40:21] There wouldn't be enough room.

[40:23] But what is also kind of interesting is Pat Lawler has said time

[40:26] and time again that he despises wide bodies.

[40:29] There's just too much space, and it incentivizes you

[40:33] to fill that space with stuff.

[40:35] Even though that stuff may not enhance the game itself.

[40:39] But what's neat about this game is he's put this upper play field

[40:44] in gumball Mac and everything up in the top left.

[40:46] And what that has done is it's actually created

[40:50] a narrow body shooter, which is quite interesting.

[40:54] If I'm a text standpoint, I think this was...

[40:57] Huh, let's see, this was the last Williams game

[40:59] that didn't have the high power interlock switch.

[41:04] So it's while it's on.

[41:05] If you open the coin door, it doesn't cut the high voltage,

[41:08] like the 50 volts.

[41:10] That's the one that stops your heart, right?

[41:12] No, that would actually be the display voltage,

[41:14] like 100 plus voltage.

[41:16] Okay, so that's the voltage.

[41:18] It just makes you pee yourself all over.

[41:20] No, this is just...

[41:21] It turns off all the coils and everything.

[41:23] So you can't short stuff into stuff and break your game.

[41:27] That's why they added the interlock switch.

[41:29] But I think this is the last Williams game that didn't have it.

[41:32] It was also the last Williams games to use the shorter coil stops.

[41:36] They went to longer coil stops after this.

[41:38] More useless tech info.

[41:39] Yeah, now this also has the famed Pat Lawler 5 Lane bottom.

[41:44] Of course, Pat Lawler's favorite thing that he does.

[41:48] He's described it as though musicians have a sound,

[41:53] painters have a similar design.

[41:56] Well, the multiple flipper, 5 Lane bottom geometry,

[42:01] repeatable loops, and some sort of side flipper shot

[42:05] is very much Pat Lawler's thing.

[42:08] But he loves that 5 Lane bottom, doesn't he?

[42:11] He does.

[42:12] Pat says, I tried to shake up my style,

[42:14] except for my 5 Lane bottom.

[42:16] I love it.

[42:17] I'll just try it, but it doesn't work the same.

[42:19] I smile because I like doing things

[42:20] that make people uneasy.

[42:22] My favorite part of this is the art.

[42:27] I mean, the max are cool.

[42:28] It's interactive, it's fun, it's got some deep code,

[42:31] which we'll get into in a minute.

[42:32] But man, the artwork that John Yosey did here

[42:35] is so perfectly reminiscent of the theme Twilight Zone,

[42:41] including that backlash, which I think is just stunning.

[42:47] And the funny thing is some of the max in the game really don't,

[42:50] like I don't think there was an episode with a gumball machine,

[42:53] but it's in the game.

[42:54] If you know if there was a gumball machine episode,

[42:56] shoot us an email.

[42:57] I'm pretty sure there wasn't, but it has talking Tina.

[42:59] So I like talking Tina.

[43:01] She kills people.

[43:02] She kills Tally Savales, who if you've ever seen the episode,

[43:05] he's a complete asshole in the episode and deserves to die.

[43:08] My favorite episode, and I think this is a bit cliche,

[43:11] because most people's favorite Twilight Zone episode

[43:13] is the one where the guy is the only survivor in the world

[43:16] so he can read all the books in the library.

[43:18] Yeah, Burgess Meredith, and he breaks his glasses

[43:21] so that he can't read anything.

[43:22] They're not all like that.

[43:23] They had some lighthearted episodes.

[43:26] I'll do this one quick.

[43:27] One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes,

[43:29] there's this dude out in the swamp land,

[43:33] like Redneck Dude with his dog,

[43:35] and he comes home and everyone's crying,

[43:38] and like why are they all crying?

[43:39] But no one can hear him or see him or his dog,

[43:42] and he looks and he sees himself.

[43:44] He's like dead.

[43:45] It's one of those deals where he's dead.

[43:47] Super cool.

[43:48] So he's walking around the wilderness there,

[43:51] and he comes up on this guy who can see him.

[43:54] It's like, hi, I'm St. Peter or whatever.

[43:58] Come to heaven.

[44:00] I'm here to lead you to heaven.

[44:01] And he's there like, oh, cool.

[44:03] So all right, and he starts, oh, I'm sorry.

[44:05] You can't take your dog with you.

[44:07] It's like, excuse me.

[44:09] I can't take my dog.

[44:10] If heaven doesn't have a lot of dogs,

[44:12] and I guess I don't want to be in heaven,

[44:14] does the guy screw you?

[44:16] So then he walks around a while,

[44:18] and then he runs into his other guy who says, hi,

[44:20] I am St. Peter, and like, wait a minute.

[44:23] That other guy said he was St. Peter, like, oh,

[44:26] I'm afraid that was the devil.

[44:28] It's like, oh, these are like, I'm here to lead you to heaven.

[44:31] Can I take my dog with me?

[44:32] Oh, certainly.

[44:33] Everyone is welcome.

[44:35] Oh, he's got him.

[44:36] So he goes to heaven.

[44:38] And the whole moral is like,

[44:39] you die, make sure you have man's best friend with you

[44:41] to lead you the right way.

[44:43] I love that episode.

[44:44] Ha ha.

[44:46] This was really where they had all those stories,

[44:50] which have very much become cliche now in moviemaking

[44:53] where the guy is dead and realizes he's dead,

[44:55] and we all know that.

[44:57] Or the spy who turns out to be a double crossed.

[45:02] Back in this time in the 60s, in the early 60s,

[45:05] people were experiencing those plot twists

[45:08] on a visual medium for the first time.

[45:11] So it must have been pretty epic at the time.

[45:13] And they still hold up today.

[45:14] And again, at the back glass,

[45:15] you could see things like the little spaceship.

[45:18] That's from an episode, the little walking guy

[45:20] that is from an episode.

[45:21] You see Maple Street, the airplane

[45:24] with the, with the ground-in-dude on it.

[45:25] Maple Street.

[45:26] I like that.

[45:27] That was an episode.

[45:28] Mm-hmm.

[45:29] The television where the creepy kid and family

[45:33] are watching that episode and the little kid,

[45:35] they're scared of the little kid.

[45:36] You know what the weirdest thing is though?

[45:38] Rod Sirling is not smoking.

[45:40] So in the original back glass, Rod Sirling was smoking.

[45:44] And of course, it was a bit of a calling card for him

[45:48] because he was a chain smoker.

[45:50] Big time.

[45:50] His widow actually requested that the cigarette be removed

[45:55] from the final production unit after she observed

[45:59] the back glass art.

[46:01] Rod would usually smoke three or four packs a day.

[46:06] In May of 1975, Rod had three heart attacks,

[46:11] one on the operating table while undergoing open heart surgery.

[46:16] And he actually died two days later.

[46:19] Smoking was the cause of his heart disease

[46:22] and his widow did not want that to be part of his legacy.

[46:26] So it was removed from the art.

[46:28] Don't smoke kids.

[46:29] Now it's the vaping.

[46:30] Get off the vaping.

[46:32] Mm-hmm.

[46:32] You look dumb.

[46:33] Oh yeah, and I forgot.

[46:34] This was the last game they Williams did without DCS sound.

[46:37] What was DCS sound?

[46:39] Digital compression system.

[46:41] It was their much improved sound system,

[46:43] especially with voice samples,

[46:46] like games Twilight Zone and before,

[46:49] when you would hear a voice in a game,

[46:51] it would not sound very high quality.

[46:53] It would sound pretty bad.

[46:56] Yeah, it was very compressed.

[46:58] Right.

[46:58] And it sounded like an AM radio.

[47:00] Yeah.

[47:01] Games after this, like, I think the next game was Indiana Jones,

[47:04] Pimball Adventures and after way better, way, way better.

[47:09] And that was used across all of Williams platforms

[47:12] to even their video games.

[47:13] So it was the WPC system was coded in MIDI sounds,

[47:18] which was very much like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

[47:20] stuff.

[47:22] And behind all of the coding,

[47:24] that was basically what it was in the 80s and early 90s.

[47:28] Now, Chris Granger would say that we pressed

[47:31] the Yamaha synthesizers limitations

[47:33] to produce a masking strategy.

[47:36] It was two or $300 system at the time

[47:39] and it was like milking every last cycle from that system.

[47:43] I was disappointed on bailing on DCS on Twilight Zone

[47:48] because it wasn't quite ready.

[47:50] We had to move from DCS back to the Yamaha system.

[47:54] DCS had a varied and rich world

[47:57] with its sounds.

[47:59] They were truer to the genre than any of the other games.

[48:02] It was originally designed to be the new fancy DCS system,

[48:06] but they had to go back to the Yamaha WPC system

[48:09] because they just didn't have the time

[48:12] to finish all the experimentation.

[48:14] Well, technically it's all WPC system.

[48:16] Yeah, whatever the system was called before.

[48:19] Yeah, so whatever the sound part of that was

[48:21] before DCS, the chip set.

[48:25] Now, Ted Estes, who was one of the original designers

[48:30] and team members who designed a lot of the coding,

[48:34] actually spoke about some of the bits that were removed.

[48:37] So there were two actual magnets in the orbit loop shot,

[48:40] weren't there?

[48:41] Yep, and the one was removed

[48:42] and then modders kept putting them back.

[48:46] There's probably a ton of Twilight Zones out there

[48:47] where they have drilled a hole

[48:50] and put the magnet back in.

[48:51] Yeah, the reason, I think that's a bit silly

[48:54] to put it back in, but the reason Ted Estes,

[48:57] and I've got a link to this article that he wrote,

[49:02] one of them was that they had a concern

[49:05] that when the ball went around the orbit,

[49:06] it was going too fast for the magnet to catch it.

[49:09] So they actually had one magnet

[49:11] that was used to slow the ball down

[49:13] so that the second magnet could catch it.

[49:15] So drilling it and putting it back in

[49:17] isn't adding any extra functionality.

[49:20] I don't know if that's true.

[49:21] I think I remember somewhere

[49:23] like the multi-ball intro sequence,

[49:25] it would actually, the two magnets

[49:27] would each catch a ball or something.

[49:30] It had something to do with the multi-ball intro sequence.

[49:33] But you wouldn't see that, right?

[49:34] Because it's basically behind the bunch of magnets.

[49:36] No, you wouldn't see it

[49:37] because you can't see anything on the right side.

[49:39] But you'll know it's there.

[49:41] But you'll know it's there if you're a modern.

[49:42] Mm-hmm.

[49:43] Yeah, now there was also door panel flashers.

[49:46] And of course, those flashers were removed

[49:50] because they were way too distracting

[49:52] when the balls were locked.

[49:53] So underneath the artwork on the play field,

[49:57] there's a door lock, right?

[50:00] And underneath that were actually flashers

[50:02] rather than just lights.

[50:04] It's kind of neat.

[50:04] I can see how it could be distracting.

[50:06] Wow. And I thought that was distracting

[50:07] and they were just incandescent.

[50:09] Imagine that they were LEDs.

[50:11] Oh, wow.

[50:12] Now they also made some changes to that mini-play field.

[50:14] The screen text and switch covers

[50:18] were added to the mini-play field during production.

[50:21] There's also a leveling mechanism that was added.

[50:24] And the words flip here so that people would kind of understand

[50:29] that they had to flip when the ball was in there

[50:31] because without physical flippers on that upper play field,

[50:34] you kind of don't know when to go.

[50:37] I guarantee you, if you have no idea,

[50:38] you'll see it pop up there.

[50:39] Like, am I supposed to do something?

[50:41] And then it'll just drop right off in the game last at you.

[50:44] The other bit.

[50:45] So this machine has the pop bumpers from death

[50:50] on the left side, don't they?

[50:51] Yep.

[50:52] You don't want it in the pop bumpers ever.

[50:54] Ever. You do not want to be in the pop bumpers ever.

[50:57] It is the worst.

[50:59] And a lot of that comes from the pop bumpers being

[51:01] really down low on the play field

[51:03] because the upper play field is up in the top left

[51:07] with the other mechanical bits.

[51:10] Well, they moved those pop bumpers down lower

[51:14] and to the left, which are right over the left out lane

[51:18] and in lane.

[51:18] And man, when that ball gets in there,

[51:20] it's power drain and out the left side.

[51:23] Well, Ted Estee says that Pat wanted to try something

[51:26] a bit radical and place the jet bumpers.

[51:28] Again, notice their Williams, so they're jet bumpers.

[51:31] That's what they call them at Williams.

[51:33] Very close to the bottom of the play field.

[51:34] After experimenting with the jet bumper placement

[51:36] on the whitewoods, Pat decided that they weren't too bad

[51:41] down there.

[51:42] Something changed between the whitewoods

[51:43] and prototypes, however.

[51:44] The ball kept flying down the left lane any time

[51:46] it went into the bumpers.

[51:48] After a few weeks of listening to complaints,

[51:50] Pat came in to work one morning, grabbed the drills,

[51:52] some tee nuts, posts, and rubbers, and installed the posts.

[51:55] The complaints died down after several thousand games

[51:58] into the production run.

[51:59] Yeah, so when you're playing in big high level tournaments,

[52:02] they'll remove some of these posts, isn't it, right?

[52:05] They remove lots of posts, yeah.

[52:07] So the biggest issue when you start modifying on the fly

[52:11] is that then issues will pop up from the fixes.

[52:15] So Ted has another quote.

[52:16] Then people were complaining that the ball would fly

[52:18] out of the bumpers and straight between the flippers.

[52:21] Something else had changed.

[52:22] Pat decided to take out the posts, but leave the holes

[52:25] and put the posts in the coin box for the operator

[52:27] to decide to use.

[52:28] Yeah, so I mean, come on.

[52:29] People complain about tweaks to play fields nowadays too, right?

[52:33] So this is already in production.

[52:35] And they're like, all right, screw it.

[52:36] We'll just put them in the coin box

[52:37] if they want to make it harder or easier,

[52:39] they can put it in.

[52:40] And wow, people complain about sending in a new post

[52:45] for sort of rage, is upper play field.

[52:48] Well, it's pinball.

[52:50] That's always happened and will probably always happen.

[52:53] Now you talked about the clock a little bit, right?

[52:56] Now there was a whole meeting about the clock

[53:00] when they were designing this game.

[53:01] They actually sat down specifically to chat about the clock.

[53:05] They needed some way to let people know

[53:08] that they had a certain amount of time to complete a task.

[53:11] Live a Simpsons pinball party.

[53:13] And on the upper play field, there is a countdown clock, right?

[53:18] That countdown clock is designed to tell you

[53:21] how much time you have to complete a task.

[53:23] Nowadays it's on the LCD screen.

[53:25] Well, this was the way that they did it back in the day.

[53:28] Was a physical, actual analog clock.

[53:31] And it kept time.

[53:33] It actually kept time.

[53:33] If it's working, it will actually have the correct time on it.

[53:37] Assuming your CPU has the right time.

[53:40] You know how much it cost?

[53:41] It was the most expensive tooling budget ever at Williams.

[53:44] That's the cost of to build the Mac.

[53:46] Like all the bits and pieces that they had to...

[53:48] Like all the stuff that they had to order,

[53:50] all the tools they had to order, and then the manufacturing.

[53:53] That's what the tooling budget is.

[53:54] The plastics had to be made.

[53:56] It was $200,000 for all the tooling to build the clock.

[53:59] Yeah, that broke the budget big time.

[54:01] And then the clocks themselves broke as they all fried.

[54:04] And then they just didn't stop working.

[54:06] So one of the big secondary market toys to buy

[54:11] is the updated LED clock Mac.

[54:15] Those are all over the place.

[54:17] One of the longest running mods ever.

[54:20] I mean, 17 years ago when I got it,

[54:23] that was one of the main.

[54:24] Like we have new clock boards.

[54:27] You get a new clock board and would have LEDs on it.

[54:29] Instead of incandescence and you put it in your clock.

[54:32] So it would actually work.

[54:34] See when they put Twilight Zone out on test, Pat, oh.

[54:37] Then there's a couple other things, right?

[54:38] So there's the gumball machine and the power ball

[54:42] and how that ties into the Twilight Zone code.

[54:46] Was the code too much?

[54:49] The idea was that you had light camera action at Gottlieb,

[54:52] which kind of created mode-based games.

[54:55] Shortly after that, you had the Adam's family,

[54:58] which had modes and it was thought to be too crazy.

[55:03] And then this thing went way over

[55:06] when it came to code, right?

[55:09] I don't know if I'd say that.

[55:10] Is it hard?

[55:12] It's not.

[55:12] Well, okay.

[55:14] It depends how you want to play this.

[55:16] If you're playing Twilight Zone in a tournament,

[55:18] it's one of the easiest games in the world to play.

[55:20] You hit the two ramps, you lock a ball.

[55:22] You lock a ball.

[55:23] You start multi-ball.

[55:24] You get jackpots.

[55:24] When it's over, you hit two ramps, you lock a ball.

[55:29] Also, anytime the right orbit is lit

[55:31] for the, to load the gumball machine, you hit it.

[55:33] And eventually you'll get Power Ball Mania.

[55:35] And you play that.

[55:36] That's it.

[55:37] That's what you do.

[55:38] From a tournament strategy,

[55:39] it's one of the easiest games to learn.

[55:42] Now, if you actually want to play all the modes

[55:44] in the game, which nobody does, now you hit,

[55:47] I can't remember if it's both ramps or one ramp,

[55:49] but you hit a ramp and then you hit the scoop.

[55:53] I think it's either scoop.

[55:54] I think there's the scoop up front,

[55:56] but I think you can hit the piano shot

[55:57] and start some mode too.

[55:58] I don't remember.

[55:59] Because no one plays the modes,

[56:01] because the only time I play it is internaments.

[56:03] But it has all these different modes,

[56:05] the panels they're called.

[56:07] They didn't call them modes.

[56:09] And if you finish it,

[56:10] which are down in the middle of the play field,

[56:12] they're like all these things, looks like a doorway.

[56:14] Yep, and you get through them all,

[56:15] which you don't have to finish, Andy.

[56:16] I mean, you just have to start them.

[56:18] Then you can get lost in the zone,

[56:19] which is the wizard mode.

[56:21] But the thing is, it's not really rule complexity.

[56:24] It was more like, what's the word on confusion?

[56:29] Like people would get a power ball

[56:30] and they would say put it back.

[56:31] And they'd be like, what are you being put it back?

[56:33] What am I supposed to do with this?

[56:34] They had no clue what they were supposed to do.

[56:36] Or like we said on the power, you hit it up there

[56:39] and it's like, okay, am I supposed to do something?

[56:41] Supposed to hit buttons.

[56:43] So Pat Lawler said, we went and drove it off a cliff.

[56:47] We carefully integrated the theme.

[56:49] It didn't do that well.

[56:50] It was not understandable.

[56:51] Pinheads knew, but you end up playing

[56:53] to a smaller audience that wants more and more and more.

[56:56] Adam's family delivered on what regular people wanted

[56:59] to do, Twilight Zone didn't.

[57:01] Yeah, so there was a lot of concerns

[57:04] about the complexity and the Twilight Zone code.

[57:08] So when they put Twilight Zone out on test,

[57:11] and back in the day, they would have a secret location

[57:15] or a couple of locations somewhere in Chicago,

[57:18] where they would put a machine

[57:19] and then they'd kind of sit there

[57:21] and have some beers and watch people play it

[57:23] and look for stuck balls and they'd watch for people's reactions.

[57:28] And that's when Pat said that he came in on a Monday

[57:31] and somebody told him one of the most horrible things

[57:34] that he had ever heard.

[57:36] Well, I must have just heard my story.

[57:38] Yeah, they had it on test and some kid got the power ball

[57:41] and didn't know what to do with it.

[57:43] They just screamed, I hate this game,

[57:44] threw up his hands and walked away.

[57:47] Ouch.

[57:48] Pat would say, when you hear that,

[57:51] it's like putting a gun to your head.

[57:52] You know you're done.

[57:55] So that's not good.

[57:57] Although they still sell 15,000 units.

[58:01] So you've put a whole lot of shenanigans in there.

[58:06] You're excited and you got this game.

[58:08] It's gonna be so much fun.

[58:09] And then you got,

[58:10] what power ball is pretty cool.

[58:11] I have to agree.

[58:12] It's kind of a neat concept.

[58:13] Let's explain that a little bit more.

[58:15] The power ball is a ceramic ball instead of a steel ball.

[58:20] So it's like white, milky white color.

[58:23] And it's super fast.

[58:24] And it's super fast.

[58:25] It's much lighter.

[58:26] And the game has a sensor.

[58:29] I think it's in around the,

[58:31] the where it comes out into the shooter lane,

[58:33] where it can detect if it's ball's metal or not.

[58:37] If it's not metal, it knows it's the power ball.

[58:39] And the game will tell you, power ball.

[58:42] So how do you, so if you drain the power ball,

[58:44] how does it know to get it back up into?

[58:46] It just sits in the trough.

[58:47] So then you have,

[58:48] eventually we'll have to play with it in regular time.

[58:50] Eventually if you lock enough balls,

[58:51] then it'll be, it'll come out.

[58:53] Ooh, that doesn't sound very good.

[58:55] It's not necessarily fair.

[58:56] You could walk up.

[58:57] If you're playing someone,

[58:58] you could walk up and it just so happens,

[59:00] you get the power ball.

[59:01] They don't.

[59:02] But it is cool.

[59:05] If you lock the power ball in the right orbit,

[59:08] goes into the gumball machine

[59:09] and then you get the power ball and you get a multi ball,

[59:14] where you're supposed to shoot it up into the power field

[59:16] and hit the magnets and try to get it.

[59:20] You have to hit it like forward into the,

[59:22] like off the play field.

[59:23] And then you get power ball jackpots,

[59:26] which is hard to do

[59:26] because you gotta keep,

[59:27] you gotta still be a multi ball while you're doing all this

[59:29] and coordinate it and not lose the ball.

[59:31] It is not easy.

[59:32] It's just too hard.

[59:34] Just, it just sounds,

[59:34] it that sounds horrible.

[59:35] That sounds way too hard for an average person probably.

[59:38] And I'm,

[59:39] and I'm,

[59:40] I would say I'm an average pinball player.

[59:42] Like I'm decent, right?

[59:43] I'm not a beginner.

[59:44] I'm not you.

[59:46] You know, I'm not even, you know,

[59:48] somebody who's got a very regularly

[59:51] moved, turned over collection.

[59:53] That's pretty experienced in a bunch of games.

[59:54] I'm a little bit better than the person

[59:56] that comes up to play.

[59:57] And it sounds way too hard.

[59:59] I didn't even describe the multi,

[01:00:02] the regular multi ball.

[01:00:03] Ugh.

[01:00:04] You hit the, say, say you hit a jackpot,

[01:00:06] which is the piano shot.

[01:00:07] So normally you'd hit the,

[01:00:09] the right ramp, it comes around to the diverter thing.

[01:00:11] He puts it in front of the flipper, you hit it.

[01:00:13] And you gotta do all this

[01:00:14] while you still have multiple balls in play.

[01:00:16] Then if you, if you get good,

[01:00:17] you can coordinate it where you get the jackpot,

[01:00:20] but then you have to relight the jackpot,

[01:00:22] which is the shot under the upper left flipper,

[01:00:25] that's through the pop-uppers,

[01:00:26] or kind of all the pop-uppers.

[01:00:28] Yeah, it's like a hit.

[01:00:29] So you actually have to hit the right orbit.

[01:00:32] That's why the magnets are, it'll stop it.

[01:00:33] It'll feed it to that upright flipper.

[01:00:35] You hit it in there to relight the jackpot.

[01:00:38] And then you gotta get it back up to that diverter thingy again

[01:00:41] and then hit it inside again.

[01:00:42] You gotta coordinate all this with multiple balls

[01:00:44] and not drain.

[01:00:45] Super fun when you can do it.

[01:00:47] I bet.

[01:00:48] You had mentioned that they sold 15,000 units

[01:00:51] and they had anticipated selling a butt load

[01:00:55] of Twilight Zones.

[01:00:57] They gave Pat Lawler and the team

[01:00:59] just a massive amount of leeway to come over things.

[01:01:03] But with big sales of machines

[01:01:06] and the release of amazing machines like Twilight Zones,

[01:01:10] you start getting into some sales issues

[01:01:13] with your sales team,

[01:01:14] which are independent business owners, distributors.

[01:01:18] And they needed to control some of the sales

[01:01:21] with this era's massive boom in sales.

[01:01:25] Many distributors had exclusive rights

[01:01:28] to sell machines in a given territory.

[01:01:31] So for example, you were given, you know,

[01:01:34] upstate New York was your territory

[01:01:36] and you couldn't sell machines down in New York City.

[01:01:40] Or you could only sell machines in the Midwest.

[01:01:43] You couldn't send machines to California.

[01:01:47] But of course, some distributors would sell

[01:01:51] a lot of their units outside of their areas.

[01:01:54] But of course, this was difficult to prove and to track.

[01:01:58] So on Twilight Zone,

[01:01:59] because they expected this to be a massive hit,

[01:02:03] they knew that people would be tempted

[01:02:05] to sell outside of their territories.

[01:02:08] So what they did is they printed a secret serial number

[01:02:12] on all of the play fields right above the door image.

[01:02:16] And you can only see with a black light.

[01:02:19] Wow, it's like stranger things, but before stranger things.

[01:02:24] Pat says if the game turned up outside the territory,

[01:02:26] it was assumed that the distributor had bootleg

[01:02:29] the game outside of his territory.

[01:02:31] Then it was up to management to decide what penalty

[01:02:33] to incur on the offender.

[01:02:35] Remember, this was during a time when it was profitable

[01:02:37] to sell and operate pinball machines.

[01:02:39] This practice would be laughable today

[01:02:41] because any sale of a pinball machine is a good sale.

[01:02:44] Ouch.

[01:02:46] So now Pat Lawler's a quote a little bit,

[01:02:50] a couple of minutes ago, he had said that it didn't do well.

[01:02:54] The sales didn't do well,

[01:02:56] but 15,000 units is pretty nuts.

[01:02:58] Yeah, anyone would want to sell 15,000.

[01:03:01] Clay Herell, of course, was the co-host and host of Topcast,

[01:03:07] which is one of the locations where we get a lot

[01:03:10] of the content for this podcast.

[01:03:13] Now, in that episode with Pat Lawler,

[01:03:15] Pat's talking about Twilight Zone,

[01:03:17] he's like, oh, we sold a ton of them.

[01:03:18] We sold like 17,000 units.

[01:03:22] Then Clay Herell says something

[01:03:24] which I found kind of interesting.

[01:03:26] Clay points out that a lot of those sales

[01:03:29] were on what he calls close out.

[01:03:32] Do you know what close out is, Ron?

[01:03:34] I don't know.

[01:03:35] What's a close out, Dave?

[01:03:37] I don't know either.

[01:03:39] So I went and I kind of like did a little bit of looking.

[01:03:42] Basically, what it means is the inventory

[01:03:46] that was built up at Williams was sold

[01:03:50] at a significant discount to the distributors

[01:03:53] to get them out of the factory and get them done.

[01:03:56] So they anticipated to sell so much of these machines.

[01:04:00] And Pat was very proud at how much they sold

[01:04:02] and then sort of Clay kind of brings them down a peg.

[01:04:04] I don't know if he did that by accident,

[01:04:06] but he just says, oh, a lot of those were by close out, right?

[01:04:08] Which basically means they were trying

[01:04:10] to get rid of them because they had built too many

[01:04:13] so they sold them at a significant discount.

[01:04:15] I like how you say distributor.

[01:04:17] Hey, pinheads.

[01:04:19] I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not doing

[01:04:21] this podcast and making bad jokes,

[01:05:19] So that's when we're gonna get into something really cool

[01:05:21] and this is a game that I haven't played,

[01:05:23] but everybody that does play it basically talks

[01:05:26] about how amazing it is and that's the shadow.

[01:05:30] It's of course a movie licensed theme from November of 1994.

[01:05:35] This is a WPCS system.

[01:05:37] It sells 4247 units.

[01:05:40] Ooh, that is quite the difference in a year

[01:05:43] when it comes to sales.

[01:05:45] The designer is one Brian Eddie,

[01:05:48] art by the legend Doug Watson,

[01:05:50] dots by Scott Slominy and Eugene Greer again,

[01:05:54] music and sound by Dan Fordon,

[01:05:57] additional software provided by Mike Boone and Brian Eddie.

[01:06:01] So what is the shadow?

[01:06:04] Uh, it was like a radio show I believe back in the day.

[01:06:09] Of course, this is based on the 1994 American superhero

[01:06:13] obviously used loosely film starring Alec Baldwin

[01:06:18] who's not Billy Baldwin and not Stephen Baldwin.

[01:06:21] Nope, but they all look the same.

[01:06:23] Alec Bowie.

[01:06:25] Based on the 1930s pulp novels,

[01:06:28] which I had to look up what that means.

[01:06:30] It's basically like a,

[01:06:33] a before comic books sort of sci-fi thing.

[01:06:38] A, of course, radio dramas and in the future actual comics.

[01:06:42] I know the radio show was just like they would do the line.

[01:06:45] Who knows, the shadow knows.

[01:06:49] It was a big deal I guess,

[01:06:50] because back in those days, now days,

[01:06:52] we're having these like radio dramas,

[01:06:55] which are actually now just like podcasts.

[01:06:58] But back in the day, the radio drama was very much what was,

[01:07:03] what the family would listen to on, you know, Wednesday nights,

[01:07:07] instead of watching what we now see as the bachelor.

[01:07:12] So that radio dramas were the television of its time.

[01:07:16] Now this film was released in theaters in July 1st, 1994.

[01:07:19] It received mixed reviews,

[01:07:21] which I think is actually quite kind.

[01:07:23] And was a commercial failure.

[01:07:26] It had a $40 million budget made $48 million at the box office.

[01:07:30] $40 million. How's that a failure?

[01:07:33] It holds a 35% rotten tomatoes rating.

[01:07:38] Have you seen the shadow in 1994?

[01:07:39] I have not.

[01:07:41] I'm very proud of you because if you would have said,

[01:07:43] oh, yeah, I've seen the shadow.

[01:07:45] And I'd be like, you've seen the shadow,

[01:07:47] but you haven't seen any of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies.

[01:07:50] I would have driven down to upstate New York

[01:07:53] and I would have burned your house down.

[01:07:55] I'm sorry. It does have Tim Curry in it though.

[01:07:58] So that makes me kind of want to see it.

[01:08:00] Tim Curry has a pinball connection.

[01:08:03] He was in this.

[01:08:04] He was also in Congo.

[01:08:06] Wait a second.

[01:08:07] Tim Curry, the basketball player?

[01:08:08] No, no, that's Stefan Curry.

[01:08:11] Oh.

[01:08:14] So this is designed by Brian Eddie.

[01:08:17] This is his first designed game.

[01:08:19] And of course, Brian Eddie would become, you know,

[01:08:21] a mythical creature within pinball.

[01:08:25] He was a programmer previously, wasn't he?

[01:08:28] Yeah, did games like Brian of pinball, black rose.

[01:08:31] He's a guy that came up with the whole cow thing.

[01:08:34] I guess he was really into cows.

[01:08:35] So he started putting cows into all his games.

[01:08:38] So then everyone else at Williams followed suit

[01:08:40] and started putting cows in all their games.

[01:08:42] That's original.

[01:08:43] Kind of is.

[01:08:44] It's not like a goat, a cow.

[01:08:46] Of course, Adam Ryan has a really close relationship

[01:08:50] with Brian. They're good buddies.

[01:08:52] And he would say in his top cast interview

[01:08:54] that Brian was very team focused guy.

[01:08:57] Whatever the theme was that he was working on,

[01:09:01] he wanted to hear everyone's opinion,

[01:09:03] no matter how diverse or odd they were.

[01:09:06] As a team, we would sit down and decide

[01:09:08] what was suitable for the game.

[01:09:11] And if you had a good idea, it would go into the game.

[01:09:15] I was just thrilled to have my dots or my ideas

[01:09:19] and even some of my speech that I wrote in the game.

[01:09:24] Is this a good game, Ron?

[01:09:26] Yes.

[01:09:27] Why is it a good game?

[01:09:29] Because it shoots good.

[01:09:30] It's fun.

[01:09:31] And it has cool max.

[01:09:33] Specifically, it's got the battlefield,

[01:09:36] which is, it's not new in that games like like swords

[01:09:40] of fury at a very similar little mini play field

[01:09:43] where you hit targets in the back.

[01:09:46] But this one has instead of a flipper,

[01:09:48] it's got like a kicker thing you slide back and forth.

[01:09:51] So it makes it, makes it unique.

[01:09:53] And then it also has the diverters, the pervas,

[01:09:58] where you can, everyone loves diverters.

[01:10:02] But wouldn't it be great if you could control the diverters?

[01:10:05] We'll shuttle it, you control two diverters.

[01:10:07] So you have two ramps, but in effect,

[01:10:09] in effect, you have four shots

[01:10:11] and you can control them.

[01:10:13] The diverters.

[01:10:14] Yes, you shoot up a ramp

[01:10:15] and you can click an extra button on the left side

[01:10:17] or the right side, a cabinet,

[01:10:19] and it will flick the diverter.

[01:10:20] And then that ramp will go either left or right.

[01:10:22] And you are in full control of these diverters.

[01:10:24] You can do cool things like create massive air balls

[01:10:27] by hitting the ramp and then flicking the diverter

[01:10:29] as it's going up the ramp.

[01:10:30] So it knocks the ball off everything.

[01:10:32] And you can just sit there

[01:10:33] and click the diverters nonstop,

[01:10:35] just back and forth, back and forth,

[01:10:36] the back and forth, the back and forth,

[01:10:38] which is awesome if you've got young children.

[01:10:41] Then you have the, in the back, it has a magnet,

[01:10:44] which almost certainly will have caused some

[01:10:47] discoloring of the paint over it.

[01:10:51] So they call this the sanctum.

[01:10:52] The sanctum.

[01:10:53] The sanctum is just a huge drop target,

[01:10:55] custom drop target, much taller,

[01:10:58] but it is basically a drop target.

[01:10:59] In front of it, there's a magnet that stops the ball

[01:11:02] and then it pulses the magnet

[01:11:03] to throw the ball into the sanctum.

[01:11:05] Now a sanctum, of course, is a sacred place,

[01:11:08] especially a shrine with an temple or a church,

[01:11:12] but most people making this as a butthole joke.

[01:11:15] Okay.

[01:11:16] You got to make sure you don't have a dirty sanctum.

[01:11:17] All right.

[01:11:18] Canadian Lations, gentlemen, just if you didn't know.

[01:11:20] So Ron, why does the sanctum get dirty?

[01:11:23] Because there's a magnet in front of it

[01:11:25] and it just burns the play field.

[01:11:27] I've seen other than a restored shadow,

[01:11:30] I've never seen just a regular shadow

[01:11:33] that didn't have burn marks in front.

[01:11:36] So they even just sell stickers.

[01:11:37] You can buy mylar stickers that people just stick on.

[01:11:39] Yeah, too.

[01:11:40] Very cool.

[01:11:41] Now the art, the art is, it leaves a little bit

[01:11:45] to be desired.

[01:11:47] The quality of the art is actually very good.

[01:11:52] Of course, that art, you know,

[01:11:54] would you expect anything else from Doug Watson

[01:11:56] on the art there?

[01:11:58] But it's got a lot of Alec Baldwin.

[01:12:04] Yep.

[01:12:05] He's front and center.

[01:12:06] He's Alec Baldwin.

[01:12:07] And this is like early 90s Alec Baldwin

[01:12:10] where he was just gorgeous.

[01:12:13] As opposed to now where he's sort of like,

[01:12:15] I'm Alec Baldwin.

[01:12:16] I can be whatever the hell I want.

[01:12:17] Alec Baldwin.

[01:12:19] This was like big time peak Alec Baldwin.

[01:12:23] I mean, the shadow himself is kind of in the background.

[01:12:27] He's not even, which is the better designed art part.

[01:12:30] And then Khan, Khan is the bad guy.

[01:12:32] Not Star Trek Khan, but this Khan.

[01:12:35] You mean Benedict Cumberbatch?

[01:12:36] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:12:39] I mean, real Khan Star Trek, that would not be,

[01:12:42] that would be Ricardo Montemont.

[01:12:43] But we're talking about the shadow.

[01:12:45] Let's not start this again.

[01:12:46] We don't need to have a marital here on the...

[01:12:49] There's no debate, I'm right.

[01:12:50] So why was Alec so big, do you think?

[01:12:54] Why was his head so big on the back glass

[01:12:56] so much bigger than everyone else?

[01:12:57] Adam Ryan speculates it could have been based

[01:12:59] on heavy-handed license.

[01:13:01] Doug Watson did the painting for that.

[01:13:02] He might have been responding to some sort of demand

[01:13:04] where Alec Baldwin had to take up, you know,

[01:13:06] 50% of the back glass and the other actors

[01:13:09] will take up 25%.

[01:13:10] That's sort of like the Sandra Bullock getting the shaft

[01:13:13] in demo, man.

[01:13:15] If she didn't, she's the same size as all of them.

[01:13:17] She didn't get a game.

[01:13:18] Oh, no, yeah.

[01:13:20] If you look at Demelman, they did the opposite.

[01:13:23] Okay, everyone has to be exactly the same size.

[01:13:26] No, interesting.

[01:13:27] There's some complexity in this pin,

[01:13:30] but we're not talking crazy twilight zone complexity, right?

[01:13:33] We're not talking about things moving and changing

[01:13:36] and adjusting and 12 or 13 things.

[01:13:38] You got the big battlefield, you got these really cool

[01:13:41] divers, but that's kind of it, right?

[01:13:43] Well, you know what you don't have?

[01:13:45] What's not in this game?

[01:13:46] That's in most games.

[01:13:48] An auto launcher.

[01:13:49] No, it has an auto launcher.

[01:13:50] Subway.

[01:13:54] Actually, I don't know if it has a subway,

[01:13:55] but that's not the answer.

[01:13:57] Just like the play field.

[01:13:58] What is it missing?

[01:14:00] What play field element is it missing?

[01:14:03] I'll give you a clue.

[01:14:04] There's only one of them on Godzilla.

[01:14:05] Pop bumpers.

[01:14:06] There's no pop bumpers.

[01:14:07] There's no pop bumpers.

[01:14:09] Oh, since it's William, I'm sorry.

[01:14:10] There are no jet bumpers on the play field.

[01:14:13] Wow.

[01:14:14] There wasn't even, even in this era of Williams,

[01:14:17] where they pretty much let the designers do what they wanted.

[01:14:20] Very few games would have no pop bumpers at all.

[01:14:23] This is one of two of them I can remember.

[01:14:26] I know no fear doesn't have one either.

[01:14:28] So less pops, more max.

[01:14:31] And of course, on the flyer, where the shadow falls,

[01:14:35] earnings rise.

[01:14:38] Wow, very good reading there.

[01:14:40] No one can resist the power of the shadow.

[01:14:43] Has he cool, I think it's a 45, the gun launcher?

[01:14:48] The ones that Williams made that were not plastic,

[01:14:50] they were like metal and they,

[01:14:52] yeah, you could just grab it and you could slam tilt that thing.

[01:14:55] You could lift all game up.

[01:14:56] You could hurt people with the thing.

[01:14:58] The worst part about that is catching it like in your leg

[01:15:01] when you're moving like left or right.

[01:15:03] Or if you have to move it in a vehicle

[01:15:05] and that's the part that sticks out.

[01:15:06] So you can't close the door or something

[01:15:08] and you have to take it off.

[01:15:09] So what's interesting about this game,

[01:15:11] this is a really flowy game, right?

[01:15:15] It's got that repeatable loop that everybody loves to shoot.

[01:15:18] It has a couple of orbit shots.

[01:15:21] It's got that really neat sort of center looping return shot

[01:15:26] thing.

[01:15:27] It's got these diverters with left or right.

[01:15:30] One of them, particularly the left side ramp

[01:15:32] and the diverter are really close to the player.

[01:15:35] So there's lots of like action going on there.

[01:15:39] Yeah, and two stand up.

[01:15:40] So if you miss the ramp, you can hit them and drain.

[01:15:43] It's a dangerous dangerous game.

[01:15:45] And what blows my mind about this era,

[01:15:49] when they're designing high flow really precise shots,

[01:15:54] they're doing all of this stuff with paper on a drafting table.

[01:15:59] What's a drafting table, Ron?

[01:16:01] It's a big table that you draw on.

[01:16:03] You draft on it.

[01:16:04] I would think by the 90s, they did have CAD.

[01:16:07] I'm pretty sure they didn't have solid works yet,

[01:16:09] but I know they had CAD by the 90s.

[01:16:11] That's what they're using.

[01:16:13] But even what's even crazier about this stuff

[01:16:16] is not just the designer doing the shots,

[01:16:19] but the engineer who has to design the ramps

[01:16:23] that have to be manufactured and bent and welded

[01:16:27] and screwed together, they're using drafting tables

[01:16:31] to do all of these designs as well.

[01:16:33] So VIA says, right now in 3D, you just design it

[01:16:36] and it just calculates all the information for you.

[01:16:38] But at the time, I had to do projection on every radius,

[01:16:41] every corner entry level.

[01:16:44] I had like a thousand lines, horizontal and vertical,

[01:16:47] and I had to connect them all to create a bottom view

[01:16:49] or side view.

[01:16:50] Yeah, we're talking some serious, serious work.

[01:16:54] And of course, speaking of the drafting table,

[01:16:57] eventually Williams would begin using a program

[01:16:59] called AutoCAD.

[01:17:02] Do you know what AutoCAD is?

[01:17:03] I know what it is, but I don't know what it is.

[01:17:07] Like it's a drawing software, right?

[01:17:09] Is that basically it?

[01:17:10] It's pretty much, yeah.

[01:17:11] Instead of writing it up on a drafting table,

[01:17:14] you do it on a computer.

[01:17:16] And I believe they still use some iteration of CAD

[01:17:19] even at Stern.

[01:17:21] I know that you use solid works for like the 3D stuff.

[01:17:25] I think there is still some CAD that it gets used.

[01:17:28] And Dennis Norman would say that his first game

[01:17:30] in AutoCAD was Indy 500.

[01:17:32] Before it was pencil, paper and mylar.

[01:17:35] We drew on big mylar sheets.

[01:17:38] It was a big learning curve for sure going to AutoCAD.

[01:17:41] So it probably took longer.

[01:17:43] And that brings us into Dennis Nordman's

[01:17:46] crazy Mac game, Indianapolis 500.

[01:17:49] I love Indy 500.

[01:17:50] This is a sports racing theme from June of 1995.

[01:17:55] It's the Williams WPC Fliptronics 2.

[01:17:58] It sells, ooh, 2,249 units.

[01:18:02] Yeah, hard to get one.

[01:18:04] And they're usually very expensive.

[01:18:05] They of course designed by Dennis Nordman,

[01:18:08] Art by Dan Hughes.

[01:18:09] Now he did Corvette as well as he did all the Alvin G

[01:18:12] Gottlieb machines as well as Paul Barker

[01:18:16] did a little bit of work on this.

[01:18:17] And he's known for junkyard who done it.

[01:18:19] But he didn't really do much art either.

[01:18:22] Dots, Adam Ryan and Brian Morris, music and sound

[01:18:26] by the legend Chris Granner, software Mike Boone

[01:18:28] and Craig Stila.

[01:18:30] See, see, it's why.

[01:18:31] Ellis, Sila?

[01:18:33] Sila.

[01:18:34] Doesn't our shirts say like mispronouncing names

[01:18:36] for something like that.

[01:18:38] It's perfect.

[01:18:38] So we got over to SilverballSwag.com.

[01:18:40] And make sure you say Alvin G, not Gottlieb.

[01:18:42] It's not Gottlieb.

[01:18:43] He couldn't use the name Gottlieb,

[01:18:45] even though that's his name.

[01:18:46] Yes, Alvin G and Co.

[01:18:49] So Indianapolis 500.

[01:18:50] This is the annual motor race,

[01:18:54] which is built as the greatest spectacle in racing.

[01:18:58] Of course, it is traditionally held

[01:18:59] on Memorial Day weekend in May.

[01:19:02] It is best known for being part of the Indycar series

[01:19:06] and an integral piece in the coveted triple crown

[01:19:10] in motor racing.

[01:19:12] Ron, that is when you win the Le Mans 24 hours,

[01:19:16] the Monaco Grand Prix from the Formula One

[01:19:19] and the Indy 500.

[01:19:21] That is the triple crown.

[01:19:23] You learn something new every day.

[01:19:24] The art done by Dan Hughes,

[01:19:27] you can see on IPDB, the sketch before it was determined.

[01:19:31] It was a Bally Aura Williams game.

[01:19:33] This back glass for a person,

[01:19:35] I'm a big motor sports fan.

[01:19:36] I love motor sports.

[01:19:38] I'm a big F1 fan.

[01:19:40] Actually, while we're recording this qualifying is happening.

[01:19:43] And the back glass on this is awesome.

[01:19:47] It's got like a bunch of cars at Indy.

[01:19:51] They've got that really cool 1990s Indycar looking thing,

[01:19:57] open wheel racing.

[01:19:58] It is an awesome, awesome back glass for a motor sports fan.

[01:20:04] This also has the, the cabin artwork uses a lot of red.

[01:20:08] So this is another game that is very difficult

[01:20:11] to find a non-faded example of.

[01:20:13] Super faded.

[01:20:14] Super faded, usually every time you find one of these.

[01:20:17] Ron, probably one of the most

[01:20:20] cliché things that you could put onto the marketing operators.

[01:20:27] Start your engines.

[01:20:29] Yes, the flyer.

[01:20:31] Well, what else are you gonna put on there?

[01:20:33] What is it?

[01:20:34] Racing to higher profits maybe could be one.

[01:20:37] We built this one to move fast,

[01:20:39] which is actually the one that's written there.

[01:20:42] Damn, I'd like mine better.

[01:20:44] Racing to higher profits.

[01:20:46] Here the engines roar, see the lights flash.

[01:20:50] Feel the excitement when Bali straps you into the fastest game around Indianapolis.

[01:20:56] 500.

[01:20:57] Hit the turbo, Bobby.

[01:20:59] It's a cool game.

[01:21:00] I really like Indy 500.

[01:21:02] So the toys on this one, we got a little turntable thing for the model.

[01:21:08] It's like a record player.

[01:21:09] The model race car, it spins around the track.

[01:21:11] Then you have the turbo, or I'm sorry, the turbo lock unit trademarked,

[01:21:16] captures the ball into spitting chamber for two to four ball multi ball.

[01:21:21] Then fires them simultaneously onto the play field.

[01:21:24] It's kind of a neat little mech.

[01:21:26] Now the problem with the turbo mech is the entryway is difficult to get in without it

[01:21:31] clunking around, right?

[01:21:32] Yeah, and that if you're good.

[01:21:34] Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:21:35] Gotta hate you.

[01:21:36] When I watch good players play this, I see they like never miss that shot.

[01:21:39] I do like...

[01:21:40] It also has a really neat left side diverter, which is like a little race car coming down

[01:21:44] the left side.

[01:21:45] Every time the ball goes by, it kind of changes its movement.

[01:21:49] It's almost like a diverter thing.

[01:21:51] Other thing I like about this game is it tells you if you're not using the third flipper.

[01:21:55] It's a third three flipper game and it's got the upper right flipper, which is pretty

[01:22:00] much to hit that turbo shot.

[01:22:04] If you let the ball just pass by there enough without using it, it'll give you a line.

[01:22:08] He hasn't taken one shot at that.

[01:22:10] I don't know if he knows.

[01:22:11] The flipper's there.

[01:22:12] Yeah.

[01:22:13] I want that little...

[01:22:15] I wonder if he knows.

[01:22:16] The flipper's even there.

[01:22:18] It's like the call out commentary on it.

[01:22:23] This game is so perfectly a racing car game.

[01:22:28] We've talked about NASCAR and Grand Prix at the Stern days with Pat Lawler, but it just

[01:22:34] doesn't have the same fun feeling as this machine does.

[01:22:39] This is when Dennis Norman was in his, I call it the flow phase.

[01:22:42] He did like white water and then he did a demo man and he did this one.

[01:22:50] He was all about the flow.

[01:22:51] This one has the payback time repeatable ramps left and right where you could just smash

[01:22:57] left to right to left to right and it is awesome because there are like these plastic ramps

[01:23:04] with this awesome sort of bend in the ramps and the way that it comes back to your flippers

[01:23:11] is so smooth and fun.

[01:23:15] You just get so much excitement from shooting ramps on this game and that's what Dennis

[01:23:19] Norman has known for is his killer ramps.

[01:23:22] That's what we're talking about.

[01:23:23] Max, it has those bizarre custom targets, doesn't it?

[01:23:27] Like on the top.

[01:23:29] I've never seen in any other game.

[01:23:31] They have these four LED lights on the standups and you shoot the standups and it gets rid

[01:23:36] of one of the lights and there's four lights on each ramp or each thing.

[01:23:41] This was the only game where they use those targets.

[01:23:44] I see the only thing that scares me about owning certain games when you hear, this is the

[01:23:49] only game they use these targets.

[01:23:51] Ooh, I've been said if they break.

[01:23:53] But when you look underneath the play field, it's not scary at all.

[01:23:56] No, because it's all above the play field.

[01:23:59] It's very modern Stern looking on the side.

[01:24:01] It's like Devil Man, there's not much under the play field, believe it or not.

[01:24:04] It's all above the play field.

[01:24:06] You can actually get some of these machines that have slightly different color and it's

[01:24:11] not from the fact that the color has been bleached by the sun, but they had actually

[01:24:18] started to produce some of the play fields and some of the side art and the German distributor

[01:24:25] came out and basically said that the color looked like baby colors.

[01:24:30] And that scared them so much that they actually decided to make some changes to the colors.

[01:24:37] Because it was their German distributor who bought more of their games.

[01:24:39] Yeah, he's the guy that we've popped up a few times throughout.

[01:24:43] I don't know who it is, but they always talk about a German distributor who came in and

[01:24:47] scared the crowd out.

[01:24:48] Their name had a company and we really should know that since we're doing history.

[01:24:54] Yeah, go ahead and email that into see the guy.

[01:24:56] If I think hard enough, I might be able to remember what they were called, but they,

[01:25:02] if they wanted something, they got it.

[01:25:06] If they want like we want lightning flippers on this, it's going to have lightning flippers

[01:25:09] on it.

[01:25:10] They didn't like the colors though.

[01:25:11] So they had to change the colors.

[01:25:14] Of course, this is Indian, Indian 500, Indianapolis 500.

[01:25:17] This is cart racing.

[01:25:19] That's got to be an easy license to work with, right?

[01:25:23] Well, Adam Ryan says, Indian 500 was challenging because a licensor didn't want to show pretty

[01:25:28] much anything fun.

[01:25:30] It was driving the cars going left to right, cars going right to left, cars coming at you,

[01:25:35] cars going away from you.

[01:25:37] As a dot sky, that's very limiting.

[01:25:39] We have one car accident on the display and then the announcer comes in and said, but he's

[01:25:43] okay.

[01:25:44] Kind of the excitement of motor sports is crashes, right?

[01:25:47] For the average person, yes.

[01:25:49] But around this time, right, this is after the death of Aaron Tensena, who is probably

[01:25:54] one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time in 1994.

[01:25:59] Motor sports was particularly sensitive about people dying because they've been changing

[01:26:04] rules and regulations.

[01:26:06] I would assume that they didn't want to show much of that.

[01:26:09] But as a dot guy, Adam Ryan, I think, killed it when it comes to the match sequence of

[01:26:13] this game because it shows all the different generations of indie cars with numbers on

[01:26:20] the side, which is your matching number in its class.

[01:26:24] But you know, it's not tip top class.

[01:26:27] What's that red and Ted?

[01:26:30] Oh, roadshow red and Ted's roadshow.

[01:26:34] You talk about mex.

[01:26:36] This game, this game has to weigh 400 pounds of stuff in this game.

[01:26:41] So you like fun house?

[01:26:43] You like a talking head?

[01:26:45] We're going to have two of them.

[01:26:47] Exactly.

[01:26:48] This is construction, country music theme.

[01:26:51] This is from June of 95.

[01:26:52] It's a Williams WPC Fliptronix II.

[01:26:55] It is a wide body, 6,249 units designed by Pat Lawler, Art, like all Pat Lawler games,

[01:27:04] John Yowsey, dots, Adam Ryan, Scott Shalomani, and Eugene Greer.

[01:27:08] Music and sound by Chris Granner, software, Dwight Sullivan, and Ted Estes.

[01:27:13] And then they sold another 10.

[01:27:14] So it was 6,259.

[01:27:16] Oh, you said 49.

[01:27:18] I did his favorite.

[01:27:20] I love it.

[01:27:21] Two talking heads.

[01:27:23] Pat Lawler says that he wanted to bring Rudy's family along.

[01:27:27] And they had to retire Rudy because he was too popular.

[01:27:31] But yet they still wanted talking heads.

[01:27:34] And at this time instead of yelling at you, they could yell at each other.

[01:27:38] When we talk about the talking heads, what are we talking about here?

[01:27:41] There are animatronic heads that literally move.

[01:27:47] Their eyes follow you around, and their mouths move up and down, and they talk.

[01:27:52] And they call it pin-mation.

[01:27:54] That's what Williams called it.

[01:27:55] I'm sorry, pin-mation trademark.

[01:27:58] It's, um, now you got a wide body, Pat Lawler has once again given a wide body, which

[01:28:03] he doesn't like, but he can jam two heads instead of one.

[01:28:07] And they do a pretty darn good job, actually.

[01:28:09] Yeah.

[01:28:10] And jam is right.

[01:28:11] Because from people I've talked through my 17 years in this hobby, a lot of people have

[01:28:17] told me, been the biggest pains in the butt to work on are the two heads on Roach

[01:28:22] Show.

[01:28:23] So one of the heads is Ted.

[01:28:25] One of the heads is Rhett.

[01:28:26] It's a male, female, calm.

[01:28:28] Ted's the dude.

[01:28:29] He's the woman.

[01:28:30] He's driving like a little bulldozer.

[01:28:33] So in front of his face, he's got two stand-up targets on like a rising mech.

[01:28:39] So you hit the, which is sort of like the blade of a bulldozer.

[01:28:42] It's supposed to look more like the blade of a bulldozer, but they had to change it.

[01:28:45] Yeah, because it's just balls are going to go crazy.

[01:28:48] So it's kind of cool, and it pops up, and then you can smack him in the face just like

[01:28:52] you could Rudy.

[01:28:54] And then red on the other side, she has the open mouth with the side shot from the flipper,

[01:29:00] just like Rudy.

[01:29:01] So we're kind of doing the same thing, but we're doing a little twist on it.

[01:29:05] And I mean, Rudy sold units.

[01:29:08] Right.

[01:29:09] They sold like what?

[01:29:10] 10,000 of those things?

[01:29:11] 10,000 plus, yes.

[01:29:13] It was a draw.

[01:29:14] So they're like, okay, well, if they can make one, well, surely this one can, you know,

[01:29:19] Pat Lawler in the magic, and after Twilight Zone, and after Adam's family, and you know,

[01:29:24] he can do it again.

[01:29:26] It's this struggle a bit, this been.

[01:29:28] Ted, that Tim Kitts row again.

[01:29:31] They're all around MVP of voice acting.

[01:29:35] Did so many voices, and then they had Carlene Carter, who did the voice and the music of

[01:29:40] the song, every little thing that you get when you, so she was the country singer.

[01:29:45] You get to hear country music when you get in a multi ball.

[01:29:51] Who doesn't want that?

[01:29:52] I'm not a country music fan.

[01:29:55] It doesn't, like I don't, I don't despise it.

[01:29:57] It's just not my genre of music.

[01:30:00] But I can see how that can wear on you.

[01:30:04] Pat Lawler said, say what you want about the music, but we weren't out there on a limb.

[01:30:08] There's a whole part of the country that likes country music.

[01:30:11] Yeah.

[01:30:12] Yeah.

[01:30:13] Is this a turd?

[01:30:15] Is this game a turd?

[01:30:16] No, no, no, no.

[01:30:19] Nope.

[01:30:20] It just doesn't get a lot of love.

[01:30:21] The thing about Roacho, Williams was kind of trying a philosophy of they wanted you to

[01:30:28] do buy-ins.

[01:30:30] They wanted you to keep buying and they would have, they actually have an extra button on

[01:30:34] there and you can buy in, you can continue your game.

[01:30:38] And this was one of the games.

[01:30:39] They really pushed that hard, even in the promotional materials.

[01:30:42] They specifically-

[01:30:43] So if you drain out after three balls, you can buy back.

[01:30:45] Yes.

[01:30:46] And they made it, it's extremely linear and you try to cross the country.

[01:30:49] And they specifically made it so the average person is not going to be able to get across

[01:30:53] the country.

[01:30:54] They're going to have to buy in to get all the way across the country.

[01:30:57] That was the philosophy.

[01:30:58] But as we're talking about, next it has the two heads.

[01:31:02] It also has the, has like a radio thing that actually doesn't do anything.

[01:31:07] But it also has a small little thing flips flipper, the same spot on the left side.

[01:31:13] And you hit across instead of the swamp, it's a bunch of stand-up targets.

[01:31:17] But very, there's a lot of elements that you got your Adams family.

[01:31:21] Obviously you've got your fun house.

[01:31:22] It's got a ton of habit trails in it.

[01:31:25] One of the bits that's kind of neat is that it has a physical ball lock on the left side.

[01:31:29] And it also has the extra plunger on the left just like fun house.

[01:31:34] Right.

[01:31:35] And then that actually goes all the way up and it hits head in the side of the head.

[01:31:38] Which is kind of fun.

[01:31:40] And he'll tell you, he got hit.

[01:31:42] The major issue is there's like when you're playing in the code, you can go east coast

[01:31:47] or west coast, right?

[01:31:48] No, there's different paths.

[01:31:51] Right.

[01:31:52] But if you get the wrong path in the beginning, you're screwed.

[01:31:54] You get the path that where you go to Miami, you're good.

[01:31:56] If you get the other path to screwed as far as score.

[01:32:00] Something like that.

[01:32:02] I mean, yes, it's linear.

[01:32:04] But again, I like goofy games and this is very goofy.

[01:32:07] Why don't you own a roach?

[01:32:08] I don't like it that much.

[01:32:11] But when we had this league, everyone hated it.

[01:32:13] And I was just like, what's it's all right?

[01:32:16] But you and I both like, both like dialed in, right?

[01:32:19] So I love, I love Ted.

[01:32:21] I'm all tired.

[01:32:22] I'm all worn out.

[01:32:24] I'm shutting down.

[01:32:25] Then he goes to sleep and then you hit it in his mouth and then multi ball starts.

[01:32:29] It's got lots of road signs.

[01:32:31] Yep.

[01:32:32] And it's one of the, one of the Williams games where they use custom colored legs.

[01:32:37] These, oh yes, they're blue legs instead of this silver.

[01:32:41] Yeah, that bothers me.

[01:32:41] I don't like powder coating.

[01:32:43] That's not my thing.

[01:32:44] Wow.

[01:32:45] A lot of people will be upset with that comment.

[01:32:47] Yeah, I just don't, I just like, not even ACDC.

[01:32:51] It's all red and it looks cool.

[01:32:53] No, I think like that's okay.

[01:32:55] If it comes factory, but I just, I just like the pro black, matte black, I like just

[01:33:01] the regular sort of silver.

[01:33:02] Okay.

[01:33:03] I don't know what it is.

[01:33:04] And of course, the flyer.

[01:33:06] It's a big country.

[01:33:08] Someone's got it.

[01:33:09] Terror it up.

[01:33:10] Why did you say it like that?

[01:33:11] That's offensive.

[01:33:12] Because it's Roacho.

[01:33:14] That's how to talk in the game.

[01:33:15] Seeing the game, you're part of a demolition crew.

[01:33:18] Red and Ted.

[01:33:19] Or destroying things across the country.

[01:33:21] If you want to talk about offensive accents, they are definitely in the game.

[01:33:24] Just get the taxi driver mode and you'll, you'll be offended.

[01:33:28] It's literally California or bust.

[01:33:30] Well, it's lit or a California bust when this row crew from hell takes on the highways

[01:33:35] and a runaway bulldozer.

[01:33:37] And with two pin-mation characters, dual plungers and car lane carters, the voice of red,

[01:33:42] who wouldn't want to go along for the ride?

[01:33:44] Isn't car lane carter just the most country name you've ever heard?

[01:33:48] I'm a little thing I think about you, haven't I mean, it doesn't get more mechy than

[01:33:55] two animatronic heads.

[01:33:58] And these heads are the ones that have the parts that break inside for the eyes that are

[01:34:02] like impossible to get.

[01:34:03] And you can hit them.

[01:34:05] Again, that's another cool thing about these toy.

[01:34:07] It's one thing to have a cool toy, but when you have a cool toy that you can hit and

[01:34:10] it reacts to you hitting it, like, ah!

[01:34:13] You know what I love here?

[01:34:14] Is you can tell that this is a Pat Lawler game?

[01:34:16] Because it's very hoarse.

[01:34:18] It is 100%.

[01:34:18] Right. And the way that it's written is car lane carter is the voice of red, a brassy

[01:34:24] country girl with a heart of gold and a free wheel in way with the bulldozer.

[01:34:28] Like, what is going on here?

[01:34:30] Tatters are two-step-and-partner, a good guy with a bad roadside manner.

[01:34:35] There you go.

[01:34:36] Pin-mation is back.

[01:34:37] Thank God this is the new Williams DCS sound system.

[01:34:41] Oh, you get to hear the awesome country music in the best possible sound.

[01:34:44] I think that that music would just drive me insane.

[01:34:47] I haven't played enough of this, but it's not that bad.

[01:34:51] Doesn't multi-ball happen like every game?

[01:34:54] Well, if you're decent, probably.

[01:34:56] Wow. Thank you for this.

[01:34:58] You're suggesting that I'm not.

[01:34:59] I didn't say that.

[01:35:00] I said, if you're decent, actually, go back.

[01:35:03] I want to see what the weight is of the machine.

[01:35:04] It actually has the weight there.

[01:35:06] What?

[01:35:07] 300 pounds.

[01:35:08] Yeah.

[01:35:09] 300 pounds.

[01:35:10] Thank you, wide bodies.

[01:35:11] When things get to a significant downturn, this is a peak in a series of valleys when

[01:35:23] it comes to sales numbers.

[01:35:25] This is when they start to get into some experimentation.

[01:35:29] That brings us into a game called Safecracker.

[01:35:32] This is a Cops and Robbers theme.

[01:35:34] It is from March of 1996.

[01:35:36] This is the WPC-95.

[01:35:39] It's kind of like a novelty game.

[01:35:41] It's a little less pinball, I think.

[01:35:43] Yeah.

[01:35:44] It says 1148 years.

[01:35:46] There's so many custom things on this.

[01:35:48] I think even the flippers are custom.

[01:35:50] I don't think they're standard two-inch flippers, if I recall.

[01:35:53] They're like specific to Safecracker.

[01:35:57] It's got a smaller cabinet.

[01:35:58] The play field is massively heavy.

[01:36:01] This was designed by Pat Lawler, John Yosey on our Adam Rhinon Dodds, Dan Ford, and

[01:36:06] my music and sound and Dean Grover on software.

[01:36:10] Pinball was in a clear decline.

[01:36:13] Pat Lawler would say that people were screaming that they wanted machines that made more money.

[01:36:21] European distros of course wanted something that was more gambling-like to help drive

[01:36:27] more revenue.

[01:36:29] For example, you could get a score.

[01:36:32] You could get something and you could get a beer for it or you could trade in your tokens.

[01:36:36] We're getting kind of close to gambling here.

[01:36:39] This machine was specifically designed for that.

[01:36:42] By and large, the game mystified people and they just didn't get it.

[01:36:48] Safecracker has of course the play field with noticeably narrower, shorter, and it's

[01:36:54] not quite a standard pinball machine.

[01:36:56] The back box door is actually swim, swing open.

[01:37:00] Like a bank safe vault.

[01:37:02] It reveals the back glass that's behind that.

[01:37:05] The back glass image has lights and colors that combined into more of an interactive board

[01:37:11] game than a traditional sort of DMD back glass.

[01:37:14] And you're supposed to act like a bank robber.

[01:37:17] Apparently, the back box also has a token launcher which is used to dispense 20 different

[01:37:23] tokens for certain keynotes.

[01:37:26] And it's cool when it gives you a token, the way it shoots out, it literally rolls along

[01:37:31] the glass to you.

[01:37:33] It's pretty damn cool.

[01:37:34] Wow.

[01:37:35] I've never seen one of these in person.

[01:37:38] The play fields are exceedingly heavy to the point where they start to bow.

[01:37:44] So one of the mods or one of the things they would sell for it is like a Safecracker play

[01:37:49] field reinforcement rails that you would put in because it literally was that heavy.

[01:37:53] That's so much stuff on it.

[01:37:55] But also a lot of operators were complaining that a lot of these big games, these wide

[01:38:01] bodies and other games were taking up so much space that they would have like a section

[01:38:05] in their bar that was really small and they could just sort of cram something in there.

[01:38:10] So they needed something smaller to put in there.

[01:38:12] It's a smaller.

[01:38:13] This is kind of another sort of take on the street level games that they had experimented

[01:38:18] with at Gottlieb, as well as the other style of game that Williams Valley had tried

[01:38:25] with Harley.

[01:38:27] Well, Paola says that Safecracker was going to be monopoly originally, which is funny because

[01:38:31] he would eventually do a monopoly.

[01:38:33] He said the big German distro, the one we can't remember the name of that has all the power,

[01:38:37] came in and said that it was stupid and an old person game and he wouldn't buy it.

[01:38:41] We did all the trouble to get the license and he killed it.

[01:38:43] Yeah, he thought monopoly was a stupid theme, but Safecracker and original theme was a

[01:38:49] great idea.

[01:38:51] And judging by the sales numbers of less than 2000 units, this did not go well.

[01:38:57] That did not.

[01:38:58] Now, why did, why do you think the sales flopped for this machine?

[01:39:01] It's too different.

[01:39:02] Way too different.

[01:39:03] It's radically different.

[01:39:04] Another thing Paola would say was that at the same time attack from Mars happened and

[01:39:09] the sales of attack from Mars ate the sales of Safecracker.

[01:39:14] I actually don't think that's true.

[01:39:15] I think that this game is kind of crappy and that's why it didn't sell.

[01:39:20] I mean, Brian Eddie did an amazing job.

[01:39:23] I mean, come on, attack from Mars is like all time.

[01:39:26] Paola would say that Williams was its own competition.

[01:39:29] Yeah, so I'm looking at the play field here and the flippers are, they're like longer than

[01:39:33] two inches, but they're not three inches.

[01:39:35] So they're custom for just Safecracker.

[01:39:39] And then it has the thing flips thing on the side again.

[01:39:42] Yeah, it's Paola games got to have a weird side shot.

[01:39:44] But it's a new vision, a new standard, a new game.

[01:39:48] It gives you token.

[01:39:50] Not only did it give you tokens, it was a token gesture has a cool mold call assault

[01:39:54] on the vault.

[01:39:55] I mean, it's a well made game.

[01:39:57] I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, and it's a Williams game.

[01:40:00] So it's high, very professional high quality well made game.

[01:40:04] I mean, like, you know, software and call outs and all that stuff, but it just, it was

[01:40:08] too different for most people and it just didn't sell.

[01:40:11] But the, I do like the, the token, because there's a little slit in the, right in the center

[01:40:16] when the token comes out, it will roll all.

[01:40:18] Along the glass and roll right to you.

[01:40:21] It's pretty damn cool.

[01:40:22] That's such a smart marketing gimmick.

[01:40:24] I guess that would be your toy.

[01:40:26] It also has a scoop.

[01:40:27] Of course, it's Paola, it needs to have a scoop.

[01:40:29] Now, this brings us into something that's got a pretty serious Mac.

[01:40:33] This is Circus Voltaire.

[01:40:35] It is a circus carnival theme from October of 1907.

[01:40:39] It is a Williams WPC 95.

[01:40:43] Two thousand seven hundred and four units.

[01:40:46] This is designed by John Papadouc, commonly known as J-Pop and Cameron Silver, art by

[01:40:52] Linda Deel, dots by Adam Ryan and Brian Morris, software and sound by Rob Barry and Dave

[01:40:59] Zabrisky and software by Cameron Silver.

[01:41:04] This is the legendary John Papadouc game.

[01:41:09] Oh, yeah, this is the one you love, right?

[01:41:12] I love this game.

[01:41:14] I don't love it for the gameplay.

[01:41:17] I don't necessarily love it for the pinball.

[01:41:21] I love it for everything but the pinball, which I think is a very common thing for this

[01:41:25] game.

[01:41:26] You want to talk Max?

[01:41:27] We got a Mac for you.

[01:41:29] This game is all about mechanical stuff.

[01:41:32] We have the Ringmaster, which the Ringmaster toy, if you've never seen the Ringmaster

[01:41:36] toy, you don't even know, well, actually, I think in a track mode, it's up to show you

[01:41:41] it's there.

[01:41:42] I think it'd be cool if it didn't show you it was there.

[01:41:44] And the first time you saw it was when you played.

[01:41:46] But you hit in the area, the Ringmaster will start the game below the play field.

[01:41:52] You hit an area where there's three targets.

[01:41:54] You hit it enough times.

[01:41:55] You spell wow.

[01:41:56] And then there's a magnet that will stop the ball and the Ringmaster will actually lift

[01:42:00] up.

[01:42:01] And the magnet will be stuck on his hat.

[01:42:03] The ball?

[01:42:04] The ball.

[01:42:05] Sorry.

[01:42:06] I guess it's not really his hat, is it?

[01:42:07] I don't know, looking at him.

[01:42:08] It's like the top of the stage.

[01:42:09] The Ringmaster was, he looked a little different.

[01:42:14] He was skinnier, but the kept having balls get stuck.

[01:42:17] So they made him a little, his cheeks a little fatter.

[01:42:21] And I think if you go to IPDB and you were just there, it shows the original Ringmaster.

[01:42:26] Like that's, we're looking at it now.

[01:42:27] That's the production.

[01:42:28] If you scroll down, there it is, sample version.

[01:42:32] See, he's got like a skinnier chin.

[01:42:35] He looks, he looks, he looks, he looks, he looks, he looks, he looks, he looks, he looks,

[01:42:38] more like, more evil Ringmaster, but the balls kept getting stuck.

[01:42:42] He's green, he's got blue hair, he's got like ruffles, he's purple.

[01:42:47] This game is an artistic masterpiece and it has some amazingly stunning mechanical pieces

[01:42:53] to it.

[01:42:54] And he releases the ball, they're like pulsing magnet, it'll, the ball fly off them and

[01:42:59] then you hit them.

[01:43:00] And if you hit them enough times, he rises up even more and he's got like a coily spring

[01:43:05] neck and you hit it in there and you defeat him.

[01:43:08] And it goes into a subway underneath.

[01:43:10] Yeah, that's just one Mac.

[01:43:13] Probably the deepest Mac as far as underneath the play field that I can think of.

[01:43:19] Yeah, very similar.

[01:43:20] A lot of people said that this is very similar to the Avengers Infinity Quest spinning disc

[01:43:26] Mac that rises up and you shoot under the subway in the premium LA version.

[01:43:31] But this is something else.

[01:43:32] It's a bash toy.

[01:43:33] It's a magnet and it's a subway entrance.

[01:43:37] It is.

[01:43:38] Then they have the boom balloon, which is basically a pop bumper that rises up from the

[01:43:42] play field, which is not, that is not a new concept that was in, I think some EM in

[01:43:47] the 60s had that.

[01:43:49] There it is.

[01:43:51] I was wrong.

[01:43:52] 50s, a disappearing pop bumper.

[01:43:55] It was also in a Williams game called Gusher.

[01:43:58] So this boom pop bumper.

[01:44:00] So there's like these weird, there's these, these little roll over switches on the play

[01:44:07] field in various places.

[01:44:09] And when you roll over all of those, there's one in the in each in lane, then there's a couple

[01:44:13] kind of a pop into glasses.

[01:44:15] Then it raises, then it raises up in this very precarious place.

[01:44:20] So there's two pop bumpers on the right side.

[01:44:23] And the third one is like hidden under the play field.

[01:44:25] And then it's like a balloon that rises up.

[01:44:27] And then it causes some serious issues.

[01:44:29] Boom balloon.

[01:44:30] Then on the left, he just has like a kind of a plastic ball that just floats there and

[01:44:35] you can hit it.

[01:44:36] Like a ball pit ball.

[01:44:37] Like a kids ball.

[01:44:39] Then even the locks are complicated.

[01:44:41] When you hit the left or a bit and you get a lot, I love it.

[01:44:46] It will put it in a saucer and then throws it to another saucer, the jugglers.

[01:44:50] So then it locks two balls up there, but wait, it has this ramp in the center.

[01:44:55] You shoot it up this ramp and there's a magnet on the top.

[01:44:58] There's like this little play field up there.

[01:45:01] And usually it'll just kind of go around and down what's called the neon tube.

[01:45:05] And it is neon, an actual neon light.

[01:45:08] But a magnet will catch it and then it will roll it down into a physical ball lock, which

[01:45:15] is like the trapeze thing.

[01:45:19] And it is so awesome.

[01:45:21] And that's just the play field.

[01:45:23] Now, the ringmaster will actually steal the ball with the magnet on his head off of that

[01:45:27] ramp off of that habit trail as well.

[01:45:30] I sort of started that I love this game for everything, but the pinball.

[01:45:35] There's a couple of reasons for that.

[01:45:36] One of them is the in lanes and out lanes.

[01:45:39] They don't have sort of traditional in lanes and out lanes.

[01:45:41] They've got those pins and you got to kind of like nudge it to get it down in there.

[01:45:46] The other thing is that the return ramps are very, very far down the play field to the

[01:45:53] flippers that you got to be like on the ball when it comes down there.

[01:45:56] There's a very dangerous game on the lower play field.

[01:45:59] And that's mostly my own skill level as opposed to the actual game itself.

[01:46:03] And we have Max in the back box.

[01:46:06] Oh, another one.

[01:46:08] Another one.

[01:46:09] It's like a bell toy.

[01:46:10] So in the back box, you have the cannon, which is just, it's got a picture of a cannon

[01:46:14] and a ball and it fires it and it goes up and it hits a bell, which isn't really a

[01:46:19] bell.

[01:46:20] I don't even know what actually is, but it makes a bell sound effect the game.

[01:46:24] Wait a second.

[01:46:25] There's something missing from the back box.

[01:46:26] Yeah.

[01:46:27] The DMD, the dot matrix display is not in the back box.

[01:46:31] He moved it down.

[01:46:32] What is that doing under the glass?

[01:46:33] He moved it down under the glass.

[01:46:34] It's under the glass in the back of the play field.

[01:46:37] Could you imagine going up to Gary's turn and be like, Hey, I want to move that LCD screen

[01:46:41] off the back box?

[01:46:42] Yeah, you're kind of changing a very basic thing that now you're going to have to design

[01:46:47] differently.

[01:46:48] Yes.

[01:46:49] This game, when somebody has like a pretty great collection, this is always like the crown

[01:46:57] jewel piece, isn't that right?

[01:47:00] Like if you've got a really nice Valley Williams collection, like you're the one piece

[01:47:06] that you always put out so everybody can see each side of it.

[01:47:10] You don't put it in the row.

[01:47:11] You always put it in its own space.

[01:47:13] You want to make sure everybody sees it.

[01:47:15] Mm-hmm.

[01:47:16] And then everybody plays it and goes, I like the inner magic better.

[01:47:19] Yeah.

[01:47:20] I would prefer Circus, Voltaire.

[01:47:23] J-Pop says, on the Ringmaster, we chose to use micr-switches instead of optos.

[01:47:27] I think that was a fatal error.

[01:47:29] It was costing.

[01:47:31] We will keep the micr-switches instead of adding seven more dollars for the optos set.

[01:47:35] That hurt operators.

[01:47:36] It was the game sort of struggled a little bit.

[01:47:40] And it really has issues with stuck balls.

[01:47:44] It really has issues with sort of the ball going kind of in all directions where you don't

[01:47:49] necessarily want it.

[01:47:50] Like it'll go up a ramp and fall off the ramp, for example.

[01:47:54] I know you get a lot of flipper hop if you're not really careful as well on the in lanes

[01:47:58] and out lanes.

[01:47:59] The game is not a very polished, finished work.

[01:48:04] So Papa Duke says, at some point you have to stop working.

[01:48:08] I think Circus had the most ball hang-up set of any prototype with ramps.

[01:48:12] Everything wasn't linear and the ball would get stuck everywhere.

[01:48:15] So even the designer himself acknowledges the fact that this was not polished.

[01:48:21] And I said it, I think the game is a lot of sizzle and not a whole lot of steak.

[01:48:25] Because the code also struggles a little bit, right?

[01:48:28] I would say that.

[01:48:29] I think it had one of the better wizard modes.

[01:48:31] Multi-stage wizard modes that would be used, and again, like say superhero and spider

[01:48:38] man would use it.

[01:48:40] This stage, do this.

[01:48:41] This stage, do this, this stage, do this.

[01:48:44] I might have been one of the first ones that did that.

[01:48:46] I'm trying to think of anyone before that that did a multi-stage wizard mode.

[01:48:52] Someone shouting at the radio right now.

[01:48:55] I want to talk about why I love this game a lot.

[01:48:59] And I think it comes down to the artistic direction and design of the game.

[01:49:04] No, it's the max.

[01:49:05] As opposed to the game itself.

[01:49:07] It's the max.

[01:49:08] You got to keep with the show.

[01:49:11] I mean, the mechs are amazing.

[01:49:13] The problem is that it doesn't necessarily, it has the mechs, it has the art, but I feel

[01:49:20] like it's lacking in the refinement of the design.

[01:49:25] Like it's just missing something.

[01:49:28] It has some flow, but it's got some clunk.

[01:49:32] It's just when I play it, I feel like, oh god, I just wish this was better.

[01:49:38] And I don't know why, because it's got all the things that I want it to have.

[01:49:41] Well, Adam says John Papaduke, especially in Circus Voltaire, wanted to let his creative

[01:49:46] flow.

[01:49:47] He wanted to push the boundaries in the edge of what is known as pinball.

[01:49:51] To that point, it was all no fear and NBA fast break.

[01:49:54] It was very hard driving, sort of one-dimensional.

[01:49:57] He wanted to have more of an artistic flair to the whole package.

[01:50:02] So he really tried to have fun and push the dots into places they've never been before.

[01:50:06] Yeah, like I can see that in the pin, right?

[01:50:10] I can see that there's something unique and different and artistic.

[01:50:16] That's what John Papaduke is really great with, but it seems to be missing sort of the

[01:50:22] very basic essence of pinball for some reason.

[01:50:26] It's so intangible and hard to describe.

[01:50:29] It's very weird.

[01:50:30] I think most people would agree with me that for some reason, it's just missing something.

[01:50:34] I don't know what it's missing.

[01:50:36] If you know what Circus Voltaire is missing, send us an email, silverballcronicles.com.

[01:50:42] The other thing with J-pop, and he gets this criticism as of late, and well, a work on

[01:50:46] a J-pop episode for the future, is that this game really shines because of the mechanical

[01:50:55] engineering of those that worked on the game.

[01:50:59] It really shines on the artistic package.

[01:51:03] It's like John is an ideas guy, and somebody else has to execute.

[01:51:10] Valley Williams was so magical and amazing.

[01:51:13] Boy, did they ever execute on this game?

[01:51:16] The part that J-pop was most in charge of is the intangible piece that seems to be missing.

[01:51:25] The pinball shooting in shots.

[01:51:27] I don't know.

[01:51:29] Do you know what I mean?

[01:51:31] Sure.

[01:51:32] All right.

[01:51:33] Let's talk about Gofers.

[01:51:34] No good Gofers.

[01:51:36] This is a sports or golf theme from December of 1997, as a Williams WPC 95 sells 2,711 units.

[01:51:46] This is a pat-law or game.

[01:51:48] It's, of course, art.

[01:51:49] Worked on Yoshi, Adam Rine on Dots, and of course, music and sound by Vince Paterrily.

[01:51:55] He did Judge Dread, Dirty Harry, and Monster Bash Software by Louis Cosseri's.

[01:52:03] I'm also very sorry for sealing Bruce Knight and Gale's Italian.

[01:52:07] This is an interesting game because Pat Lawler came up with the idea of doing a backyard

[01:52:12] mayhem theme where Gofers were destroying your lawn.

[01:52:16] The idea was that there's a mechanical wheel in the middle of the playfield, which is

[01:52:21] like a weed whacker.

[01:52:23] You're chasing these animals.

[01:52:24] They're ruining your garden party kind of thing.

[01:52:26] Pat Lawler says that sales told him that the Japanese don't have yards and they wouldn't

[01:52:32] understand a backyard mayhem theme.

[01:52:35] What they told Pat was that they wouldn't be able to sell one container to Japan.

[01:52:42] They lobbied and lobbied and eventually pat relented, and he changed the theme to Gof,

[01:52:49] which is very big in Japan.

[01:52:51] The other thing about making it a golf theme is Gottlieb already did teed off, which

[01:52:57] was a golf theme with Gofers.

[01:52:59] For once, Gottlieb was ahead of Williams.

[01:53:02] Yeah, it's pretty cool that way.

[01:53:06] The other thing is that everybody loves Catty Shack, but this is not.

[01:53:11] It was not meant to be a Catty Shack rip off, nor was it meant to be a Gottlieb rip off.

[01:53:17] It was just, hey, marketing nagged him enough that he just couldn't deal with it.

[01:53:21] This is a very underrated Pat Lawler game.

[01:53:23] It's had a long burn.

[01:53:24] It was not popular at the time, but I think today it's much cooler than it was then.

[01:53:29] Would you agree?

[01:53:30] Eh, eh.

[01:53:32] I'm sure they sell it.

[01:53:33] They sell for a lot.

[01:53:34] Again, it has more cool next.

[01:53:36] We have Gofers that pop up that you can hit and they react, buzz and bud, and we have

[01:53:42] the slam ramp.

[01:53:43] Ooh, that sounds fancy.

[01:53:45] I love that name, and it's very appropriate because it would slam into the playfield and

[01:53:48] damage it pretty much on every single no-good Gofers.

[01:53:52] Yeah, it's basically a ramp that hovers above the playfield, and then it goes down and

[01:53:57] touches the playfield, and then you shoot the ball into the ramp and it literally launches

[01:54:01] the ball across the playfield to an upper playfield area, as opposed to having a ramp that

[01:54:06] smoothly goes up.

[01:54:07] It literally launches the ball.

[01:54:08] And you're trying to get in the hole for a hole in one.

[01:54:11] You're golfing.

[01:54:12] And I mean, it made people uncomfortable.

[01:54:14] Pat Lawler loved it because that's what the ramp did.

[01:54:18] Now of course, Pat was a people playing pinball at the time, took a look at it and said,

[01:54:23] golf.

[01:54:24] Golf sucks.

[01:54:25] I'm not playing that.

[01:54:26] But as time went on, it came around.

[01:54:29] So this came, we were talking about Louis, the programmer.

[01:54:34] Now what Pat loved the most about Louis was his off-center sense of humor, and that he

[01:54:41] can really let loose with his humor.

[01:54:44] And that fit right in with Pat Lawler and his type of games where he likes to make them

[01:54:50] of lighthearted and fun.

[01:54:52] But around this time, the downturn in pinball went even deeper.

[01:54:56] And things started to go down slowly, but now they started to really pick up speed.

[01:55:03] This is where everybody started moving over into Williams' new slot machine division.

[01:55:09] So Pat Lawler would say that they saved gaming but killed pinball with these slots.

[01:55:14] At that point, they had become a real gaming company.

[01:55:18] Williams had stock analysts come in, and they looked at the company, and they wanted to

[01:55:23] value the stock as a gaming company.

[01:55:26] But they had this pinball on the side.

[01:55:29] So in that quote, Pat Lawler is basically saying that they had the sort of the corporate

[01:55:34] people come in and look at it profits, and they couldn't figure out what pinball was.

[01:55:38] It wasn't gambling like the gaming division.

[01:55:40] It wasn't video games like the video game division.

[01:55:43] It was like this weird relic of pinball, and they very much looked down on it, and they

[01:55:47] couldn't value it in the stock.

[01:55:48] The real part about no-go-fers that I can never understand is it has a real back glass

[01:55:53] for no apparent reason.

[01:55:55] Instead of a translate, I would think that I would have had to cost it more.

[01:55:59] Like why would they use that?

[01:56:01] It's always weird.

[01:56:02] That that champion pub had real back glasses.

[01:56:05] I don't know why.

[01:56:06] One of my favorite parts about this pinball machine are the gofers.

[01:56:11] The gofers, of course, being buzz and butt, and they hide underneath the ramps on the

[01:56:19] right and left side.

[01:56:20] So the ramps will pop up like those Gottlieb Stargate ramps, and then these gofers come

[01:56:27] up underneath.

[01:56:29] Now nowadays, the ramp would pop up and there'd be like a stand-up target, or there would

[01:56:33] be a drop target if it was fancy.

[01:56:36] Well, I mean, then there's actually like a 3D plastic molded bash toy that these two

[01:56:41] gofers pop up.

[01:56:42] There's not just one, there's two.

[01:56:45] Like this machine did not suffer from modern day costing issues.

[01:56:49] Walking dead as bicycle girl.

[01:56:51] But then again, she does the same thing.

[01:56:53] These move.

[01:56:54] These you can actually...

[01:56:55] Yeah, they bounce up and down and giggle and talk to each other and taunt you.

[01:56:58] Super cool.

[01:56:59] Yeah, then you hit them, and then you hit the hole where they are and it locks the ball.

[01:57:02] Yeah, now there's a ball lock behind them, brilliant.

[01:57:05] It's a great little game.

[01:57:06] I love this.

[01:57:07] And it has like a spinning disc, which is like the shape of...

[01:57:10] It's meant to be a golf ball, but on it, it's sort of like a roulette wheel with a bunch

[01:57:15] of mystery awards and it's grippy.

[01:57:18] So it's very much like whirlwind where it'll play chaos with your ball.

[01:57:22] It's got the pat-lawler, standard five layout in-lane, out-lane bottom, which is kind of

[01:57:29] off-center a little bit.

[01:57:31] So, it's like a wonderfully smooth ramps.

[01:57:34] Two spinners.

[01:57:35] Come on, game with two spinners.

[01:57:37] Captive ball.

[01:57:38] It's got the whole thing here, but the mechs on there not particularly complicated, like

[01:57:44] a doctor who or a twilight zone, but numerous and effective.

[01:57:49] So much fun.

[01:57:50] Do you play this?

[01:57:51] Do you play this a lot in tournaments?

[01:57:52] Not a lot.

[01:57:53] I have played a lot of no good gophers.

[01:57:56] Would you own a no good gophers?

[01:57:58] No.

[01:57:59] Why not?

[01:58:00] I don't like it that much.

[01:58:01] We look on the flyer here.

[01:58:03] They have one of those TNT plushers.

[01:58:06] You mean a detonator?

[01:58:07] And it says the pin, everyone will go fur.

[01:58:11] Get it?

[01:58:12] No, I don't.

[01:58:13] Oh, I see.

[01:58:14] And the L is smashed out of gophers.

[01:58:17] No good gophers, no good gophers.

[01:58:19] Ah.

[01:58:20] Very good.

[01:58:22] Very well done.

[01:58:25] You know that from hackers to season pros, this game scores big.

[01:58:30] The innovative slam ramp trademark.

[01:58:32] God, they trademark every spinning world wheel trademark.

[01:58:36] So from whirlwind, I guess that makes sense.

[01:58:39] Why didn't they trademark buzz and buzz their names?

[01:58:41] I don't know.

[01:58:43] Isn't it also neat that buzz and buzz basically look like chip and Dale?

[01:58:47] There's the one with the red nose that's kind of weird and the one that's not kind of

[01:58:51] weird looking.

[01:58:52] It's a fun game.

[01:58:53] I don't want to these, but they're so pricey now.

[01:58:56] I don't understand why.

[01:58:58] Like all everything is just picked up steam.

[01:59:00] So this is when we get into the shutdown.

[01:59:02] For some reason every time we go through some sort of chronological order of the 90s,

[01:59:08] we end up talking about the Williams shutdown.

[01:59:11] I like to depress everybody before we finish the podcast.

[01:59:16] So why did Williams close down the pinball division?

[01:59:19] Because Slats makes way more money.

[01:59:22] Well, here was the thing.

[01:59:23] When the analysts came in, they did all their nerding, they crunched all their numbers,

[01:59:27] they came up with a couple of options.

[01:59:29] That lower would say that they could sell the pinball division outright to somebody

[01:59:32] who would buy it or they could write down $12 million.

[01:59:38] And a lot of people will say that's also called writing off money.

[01:59:41] So the idea is if I can find somebody that will buy the division, which is what everybody

[01:59:47] I think would have preferred, right?

[01:59:49] All the pinheads in the world would have been like, oh, if only somebody else had purchased

[01:59:54] Williams, it would have been just the clouds would have parted.

[01:59:58] And at least we would have kept pinball.

[02:00:00] But the analysts are looking at it saying if they could write off or write down $12 million,

[02:00:05] that means that they could count it as a loss and they could use that loss somewhere in

[02:00:10] their corporation to offset again, lowering taxation and a bunch of other things.

[02:00:17] That's my nerdy financial advisor hat being played there.

[02:00:21] Well, that would mean that they would have had to sell Williams pinball to somebody for

[02:00:28] $12 million.

[02:00:30] And there is no way somebody would pay $12 million for a pinball company in 1999.

[02:00:38] Pat Lawler in 2010 said today, no one would pay $12 million for a pinball company.

[02:00:44] No one would pay $2 million for a pinball company.

[02:00:47] So I mean, the post 2008 era when Pat Lawler did this interview with Topcast, there's

[02:00:52] no way anybody would pay $2 million at that time for a pinball company.

[02:00:56] Let alone $12 million.

[02:00:57] So Pat Lawler is kind of right.

[02:00:59] I mean, if they could take that $12 million and write it down and write it off, that is

[02:01:04] the corporate decision.

[02:01:05] It's not the right decision.

[02:01:07] It's not the decision that any of us wanted.

[02:01:10] Pretty sad actually.

[02:01:11] Well, you remember Rob from earlier who said some great things about our podcast, but he

[02:01:16] said he was also at the 99 expo when he took the factory tour.

[02:01:20] He says I was working for Cleveland Coin to distribute it at the time.

[02:01:23] And when I heard that Williams closed that Monday, it felt like I just lost my best

[02:01:27] friend.

[02:01:28] I still stayed in the hobby but kept my distance from the shows because without Williams,

[02:01:32] there was nothing left in my mind but the old stuff.

[02:01:35] I still wish Williams was a pinball company.

[02:01:37] And could you imagine the great pins they would have come out with?

[02:01:40] Gee whiz, hey.

[02:01:41] I thought that was such a really great piece from the email that Rob said into silverbalkroniclesgmail.com.

[02:01:47] I had to include that at the end of our show.

[02:01:50] So what do you think, Ron?

[02:01:51] What do you think of the mechs that made us Williams' ballet in the 90s?

[02:01:57] They're awesome, especially when they're interactive and you can hit them.

[02:02:00] Hitting them is always good.

[02:02:01] And you want it to change the same mech that can do different things is 10 times better

[02:02:06] than a mech that you just bump into or a magnet that you catch a ball on.

[02:02:12] They help accentuate, accentuate, yeah, accentuate the pinball experience.

[02:02:17] Yeah.

[02:02:18] So what was your favorite mech, Ron, of all the ones that we reviewed today?

[02:02:22] All the ones we reviewed?

[02:02:24] Time Expander.

[02:02:25] It just does the most things.

[02:02:27] Yeah.

[02:02:28] Time Expander is definitely my favorite of the ones that we did.

[02:02:30] Although in this episode you also have to talk about the ringmaster and how awesome and versatile.

[02:02:36] He is versatile.

[02:02:37] He's more versatile than just hitting him.

[02:02:40] He does one at least three different things.

[02:02:42] Catches the ball.

[02:02:44] And he's a character himself.

[02:02:45] He raises up.

[02:02:46] Then he raises up again.

[02:02:48] Then you hit into him.

[02:02:50] He catches balls off of a ramp.

[02:02:52] Drops them on.

[02:02:53] I am the ringmaster.

[02:02:56] Nowadays the ringmaster would be a piece of PTEG plastic and a magnet from...

[02:03:01] On the pro.

[02:03:02] On the premium it would be a molded piece.

[02:03:12] Stewie, you got this one?

[02:03:43] I'm partial to the one that says Ron first.

[02:04:23] You know what's missing from those bod movies?

[02:04:36] Shotconry.

[02:04:37] Thank you.

[02:04:38] Connery had the swagger, right?

[02:04:40] Like he had the sort of the brutish fighting and the swagger too.

[02:04:44] But it's, I don't know man, I would put Daniel Craig, you know, I might put him above

[02:04:49] him.

[02:04:50] I really would.

[02:04:51] I know that might be slightly controversial, but created by Ron Sturling.

[02:04:58] Ron Sturling, you got to have that in the blooper reel.

[02:05:02] It's Rod Serling.

[02:05:04] Rod Serling.

[02:05:05] Rod Serling.

[02:05:06] From upstate New York, I may add.

[02:05:08] You wrote it wrong.

[02:05:10] Ron, submitted for your approval, a man who can't spell the program also spelled correctly.

[02:05:19] Dispix.

[02:05:20] Dispix?

[02:05:21] Like that.

[02:05:23] There's a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man.

[02:05:27] It is the Dennis zone.

[02:05:29] A zone we're spelling.

[02:05:31] It doesn't work.

[02:05:33] So here's the thing in the original backlash.

[02:05:36] Ron Sturling was smoking.

[02:05:38] Rod Sturling.

[02:05:39] I think you just, just call this episode Ron Sturling.

[02:05:47] Before it was pencil paper, paper, before it was pencil paper.
