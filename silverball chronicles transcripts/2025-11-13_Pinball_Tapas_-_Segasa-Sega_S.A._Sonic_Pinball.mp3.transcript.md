[00:00] Yeah, so I was up really late, so I will likely be very tired and low energy during today's

[00:09] podcast.

[00:10] Those damn dodgers, when in that friggin game seven, they're just piles of garbage, hot flaming

[00:19] garbage that smells like soy sauce, and Don Mangley does not get his world series ring.

[00:27] Hello, everyone.

[00:43] I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles and with me is Ron Piaia Hallet.

[00:49] What's up, fella?

[00:50] Hola, Miyamoto Ronaldo.

[00:53] Oh, very nice.

[00:56] Your name is so much cooler in Spanish.

[00:59] I can't shrile the ar though.

[01:01] Yeah, Ronaldo.

[01:02] Yeah, I can't see that.

[01:04] You don't have that.

[01:05] It's that thing that most Canadians have because we've got that French influence, so we're

[01:10] able to kind of pick those things.

[01:12] Oh, tons of fun.

[01:13] What's been up?

[01:14] How was Expo?

[01:15] It was great.

[01:16] It's always great.

[01:18] Always great.

[01:19] Never bad.

[01:20] Except that one year where it looked like their pinball was going to be gone forever.

[01:25] But other than that year, it was, it was, it was, that's pretty well.

[01:30] I did not get to Expo.

[01:32] I am planning to make it one of these years, but it's got to be a good year.

[01:36] There's got to be some good pins out.

[01:38] None of this, none of this Star Wars follow the Empire crap.

[01:41] Well, fantastic hotel.

[01:43] That's the one on sale today.

[01:46] So, mm-hmm.

[01:48] Did you see the guys that flipping out are sponsor?

[01:50] Yes, I did say that I saw, yes, I saw Greg and Ken from flipping out, manning the flipping

[01:56] out booth.

[01:57] Yeah, they had a whole booth.

[01:58] They did the whole thing.

[02:00] Did you, did you give them all hugs?

[02:01] Did you give them hugs?

[02:02] No.

[02:03] No, I did play Golden Tea.

[02:05] Oh, yeah.

[02:06] Okay, I heard that.

[02:07] I heard that on SlamTill podcast, your other podcast.

[02:09] My other podcast.

[02:10] Yes.

[02:11] Very good.

[02:12] Very good.

[02:13] Now, did you happen to email Greg at fliptheletternoutpinball.com for all your latest and

[02:20] greatest needs when it comes to Golden Tea?

[02:23] Sure.

[02:45] Oh.

[02:46] In other news, the pinball bar in my local hometown has started to really up the pinball

[02:54] quality of the pins in there.

[02:58] And I'm telling you, it's pretty great.

[03:01] They picked up a roller games and a mouse and a round.

[03:06] Huh?

[03:07] Ooh.

[03:08] Collecting that cheese and going through the mouse hole thing.

[03:12] Both games I've owned or currently are.

[03:14] Love it.

[03:16] Roller games.

[03:16] Just fantastic.

[03:17] I've played a lot of King Kong.

[03:22] King Kong Pro.

[03:24] So based on our last episode, that's all time.

[03:31] There's not a terrible shot in that entire game.

[03:34] Even the brick shots are amazing.

[03:37] Ron, I think I prefer it over Godzilla.

[03:41] Oh, wow.

[03:43] Yep.

[05:10] I love t shirts.

[05:23] And, uh, as always, you can email us silver ball chronicles at gmail.com.

[05:30] So we got a great email from Gary P. He says, love the show.

[05:34] I started from the beginning and I just heard Ron talk lovingly about Johnny, pneumonic.

[05:41] There you go.

[05:42] Love the community.

[05:43] Love everybody involved in saying hello and feeding Ron's ego.

[05:48] Nobody ever sends a message talking about how great it is about, you know, the time that

[05:52] I said, oh, this game was great, but Johnny, pneumonic.

[05:57] Stegasa or sonic pinball was Spain's major contribution to the golden age of pinball.

[06:05] Its products evolved from licensed electro mechanical designs to original solid state games

[06:10] under the brand sonic.

[06:14] Established in March of 1968, sigasa, later known as Sega, SA sonic, initially imported

[06:22] and distributed American amusement machines before transitioning to a local manufacturer

[06:29] due to import restrictions.

[06:33] Production ceased in 1986, marking the end of Spain's efforts for world domination and its

[06:40] pinball adventure.

[06:42] Let's jump in this month to pinball tapas sonic pinball.

[06:46] Do you like tapas, Ron?

[06:48] I was going to ask you what that meant.

[06:49] I thought you meant to put tapes and spelled it wrong.

[06:51] Oh tapas, tapas are like little plates of food that like a table would order multiple

[06:58] little, it's like little appetizers, but that's the meal.

[07:02] And then you all order what you want and then y'all kind of share at the table.

[07:06] Tapas.

[07:08] And that's a, that's a Spanish thing, apparently.

[07:10] It's very okay.

[07:11] Not a tapas band.

[07:13] Do you like paella, Ron?

[07:16] The shrimp and the seafood and it's in a really big sort of, I like shrimp.

[07:21] Yeah, yeah, you like rice with your shrimp and your seafood, all cooked in the same thing

[07:26] with tomato and spices.

[07:28] That actually sounds good.

[07:29] It's paella is actually very good.

[07:30] I kid.

[07:31] Paella is very good.

[07:32] It's worth it to look that up.

[07:35] Ron.

[07:36] Yes.

[07:37] Do you like movies about gladiators?

[07:40] Do you like sonic pinball games?

[07:43] Yes I do.

[07:44] I like several of them.

[07:46] Several?

[07:47] So not, they're not just a one hit wonder.

[07:48] Yeah, I might even own one.

[07:50] Actually, two.

[07:51] This was a difficult pinball podcast to put together.

[07:55] Segasa or sonic.

[07:57] So they kind of changed, they rebranded, kind of changed their structure of their company,

[08:02] kind of halfway through their existence.

[08:05] So it's really difficult to kind of piece together what was released when and by whom.

[08:10] And confusing.

[08:11] I mean, they're called Sega and sonic, but they're not Sega, you know.

[08:16] Yeah, and they're Segasa, but they're Sega SA.

[08:20] Yeah.

[08:21] And their logo changed like a dozen times in the years that they were.

[08:25] It was very, very confusing.

[08:27] The other thing is it's like because of the language barrier, because they're from Spain

[08:32] and they're from Europe as well.

[08:34] There's a double sort of issue there.

[08:37] Like they don't have the sources that they would have for like a Williams or a Valley

[08:42] or even the Australian contingent because of language barrier and because of sort of distance

[08:49] from the North America, which is the sort of pinball focus of the world, especially the

[08:55] Midwest.

[08:56] Their designers didn't do podcasts or I couldn't find any of those podcasts.

[09:02] A lot of the episodes that we're doing here, Ron, those come from this old pinball when

[09:09] they did their old podcasts.

[09:12] And that was from the mid 2000.

[09:13] So it was sort of like when pinball had died and they were trying to get the stories out

[09:17] because they didn't think we'd be back in this situation.

[09:20] So it was kind of tough.

[09:21] However, if anybody is listening and they do have some extra sources for Sonic, please

[09:26] feel free to email us at silverballcronicles.com and I'll add them to the next episode so

[09:32] people can reference them.

[09:34] Now this episode doesn't cover playmatic of Barcelona, Spain.

[09:39] That might be another episode.

[09:40] This is about Sega SA Sonic.

[09:44] What do you think?

[09:45] Sonic or playmatic.

[09:46] What is your favorite?

[09:47] I have liked more Sonic games than playmatic games.

[09:50] Okay.

[09:51] I've played a couple of playmatic games.

[09:52] All of them.

[09:53] Pretty decent.

[09:54] But I have to agree.

[09:55] The ones, the Sonic games that I've played, I've always enjoyed more.

[09:59] Especially when they made a couple of original designs and we'll get into those shortly.

[10:05] So I guess we should start at the beginning of Sega SA.

[10:08] And like I said, I'm doing my best with this topic.

[10:11] I found one very, very good source.

[10:14] I took that source and I had to translate it.

[10:19] And you know, that source might be all made up.

[10:22] I don't know.

[10:23] But we're doing the best we can here because we got to tell all the stories of all the manufacturers.

[10:29] Not everybody wants to hear about Bally Williams in the 90s all the time, right Ron?

[10:33] Yeah, no, but there's plenty of that out there.

[10:35] So Sega SA was founded in 1968 as the company called Sega SA or Sega SA would you just

[10:44] kind of jam those together.

[10:47] These were, this company was created by shareholders of Sega enterprises.

[10:52] So the company like the the game maker Sega or what would eventually become Sega and

[10:57] Sega Genesis and all that stuff.

[11:00] So they were shareholders of that company and they started Sega in Madrid, Spain.

[11:07] Are you a fan of Madrid Spain?

[11:08] I've never been there.

[11:10] Never been there either.

[11:11] Never been there either.

[11:12] I feel like Madrid is a big deal.

[11:15] That's where the F1 races, I think, outside of Madrid.

[11:19] And then there's Barcelona.

[11:20] And we'll talk a little bit about a bit of Barcelona a little bit later.

[11:24] Now the company's capital, the money, was actually owned by the Japanese firms, Sega

[11:32] and our prizes.

[11:33] So a lot of the startup money came from the actual Sega.

[11:37] And its business purpose was to quote unquote manufacture and wholesale recreational gambling

[11:43] machines.

[11:45] So I found that that was kind of neat.

[11:46] So when the company was set up, it had a very specific purpose to manufacture and wholesale

[11:52] gambling.

[11:54] So they began by manufacturing electro mechanical arcade machines.

[11:58] I never really had seen electro mechanical arcade machines before.

[12:04] All the arcade machines I ever saw were solid state and they were like, and they were like

[12:08] the 1990s solid state, right?

[12:10] Because they were even see any like the gun games or any of the pilot helicopter around

[12:16] and stuff like that.

[12:17] So I've seen a few of them since I've joined the hobby because I've gone to a couple of

[12:21] shows or I've been to a shop or something like that or I've been to a collector's house

[12:28] and they've got something like that.

[12:30] And I think electro mechanical arcade machines are super cool.

[12:34] Do you have any favorite electro mechanical arcade machines?

[12:37] I like a lot of the gun ones, especially when they started getting crazy to put like

[12:42] an H-track in there.

[12:43] So it's playing sound and things like that.

[12:46] Yeah, it's, it just boggles the like for somebody like me who more or less has grown up in

[12:52] the digital world.

[12:54] It's really confusing to me to imagine that something in that machine is physically moving

[13:00] around and making the targets fall down or lift up or you're shooting like one of the

[13:08] ones that are like a periscope game, right?

[13:11] Where you're using a periscope and shooting down like submarines, like that is super cool.

[13:16] The smart thing that that Sega did is they used all of the technology and patents from

[13:23] Sega Japan and they were mostly direct copies of other machines that were already manufactured

[13:29] in Japan.

[13:31] But now they were producing them in Spain because Spain had high import tariffs, very

[13:38] topical word at the moment in world trade.

[13:41] So it made it more expensive to move machines from Japan into Spain than it was to manufacture

[13:47] them in Spain.

[13:49] So that reduces the cost.

[13:51] You don't have your own R&D firm.

[13:53] You don't have to reinvent the wheel.

[13:55] You're just kind of doing the same thing but building it somewhere else.

[13:57] Pretty smart, pretty smart strategy.

[13:59] And you're actually.

[14:00] But they eventually got into the video games.

[14:02] Yes.

[14:03] They made the imported video games into space such as pong, space invaders, asteroids.

[14:09] Yeah.

[14:10] So this was like what they did in the States too, right?

[14:13] Like didn't somebody in the States just buy the rights to those Japanese games and manufacture

[14:18] them in the States?

[14:19] Wasn't that the same midway?

[14:21] Yeah.

[14:22] Bought them.

[14:23] Yeah.

[14:24] From Namco.

[14:25] That's our Pac-Man.

[14:26] Cam.

[14:27] Pac-Man is Namco but all the cabin, it's everything, they're all built by Midway.

[14:31] Yeah.

[14:32] It's really weird when you look at those old sort of video game sort of who owns the licensing,

[14:39] who owns the manufacturing, who owns the patent, like this, this weird web of all these international

[14:45] companies that own these bits and pieces.

[14:48] It's so confusing.

[14:50] Usually the US cabinets are preferred in the market because they're bigger.

[14:53] Oh.

[14:54] Usually the Japanese cabinets were smaller.

[14:56] Are those the ones they call the Caber-Lays?

[14:59] No, they weren't smaller like that because those were made, those were in the US market too.

[15:03] They would have the full model, the cabaret, which is just like the mini, and then they would

[15:08] have the sit down that had to had.

[15:11] Yeah.

[15:12] Actually, is that called the cabaret?

[15:13] Am I getting my cabaret?

[15:14] No, the cabaret is the small one.

[15:16] The cocktail is the little one.

[15:18] But I mean, like the full size one in Japan was smaller than the full size one in the US.

[15:22] And that's mostly because in Japan, you know, they're in these large cities and space

[15:28] is worth a lot more.

[15:30] I think it's because everything is bigger in the US as I found when I went to the UK and

[15:36] even a can of sodas.

[15:37] It's like, wow, this is way smaller than I'm used to.

[15:40] We need a bigger marquee than this game, not big enough.

[15:43] Now, the biggest breakthrough for Seigasa was really in 1972 when they began the in-house

[15:48] manufacturing of EM pinball machines.

[15:51] They reached a licensing agreement with Williams pinball in the United States and they decided

[15:56] to reproduce those models for the Spanish market.

[16:01] This, again, they're taking a very smart lesson here.

[16:05] They're saying, we got those videos and all those EM machines from Japan and we just took

[16:11] their plans and built it here.

[16:13] Well, we're going to do the same thing with pinball.

[16:16] And who do you go to when you're going to make a pinball machine?

[16:19] You pretty much go to the clean.

[16:22] Yeah, you do go to Gottlieb.

[16:24] They're probably too expensive.

[16:25] Yeah, they probably were too expensive like no.

[16:28] Right?

[16:29] You go to the second place, you know, or the third place Williams team.

[16:35] Because Williams probably wants to generate more revenue somewhere and if they can license

[16:39] out those games, that's great.

[16:42] Gottlieb.

[16:43] Gottlieb's killing it on their own.

[16:43] They don't need any help.

[16:45] So their first pin was Casba.

[16:48] Rock the Casba from the night from the from the clashes famous song in 1972 years before

[16:56] the clash actually date this song.

[16:57] Amazing.

[16:58] This is where the clash created their song.

[17:02] This rock the Casba came from this game.

[17:05] Who knew?

[17:06] Now, Casba is actually K-A-S-B-H.

[17:10] But this is Casba C-A-S-B-A-H.

[17:15] And it's an area in Algeria.

[17:19] You've been to the Casba in Algeria, right?

[17:23] I have never rocked the Casba, I'm afraid.

[17:25] The Casba is very much like an old fortified city.

[17:31] Sort of it comes from the Spanish mixture within the Arabic world.

[17:36] It's really cool.

[17:37] You can throw it into Google.

[17:38] That's literally what I've done here.

[17:40] It's in North Africa.

[17:41] It's like a citadel.

[17:42] It's really cool.

[17:43] So it's an exotic theme, right?

[17:47] It's like a Middle Eastern Aladdin-esque theme.

[17:51] Yeah.

[17:52] You know what our listeners want?

[17:53] They want to know what the flyer says.

[17:56] All right, let me bring up the phone.

[17:57] It's so wide.

[17:58] I love the flyers.

[17:59] All right, you go ahead and read this one, Ron.

[18:00] Oh no, it's in Spanish.

[18:03] Of course it is.

[18:04] Especial Lotiaya.

[18:06] E justi bal a tres e cinco bolas.

[18:10] Necesaria, eto do exploite do arre por su...

[18:14] Yeah, I don't know what that says.

[18:15] And I just completely butchered this entire language.

[18:20] Let's see with acclaimed and popular systems of balls.

[18:26] Balls, that's what actually looks like it says.

[18:28] Something about bonus and extra ball.

[18:31] Bola extra.

[18:32] Extra.

[18:33] Double the bonus in the last ball.

[18:37] Ultima ball.

[18:38] I was assuming that double bonus on the last ball.

[18:41] See, I'm doing it.

[18:42] The art is really kind of neat here.

[18:46] It's like cartoony.

[18:48] It's got like perspective.

[18:51] It's like people hanging out in a bar

[18:53] and there looks like there's a king sitting on a throne.

[18:57] It's very exotic.

[18:58] It's a one player.

[19:00] Five digit display.

[19:03] Five real display.

[19:04] There are no digits.

[19:07] Unless they were way ahead of their time.

[19:09] I think the best part about this pinball machine

[19:12] is that you can see that they are being very careful

[19:15] with their first pin.

[19:17] Right, they don't want anything too complicated.

[19:19] They don't want a million mechanics.

[19:21] They got two pop bumpers, two,

[19:24] one of these captive ball, very target looking things.

[19:28] And then in the bottom, there's no in lanes.

[19:32] It goes into like a weird kicker just behind the flippers.

[19:36] Yeah, like a lot of Williams games too.

[19:39] They kicks it out.

[19:40] Yeah.

[19:41] And people are like, well, what does this doesn't make?

[19:44] Why would they make their own version?

[19:45] Well, actually, this is 1973 Williams darling

[19:50] or the four player Jubilee.

[19:53] They've just re-themed it for their local market.

[19:57] So darling doesn't mean anything in Spanish or in Spain.

[20:03] But Casbah does because it's kind of this exotic spot

[20:07] on the other side of the Mediterranean.

[20:10] To me, the most surprising thing is they actually licensed it

[20:13] and didn't just rip it off.

[20:15] Because most of the time in Europe, you could just rip it off.

[20:17] I mean, they're not going to be able to sue them.

[20:20] Especially in the actually made us.

[20:22] Yes, in the early 70s, in this case.

[20:25] But they made a licensing agreement.

[20:27] Yeah, copying pinball machines, especially American pinball

[20:30] machines was pretty common in Europe.

[20:32] But Segasa chose the more reliable and legal route.

[20:35] So hats off to them.

[20:37] But that also gave them sort of a competitive advantage

[20:40] that it gave them almost a guarantee of a top of the line

[20:45] earning pinball machine and mechanics that were already proven.

[20:51] They didn't have to do it all themselves.

[20:53] This was very much credited towards Fredrico Baldo,

[20:58] who is the industrial designer at Segasa.

[21:03] Very smart decision.

[21:05] Now, the pinball machines that kind of everybody knows

[21:10] when it comes to the early years of Segasa is 1973's Spanish eyes.

[21:17] It's good as it gets.

[21:19] And some people realize this pin as being the Williams Spanish eyes.

[21:25] Wow, the backlash looks way better.

[21:27] Isn't that look great?

[21:29] This is what I was going to bring up here.

[21:31] I need this backlash in my game.

[21:33] So Segasa, although manufacturing the game the same way

[21:38] and putting Williams on the backlash

[21:40] and then kind of on the other side,

[21:41] it says a product of Segasa Madrid or Esun Prodico Segasa Madrid.

[21:49] They've gone and made Spanish eyes, but the art is far superior.

[21:54] Like it's similar, right?

[21:55] It's the same.

[21:56] It's a similar style, but it's actually good.

[22:00] It's yeah, because I don't know if you know this or not.

[22:04] Europeans very artsy folk.

[22:07] Old world.

[22:08] I have not played Spanish eyes.

[22:11] The play field looking, I'm looking at the play field now.

[22:13] The play field art looks exactly the same.

[22:15] The plastics are different.

[22:17] At least some of them are different.

[22:19] The play field, the figures on the play field,

[22:22] the kind of the shape of the faces and stuff

[22:25] in the mid play field exactly the same as the Williams version.

[22:29] It's this is a cool game because it's in that weird era

[22:32] where they just weren't quite sure yet.

[22:35] At the bottom of the play field in the middle,

[22:36] there's a pop bumper and then the slings are just above that.

[22:41] So if you get kind of stuck in that middle pop bumper,

[22:43] you're going to drain likely, but you might be able to nudge it out.

[22:46] Nah, you could save it a ton of times.

[22:48] Maybe if you're Ron Hallett.

[22:50] It's great.

[22:52] This is one of the more popular games I have for newbies that come over.

[22:57] At the first time they save a ball out of there,

[22:59] if they love the game from that point forward as they should.

[23:02] Spanish eyes from Williams was 1971.

[23:05] So it's a couple of years after that.

[23:08] They did time travel in 1973.

[23:12] Look at time travel. Look at this one.

[23:14] It's called travel time now.

[23:16] That's right. So travel time from 1973 was time travel

[23:23] over at Williams. What do you think of this one?

[23:28] I think the art is better once again.

[23:30] It's unbelievable.

[23:33] If you're looking for back glass art to hang up,

[23:37] search for the cigas of stuff.

[23:39] It is gorgeous.

[23:40] It's like a lady on a beach, but it's very psychedelic.

[23:45] What it's almost like a yellow submarine

[23:49] kind of in the background, right?

[23:51] With those weird swirls and that is true.

[23:54] That's kind of what it looks like.

[23:55] It's clearly like an island in the background.

[23:59] People are surfing.

[24:00] I have no idea what it has to do with.

[24:02] So it has nothing to do with time travel

[24:04] and it has everything to do with travel

[24:06] or time around traveling.

[24:08] Again, it's a wide open play field.

[24:11] Yeah, this one is not at the level of Spanish eyes.

[24:14] It is not.

[24:16] It's got a kicker in the middle rather than the pop bumper.

[24:19] Still no in lanes.

[24:22] The highlight here is the back glass art,

[24:25] which is just stunning.

[24:26] Now for the next game, there is no highlight.

[24:28] So I'm curious.

[24:29] There's no highlight here.

[24:31] So everybody remember Strato Flight from 1974?

[24:36] Well, this is Astro Flight.

[24:39] Yeah, yeah, it looks similar to the regular one.

[24:44] Yeah, it's just a big square of no fun.

[24:48] It's terrible, terrible.

[24:50] It is a terrible game.

[24:51] I hate seeing things like that, but this game just sucks.

[24:55] It's, yeah.

[24:55] So we're gonna yaddy, yaddy, yaddo over this one.

[24:58] Someone's gonna be like, that's my favorite game.

[24:59] I'm sorry.

[25:00] That's the best one that Williams ever made.

[25:03] What about Gulfstream?

[25:05] Gulfstream.

[25:06] Everybody loves Gulfstream.

[25:08] Remember the back glass with the pointy elbows?

[25:11] Lots of pointy elbows.

[25:13] Yeah.

[25:13] So many pointy elbows.

[25:14] They thought that this was really cool art,

[25:16] so they just went with the same one.

[25:18] They didn't make any changes.

[25:19] The play field itself, again, we're not talking Gottlieb here

[25:23] at the Williams days, are we?

[25:25] Interesting.

[25:26] Looking at the pictures on IPDD,

[25:28] it looks like someone changed the flipper bats.

[25:30] Yeah, to the Gottlieb once.

[25:31] Yeah, there goes Gottlieb bats for some reason.

[25:35] What they're doing here is in this time,

[25:38] all of a sudden became apparent that, oh my goodness,

[25:41] people wanted to play these games.

[25:45] Right, they wanted to play pinball.

[25:47] Pinball is a form of entertainment of distraction,

[25:50] was a big deal.

[25:51] So they're just banging out as much as they can,

[25:54] as quickly as they can.

[25:56] Basically, the same thing they're doing in the States.

[25:59] They're just doing it in Europe or in Spain specifically.

[26:03] The issue is Williams, in my opinion,

[26:07] was significantly behind Gottlieb when it came to designs.

[26:11] They just kind of did whatever,

[26:13] and you can kind of tell that whatever was not great.

[26:17] What do you think?

[26:18] Are you Gulfstream fan?

[26:21] Not really.

[26:22] Not really.

[26:23] Well, we'll just continue on.

[26:25] If anyone has a, say,

[26:26] God's the God's the Spanish ice back glass, let me know.

[26:30] Other games that were really popular were Ace High,

[26:34] which was a 1974 copy of Williams 1973 dealers choice,

[26:40] but it had the same colors as 1974's Lucky Ace.

[26:44] Does that matter?

[26:45] No.

[26:45] Triple action was a big game for Williams,

[26:50] Baby doll and Big Ben was their last 1975 pin.

[26:55] In some cases,

[26:57] Segasa was able to help Williams break into the Italian market,

[27:02] and the Big Ben pinball machine was a great example of that.

[27:06] Do you remember how hard it was for Gottlieb to get into Italy?

[27:09] They had to create Atta Ball,

[27:12] because it was gambling if you could win a game.

[27:15] So they had to make it so you win a ball,

[27:17] which was in the same game you were currently playing.

[27:20] And Big Ben designed,

[27:23] a remanufactured by Segasa helped Williams

[27:27] break in to that Italian market.

[27:29] So that was a big turning point,

[27:32] but not as big as the 1976 rebrand.

[27:36] I'm very excited.

[27:38] So Segasa, with all of his success at home,

[27:41] set its eyes on the export market.

[27:45] It wanted to start selling pinball machines.

[27:47] It was a broad, so they've noticed, oh my goodness,

[27:52] we can make a lot of money by making these pinball machines.

[27:56] What if we just made our own pinball machines?

[27:59] We didn't license as many pinball machines from Williams,

[28:02] and then we sold them in the United States,

[28:05] or in the UK, or in Italy, ourselves.

[28:09] Well, that's when Segasa rebranded as Segasa, SA Sonic,

[28:14] so that it wouldn't be confused with the Japanese Sega.

[28:20] Which is weird because then the Japanese Sega

[28:25] used the Sonic for their character.

[28:29] I mean, that can't be a coincidence either.

[28:31] Instead of Segasa, now it's Segasa, space SA.

[28:35] So now it looks more like Segasa from Japan.

[28:38] So it looks like there's more confused Europeans, man.

[28:41] So then they expanded their manufacturing operations

[28:45] to Parla Madrid, which is, I guess, a section of Madrid.

[28:51] This is when they set their eyes on the US and Europe,

[28:55] but they had to expand their team.

[28:58] Some of the names that they added, the legends in pinball

[29:02] that I'm sure you remember, Manuel, oh God.

[29:06] I thought it would be Manuel Velasquez.

[29:09] You need to watch more baseball.

[29:10] Manuel Velasquez, Val Verede, who was the commercial director.

[29:16] So now you needed somebody to sell,

[29:18] somebody to be on the business development team.

[29:21] And he was a former Real Madrid footballer.

[29:24] Yeah, you had his poster in your bedroom,

[29:26] right next to Don Mattingley.

[29:29] What did your FION day world cup soccer?

[29:32] He probably did.

[29:33] Now this is a course where IPDB, the internet pinball database

[29:39] gets a bit messy because some of the pins are listed as

[29:42] Segasa, others are listed as Sega.

[29:45] Some of them are listed on both of the lists.

[29:47] It's very confusing.

[29:48] We can all say that it's because of Jose, Maria, Gaeldo,

[29:54] Goma, the game designer that we are talking about,

[29:58] Segasonic today.

[30:02] His first design was Casino Royale,

[30:07] named after the 2006 James Bond film.

[30:11] No.

[30:12] I think it was just called Casino Royale

[30:14] because it's Casino Royale.

[30:15] That's right.

[30:16] It's just a royal casino.

[30:19] Back glass, awesome.

[30:23] Play field, really good.

[30:25] It's got a nice orbit shot.

[30:28] It's got one of those sucker shots in the middle

[30:31] where you want to put it in the hole

[30:32] for it to build up your bonus.

[30:35] Will it stick in that hole though?

[30:38] I'm looking at it.

[30:39] It looks like it would reject a lot.

[30:41] It does.

[30:42] It is a casino based pin.

[30:46] This is something very common back in those days.

[30:49] Right, it was gambling or cards.

[30:51] Ladies in general, sometimes cars.

[30:54] Those were the themes that sold cowboys.

[30:58] Solid, I would say solid first outing.

[31:01] The game, it was actually so popular

[31:04] that other companies throughout Europe

[31:07] pirated the design and copied it.

[31:10] Nice.

[31:11] Predominantly the Italian market in 1970.

[31:14] Oh, I follow Italians.

[31:16] What are you doing?

[31:18] No.

[31:19] No, but the Italians are in no way ever untrustworthy.

[31:23] I find that that is slander.

[31:26] What about Monaco?

[31:28] You vacation in Monaco quite regularly.

[31:30] I'm sorry, cans.

[31:31] Or cans.

[31:32] Well, they're pretty much the same game.

[31:35] That's right.

[31:36] You've been to cans for the film festival?

[31:39] No.

[31:39] But I have played this game.

[31:41] I played cans and Monaco.

[31:43] And Monaco.

[31:44] Yeah.

[31:45] That seems like it's really hard.

[31:48] And this we got an orbit spinner.

[31:50] Yeah.

[31:51] You know how I feel about orbit spinners.

[31:53] It also has one of those swinging targets

[31:55] in the middle, classic, 19 sort of 70s, late 60s design.

[32:01] How about this backlash?

[32:02] What do you think of this one?

[32:03] Another good backlash.

[32:04] Now they're good backlash.

[32:05] They're like, they're in like a vacation resort,

[32:09] clearly in cans, France.

[32:11] Some of it, there's a lady water skiing,

[32:14] little bit of a,

[32:16] little bit of bikini action,

[32:18] but the bikini is kind of low in the back.

[32:21] Kind of low, a little crack showing, yes.

[32:22] Yeah, it could be, could be a plumber theme.

[32:24] Yep.

[32:25] But the art in general is really good.

[32:28] Now in your research,

[32:30] did you find anything about

[32:33] when they started a clear coating the play fields?

[32:35] No.

[32:36] See, one of the things that's unique

[32:39] in the collector market,

[32:40] it's basically two really unique things

[32:42] about the Sonic games.

[32:45] One is the play fields are clear coated.

[32:48] So they generally look way better

[32:51] than you would think a 50 year old game would look.

[32:54] I mean, most manufacturers were not clear coating

[32:57] in the 70s.

[32:58] No, they were.

[32:59] That started sort of pat-law or in the late 80s?

[33:01] Yeah, starting like in the late 80s.

[33:03] So they were ahead of their time in that.

[33:07] So the play fields generally look good

[33:09] and they usually, they play fast.

[33:12] These games play really fast.

[33:16] The cabinets themselves vary solid as well.

[33:18] No, that's actually with the other thing

[33:20] they're no forest having horrible cabinets.

[33:24] Yeah, the wood.

[33:25] Not so strong in Europe.

[33:26] Yeah, they're like particle board.

[33:28] They're not good cabinets,

[33:30] but their play fields are excellent.

[33:32] Also, as an owner of two of them now,

[33:36] I'll say that the mechs are all Williams mechs, obviously,

[33:40] because that's, yeah,

[33:41] because that's who they've licensed a lot of that stuff from.

[33:43] But they improved on it.

[33:45] Like they're flippers,

[33:47] instead of the parts just being screwed into the wood

[33:50] where they eventually loosen up and in the flipper suck,

[33:53] they go into a base plate.

[33:55] Before Williams was using a base plate.

[33:57] Yeah, so rather than going directly into the play field,

[34:00] there's like a metal base plate.

[34:02] Smart.

[34:03] But they're the same parts other than the base plate.

[34:05] So when you order like a flipper rebuild kit,

[34:08] you can just order the Williams one

[34:09] and it fits right in there.

[34:11] So the flippers are better, their chimes are better,

[34:14] they sound better.

[34:16] Is it four pieces or three piece chime?

[34:19] That's, I think it's three.

[34:20] I think it's three.

[34:21] That stern has the four.

[34:23] They're a mechs.

[34:24] It's just, they're like improvements

[34:26] over the Williams design a lot of ways.

[34:29] It's funny where you can see the engineering team

[34:33] and Sigasa in general spent a lot of their time.

[34:37] They knew just like when we got into kind of that 1981 valley,

[34:44] they knew that art drew people in.

[34:46] So they put a lot of effort in the art

[34:48] and you can really tell.

[34:51] They also put a lot of effort into service ability

[34:54] to make sure that it lasted through a lot of plays.

[34:58] When it comes to things like the cabinets,

[34:59] they knew it only needed to last like five years.

[35:02] It didn't need to last 50.

[35:04] Boy, that three years worth of hardcore

[35:07] straight on play needed to last.

[35:10] So it's, it needed to draw you in with the art.

[35:13] It needed to last like a rock for three years

[35:16] and then it was no big deal after that.

[35:18] It was, it was, it was pretty smart.

[35:20] You know the clear coat they were using

[35:21] was not safe in anyway.

[35:23] Oh, surely not.

[35:24] Nothing in 1976 was safe.

[35:26] No, like just look at the,

[35:29] that wasn't that lawn darts weren't lawn darts popular in 1976?

[35:33] This is Gene Simmons from Kiss.

[36:26] Playaborn all the time when I was a kid.

[36:28] I mean, you didn't throw lawn darts at people.

[36:31] Yeah, sure.

[36:32] Nobody ever did that.

[36:33] You do not to do that.

[36:34] You just threw it straight in the air

[36:36] and then tried to run away before it landed near you.

[36:39] No, you threw it into a circle on the other end.

[36:44] And the child seats in the 1970s?

[36:46] Definitely solid.

[36:47] I don't even think adults had seat belts in the 70s.

[36:50] I don't remember having a child seat when I was a kid.

[36:53] My child seat was kneeling on the back seat,

[36:57] put my hands up and looking over.

[36:58] The clear coat was just par for the course.

[37:01] My grandfather, so he used to do auto body work.

[37:04] It is repair shop.

[37:05] And he would like spray lead paint on like 1950s and 60s cars.

[37:10] And he didn't wear a mask.

[37:11] You know what I mean?

[37:13] Yeah, I'm, yeah.

[37:14] I'll think of some of the sonic employees probably

[37:18] that's some issues due to all that clear coat.

[37:20] That brings me, I think, to the kind of the neatest,

[37:23] most interesting pin around this time

[37:26] from Segasa and that, or from Sonic, rather.

[37:30] That was faces.

[37:32] Ooh, named after the Rod Stewart band.

[37:34] Oh no, what's that?

[37:36] So faces, this is the one I think that a lot of people would know

[37:40] or would notice or see.

[37:42] They sold a lot of these, particularly in North America.

[37:46] And it is wild.

[37:49] It's a lady's face on half of the back glass.

[37:54] And it's all like you were on acid.

[37:57] Yes, it's very trippy.

[37:59] Yeah, she's like purple and pink

[38:02] and her eyes are all like wonky

[38:04] and her hair looks like roses.

[38:07] It's got a lot of blue, white space.

[38:09] And I'll tell you, one of the most beautiful back glass

[38:12] is in pins in general.

[38:14] The play field is gorgeous.

[38:15] The cabinet is gorgeous.

[38:16] It's so cool.

[38:17] I mean, it looks like Picasso himself made this pinball machine.

[38:21] He could have.

[38:22] It's possible.

[38:23] Never know.

[38:24] It was actually the art director.

[38:26] The artistic director was Miguel and Hal extravaren.

[38:33] Hermenda, Día.

[38:35] Armendía.

[38:36] Wow.

[38:37] And you thought we screwed up the names on the regular

[38:41] silver ball Chronicles, but boy, oh boy,

[38:44] we got nothing on this episode.

[38:45] Pretty bad.

[38:46] Yeah, it's pretty bad.

[38:48] Miguel died in 2004.

[38:51] But he was the kind of, he was the art director.

[38:53] So he's like, let's go all in on European crazy.

[38:58] Yeah.

[38:58] And faces looks exactly like Grand Prix.

[39:02] Oh, imagine that.

[39:04] Yeah.

[39:05] So if you're looking for a like Grand Prix,

[39:08] they sold what like a billion of those.

[39:09] But it has an extra flipper.

[39:11] So in Grand Prix, when you're shooting,

[39:13] so the left and the right side of Grand Prix have spinners.

[39:19] And it's a mirror image, right?

[39:21] The left and right side.

[39:23] But on faces, the right side has another lane and a spinner,

[39:30] which I think is kind of cool.

[39:32] I'd like to know how it shoots.

[39:34] The pop bumpers also kind of look like eyes

[39:37] and then there's lips in the middle of the play field.

[39:40] And it looks like hair going down the middle.

[39:43] There's faces in the middle of the play field.

[39:45] And is that a collect saucer on the right?

[39:47] Yes, it is.

[39:48] Yeah, because on Grand Prix, they're on both sides.

[39:51] On this one, it's just on the right.

[39:53] So on the right has an extra flipper

[39:56] to help you access that orbit on the right side

[39:59] or to make you want to shoot it

[40:01] and then inevitably drain because you've used that flipper.

[40:05] I would love to play one of these

[40:06] and compare it to Grand Prix.

[40:10] I love Grand Prix, but this is much more interesting.

[40:14] I mean, everybody loves Grand Prix, right?

[40:16] I don't dislike it.

[40:17] Spinners, man, come on.

[40:19] I'd rather play Hot Tip.

[40:20] Spinners, collect it the saucer, spinners, collect the saucer.

[40:24] Oh, I'm more of a Hot Tip guy.

[40:26] I'm on Team Captive Ball.

[40:29] What about Mars Trek?

[40:30] Mars Trek, it's hernimate darling.

[40:32] It should be in every tournament.

[40:35] Everybody loves Mars Trek.

[40:37] Mars Trek, the same kind of trippy art style as faces,

[40:44] but a little more spacey and like a little less,

[40:49] it's wild, but it tends to be a little less Picasso

[40:54] and maybe a little more something you can actually see.

[40:57] So you're on acid, but you're in space on acid.

[41:00] Now, the cool thing about this one,

[41:02] this is an amazing pin because it has two spinners

[41:07] kind of halfway up the play field.

[41:09] And behind those spinners is like a horseshoe ramp, right?

[41:13] Or a horseshoe return, a little bit like stern star wars.

[41:19] Yeah, it's a horseshoe.

[41:21] It's just called a horseshoe.

[41:22] So you do spinner horseshoe then it comes back

[41:26] towards the player through the other spinner.

[41:29] And the lanes at the top after you plunge

[41:32] are on an odd angle.

[41:33] They're not straight up and down north and south

[41:35] like they usually are.

[41:37] It's got a third flipper that's on the side, but way low.

[41:40] And dangerous.

[41:42] Yeah, well, it's almost get it out of the outlane area flipper.

[41:47] Yeah, this is a great game.

[41:49] You know, in all this.

[41:49] But it's actual job is to hit the Mars targets.

[41:52] I played one of these at Fantastic

[41:54] and I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this game.

[41:58] I was like, oh, a sonic.

[42:00] I've never really, I've only ever played one other sonic.

[42:02] I'm like, oh, and I played it.

[42:03] And I'm like, this game is awesome.

[42:05] Don't you love a fast they play?

[42:07] Yeah.

[42:08] Okay, so here's the thing.

[42:09] Did these play faster than the sterns?

[42:13] Uh, different era so.

[42:17] Yeah.

[42:18] Who's got the crappier cabinet?

[42:20] Uh, certain cabinets aren't too great either, but no.

[42:23] Sonic's got them on the crappier cabinet.

[42:26] Yeah.

[42:27] So that's, that's August of 77.

[42:29] That's probably the one that I would want.

[42:33] Oh, but this is the one that you want or because you have it.

[42:38] Well, yeah, I have it.

[42:39] It's sitting downstairs right now.

[42:41] This is prospector from 1977.

[42:45] This is an unlicensed version of Laurel and Hardy.

[42:49] Yes, Laurel and Hardy are everywhere on this game

[42:52] and in the guarantee they didn't get a set from it.

[42:55] Well, their families didn't get a set from it.

[42:58] That's right.

[42:59] Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, they are prospectors on the back glass.

[43:03] As they were known in Spanish is El Gordo, Ye E Fleco.

[43:08] So the fat man and the skinny man.

[43:10] The skinny man.

[43:11] Yes.

[43:12] Those words I actually know.

[43:13] So yes.

[43:14] Yes.

[43:15] So, so my wife often calls me Gordo and I told that that is a term of endearment or she's

[43:24] fat shaming me every day and I'm completely unaware.

[43:28] This is perhaps based on the 1937 Hollywood movie by Laurel and Hardy called Way Out West

[43:39] where they were seeking to help out a prospector's daughter.

[43:44] You remember Way Out West from 1937?

[43:48] I remember Way Out West as it was called in the US.

[43:51] Yes.

[43:52] It was MGM films.

[43:53] I have to.

[43:54] Now owned by the evil corporation of Amazon.

[43:57] That is true.

[43:58] Very evil.

[43:59] I mean, could it be based on that?

[44:02] Yeah, probably.

[44:05] Critical response.

[44:06] How many rotten tomatoes we got here?

[44:08] It's not rated.

[44:09] Right.

[44:10] So Laurel and Hardy was like a slapstick comedy, right?

[44:13] Where it was a little bit like both of them kind of getting into trouble and funny situations

[44:19] and falling down and...

[44:21] Well, they're one of the few ones they had success in the silent era and then just as

[44:24] much success in the sound era.

[44:26] Yes, the talkies they called them.

[44:28] The talkies.

[44:29] They didn't hurt them at all.

[44:30] Yeah.

[44:31] Some people like Buster Keaton struggled.

[44:32] He was in round that era as well.

[44:35] Worth the look out.

[44:36] I'll put that link to Way Out West 1937 in the show notes.

[44:43] Do you want to talk about this pin because this is this whole this is near end to your

[44:48] hot prospector?

[44:49] The back glass is good.

[44:50] It's got Laurel and Hardy.

[44:52] They're prospecting.

[44:53] Laurel's got some like tight pants on.

[44:56] I'm sorry, Hardy.

[44:58] Which one's the chubby one again?

[45:00] Hardy is the fat one.

[45:02] Yes.

[45:03] So Hardy standing in the water in very tight swimming shorts like prospecting.

[45:10] I guess looking at gold.

[45:11] Yes.

[45:12] There's lots of really cool, interesting things in the back glass kind of floating around.

[45:17] Laurel is on the other side.

[45:20] He's writing down things.

[45:21] I assume doing accounting.

[45:24] He's the straight man I would assume.

[45:26] Yeah.

[45:27] Kind of.

[45:29] You'd have to see their routine.

[45:31] Would you would you go with a Hardy mustache?

[45:34] Do you think that's a good mustache?

[45:36] No, not these days.

[45:37] No.

[45:38] Because it's the Hitler mustache basically.

[45:41] Are you sure?

[45:42] Yeah.

[45:43] So tell me why is prospector a great great game?

[45:49] Two spinners.

[45:50] Right in the middle of play field.

[45:52] And basically the whole game is you want to collect silver and gold.

[45:56] Because you're prospecting.

[45:58] Silver bonus.

[46:00] You get by the spinners when they're lit.

[46:02] Gold bonus.

[46:03] You get by going over the switches that say build gold bonus.

[46:09] You can get a double double bonus.

[46:12] You can double your gold bonus by hitting the five and the six targets over on the right.

[46:17] Gold is worth more than silver.

[46:19] Just like it is in real life.

[46:21] So you can get up to $200,000 to $200,000 points in gold bonus if it's doubled.

[46:29] And also has all these kickers on the top that can kick the ball around.

[46:33] So you can get you can get a lot of action up there without ever doing anything.

[46:37] That's the other thing I like.

[46:39] It's a little bit of play field design, but what it is is really rules.

[46:42] This game nailed some really good kind of bonus collect rules.

[46:49] And that's I think what makes all the difference.

[46:51] You can collect the silver bonus.

[46:53] The gold bonus I think you can only collect when you drain.

[46:56] Fire remember.

[46:57] It's very it's great game.

[46:58] We play this I think on stream when I was at your place.

[47:02] And in which see the thing that gets me about this game is is both the part that I hate.

[47:08] And the part I think that makes it interesting is that when you rip one of those spinners,

[47:12] like you just smash it through the spinner, it's going to hit the pop bumpers behind it.

[47:17] And then it's going to come back down into the spinner and stop it from spinning, which

[47:21] makes me so angry.

[47:23] But at the same time, I think is part of the draw.

[47:25] Yeah.

[47:26] And the other interesting thing is like the saucer in the center.

[47:30] It's got like a metal guard around it, which I believe is factory.

[47:35] So again, nowhere in the saucer.

[47:38] Like how many saucers in like a 70s American game, are you going to see that don't have some

[47:43] kind of wear on them?

[47:44] Well, how about Joker's wild also from 1977?

[47:47] Now this based on the game show, maybe not.

[47:51] This is unbelievable.

[47:53] It's a forced perspective look.

[47:57] So it's like you're at the top of a of a saloon.

[48:00] You're looking maybe from the balcony kind of down onto the bar, the card playing.

[48:07] There's a jester.

[48:08] There's people that are dancing.

[48:11] Fellows with subreros, with hats.

[48:15] There's ladies, there's guys with guns on the table.

[48:19] It's really kind of neat because the perspective is that you're looking down onto this amazing

[48:26] kind of like crazy wild time.

[48:32] Very, very smart design.

[48:34] It kind of looks like a spaghetti western or something, doesn't it?

[48:37] Except for the Joker in the picture with his outfit.

[48:41] Yeah, he's like, yeah, he's like a jester or something.

[48:44] But I guess Joker's wild, like it's a card theme.

[48:47] The play field itself also forced perspective.

[48:51] So it has three spinning reels under the middle of the play field, three spinners.

[48:56] Three spinners.

[48:58] Double in lanes, single out lane, no slings.

[49:03] It's kind of a neat, different kind of thing going on here.

[49:06] And you haven't played this one.

[49:08] I haven't played this.

[49:09] No, neither of all.

[49:10] I haven't seen any of these.

[49:11] I don't know how many of these were sold in the North American market.

[49:15] But this is definitely something that looks very cool.

[49:18] It's got that center spinner too, right?

[49:21] So you could rip that center spinner.

[49:22] It has three spinners.

[49:24] That's all I need to hear.

[49:26] That's pretty neat for back in the day.

[49:28] 1977 also saw Super Straight, Bird Man, Butterfly, Cherry Bell in 78, Corus Line, Highly

[49:37] kind of game, 1978, and Space Queen in 1979.

[49:44] Shut up for Super Straight because that's the other one I own.

[49:48] No, you have a Super Straight from Sonic.

[49:50] I have a Super Straight.

[49:52] It doesn't work currently, but we've got to get it working.

[49:55] OK, so when it gets working, you can report back.

[49:59] It is the fastest Sonic I've ever played.

[50:01] We'll add a new segment to the podcast.

[50:05] We'll call it Repairs.

[50:07] You can tell us about Super Straight.

[50:09] So late 70s, that's when the tide began to change.

[50:14] Yes, Balley and Williams were leading the field in the old solid state.

[50:19] This was where I think Sonic made a very smart decision and they made the game called Storm.

[50:26] Storm.

[50:27] You remember Storm?

[50:28] Yeah, it was called Flash, what it was made here.

[50:31] That's right.

[50:32] So they took Flash.

[50:34] The Steve Richie Smash Classic is the biggest selling game still that started the, basically

[50:42] the first game with the Flash Lamp.

[50:44] Yeah, Flash Lamps.

[50:46] Right, it had his signature side flipper.

[50:49] First one that had it, loop shot.

[50:52] First time he did it and the three drop targets in the center and the five targets on the

[50:57] left that he did a ton of times.

[51:01] And he just made this game over and over and over again for 40 years.

[51:06] Not really, but yeah.

[51:08] But yeah, Storm.

[51:09] So that was a wise decision.

[51:10] Like take the one that's a massive hit and do that one.

[51:13] They sold tens of thousands, I think of the of the Flash.

[51:16] They sold a 20 K of Flash, yes.

[51:18] Yeah, that's right.

[51:20] Like huge Steve Richie's biggest seller.

[51:23] Yeah, how could you not just take it and call it something else?

[51:29] So super, super smart.

[51:31] That's when they also jumped into night fever based on the movie Saturday Night Fever.

[51:38] Oh, wait, no, no, it's just night fever.

[51:41] This looks an awful lot like Saturday Night Fever.

[51:44] Yeah, it is Saturday Night Fever.

[51:46] It literally is Saturday Night Fever.

[51:48] But it is not Saturday Night Fever.

[51:50] Yeah, if it only played Night Fever by BGCP, awesome.

[51:53] Yeah, exactly.

[51:54] Or what was the one when they stay alive?

[51:56] Wasn't that the one?

[51:57] Stain alive is in this, yes.

[52:00] There's like five major hits that are all in there.

[52:02] Yes, stay alive.

[52:04] More than a woman.

[52:06] How deep is your love?

[52:07] God, I'm always different.

[52:10] Oh, it's great.

[52:12] But this looks like John Travolta on the back glass.

[52:14] And it's night fever.

[52:16] And it's clearly trying to rip off Saturday Night Fever.

[52:19] Yes, it's literally the scene where he's doing the dance number in the club.

[52:24] Pretty neat, pretty neat.

[52:24] What do you think of this play field?

[52:26] This is a whole other adventure down here.

[52:29] Does not look like a big winner in my opinion.

[52:33] It's hard to tell.

[52:34] I see a lot of drop targets.

[52:38] I think those are drop targets.

[52:39] Or they standups.

[52:40] I can't tell in this picture.

[52:41] On the back row, those are drop targets.

[52:45] Okay.

[52:46] That's better.

[52:47] Yeah.

[52:48] But further up the field, these ones are standup targets.

[52:53] So it's not...

[52:55] It is wide open and it doesn't look like there's much to hit other than the drop targets

[52:59] in the back.

[53:00] And then there's like an orbit that kind of goes under a plastic.

[53:05] And then it kind of trickles out kind of in the middle here as I...

[53:09] It doesn't look as cool as a lot of the EMs we just talked about.

[53:12] Yeah, it's...

[53:14] I don't know what they're trying here.

[53:17] The spinner on the right side over here, it goes into these three lanes.

[53:22] Is it just a rip off of disco fever but without the...

[53:26] The banana flippers?

[53:27] I'm trying to remember what disco fever looks like.

[53:29] No, I think it's similar to disco fever.

[53:34] But no, they did not use the banana flippers on this.

[53:38] So what was really missing in the late 70s when it came to pinball machines?

[53:42] Well, by goodness, it was licensing.

[53:45] This is what took off licensing.

[53:48] Segasa registered a series of pinball backlasses with the trademark office in Spain.

[53:56] And they wanted to then build these machines in a similar fashion than they have with the

[54:02] Williams partnerships.

[54:04] These were KISS from 1979, Paragon from 78, Playboy, Playboy, Playboy from 78, then Time

[54:15] Warp, Stellar Wars from Williams.

[54:19] They also licensed hot hand and magic for all...

[54:22] I don't know why.

[54:23] For Stern.

[54:24] Okay.

[54:25] Genie from 79, pinball pool, which is friggin awesome from 79 and got from God.

[54:31] God, Liam.

[54:33] The Sharp Shooter, 1979 from Game Plan.

[54:38] None of those pins were actually produced, but they did register all of those trademarks.

[54:44] Hmm.

[54:45] Now, we'll never exactly know what Segasa's intentions were, because that's when the

[54:52] economic crisis of the early 80s started to affect the entire world, not just the United

[54:58] States.

[54:59] We're talking about the sort of the downturn in the 1980s with rapid inflation, the Reagan

[55:06] years, and of course, the spiral in video games.

[55:12] Too much garbage created video games that were garbage by 1984.

[55:19] Things had started to improve.

[55:21] And Spanish pinball was back, baby.

[55:24] Yeah.

[55:25] And they registered two Williams pinball machines, Comet and Space Shuttle.

[55:30] Yes.

[55:31] And why was Space Shuttle so important?

[55:32] That was a game that kept the lights on.

[55:34] It Williams.

[55:35] Yeah, Space Shuttle saved pinball.

[55:37] But it was really this game, the greatest game that Segasa ever made.

[55:44] Gamatron.

[55:45] I would like to have this one.

[55:49] This is one of, I know this is not my podcast, Slam Toe podcast, my other host, Bruce, his

[55:57] list.

[55:58] He would really like to have a Sonic Gamatron, because he has the regular Gamatron, Gamatron,

[56:04] Gamatron.

[56:05] But the back glass on this is superior.

[56:11] So much better.

[56:13] So it is a giant robot.

[56:16] He looks like, what's his face?

[56:17] Megatron.

[56:18] He's shooting lasers out of his face and his chest against people on like a moon base

[56:24] or a planet.

[56:26] And he's being attacked by like airplanes and guys and they're shooting rockets out of

[56:32] him.

[56:33] It looks awesome.

[56:35] But where did Gamatron come from?

[56:37] Where did this idea or concept appear?

[56:40] Well, it's start well.

[56:41] He technically was what pinstar?

[56:44] It was Gary Stern's company pinstar.

[56:47] They did a different version, basically a conventional size version of flight 2000.

[56:54] So flight 2000 was a wide body.

[56:56] Yep.

[56:57] And the wide body kind of made it a little floaty.

[57:00] No, it still plays fast.

[57:02] It's a Stern.

[57:03] Yeah, but it's like a wide body is in general or just the ball just lumbars around.

[57:09] Disagree.

[57:10] Place some cheetah.

[57:11] I can't endorse these views.

[57:14] So what they've done is pinstar the sort of the re-themed company what they did is they

[57:20] made like a kit and you could replace.

[57:24] I think it was like a bali game.

[57:26] Yeah, the idea was you would put it in like an old bali game that wasn't making money

[57:31] anymore.

[57:32] You put this thing in there.

[57:33] New game, half the price.

[57:34] New game, yep, half the price.

[57:36] Exactly.

[57:37] And it has a really cool lock mechanism on the left side where you shoot it up and it locks

[57:41] a ball from the wall.

[57:42] The ball locker.

[57:43] And then it has drop targets lined up one through five and then has a spinner on the

[57:48] right side with sweepable drop targets after that spinner.

[57:53] Yep.

[57:54] What they did was they took that wide body design and they squished it into a standard

[57:58] size pinball machine.

[58:00] This rather than an upgrade kit, Sonic made it as a standalone pin.

[58:07] So it wasn't a kit you bought.

[58:08] This was actually from the factory, but it has a weird head because we're now into solid

[58:15] state.

[58:17] And instead of putting the the score displays in the back glass through like a little window,

[58:23] they've put them below the back glass almost like a modern stern or you know, most modern

[58:30] pinball machines today where you've got a full back glass and then the score unit underneath

[58:35] or an LCD screen in today's world.

[58:37] Yeah, it's a lot like the, what was it called?

[58:41] The the LE models that Valley did that were just rapid fire cabinets.

[58:45] Yeah.

[58:46] And they left over where they did the was it eight ball deluxe, LE and then Centaur, which

[58:52] they didn't call Ellie.

[58:53] They call it Centaur two for some reason, but it's very similar to that.

[58:57] Yeah.

[58:58] And and cabinet quality, questionable, but better.

[59:03] Well, I don't know if it's better, but they didn't bother with any art.

[59:06] It just says sonic on the side.

[59:08] Yeah.

[59:09] This was kind of like a they dove back in to they dove back into pinball, right?

[59:17] Because things had started to kind of relax and it wasn't quite as bad in the recessionary

[59:21] times, but they just they just didn't get their footing again.

[59:26] So 1987 poll position, it has nothing to do with the video game.

[59:32] Other than it's about racing, yeah, F1.

[59:35] Very cool.

[59:36] Of course, F1 was much bigger in the European market.

[59:39] Oh, yeah.

[59:40] Then it then it was in the North American market.

[59:42] Again, forced perspective look.

[59:45] You're looking down on race track.

[59:48] They've added some ramps because you know, to be alive in the 1980s, you got to have

[59:53] ramps, right?

[59:54] The interesting thing is when they came back to make the solid state games, they changed

[01:00:00] their pop up or caps.

[01:00:02] These to be just like they looked a lot like the Williams ones and their regular size.

[01:00:08] These look more like the playmatic ones that they've just big squares.

[01:00:12] Yeah, they're probably buying them from the same manufacturer to reduce cost.

[01:00:16] I really like the ramp on the right side.

[01:00:18] You shoot the ramp.

[01:00:19] It goes through a wire form and then into almost like a left out lane that then crosses over

[01:00:26] into the in lane.

[01:00:28] It looks like a really cool, repeatable shot.

[01:00:31] And Mar-Burl, if you're into cigarettes, we got it right on the right sling.

[01:00:34] You're all set for you.

[01:00:36] Yes.

[01:00:37] Probably wouldn't see that on the US game.

[01:00:39] Smokey gets good for you.

[01:00:41] Yeah, it's pretty nuts.

[01:00:43] It's great art as well, right?

[01:00:45] Like, the back glass kind of went with that got-leab photo realistic.

[01:00:49] Actually, yeah.

[01:00:50] Actually, it looks like the Mario and Dready one.

[01:00:54] Actually.

[01:00:55] Yeah.

[01:00:56] It does.

[01:00:58] But I like, I got to play this at pastimes arcade.

[01:01:01] I never played it before.

[01:01:03] I like, God, this is pretty good.

[01:01:05] Like, who did this?

[01:01:06] Oh, Sonic.

[01:01:07] Sonic was still around.

[01:01:08] That's what I said.

[01:01:09] Yeah, exactly.

[01:01:10] Now, I mean, by 1988, leadership had changed at Sigasa and they started to kind of waver

[01:01:19] on the fact that they thought pinball was still profitable.

[01:01:22] Now, you've noticed throughout this episode, if you're listening, that we haven't

[01:01:27] mentioned any of the sales numbers.

[01:01:30] We don't- because they didn't announce any of the sales numbers like they sort of did

[01:01:34] with Williams or Balli in the 1970s and 80s.

[01:01:38] So we don't know how many they actually sold.

[01:01:41] So for us to say, oh, they weren't selling enough pinball machines or why would they close

[01:01:45] down?

[01:01:46] They were selling so many.

[01:01:47] We just don't know.

[01:01:48] But the leadership decided to give it one more kick at the can and they licensed laser

[01:01:53] war from Dad to East and they were going to adapt it to the Spanish playing style and

[01:01:59] have some of the components replaced.

[01:02:01] But as they were working on that pin, leadership basically decided, you know what, we're done

[01:02:06] here.

[01:02:07] Let's move on.

[01:02:08] And that, my friend, was the death of Sigasa Sonic.

[01:02:13] Oh.

[01:02:14] I wonder how much Gary Stern knows about them because I figure they had to have licensed

[01:02:18] out his thing for Gamatron and then he starts data east and then they're going to

[01:02:23] do a data east game.

[01:02:25] So they must have some kind of relationship.

[01:02:27] There's more to this story, I think.

[01:02:29] Yeah.

[01:02:30] There's more to that.

[01:02:31] So if you've got any other additional information floating around, silver ball chronicles at gmail.com,

[01:02:37] I would love to add it to our next episode or if we're doing like a playmatic episode

[01:02:42] or something like that, maybe I'll tack it on in there.

[01:02:45] So here's a tidbit.

[01:02:46] So in my prospector, my prospector still had the original Goody bag in it.

[01:02:52] Oh, weird.

[01:02:53] And what's even weird?

[01:02:54] Extra plastics and stuff.

[01:02:55] You have the bag there when it came in.

[01:02:57] It didn't actually have any of the stuff in there, but it was, it just says on it, Sega.

[01:03:04] But in the, in the Sagusa font.

[01:03:06] So talk about confusion.

[01:03:07] You have the Sonic game.

[01:03:09] The Goody bags has Sega on it.

[01:03:12] That's so weird.

[01:03:13] Yes.

[01:03:14] So that's what I mean with this episode.

[01:03:16] It was so, it was so difficult to find the sources and what, what was when and who was

[01:03:22] where and I couldn't find any quotes.

[01:03:25] But I think in general, it turned out okay.

[01:03:28] If you think this episode was terrible, go back and listen to the bingo one.

[01:03:31] Oh, God.

[01:03:32] I want to know the relation between that Sonic and Sonic the Hedgehog because obviously it's

[01:03:37] the same, it's not the same company, but they're finessed by the same guy.

[01:03:42] You know, if, how did that end up happening?

[01:03:46] Because the one Sonic was around long before the other Sonic, but they have to be related.

[01:03:51] They have to be.

[01:03:52] Maybe, yeah.

[01:03:53] Where did they come up with?

[01:03:54] Was it Sonic based on sound or speed?

[01:03:57] Were they like, oh, we've, we've got this patent somewhere in the world or this trademark.

[01:04:01] We've got it.

[01:04:02] But they just sonnet the Hedgehog.

[01:04:03] You know, what do we call this?

[01:04:04] Well, our old pinball company that we help finance, they, hey, change their name to Sonic.

[01:04:09] So we'll use that.

[01:05:52] Especially a lot, lotteria.

[01:05:57] Uh, okay, that's not a more Italian than it did Spanish, but.

[01:06:03] Is he as pretty in real life as he is on television?

[01:06:08] His hair looks better than mine.

[01:06:10] Okay.

[01:06:11] Say that.

[01:06:12] Well, my hair is going.

[01:06:15] Going south.

[01:06:16] Not good.

[01:06:17] Uh oh.

[01:06:18] Uh oh.

[01:06:19] Not good.

[01:06:20] Not good.

[01:06:21] Not good.

[01:06:22] It's the Dodgers bullpen, man.

[01:06:26] Like you just can't get the bats.

[01:06:28] You can't get the bats going.

[01:06:30] The bats, bro.

[01:06:33] Congratulations, Blue Jays on the game seven win.

[01:06:36] Absolutely amazing.

[01:06:38] Just come, you know, bullpen, hitting offense, defense, they were just phenomenal in game

[01:06:44] seven.

[01:06:46] Don Mannyley finally gets his ring.

[01:06:52] See, this is what's going to happen is I'm just going to, I'm just going to cut in

[01:06:56] whoever wins tonight.

[01:06:57] So then it seems like we actually recorded this after.
