[00:00] The pinball network is online.

[00:07] Launching.

[00:08] Silver ball chronicles.

[00:15] I hear like a fan or something in the background, just FYI.

[00:18] Oh, that's my T. Okay.

[00:21] As long as you know that you'll hear that.

[00:23] I put a fan under my desk just to keep my crotch cold.

[00:27] I'll be recording.

[00:29] And your wife says it works great.

[00:31] No!

[00:33] Thank you.

[00:35] Thank you.

[00:36] Ladies and gentlemen, Ron Hallett.

[00:37] Thank you.

[00:38] You'll be here all weekend.

[00:39] Mm-hmm.

[00:40] Tip your way, Tristan.

[00:41] Try the Ville.

[00:42] That better be in the post show.

[00:44] Heh.

[00:57] Hello everyone.

[01:22] I'm David Dennis and this is Silver Ball Chronicles.

[01:25] A pinball history podcast.

[01:27] With me every month is my co-host.

[01:30] The most charming man in pinball.

[01:32] Ron.

[01:33] Pintastic bound Hallett.

[01:36] What's up Bella?

[01:37] Yo.

[01:38] You ready for Pintastic or what?

[01:40] Sorry.

[01:41] I'm ready.

[01:42] Are we the silver ball chronicles or just silver ball chronicles?

[01:45] What's the official name?

[01:46] I think it's just silver ball chronicles.

[01:48] Okay.

[01:49] But we can be the silver ball chronicles.

[01:50] I heard the lately and I didn't remember the the.

[01:52] Some people though have also said that we are on the pinball network.

[01:57] But I've also heard we're on the TPN network.

[02:00] So you know what?

[02:01] You can call us whatever you want.

[02:02] Hey, so we're on the TEP.

[02:04] That means we're on the pinball network.

[02:06] Yeah.

[02:07] The TPN network.

[02:08] That's my favorite one.

[02:09] Mm-hmm.

[02:10] And that's a shout out to Bruce Nightingale.

[02:12] Ah, yes.

[02:13] A word smith like no other.

[02:15] And if you want to hear his word smithing, check out my podcast.

[02:19] The slam tilt podcast.

[02:20] That's can be heard by weekly or weekly depending on whenever Bruce tells me we're recording.

[02:26] There you go.

[02:27] And I'll tell you we got that plug out in record time.

[02:31] Record time.

[02:32] Bruce will be happy.

[02:33] Woo.

[02:34] Looking good.

[02:35] Looking good.

[02:36] And I'm excited because Pintastic will be my first actual big pinball show.

[02:42] I'm going to America.

[02:44] Jumping in the car with my beautiful wife.

[02:47] We are going to zip on down.

[02:50] Probably going to swing into Albany, New York.

[02:53] We said it right.

[02:55] Yes, right.

[02:56] I did hesitate because I had to say it again in my head.

[02:59] I don't live in Albany, but that's good.

[03:01] There you go.

[03:02] I'm going.

[03:03] So we're going to zip on over there.

[03:05] I'm going to go to level zero.

[03:07] I'm going to play some of the greatest ballet Williams of all time in the greatest shape.

[03:13] I've heard.

[03:14] Going to see some of those classic stirons.

[03:16] Those broken porches, as you call them.

[03:19] And you'll see a data east game.

[03:21] Oh, the topic of today.

[03:23] Because you have a Robocop.

[03:25] No, I have a lethal weapon three.

[03:27] I have the greatest data east game ever made.

[03:30] Which we won't be getting to in this episode.

[03:32] Yeah, as I edited it up this episode, Ron, it took a path.

[03:37] I was not expecting.

[03:38] And it was a lot more content than I had expected in the earlier years of data east.

[03:42] So other than that, we're just sort of waiting for Jersey Jax every two year release for their pinball machine.

[03:52] And Stern is still in a holding pattern.

[03:55] So there's not much going on in the hobby itself, but we are excited nonetheless.

[04:00] You can swing on over to Facebook.com slash silver ball Chronicles to check us out and chat with us.

[04:07] We've had a little more engagement this month in the podcast because I wanted to work with some of our listeners to get some of their quotes for the episode.

[04:16] But you can also swing on over to the trip pinball promoters database over at this week in pinball.com.

[04:22] There you can find all kinds of pinball content, including other podcasts, Twitch streams and YouTube channels all in one place.

[04:29] Take a moment and leave us a five star review so more people can find us there.

[04:34] Or in your pod catcher if it's Google podcasts or Apple podcasts or Stitcher or whatever you're using.

[04:41] I don't even know if Stitcher is a thing.

[04:43] Just leave us a five star review that way.

[04:45] More people can find our content.

[04:48] Ron, we've got some awesome quotes over on our Facebook page about our last episode.

[04:54] Okay, you get me these names. That is Zuzza says, I've been checking every day for like two weeks for an episode.

[05:01] So glad it's here. Love the work you put into the show.

[05:04] Yeah, Garrett Fuller says, friggin love the show. Great stuff.

[05:09] And Chris Vaughn says, can't wait to hear this. You guys are Ace Legends.

[05:14] Ace Legends. I don't even know what that means.

[05:17] I don't know what that means because either it sounds good.

[05:19] Yeah. The A is capitalized in A, so that's got to be good.

[05:22] Now, did you think you would ever be called an Ace legend on any other podcast besides the slam tilt podcast?

[05:29] No, no, not at all.

[05:32] Huh. Well, Chris, Garrett and Thaddeus, if you're looking for a way to cover up your hairy chests, two shirts is a great way.

[05:43] Swing on over to silverballswag.com and you can click on our store.

[05:49] You can jump right in and purchase a silver ball chronicles shirt.

[05:53] We get a kickback ever so small, but a kickback nonetheless.

[05:57] And Ron gets to inflate his ego even more with having his name on your chest.

[06:03] Even if you don't have a hairy chest, feel free to get the shirt.

[06:06] As you know, we always take our corrections in our mailbag at silverball chronicles at gmail.com.

[06:13] You can also send us comments, feedback, other things that way.

[06:18] We'll also take that feedback and information from our Facebook page.

[06:23] Ian, a Canadian pinballer from Ontario says, I was a little disappointed.

[06:28] Jimmy Liphen was mostly reduced to some guy on Pinside in our last podcast run, although accurately that he is just some guy on Pinside, he has been involved in so much of the boutique and homebrew scene.

[06:43] Yet I know almost nothing about him.

[06:46] I was hoping to learn more.

[06:48] Oh well, maybe when you do your boutique episode, Ron, do you know lots about Jimmy Liphen?

[06:54] I do not. I'm not really, I don't follow a lot of the boutique stuff.

[06:59] Now as I was editing up the episode, I did uncover a little more information about Jimmy or some guy on Pinside who did the code for magic girl.

[07:11] But I can't uncover all the sources, everything all the time.

[07:16] Yeah, that being said though, we did sort of reduce Jimmy to a guy on Pinside, even though he is quite engaged in that homebrew and boutique scene where you and I don't spend any time and have never heard of this person.

[07:30] There are plenty of but when we do a boutique episode or a smaller group homebrew episode, maybe we're going to leave that for when there's actually a larger scene and maybe some of those people who are watching this.

[07:40] And maybe some of those designers and programmers have actually worked at a bigger company or the company has become a big company.

[07:47] Perhaps then we'll go into a deeper dive.

[07:50] Yeah, what would that be? You'd have like a predator, a magic girl.

[07:56] I just think it a boutique homebrew games.

[07:58] Oh yeah, the Dutch pinball saga.

[08:00] Dutch pinball. You could have things like archer, you know, gets Keith L. when his job. You could have Sonic.

[08:08] Yeah, there's some content that's there. It's just I want to give those individuals that have designed those things more breadth.

[08:15] I want to give them more content to talk about as opposed to, hey, here's one person with one machine and then 12 years down the road if you were to listen to this podcast again, you'd be like, oh, that one person that did that one thing once.

[08:27] I'm looking for more breadth where a Keith L. when is a great example of that?

[08:31] Maybe we'll do like a young guns episode. How does that sound? Right? Like sort of the new up and comers.

[08:36] And then I can jam them all together in episode. Anyway, I'm just thinking out loud. We got some content that we can build there.

[08:41] Anything else you want to add, Ron, before we get underway?

[08:43] I'm ready for some data east or data east depending on how you say it. I know some people it's like it's it's data east because data is is data from start track.

[08:53] So you don't say it that way. Okay. We don't want to look dumb here, Ron.

[08:57] I do it every day works for me. It is often through failure that we learn and after the collapse of stern electronics, Gary Stern didn't give up.

[09:10] He collected himself over a year and then would work with Joe Kamenkao and Shelley Sachs on building data east pinball.

[09:20] Often the butt of jokes on quality, code depth and it's God awful artwork. Data east would become the only survivor of the 1990s pinball collapse and is now known as Stern pinball ink after a brief time as Sega pinball.

[09:39] This month we take some time to explore data east pinball in an episode that we call fake it, Tilia make it. And I want to say a big thanks to Mike win for helping us out on this episode.

[09:53] He collected some of the quotes. He did some searching and emailing with some of these primary sources and he was able to forward it off to us. So huge thanks to Mike.

[10:05] Let's add some of Mike's comments. Mike says on early data east, great layouts, great sounded music, interesting themes, terribly shallow rules.

[10:14] And that is really the theme I think of data east. They had a lot of really great bits to them, but it's always sort of the code that holds them back.

[10:25] It was always that piece that they really kind of suffered from, but we'll get deeper into that as we go through the podcast.

[10:32] But a lot of that code is more exploitable stuff. If you're just playing a game to enjoy it, I don't think it's that big a deal in my opinion.

[10:40] Yeah, the term is often overused or I mean I guess you could call it a cliche is close to the start button.

[10:48] There's lots of things that you can do that give you a lot of positive feedback really quickly, but when you get into running up big scores in the tournament world, not going to happen.

[11:00] Well, let's rewind back to the sort of the early 80s and the collapse of stern electronics. Your favorite pinball manufacturer isn't that correct?

[11:12] Oh, shutting it here right now as I read this.

[11:16] Hello, darkness, my old friend.

[11:19] So in 1980, 81, sales in pinball began to slide as coins moved to video games.

[11:27] So rather than sort of the explosion we saw in that 1977 to 81 range where pinball was just a dominator, people had learned that video games could get a little more play

[11:41] and tend to be a little more interesting and cheaper and they made more money.

[11:46] Absolutely. Stern moved to make some video games like Berserk and others and by 1983, Stern had become one of the many victims of the amusement industry economic shakeout.

[12:01] And that was mostly that all of a sudden pinball was getting less coin, which meant that arcade owners bought less of the pinball machines.

[12:10] So that sort of started a downward spiral.

[12:14] One of the other things that would happen by 1983 was that so much money was being put into video that a lot of the product that was coming out of there was garbage, isn't that right?

[12:24] There was a lot of video games, a lot of video games.

[12:28] And a lot of them, although easy to play were just terrible.

[12:34] There was a large scale recession by 1983 in the video game industry and that came from over saturation and quality issues which we spoke about.

[12:44] And to tie that into dollar amount in 1983, video games particularly in the arcade industry was a 3.2 billion dollar industry, which is outrageously huge by the 1980s, but by 1985 only two years later it was a hundred million dollar industry.

[13:06] So that is an epic bubble burst if I have ever seen one.

[13:10] So we did a whole episode on Stern Electronics which we were contractually obligated to do so you could pump up the value of your Stern Electronics games and your basement.

[13:20] Well I said I wouldn't join this podcast unless we did the Stern episode.

[13:23] That's right. So it was episode number two, which was right after our pilot episode.

[13:28] This one is a little bit rocky, but I think there's some pretty good work in there. It's called episode two. Stern Electronics, no not that Stern.

[13:36] Probably still your favorite episode.

[13:38] I don't listen any episodes. I can't tell you.

[13:42] That makes me sad. I listen to the bloopers at the end.

[13:45] I do all of this. I do this podcast for you and Bruce Knight and Gale. I don't do it for anybody.

[13:50] I listen to the bloopers at the end. That's all I listen to.

[13:52] Yeah.

[13:53] In 1985 Stern Electronics left the amusement industry all together. Gary Stern would declare bankruptcy over the whole deal.

[14:02] So the manufacturing machinery was all auctioned off and Stern Electronics worked with the bank to the bank.

[14:10] I'm going to quote the bank, the man to wind down its operations.

[14:16] One question that people always ask is what happened to Stern Electronics intellectual property or its IP?

[14:23] Who owns the Stern Electronics stuff?

[14:26] That also comes up a lot because you see companies make play fields for old Stern games and back glasses and they don't seem like they have to pay anyone unlike Bali or Williams.

[14:38] So who the heck owns it?

[14:40] The other thing is that Stern Pinball Inc. today is a totally separate company and they do not own any of the intellectual property from Stern Electronics.

[14:53] Well Gary Stern can shed some light on this.

[14:57] Gary says the bank foreclosed and the bank was in worse shape than we were. If you remember there was a banking crisis at the time.

[15:04] The interest rates had gone up to double digits at one point. So the assets were sold at a foreclosure sale.

[15:09] And I eventually bought the IP back from the buyer. So now my ex-wife and I own the old Stern IP.

[15:15] Gary Stern himself and his ex-wife, which sounds like a terrible arrangement,

[15:21] own the intellectual property to Stern Electronics.

[15:25] I have links in the show notes to all of our sources.

[15:29] This comes from Pinball News, Pinball Magazine Pinball Podcast over at Pinball News and Pinball Magazine's website.

[15:36] You can hear their monthly updates. This is from Gary Stern's 75th birthday celebration pinball podcast at Pinball Magazine Pinball News.

[15:46] And it's a gold mine when it comes to Gary because you can tell that Gary loves to talk shop.

[15:55] And this is an amazing episode. Jonathan Justin and Martin over on Pinball News Pinball Magazine Pinball Podcast are very, very good at interviewing.

[16:06] And I think they've done a stand up job to get some great content from Gary.

[16:10] So this is also why Stern Pinball Inc. or today's Stern was able to do Beatles, which was based on the Sea Witch layout.

[16:20] Because Gary personally owns the intellectual property and was allowing Stern Pinball Inc. to use the intellectual property from Stern Electronics.

[16:31] And they've also been able to do things like they put a Stargazer in the building on Ghostbusters because there was a Stargazer in the movie.

[16:38] If you play Deadpool in Deadpool's Game Room, there is a Sea Witch. I think there's a Quick Silver, a Flight 2000.

[16:46] There's a Berserk and a Frenzy next to each other. So yeah.

[16:50] All IP that was owned by Stern Electronics. So there you go.

[16:55] So now you can ask Gary if you can borrow some of his IP for your own play field.

[16:59] Well, since everyone seems to just do the play fields for that permission, I guess he just doesn't care.

[17:04] So why after the failure of Stern Electronics would Gary even stick around?

[17:09] Right? Like why would you, after you've put this much time into a company you've purchased Chicago Coin, you purchased a bunch of other smaller companies, a Malgamy to them in Stern Electronics, you've put your heart and your soul into it.

[17:21] And then it just all goes to crap because everything went to crap. Why would you stay? Why would you stick around?

[17:29] Well, Gary says, guys who love cars, manufacture cars. They love cars. They're not good to make one car and put it on a pedestal and look at it.

[17:38] They want to make, they want to manufacture that car. Sell it to people. Sell it to somebody in New York so that it gets driven, used and enjoyed.

[17:45] Then make money so they can design the next car. We love pinball machines. First and foremost, we're manufacturers.

[17:51] We want to design pinball so that we can make it sell it to people who can use them. Then we can design the next one.

[17:58] It just comes down to Gary Stern has a passion for manufacturing and a passion for pinball.

[18:05] This comes from a recommended if you like or R.I.Y.L podcast, which is a roundabout way where I found this one.

[18:12] And I found that quote in there because I thought it was pretty cool because it comes down to his passion as being a manufacturer, having a manufacturing line.

[18:20] All the excitement that comes from that. But then you're also creating something fun to play with.

[18:25] You know what my favorite Gary Stern quote is? What's this?

[18:28] This isn't a recent interview. They asked him, what do you think your legacy is?

[18:32] He basically said, I don't have a lot of care about legacy. I'm a businessman.

[18:37] Yeah. Yeah, he loves it.

[18:39] And as a business business person myself, I can totally understand why building and creating and getting excitement from boring things like business plans and what can I grow and build.

[18:52] I can totally understand what Gary's talking about.

[18:55] But a lot of the Stern electronics personnel, sort of the big brains behind the scenes, would eventually move to Gary's next venture, which was pinstar.

[19:05] This is something else. So what in a nutshell was pinstar, Ron?

[19:09] They were, it was Gary Stern's company and they made conversion kits.

[19:13] He was a big time manufacturer. Now he's moving into sort of small time manufacturing.

[19:18] I've included some of the links to the pinstar information in our show notes if you want to take a look at them.

[19:25] He was able to use a lot of the hairy Williams and Steve Kirk information on the IP that was used in his new venture.

[19:36] The idea was that you could take an old pin and convert it into a new pin by replacing the play field and adding some decals.

[19:44] The most important one is Gamatron.

[19:48] Yeah, thinking only did two conversion kits and Gamatron is the one that most people would remember.

[19:54] There was one called Walk the Ball, which was art only. It was never actually released.

[19:59] Gamatron is the only one that actually had any volume.

[20:02] Yeah, I have seen the other one though. The other conversion kit.

[20:05] Bullseye. Yeah.

[20:07] And in Gamatron, this is a space robot war theme.

[20:11] It is from December of 1985, which was then more or less manufactured in 1986.

[20:17] It is a Stern slash ballet board set, standard body pin.

[20:21] So you would take your old ballet and you would put this conversion kit in it.

[20:25] It sold 1,201 units.

[20:29] The design was hairy Williams and Steve Kirk, art by Shamus McLaughlin and software by Bill Futzenruder.

[20:36] Before we get into the finer details, why would one use a conversion kit rather than just buying a new pin?

[20:46] Well, in theory, it is cheaper. That does something.

[20:50] It is cheaper. You can repurpose a game just by replacing the play field.

[20:55] It becomes a new game. And in theory, you can make money off this new game at minimal cost.

[21:00] Pinball is very, very much and especially at this time, a commodity.

[21:05] Right? The technology is changing. The layouts are getting more intricate.

[21:10] You are adding mechanics to it. You are adding sound to it.

[21:13] You are changing to a DMD, to a screen, scoring relays, to a 6 digit, to 8 digit, to a million scores.

[21:20] Things are always evolving. So it becomes a bit of a commodity where you just throw it out or sell it off and buy another one.

[21:27] So in this tough time in the early and mid-80s, how do we reduce the cost to replace it?

[21:34] And that was kind of the idea.

[21:36] The manufacturing flyer was actually says fits most standard four-player,

[21:43] Bally manufacturing corporation pinballs.

[21:46] A subsequent reporter told IPDB that this kit would not actually fit stern games without a modification.

[21:53] So interestingly enough, it had to specifically be a Bally four-player game.

[21:58] And it couldn't just take a stern game even though they're, I mean, cousins, pinstar and stern electronics.

[22:05] The height of the replacement Plexiglass back glass you would get with the kit was too tall to fit in a stern back box.

[22:11] And the display placement was different because stern did not use a standard display location.

[22:19] But if you see game like stars or memory lane, where the displays are just in really bizarre positions.

[22:26] They just sort of move them around to fit the art as opposed to make the art fit the positions.

[22:31] Yeah, so it becomes a bit of an issue there.

[22:34] And of course, this is the Bally slash stern board set.

[22:37] You know, that is a whole other story where Gary Stern and the stern electronics team would take and clone the Bally board set and sort of make their own version.

[22:49] Now, pinstar did have a daughter board, which is like an extra board onto the side where you would kind of attach it to the existing board.

[22:57] And you plug into the CPU socket, which would add some of the content.

[23:01] Now, if you actually compared the software for Gammatron and the software for stern electronics flight 2000, you would notice that it is a hundred percent identical.

[23:14] And if you look at the, because the play field is identical, the play field is basically a narrow body version of flight 2000.

[23:22] Yeah, so flight 2000 was that that stern wide body body.

[23:25] It was thicker and wider. It wasn't quite as wide as the Bally Williams, but it was wider.

[23:30] Yeah, and the thing is, I know a lot of people who prefer Gammatron, they think it plays better than flight 2000.

[23:37] So it plays faster, right? Not as, not as quote unquote floaty.

[23:40] Uh, it's flight 2000s and old stern. It plays fast. All sterns work fast. But yeah, a lot of people prefer this layout.

[23:48] There's also rumors. I've heard for years that the actual flight 2000 play field was more of a Steve Kirk design than a Harry Williams design to go with, which I, I've heard that from multiple places.

[24:03] So I, that's interesting to me. I'd like to know the end. You know, yeah, through my research, Steve Kirk actually worked a lot to refine the flight 2000 into the Gammatron.

[24:15] So that would say that he had some familiarity with the geometry already.

[24:20] Yeah, his name is on the, on Gammatron. I mean, it's, he's considered the designer based off of the Harry Williams play field.

[24:29] When you, when you look at this play field, it is, it is clearly flight 2000. Yep.

[24:34] It has the stand up targets. It has the stepper ball lock on the left side.

[24:39] It has the sweepable drop targets through the spinner on the right side, the single pop bumper. Where's the stand up targets? I only see one.

[24:48] Do you mean drop targets? The drop targets. Yes, of course. Actually, I think there is a stand up on the left too. There's one here and here. There's two.

[24:54] Yeah, there's two, two on the left just above the slingshots. So I'm wrong. There you go.

[25:01] But yeah, it plays exactly like flight 2000, except there's no speech. One of the coolest parts of flight 2000, no speech.

[25:08] No speech. Wow. Now Bruce Nightingale from the slam tilt podcast.

[25:14] He also has one or two of these, right? One or one and a half, something like that.

[25:20] So person who owns more half pinball machines than I have ever seen. Also, another tie back to the Stern electronics piece is it has the wow WOW down on the bottom,

[25:30] which is basically the Stern electronics version of a special. So they're really, you know, it's obviously the same company to the point of they're using pretty much the same play field layout and a lot of the same terminology.

[25:46] So you can tell that they that Gary just wants to continue making fun and continue manufacturing regardless of his other company going bust.

[25:55] Do you remember Sonic at the hedgehog the manufacturer? Yes. The Spanish company. No for games like Prospector Mars track.

[26:05] They were around into the 80s and they made electronic games and one of the games that they did.

[26:11] There was actually conversion kit for gamma tron like a sonic version. So you wait a second. So you would have a ballie. You convert it to gamma tron.

[26:20] And then you take gamma tron and convert it to the sonic. Now there's a sonic gamma tron version. Oh very good. Okay. Much cooler arc that backlash is awesome.

[26:32] I don't know the backlash on this one is pretty awesome. Look at the one for it. It pales in comparison to the sonic backlash. What was it called? It's called gamma tron. If you just look at gamma tron and IPDB, which is the internet pinball database.

[26:45] We should mention that when we keep saying the initials of people like what the hell does that mean? Yeah, the backlash is cooler. So the backlash of the original one is like a robot.

[26:56] He's like almost like a standing there. He's shooting people on buildings. It's it looks very mushy. It's kind of clay looking. It's not quite right.

[27:08] The sonic version is very detailed and really, really neat. It's similar, but it's just more detailed. And their cabin is completely different. They have like the digital display there below the backlash.

[27:21] I've actually played one of these. They had one at expo one year. It's got one of those sweet square pop umper. Yeah, and it's got its own custom board said and stuff. So if it broke, you'd probably be screwed. But yeah. So this is the better gamma tron.

[27:36] It plays exactly the same. Okay. So if it's if art is your thing, they only made 1200 of these. So they're not really easy to find. So if you can find somebody who owns a half a one.

[27:46] You know, I would take advantage of that. We got to get into the flyer. This is this is the saddest flyer I have ever seen. It is very sad. It's basically blue. There's no color to it at all. It's obviously done on the cheap.

[27:59] It's yeah, it's just like a single page white paper crappy looking photo. Gamma Tron trademark designed to appeal to today's player by Harry Williams and Steve Kirk. Exciting multi ball chain reaction launching chamber.

[28:16] So they've renamed the ball walker the multi ball chain reaction launching chamber. It does sound cooler, doesn't it? It does sound pretty cool. It has high action components.

[28:28] What that means I guess that means it's it's stuff is closer together and cover your ears for this one. All parts made in America by current manufacturers of pinball machines and components kit includes wired play field ready to install a prom change and sound board, which I mean it didn't have speech. No new back glass and complete set of decals. All the necessary cables and hardware. It's comparative earnings at one half the investment. That was actually it was all in capitals.

[28:57] Yeah easy conversion. You don't even need a soldering iron. Although that is that that to meet that appeals to me.

[29:04] So I don't think that appeals to me. So I don't think I'm okay at that stuff if I have to like fix a coil or something like that. But if I got to get into something more serious than that, I can do it. It's terrible. It gives me a lot of stress. So that's a big deal.

[29:17] And honestly, this would be a great like if you had say lost world like why would you have that but lost world old Valley. I hate that game. Somebody somebody had to buy that piece of garbage.

[29:27] They sold a ton of them though, but you can swap that play field out and put gamutron in and boom you actually have a good game.

[29:33] There you go. And gamutron. Very good game. I've been told I've never played one. It's tough to find them. Hopefully there's one at fantastic.

[29:42] Prusite Gale. After that, we get into their second game bullseye 301. And when you see bullseye 301, what does that say to you Ron?

[29:52] Darts. Darts, which I didn't know that until I looked it up. I'm like that's a word name for a game.

[29:58] This was actually managed by a company called Grand Electronics. So it wasn't actually built by pinstar. It wasn't actually released by them.

[30:08] So this company Grand Electronics is still around in Illinois. They make go carts and go cart parts. That's so cool.

[30:17] But not pinball related. This would actually be the only pinball game that Grand would actually make.

[30:25] 301 bullseye is a competitive darts themed pinball game. Perfect for the bar. I think is what the idea behind darts was.

[30:35] It's from May of 86. It uses again the Stern and Valley board set with your conversion kit of a standard body.

[30:42] The only manufacturer is 150 units. We don't know who designed it. We don't know who they are. And we don't know who did the software.

[30:49] This is like a get it done pinball machine. This was like rushed. This was like sell it, build it, get it done, and then just be just that's it.

[30:57] Break even 150 units right. Get out of the game. Very unusual. Why do you think of that is?

[31:02] I know I've only seen one ever and that was at Alan Town and it wasn't actually installed in a game.

[31:09] It's just like oh so Alan Town is the pinball swap meat is basically what it is right where people have their crap laying on the outside of their SUV.

[31:18] Alan Town, Pennsylvania like every spring and I actually saw one of these the 301 bullseye like wow it exists.

[31:25] Weird. You should have bought that it'd be worth millions. I don't think so.

[31:29] It has a dart board in the middle of the play field as you would as you would expect it to surprise.

[31:34] It has a glass of wine and a glass of beer on the plastics on the left or right side.

[31:39] Probably should have cigarettes in it if it wanted to be authentic. Yeah that's right. And everything would have to look very like Britishy and like Haggard.

[31:47] Okay. Someone's been watching Darts on TV I see.

[31:50] And the ones are playing the Darts. Yes. It's got four drop targets in the middle kind of on an angle and then a spinner in the middle which looks actually kind of fun.

[31:57] But that's kind of it. It's pretty bad. Pretty bad game. My assumption.

[32:02] I like how you assume it's a bad game and you've never played it. You could play it and be like oh my god I found my game.

[32:08] This is it. This could be it. Yes. You know you could be on target. That's what the flyer says. Of course it does.

[32:15] Ben ball conversion kit 301 bulls eye scores like today's most popular street location game. Darts and has all the play appeal of the ever popular pinball game.

[32:27] Maximize the income of your older ball the electronic pin balls by retrofitting them with a 301 bulls eye conversion kit from grand products incorporated. Wow.

[32:37] Also black and white picture. Yeah. And when they have when they put back glass is two words which you normally don't see on a pinball flyer.

[32:46] Like if you look at the gamutron one I'm pretty sure it says like one word. That's like if you see like hey John Papadouk is designing something that's a big red flag.

[32:54] It's just when you see certain words a certain way they're probably not really pinball people.

[33:00] I would guess that this game was started and developed by pinstar by Gary and stern in the team there. Then they moved on to another project and basically just got rid of this to somebody who could make some money.

[33:12] I think that's basically what it was. It's it's unusual. Check it out on the on the IPDB. But I mean it's I mean it's probably not worth your time to look at it.

[33:21] Well the question is do these conversion kits work. Do they make any money? It seems like a super smart idea. Doesn't it? You've got a pinball machine.

[33:28] You buy a play field of back glass and some stickers and you got a whole other pinball machine. You don't have to buy the cabinet. You don't have to buy the boards.

[33:35] You don't have to it seems like a super smart idea except that Gary Stern says. I'm the guy that proved a conversion kit doesn't work.

[33:45] I was between companies and I made a play field. I manufactured these and I'd sell the play field as a kit with decals.

[33:51] The problem was the economics didn't work. You'd be better off training in your game and buying a high speed by Steve Richie than converting an old badly game and putting my conversion play field in it. Now you have a worthless game.

[34:02] Exactly. You've got all the parts. You got all the garbage. And you've got another pin which sort of has yesterday's technology. It's a new play field. It's a new game.

[34:13] But it's still based on the previous technology, the previous code, the previous board sets. And as we've seen, especially now when we get into system 11, you know that hockey stick of development and complexity of pinball machines is on an upward swing.

[34:27] He makes a good argument. Now at the time Gary was also working with a company called Video Vending where he was developing a VHS tape rental machine.

[34:39] You remember VHS? Terrible. Terrible. Hey, it was awesome. You could watch stuff on your TV movies and stuff at your leisure. It's the first time you could do that.

[34:51] Yeah, you didn't even have to wear pants. A very important person that is really difficult to find information about is a person named Shelley Sachs.

[35:02] And she's still at Stern to this day. Still at Stern today. She's been with Gary Stern since like 1980. I talked to her last year. She called me about my Jurassic Park. Why would she call you?

[35:13] The shippers can't get a hold of you. You need to answer your phone. Really? I find that awesome that you spoke to Shelley Sachs. She called you over something as mundane as answer to your damn phone, Ron.

[35:23] Well, because when I see numbers, I don't recognize I don't answer the phone and no one told me that it was ready or that FedEx would be calling me. So yeah, that's that's the one that FedEx eventually just left the thing in my driveway.

[35:35] So what you're saying is this is your fault. So what I'm saying is it didn't matter anyway. They still screwed up with Shelley. She is also known as a jack of all trades. She has had many hats, continues to wear many hats.

[35:48] And is one of the major factors in why Stern, Data East, Sega and today's Stern have been as successful as they are. Gary's right hand woman. Is that correct? That is correct.

[36:02] I voted in the 2021 pinball industry awards for the legacy award for Shelley Sachs. She is one of the most unknown biggest deals in pinball ever. Everybody knows the designers. Everybody knows the coders. Everybody knows Gary and Joe Cam and cow and all these guys who made a lot of money back in the day.

[36:27] But very few people know about the awesomeness of Shelley Sachs. She probably wants to remain unknown. So you should stop mentioning her. Yes. Gary and this unknown person would work in Gary's townhome and they put together a business plan for a new pinball manufacturing company.

[36:47] This is about 1986. So probably had Don Johnson suit jacket on right. Shelley probably had really big super teased up hair, but they needed somebody else to tie the trio together.

[37:06] Fill up Michael Thomas. No, I'm sorry. You can't have a stool with only two legs. Wow. Okay. You got to bring in Joe Cam and cow. Now Joe Cam and cow is one of the biggest names in pinball. And he's one of those right place, right time individuals in pinball. We've spoke about a few of those over the years. Eugene Jarvis is a great example of right place, right time all the time. Very tomorrow. He always knows where to go before anyone else.

[37:36] He always in the right place in the right time. So they are where they are today because they were in the right place at the right time. But Joe Cam and cow specifically Joe has this amazing work ethic. And he is a positive personality. He is a straight shooter. There's no BS with Joe kind of and his business acumen is almost second to none.

[38:02] That is what has propelled Joe to the heights that he is at now. Have you met him? Uh, no. I've interacted with him several times, but I don't get him drunk because at the Gary Stern row. So you got drunk and then he started yelling at people at the bar in the next room to shut up.

[38:22] That's a that's the story I remember. And he is very influential in pinball just ask him. He'll tell you and it'll let you know how they beat Williams in the end because Williams went out of business. So he is very interesting person. He's a humble. He's a humble guy. Yeah, he's that's what you call him Joe Cam and cow grew up in Maryland. His father worked as a commercial distributor called general vending. And he would eventually also work for Bali. Joe attended Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts with where?

[38:52] Business message. She says message to sits. That's where fantastic is you're saying it wrong. Massachusetts message. She sits the spirit of Massachusetts. It's the spirit of America. Come on. Try again.

[39:04] He graduated with a business and political science degree. Fail. You didn't say it again. Joe started a game development business called logical highs. And he would join Williams electronics where he would learn the ropes of pinball.

[39:20] His first game was the smash hit defender. No, it wasn't a smash hit. It was the pinball.

[39:29] In 1984, he would help out with space shuttle. And according to Joe Cam and cow saved pinball.

[39:38] More on that in the Barry Ausler saves pinball episode that you can see in our archives. So we got over to Silverball Chronicles.com. All the episodes are listed there.

[39:48] And if you ever see a defender at a pinball show, play it. It's a super cool game. You hardly ever see him.

[39:54] Joe would leave Williams soon after space shuttle because of various conflicts with folk in there. He would briefly join a company called Game Plan where he would meet Gary Stern.

[40:08] Joe Cam and cow was brought on board as the senior vice president of game design at Data East in October of 1986, where he would begin building relationships among some influential license holders.

[40:24] This would be Data East's differentiating factor and lead to amazing license games like back to the future. Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Hook, The Simpsons, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[40:40] There was also Batman and the NFL license to name a few after leaving Sega in 1999. Joe would join I GT and he would make slot machines and gambling technology.

[40:54] He gave slots a massive shot in the arm by extensively using licensed themes, obviously something he learned from pinball. Of course, he could also leverage all of the relationships he had while working in licensing at Data East.

[41:09] He was inducted into the pinball Hall of Fame at Expo in 2004. It was there. It was exciting. Did you shed a tear?

[41:16] I was sitting at the same table as Steve Richie, so I was marking out over that. That's so cool. Now to Joe tell everybody in the crowd how Data East beat Williams.

[41:26] You know, he probably did, but I don't remember. In 2007, Joe co-founded Spooky Cool Labs, a small part of Zingha, which pioneered mobile cell phone games.

[41:38] Have you ever heard of Farmville, Ron? No. That was a huge deal when it came to mobile gaming and Facebook gaming.

[41:45] They're the ones that popularized the idea of loot boxes and those stupid little diamonds you have to collect to keep playing. They did that.

[41:53] Zingha was recently acquired by Take Two Interactive. They own Rockstar Games. Ron, you've played Grand Theft Auto. No.

[42:02] I know of it, but I know what it is, yes.

[42:04] That is one of the properties that Rockstar Games owns.

[42:09] I would assume over these series of acquisitions, Joe Kamenkow was given a boatload of money and stock in some pretty big high-profile companies.

[42:21] Joe is currently the chief innovation officer at Aristocrat Leisure Limited in Las Vegas, which is a gaming solutions company,

[42:31] which means they make gambling machines in Las Vegas.

[42:34] They are licensed in 300 jurisdictions, so that would be like provinces and countries and states, and have over 7,000 worldwide employees.

[42:45] This is a big company.

[42:48] But most importantly, Ron, Joe has a replica Batman 66 Batmobile and an Aston Martin DB5 like James Bond.

[42:59] Oh, I can gold finger.

[43:00] All right.

[43:01] I have also heard that he is having this DB5 modified to have all of the electronics and toys seen in gold finger.

[43:10] Yeah, so that would be what? The bulletproof glass, the bulletproof thing that comes up, oil slick, machine guns, the ejector seat, at least the button for it.

[43:22] Joe Kamenkow and I can be best friends if Joe is listing this, which he is not.

[43:28] I would love to hang out with Joe.

[43:30] We could do cool things together.

[43:32] We could talk James Bond, because sitting right in front of me is a 1964 car and driver ad for an Aston Martin DB5.

[43:42] It says, wings and propeller are optional.

[43:45] I think that if you really want a James Bond pinball machine, you're probably going to get your wish sooner than later.

[43:51] Joe Kamenkow, I'd like to be your best friend.

[43:53] So starting, uh, data east, let's, let's wind it back now.

[43:57] Now we know who Joe Kamenkow is.

[43:58] Let's wind it back again to 1986.

[44:02] We're seeing a resurgence in pinball at this time, aren't we?

[44:05] We got high speed.

[44:07] It's out. It's kicking butt.

[44:08] We got pinbott.

[44:10] Let's see, would that have been out yet?

[44:11] Maybe not.

[44:12] Let's pretend it was.

[44:13] Uh, yes, we're seeing pinballs coming back, maybe coming back.

[44:17] Speech is back.

[44:18] Speech is back.

[44:19] We got multi-ball.

[44:20] We got nice plastic ramps.

[44:22] Yeah, ramps are coming around now.

[44:23] That's pretty cool.

[44:25] By November of 1986, Joe and Gary would start their new company.

[44:31] But they would need financial backing.

[44:35] So they approached a few video game manufacturers like Konomi.

[44:40] Is it Konomi or Konomi?

[44:42] Konomi?

[44:43] That was Konomi.

[44:44] That could be Konomi.

[44:45] Well, their proposal was rejected.

[44:47] Yeah, they didn't, they didn't want to get into that game.

[44:49] They were more, you know, interested in making like the Metal Gear Solid games.

[44:55] They were also interested now in like fitness bars and like weird day spas in Japan.

[45:03] They didn't want to do pinball.

[45:04] That would just be silly.

[45:05] Once your proposal is rejected, you often feel pretty bad.

[45:10] But man, you fake it till you make it and you keep grinding and you go to find somebody else.

[45:18] So they found a much more receptive audience in a company called Data East.

[45:23] And they were interested in expanding beyond video games.

[45:27] Oh, you're going to make me say this.

[45:28] I, Mr. Fuku-da Fuku-da.

[45:33] Okay, hopefully I said this right.

[45:34] So this is from Gary Stern.

[45:36] I had a business plan with the help of Ed Pellegrini.

[45:39] I approached them.

[45:40] I eat Data East.

[45:41] In fact, Mr. Fuku-da, hopefully I said that right.

[45:45] Tetsu-tetsu Fuku-da, founder of Data East, came to my townhouse.

[45:50] Kamikail, Shelley and I, we had two deaths next to each other over there.

[45:55] And Kamikail and I made the presentation.

[45:57] And we intrigued them into investing in this pinball company.

[46:01] Oh, so there you go.

[46:02] You had a big, big time influential person, Mr. Fuku-da.

[46:08] That's a, you know, that's a big time meeting.

[46:10] But it's also kind of interesting that they're not in a fancy boardroom.

[46:14] They're not in a big office.

[46:16] They're literally in Gary's townhouse, which I'm sure is probably pretty nice.

[46:20] Well, what can you tell me about Data East?

[46:23] Ah, okay.

[46:24] So I knew about Data East, but I didn't know about

[46:28] with sort of air quotes Data East.

[46:31] So Data East is a Japanese video game maker and an electronic engineering company.

[46:37] The company operated from 1976 to 2003.

[46:41] And they released over 150 video game titles,

[46:44] including their first smash hit burger time in 1982.

[46:48] Really?

[46:49] Burger time is, burger time is Bali Midway.

[46:51] So maybe they designed it in Bali Midway, manufactured it.

[46:55] Yes.

[46:56] That is, that is the roundabout way.

[46:58] So when it comes to video games, video games are really weird

[47:02] as to who manufactures it, who designed the game,

[47:06] who actually made the game, who has the rights in North America to sell the game,

[47:10] who has the rights in Europe to sell the game,

[47:12] typically in Japan.

[47:13] They would make the cabinets in Japan, but they were different than the ones they made here.

[47:17] I think they were generally smaller.

[47:19] Video games are a mess when you're trying to figure who owns what and who manages what,

[47:24] unless you have a massive like spider,

[47:27] charts, web tree to try to figure that stuff out.

[47:31] But they were also very well known for 1984's Karate champ,

[47:37] Kung Fu Master,

[47:38] Commando from 1985.

[47:40] Now those three titles push data east to the forefront in the coin op industry

[47:46] in the mid 1980's.

[47:48] Did you know I'm the Karate champ champ?

[47:49] Or it used to be?

[47:50] In what?

[47:51] I was a world record holder in Karate champ for really?

[47:54] Eight years, like 2010 to a few years ago.

[48:00] Some of Chicago beat my score.

[48:02] Was that like a can't, was that like a Guinness book of world records?

[48:06] That's a twin galaxy's thing.

[48:07] That's so cool.

[48:09] Did you get like a little, a little push?

[48:10] I, I still have a plaque.

[48:12] You'll be able to see the plaque when you're here at level zero.

[48:16] I'm going to take a picture with the plaque.

[48:17] That's a big deal.

[48:19] Those three games were also the highest grossing games of 1985,

[48:24] and they were also considered to be the first fighting games

[48:28] and still influence fighting game styles today.

[48:32] Now on consoles, most people would remember 1988's Robocop 1990's Batman and Lemmings from 1991.

[48:44] Those were data east properties.

[48:46] You played those?

[48:48] Ah, no.

[48:50] No, you didn't play the all-man.

[48:52] The Robocop game was a big deal.

[48:54] And Batman as well.

[48:55] So Batman and Robocop were basically the same game.

[48:57] They just sort of changed Batman for Robocop.

[49:01] And then they changed sort of the buildings for derelict sort of

[49:08] Detroit city stuff for more gothicly Batman stuff from like Tim Burton's Batman.

[49:13] Super cool games.

[49:14] Really enjoyed those.

[49:15] Lemmings was also fun.

[49:16] Played that one on the Super Nintendo.

[49:19] By 1998, the parent company of data east left arcades entirely

[49:24] as they were accumulating too much debt.

[49:27] And that's when the pinball part was spun off to Sega pinball.

[49:32] By 1999, they stopped making video games entirely.

[49:38] By 2003, data east filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo district court.

[49:44] And their intellectual property and all that other stuff

[49:47] was purchased by a Japanese company called GMOTE.

[49:52] Most of the items were then eventually spun off to a D4 Enterprises.

[49:56] And Taktron Corporation, whoever those companies are.

[50:00] So the intellectual property for data east is owned somewhere by somebody.

[50:04] But basically the entire company kind of went from its highs

[50:08] in the around the time that Gary Stern is meeting with them

[50:12] to basically being nothing but a name nowadays.

[50:17] So why did they choose data east?

[50:21] Hey pinheads, I just wanted to let you know that when I'm not making cheesy

[51:31] Well, Data East USA in California was a subsidiary.

[51:34] Well, I think I said that right, subsidiary of Data East Japan in Tokyo.

[51:39] Data East USA was a separate company run mostly by Americans in promoting Japanese products in the US.

[51:46] Yeah, so I'd like to avoid taxes to employ Americans to get into the market.

[51:51] Usually you had to have some sort of presence in the United States.

[51:54] Well, Data East had their Data East USA, but they mostly just sort of pitched Japanese products.

[52:00] So this is where you start introducing some corporate politics,

[52:04] which are often pretty cutthroat when it came to the video game industry.

[52:08] Well, Gary Stern says, Bob Lloyd was running Data East USA and he was intrigued with the idea

[52:14] of a product that didn't come from Japan that he had more control over.

[52:17] Something he could sell worldwide instead of just in the US because he was just selling Japanese

[52:22] video games here in the US. Yeah, it's like a power control thing, right? Where Bob Lloyd,

[52:31] this guy here in North America was basically selling the Japanese stuff here.

[52:35] He didn't develop his own stuff. He didn't get to feed his own ego.

[52:39] It's very like a, what's that show that everybody's watching now?

[52:43] Succession. I don't watch TV. Yeah, I know you don't.

[52:47] So why did Data East need pinball?

[52:51] And Gary Stern says Data East is a coin op company. It had fighting games and video,

[52:55] it had redemption, which often they got from Namco.

[52:59] So with pinball, it became a full line company.

[53:02] It was fully integrated. They could get more coins at the arcade.

[53:06] That's all that mattered was that they had all of the lines of business, full line company.

[53:12] So the next step was really something of a big deal is that when you're starting something new,

[53:19] it's really hard to do it without money. And we can see that, especially if you look at our last

[53:24] episode of Silver Ball Chronicles, it's tough to start a new company without funding.

[53:31] And we're not talking about funding from your clients who you would eventually not sell the

[53:36] product to, but we're talking about a big backer. It's tough to start designing mechanics and

[53:43] build a manufacturing line without that scale. But you're going to have to continue to build out

[53:50] a team to help scale up. Money is only part of it. You can have all the money in the world,

[53:56] but if you don't have the expertise, you're not going to be able to put the pieces in line.

[54:01] So they needed help. What did Joe Kamenka say about that?

[54:05] Joe Kamenka would say, we needed desperate help. I convinced Gary to have Ed Sabula help clean us up.

[54:13] Part time at first and then full time. We were lucky and grateful to have his help and mentorship

[54:21] to make our games function and work. So who's Ed Sabula?

[54:27] I believe Joe probably met him at Gameplan, I would assume.

[54:30] Yes, he was a super mechanical engineer and pinball designer who would help out at multiple

[54:38] small companies, but he was another jack of all trades like Shelley Sachs.

[54:43] Ed is a teenager started at Mills Jennings at Chicago repairing slot machines.

[54:48] slot machines come up a lot in these pinball discussions. You ever noticed that?

[54:52] He learned all the gearing and interworking of original slot machines. It became a self-taught

[54:56] engineer and spent years designing slot machines. Eventually the company, oh so Mills Jennings became

[55:02] clean, I don't know that. Wow, I'm learning something. Eventually Mills Jennings would become

[55:07] Gameplan and he created both slot machines and later a variety of pinball machines in video game

[55:12] cabinets. Self-taught. That's a big thing to be self-taught about. Are you self-taught at anything

[55:19] Ron? I guess pinball repair, I mean other than checking out videos and looking at the internet.

[55:25] Yeah, I mean I would be sort of a self-taught solderer and if you've ever seen my soldering,

[55:29] boy you know I'm self-taught. Joe Kamenkow and Gary Stern helped induct

[55:34] Ed into the pinball hall of fame in 2004. Did I mention I was there? That was my first expo.

[55:41] Yeah, that's right. You know what game was on the line? 2004. What game do you think was on the line?

[55:46] Now folks back then, Stern is the only game in town, so there's only one factory you were visiting.

[55:51] Was that, no it wasn't Ripley's, that was too, that was the way I heard it. No, that was before.

[55:55] Ripley's was ending before. They gave us the shrunken heads that they had in stock because Ripley

[56:03] didn't really sell that much. So they had a lot of extra shrunken heads. Thank you very much.

[56:08] Thank you. I can't give you more of a clue here. So it now has to tell us. That was a pretty heavy

[56:13] handed floor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Ed was a really big deal. He had helped and

[56:19] mentored and left a great impact among a lot of those in pinball, including John Bork.

[56:25] John says Ed was a master craftsman. He created most of our drawings back in the pencil and

[56:30] drafting board stays. That brings us to Roger Sharp, who said that Ed was a very soft spoken

[56:37] and genuine fellow, easy to converse with, open and honest to a fault, at least with me.

[56:43] And a formidable skill set as evidenced by his body of work. We worked together at Game Plan,

[56:50] even though I wasn't even an employee of the company. I will get into Game Plan in a whole

[56:55] other episode because it was kind of a fun little experiment as well. But also at Game Plan was

[57:01] Joe Kamenkau. Joe says Ed was incredibly kind, a true gentleman, never an on-kind word.

[57:07] He loved his craft and pinball and could build anything with his hands and was incredibly

[57:11] dedicated and a hard worker. Smoke nonstop while he spoke, and often had a cigarette in his mouth

[57:16] and mumbled a bit. He was respectful and quiet around others. A wonderful, incredible mentor and

[57:21] friend. He even drove sports cars late in life. Ed seems like a pretty cool dude. Now of course,

[57:27] they needed the engineering help. Ed was very important in helping. Data East build out that

[57:33] entire department. Shelley Sachs would say that Ed was a great person and was always trying to

[57:39] find a better way to design mechanisms for ease of use and could be the most cost effective.

[57:47] He had a great subtle sense of humor that was unexpected as he took his responsibilities

[57:53] very seriously. Well, you need a quarterback, right? When you're building out a manufacturing line,

[58:00] when you're building out an engineering team, you need somebody who's very, very serious and

[58:04] not joking around and having a time. You want somebody who is focused, but they can't be just

[58:11] a horrible person either. You need that quarterback. A Kamikawa said, when we started Data East and

[58:17] we were getting games ready for the first spring show in 1987, Ed and his wife, to be, and sidekick,

[58:23] as well as many others helped us make a makeshift line to get the first game ready. Ed, along with

[58:28] friends at all the pinball companies helped pillage parts that East needed to build the first games.

[58:33] Ed, along with friends at all the pinball companies helped pillage parts that East needed to build

[58:37] the first games. I made the first games then drew them. The mechanical engineering was almost

[58:42] not existing and horrible at best. Joe was not a mechanical engineer, right? He did a politically

[58:48] political science degree. You know what I mean? Like he's, it's not his background. He sort of had

[58:53] to figure out that stuff. Well, that's where he would lean on somebody like Ed, who again was

[58:58] integral to the engineering at the early years of Data East. They didn't just convince somebody

[59:06] to give them a pinball company though. Did they? Like he didn't just go to Data East and be like,

[59:11] we need this billion dollar company over here to give us a bunch of money. We'll figure it out,

[59:14] right? And then it didn't matter what they did. No, they're on a budget, man. Someone else's money.

[59:20] You got to keep it on budget. You're like, they're looking at that stuff, right? And if you're over

[59:24] budget, if you're spending money willingly, if you're not bringing out a product, if you're not

[59:30] profitable, if you can't bring up a product line, manufacturing line, you know, a marketing team,

[59:37] if you can't bring that up, the, you know, the parent company is going to know a prime example of

[59:43] that is Capcom when they started, you know, they were using somebody else's money, Capcom,

[59:51] the parent company, but man, they were blowing money left and right. Well, that was not the case

[59:55] with Data East. Every time I listen to a podcast, most of which are in the show notes. And somebody

[01:00:03] mentioned Joe Kamenkauer, Gary Stern, around the time of Data East or the early Data East,

[01:00:08] would often talk about how Joe and Gary could squeeze every penny out of a budget.

[01:00:13] And that doesn't sound like some of the startups today, where it seems like they are just

[01:00:18] blowing money left and right. These guys were penny pinchers. And that was probably why they

[01:00:26] were so successful. I have a quote here from Michael Gottlieb. You know, Michael Gottlieb is?

[01:00:30] Yes, because I have the show notes for me. Oh, very good. It's a grandson of David Gottlieb, son of

[01:00:36] Alvin Gottlieb, former president of Gottlieb Pinball. And he couldn't use his own name when he started

[01:00:40] Alvin G. That's why it was Alvin G. Yeah, Michael, Michael was sort of the principle behind Alvin G

[01:00:46] and Co, which was sort of a spin off, if you will, of the Gottlieb family in pinball in the mid 90s.

[01:00:52] Michael says, I worked as a summer intern, a coffee boy at Data East. I put stickers on Monday night

[01:00:58] football. Gary and Joe could work on a budget. They are resourceful. They knew what to do at the cost.

[01:01:04] Joe was a dreamer and always so enthusiastic and motivating. That's a typical quote that you

[01:01:09] would hear, right? They were super good on a budget and they did everything on a budget, which is

[01:01:13] why they did it. They got the team together. We got money. We're penny-pinching. We're going to

[01:01:18] build a game. What do we got? What's the first game? Ground breaking. Ground breaking game here.

[01:01:23] Ladies are war. Yes, this is the fantasy sci-fi war theme. It is from May of 1987. It is a

[01:01:31] Data East version one board set. So they've built their own board set. They sell 2,569 units. This

[01:01:39] is designed by Joe Kamenkow, all the engineering again, Ed Sibula, art by Margaret Hudson, who we

[01:01:45] would know from the Bally days back in the class of 1981, music by David Theill, software by Lonnie

[01:01:52] Robb and Richard Ditten. Rumor has it that Gary Stern still has a laser war in his office.

[01:02:00] So you groaned a moment ago. They did the same thing. They did the same thing they did at

[01:02:07] Stern. Edward Partridge, listener of the show, would say, I always thought it was funny that Sam Stern's

[01:02:11] solid state ripped off Bally's board set. Then Gary followed suit with Data East copying the

[01:02:16] William System 11 board set. Yep, pretty much. They ripped, they copied the System 11 board set for

[01:02:22] the most part. But then they threw the years a deviated off of it kind of into their own

[01:02:27] their own world. They started doing their own stuff. As opposed to at Stern where literally you can

[01:02:34] use the same Bally board set in any Stern game and it works. So there was some some deviation.

[01:02:41] The Stern soundboard was a little different though. They had kind of their own thing there.

[01:02:45] But yeah, they somewhat reversed engineer System 11, but not quite. Well, they had to work around.

[01:02:52] You know what Gary Stern said about it. He said, we reversed engineers parts of the printed

[01:02:56] circuit boards that would have been Data East. That's the one thing they did to help us. They had

[01:03:01] electrical engineers and they Data East. They worked with us doing that. Wait a second. So Gary

[01:03:07] Stern just blatantly says, oh yeah, we totally copied it. The circuit boards. Yeah. So isn't it

[01:03:13] illegal to steal a board set like, you know, just to take in copy? You know, Gary Stern is a lawyer.

[01:03:17] Did you know this? He mentions it quite often. And Gary says it's against the law, especially in

[01:03:23] Illinois at the time to dump and copy the copy right of code. Richard didn't at which later became

[01:03:28] Incredible Technologies program from scratch. The system he did not look at. And he was very careful

[01:03:34] not to look at any of the code that was in a Williams game. How do you look at it and used it somewhere

[01:03:38] there would have been fingerprints. So he did so he did it from the ground up. There are copy rights

[01:03:44] on drawings and code, but not the boards themselves. Ah, there is the key. The key is that you can't

[01:03:53] copy the code, the way the chips work, the chips within it, things like that. But the way the

[01:03:59] board looks, you can. And you can't just take the drawings of the boards and copy the drawings

[01:04:05] and the boards in like a photo copy or a Xerox machine. They just took the boards themselves and

[01:04:10] did them and they did not look at the code. Well, what do you think Williams thought of that? Right?

[01:04:15] Williams is always the big dominant player. Well, Gary says, you know, over the years, Williams

[01:04:22] sued the company me personally a number of times. It seems to always get settled. Well, no specifics.

[01:04:29] But you could probably figure out what happened. The same thing that happened with the ballies. They

[01:04:34] did have a number of, there were lawsuits within the whole not just between Dad East and Williams.

[01:04:39] There was lawsuits between Capcom and Williams and yeah, the big dog is always trying to defend

[01:04:44] their territory and if they got to bring in the lawyers, they will. While the funny thing about

[01:04:48] laser war, it was built from parts from a Williams roadcanks. It was also designed on the Thanksgiving

[01:04:54] weekend of 1986. This is not the first time that I have heard that a roadcanks was cannibalized

[01:05:01] to build a machine. Which hurts me because I like roadcanks.

[01:05:07] Let's jump into the flyer here because new company, right? Yeah. New new designers, new marketing team.

[01:05:14] Let's see the fanciness that is laser war. Same board set. Although they had stereo. Williams

[01:05:20] did not have stereo. So they could say like we have stereo. Did you know, Dad East presents laser

[01:05:26] war. It's the new standard and pinball. The new standard. They have changed the game. They've changed

[01:05:33] the game. Now the back of the flyer is the best part because it shows a lot of the, a lot of the

[01:05:40] the marketing gimmicks and some of them are pretty hilarious. Yeah, and I can't read any of them.

[01:05:46] So I have these young below 40s eyes. So I will read this. At the top, it says new, new, new,

[01:05:53] new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new. So is it new? There's a lot of new stuff on here.

[01:06:01] Right? It's fully designed. Brand new system happens to be a similar board set to system 11,

[01:06:05] but apparently there's some new stuff. One of them is the new compact disc clarity. The first

[01:06:11] system specifically designed for digital stereo. It has 2.1 sound. Two speakers left and right

[01:06:20] and a sub the point one. What do you think of that? Incredible. Compact discs were the big thing

[01:06:25] right because we were moving from records and tapes to compact discs. So that was the trendy

[01:06:31] thing at the time to compare yourself to. And they have pictures of the speaker panel from

[01:06:36] the game with compact discs in front of us. Yes. I think that's awesome. Advanced speech and special

[01:06:40] effects, new chrome enclosure. What about the new black beast unleashed, which was an advanced

[01:06:48] space-aged ABS material. Compact pieces of modular design and power durability and standard

[01:06:57] coils. So they're using more plastic. That doesn't sound very good. Doesn't sound like plastic.

[01:07:05] It sounds really cool the way they worded it. Space-aged ABS plastic. ABS material. Space-aged.

[01:07:12] Space-aged. So there's also the hand of holding one of the coil assemblies and it looks like

[01:07:18] an apes hand or something? Black beast. It is an apes hand. Very weird. Compact one piece module

[01:07:27] or design. Power durability uses standard coils. Wow. It's got a picture of a crown. The neck.

[01:07:36] Yes. So the crown is interesting. It says new crown gems uncovered. New shapes and sizes, new colors

[01:07:44] and advanced player appeal. Basically they have different designs of inserts. I guess that's a big deal.

[01:07:52] This is my favorite one. A flipper so strong. It could crack wall nuts. The early daddy's games do

[01:08:02] have obscenely strong flippers. That is my favorite one. There's a picture of a flipper with broken

[01:08:08] wall nuts around it. I haven't played laser war, but I hear it is actually kind of fun. It's a good

[01:08:14] little shooter. Actually a lot. I am a big fan of a lot of the early daddy's games. Yeah, and we'll

[01:08:20] get into those here. The early daddy's games. Got the physical kickback on the side, which kind of

[01:08:26] goes away up the play field as opposed to just sort of above the slings, which is really cool.

[01:08:32] It's got two spinners. One in the center, one on the left orbit. Everybody knows I love me some

[01:08:36] orbit spinners. Nice big wide open ramp in the center feeds back to the flipper on the right side.

[01:08:43] Standups. A lot of standup targets. It's energy and information at your fingertips. 100%

[01:08:50] interactive with digital music and sounds. A light show so advanced. It's patented. Whoa.

[01:08:57] It's wow. Yeah, it's it's like what are those lights called that everyone wants in their games,

[01:09:04] the mod, pin stadiums. It's pin stadium before pin stadium. Yeah.

[01:09:09] Proven attention getter without glaring lights. Wait a minute. It's a light show so advanced.

[01:09:15] It's patented, but it's it's without glaring lights weird weird. I found my site that has all

[01:09:23] the flyers at like 300 DPI so I can actually read it. The other, you know, if we tie this back,

[01:09:33] right, flippers are always a contentious issue, right? There's always like when manufacturers come

[01:09:38] out, they have a difficult top there. They're flippers are too squishy or they're not sharp enough

[01:09:43] or or they need to be rebuilt. Got leaves struggled with that with system three, you know,

[01:09:48] some people critique JJP or multi-morphic about their flipper feels nowadays. Joe Kamenka would say

[01:09:54] we had to get to a point quickly and make our own flippers slingshots and other parts.

[01:10:01] Many of these parts stern uses today. His work output and good design saved us. Without Ed's

[01:10:09] early involvement, the company would have vanished over night. So we joke about this ABS plastic design

[01:10:16] and flippers and all of that stuff, but it's really that is what saved them according to Joe Kamenka.

[01:10:23] Another thing is that this machine was built from May of 1987 to February of 1988. Now that is a

[01:10:31] really, really long run for only 2,500 machines. That's 10 months. But again, it's that first game,

[01:10:40] they're getting it rolling, they're selling it and they're selling 2,500 machines. I mean,

[01:10:44] it's taken Jersey Jack today almost 24 months to make 5,000 machines. For those at home, I believe

[01:10:52] made a February would be nine months, not 10 months, but well, details details. I want to see,

[01:10:59] let's leave that in and see if anyone corrects that. Let's jump over to the next game,

[01:11:04] which I think is a little more up my alley here, speaking of James Bond, etc. This is secret service.

[01:11:12] This is a data east version two. So we've made some changes to the board set after one game.

[01:11:20] Probably had to be made due to a lawsuit, my guess. May of 1988,

[01:11:26] 2741 units designed by Joe Kamenka, art by Margaret Hudson, and everybody knows this name,

[01:11:33] Kevin O'Connor. Again, another one from the Bally Days, music by the legend David Thiel,

[01:11:39] and software by Lonnie Robb and Richard Ditten. This was manufactured from March of 88 to July of 88.

[01:11:49] So their line has ramped up. This is only a five month manufacturing period.

[01:11:55] That's four months. Four months. Well, no, I counted all of March.

[01:12:01] Okay, so if I'm counting it as the first time. All right, it's all wrong. So four and a half months.

[01:12:07] It's cut it in the middle. That's half the time.

[01:12:10] Frasca? Mike Frasca over on Silver Ball Chronicles Facebook page would say that secret service is

[01:12:16] a all play the crap out of it once a year at a show kind of fun. Would you agree with that?

[01:12:23] I don't know if I don't, but I'd like it a little more than that. Well, if I see this game

[01:12:27] at Fantastic, I'm going to play the crap out of it. It's right up my alley. This game is so cool

[01:12:34] for a couple of reasons. One of them is the back glass is pretty epic. It is of a car chase,

[01:12:42] which in what looks like Washington, DC, there's a car in the back, one of those like old 1980s or

[01:12:49] 70s Mercedes-Benz that often bad guys are driving. It looks like it's from an embassy or something.

[01:12:55] There's people shooting at somebody in a Ferrari driving away. And there's a lady who's standing

[01:13:02] up at the T-top shooting, which looks very dangerous. She's not wearing a seatbelt.

[01:13:07] But it is really, really cool. The best part about this are the details that you don't know,

[01:13:13] which is this was an eight-hour photo session in Madison, Wisconsin, because their state

[01:13:19] capital building looks very similar to buildings in Washington, DC.

[01:13:25] It looks very similar to the capital in Washington, DC. Yeah, the actual specific capital.

[01:13:30] The Mercedes-Benz car in the background that's chasing the Ferrari in the front are the

[01:13:37] data East employees, Richard Denton, Elaine Hodgson, Lonnie Robb and David Feel. How cool is that?

[01:13:45] I'd put myself in the game too, why not? Of course. And this is during that, like,

[01:13:49] remember Gottlieb was doing those photo-realistic back glasses? They're kind of doing the same thing now.

[01:13:54] This would go at a vogue really quick. Did you know it's in digital stereo?

[01:13:59] It is. It's all over the flyer, man. Yep. The flyer. What do we got for the flyer this time?

[01:14:05] It's total cliche. It's basically James Bond, but not James Bond. It says licensed to thrill. Yeah,

[01:14:13] they totally ripped it off. Wow.

[01:14:16] Data East brings you pinball the way it was always meant to be. Fast action, non-stop challenge,

[01:14:22] and super excitement. What do you think of the picture on here? It's like a Russian embassy

[01:14:28] car in behind them. There's the James Bond-esque fellow in a tuxedo. Yep. 80s lady in the

[01:14:35] in the gold dress with the high heel pumps. That was a big thing in the 80s. Man, these flyers

[01:14:43] are not very high quality. Quality on the, I'm not talking about the flyer itself, just the actual.

[01:14:49] The printing. Captivating action-filled light unit that looks great and fits in every location.

[01:14:55] That's for those at home. That's the top. They called it the captivating action-filled light unit.

[01:15:01] Best just got better. Through to our improved sound system, which also features the hit music from

[01:15:07] the television series Mission Impossible. Get smart, secret agent man, and the spy who loves me.

[01:15:13] Wait a minute. The spy who loves me. So not loved me. So was that a show? I don't know.

[01:15:19] So the movie. Maybe it's a typo. I got a for you. If you know the answer to that, please email

[01:15:24] us silverball chroniclesgmail.com. It's faster than a speeding bullet. This is the first pinball

[01:15:29] to sport a standard secret service issued eight cylinder fuel injected 160 mile per hour,

[01:15:36] $85,000 matchbox Ferrari on every play field. Wow, I want this game now. This has sold me.

[01:15:49] Instant multi-ball, instant fun in our fast food microwave it. I want it now world even in the 80s.

[01:15:56] You no longer will have to wait for multi-ball play. Instant two and three ball instant fun. The

[01:16:02] data East pinball way. And as you can see, they can still use the word multi-ball right now,

[01:16:07] but that will change. Yeah, eventually they'll get sued and they won't be able to use the turn

[01:16:11] multi-ball. Correct. Yes, they'll have to change it to try ball. Do you know it's a movie quality

[01:16:16] back glass filmed on location with 70 millimeter special effects? Oh my god. Yeah, it's like a big deal.

[01:16:24] Who wrote this flyer? I want more flyers. But the thing is the funny part always about these

[01:16:30] data East ones is that they're not as cheesy as the Williams flyers. Like there's not a lot of

[01:16:36] puns and there's not a lot of goofiness, right? There just is just really over the top. Like

[01:16:41] Joe Camman cows a car person. We spoke about that a little while ago. He's a bit like me like

[01:16:46] fast cars and cool stuff, which is I think why they would put such a huge description about the

[01:16:50] matchbox Ferrari and every car. Did you know that never before in the history of pinball?

[01:16:55] There have been a resettable ball eating target until now. Players will marvel to the

[01:17:01] thrills of our innovations. Remember those really strong flippers? Not even wall nuts are safe

[01:17:06] from a dad East flipper. The flipper that some call the best in the business now sports a

[01:17:11] reinforced flipper link arm. In other words, they must have issues with them breaking on the

[01:17:15] previous game. Parallel, Lown flipper coil and better than ever ball control, which is funny

[01:17:19] that they would they're plugging the parallel Lown flipper coil when they would abandon that.

[01:17:24] Eventually. Could it actually break wall nuts? Do you think they tested that?

[01:17:28] I'm sure if you hit a steel ball at a wall nut from these flippers, you could break them.

[01:17:33] But with the flippers break the wall nut. Sure, why not? Let's try that out. If somebody wants to

[01:17:37] try that out, they can email us at silverballcroniclesgmail.com. Be interested to know.

[01:17:42] This play field has had some comparisons, let's say, to it. It has a third flipper into a side ramp

[01:17:52] which rotates over into a diverter on the left side and then a ramp which drops that are

[01:17:58] off right in front of the slings. This is basically high speed, right? Everyone says that. I mean,

[01:18:03] it has some elements that are the same. Well, let's say let's look at the top third.

[01:18:09] To me, it's different enough. You've got the left side ramp. You've got an orbit, which is actually

[01:18:16] quite kind of in the middle of the play field, but shoots into a spinner into the top lanes.

[01:18:21] Then you've got the capital house mold in front of three stand-up targets. Then you've got the

[01:18:28] pop-upers behind that. What draws my attention is on the left side. There's what looks like a highway

[01:18:34] chase. You mean the right side? Yeah, sorry, the right side is there's a highway chase of the

[01:18:40] people being chased by in the Ferrari into a spinner on that orbit on that side, which looks like

[01:18:48] a highway sign, but then there's also a capture hole just to the left of that, which looks like

[01:18:54] the high-speed capture saucer, which that feeds, like, you know what I mean? There's a lot of

[01:18:58] little bits taken. But, you know, high speed is an hysteria. That's true. Flippers can't break

[01:19:04] walnut, so clearly superior. It does have some really cool molds that look like capital buildings.

[01:19:10] Right, so I mean, there's some innovation when it comes to play field immersion, you will.

[01:19:18] And that's kind of cool. These early, daddy's games are in your face, bright, loud games.

[01:19:25] Yeah, they wanted to get your attention, because attention would draw quarters. That's what I like,

[01:19:30] so yeah. Well, this brings us to their next game. Probably the best of the three. Torpedo Alley.

[01:19:37] This is the Navy Combat theme from August of 1988, is a data east version two sells

[01:19:44] 1,000 in two units, not a very good seller. So we've been up in the mid 2000 sellers. Now,

[01:19:50] this time we're down to 1,000. It's designed by Claude Fernandez, who you will remember from

[01:19:55] Williams Blackout, Bally Flash Gordon, Electra and oh god, baby Pac-Man. And skateboard.

[01:20:03] Skateball. Skateball is good. All of his designs are basically other people's play fields with

[01:20:08] slight changes. Oh, Blackout isn't. Neither's Electra. Neither's baby Pac-Man. Take that back.

[01:20:15] We apologize to Claude. Any of his good games are somebody else's.

[01:20:20] Art by Margaret Hudson and Kevin O'Connor. Now, they were actually, they had their own independent

[01:20:26] businesses. They were independent contractors, which is why they are popping up now on the

[01:20:31] Bally's as well as the daddy's stuff. Music by David Thiel, Sound by Kyle Johnson,

[01:20:39] software by Lonnie Robb and Richard Ditton. So you can see on these three games, we basically have

[01:20:45] the same teams. But we've brought in somebody else, a third designer to help out. This is a three-month

[01:20:52] production from August to November of 88. The backlash. Let's talk about the back. I want to

[01:21:00] start there. I don't want to talk about anything else. I want to start with this backlash. Okay.

[01:21:03] What's going on here? I don't know what's going on. So they are on like the bridge of a ship. I would

[01:21:10] say, I guess it's a submarine, which is partially above water, which makes no sense because submarines

[01:21:17] are supposed to be below water. There are three ladies who are all very surprised. And they are

[01:21:23] wearing not very comfortable shoes for working on a submarine, I would say. And they're wearing like

[01:21:31] really tight spandex uniforms. Again, I don't think these are US military standard issue uniforms.

[01:21:43] Obviously designed to attract male pinballers, if you will, from the 1980s. But there's also a man

[01:21:52] to the left. And he's pointing at a ship, which they're shooting at because they're torpedoing them.

[01:21:59] Look at his pants. What's his pants look weird, don't they? They're airbrushed on.

[01:22:05] Originally, he was wearing the same standard issue torpedo alley spandex pants as the ladies.

[01:22:13] But it was determined that that looked weird. Yeah, I'm sure what. But if that's the military

[01:22:18] issue uniform, that's the way it is. So they airbrushed on pants.

[01:22:26] The the the standout Mac here is in the middle of the play field, which is like a sinking ship

[01:22:34] looking through binoculars. So when you when you complete the thing, when you when you sink the

[01:22:40] ship, it sinks it in the middle of the play field, which is kind of cool, eh? Yeah. It has your

[01:22:46] clawed Fernandez plunge across the play field to start the game. Looks about as deadly as star wars

[01:22:53] from Stern. The latest star wars from Stern. Now you can plunge it into the lane there.

[01:22:59] Kenya. Yeah, you're fine. It looks dangerous. Nah, it's fine. Well, something with a with a

[01:23:06] bunch of tight pants has to have a great flyer. Well, the the flyer they have a mascot character

[01:23:12] looks like a cat with a sailor outfit on with a daddy's tattoo. I don't think he's in the game

[01:23:17] anywhere. So I don't know why is he in the tour. No, yeah, he's not. There's another weird cat in

[01:23:23] the O of torpedo, but it's a different cat. And they got a mouse. Where's the foot of the game?

[01:23:28] He's on the foot of the game. Oh, yeah. What's up with that? I don't know what they were going for

[01:23:33] there. Yeah, you could tell that maybe the direction was in all directions here. And let's see,

[01:23:39] you know, the proof is in the play field. That's right. A good play field makes the game, right?

[01:23:43] Data East commitment to quality shows up in every detail of game design and manufacturing.

[01:23:49] So this one is a little more business. Yeah. Tell you the shots, the actual rules of the game.

[01:23:56] Yeah, what you should be doing to get your points, which is boring. Come on, I want ridiculous

[01:24:01] over the top. I want this to tell me how it's going to change the course of pinball forever.

[01:24:05] Claude Fernandez was known for having not bad play fields, but just different play fields,

[01:24:12] like odd things. And this one has a lot of vertical upkickers and not a lot of standard kind

[01:24:19] of regular ramps. Here we go. We got an improved design, control lamps and flash lamps on printed

[01:24:26] circuit boards for reliability and easy service. Gold contact, micro switches on all rollover

[01:24:33] switches, removable speaker housing with easy in and out design, stronger legs,

[01:24:40] stronger legs. Okay, all PCBs located in back box for easy service. That's a good idea.

[01:24:46] All plywood cabinet, cleanest cable in the business.

[01:24:52] Actual sinking mechanical ship design for the thrill of the kill. I don't think that particular

[01:24:58] line would be used in any modern game. This they have a really neat design around this time as well,

[01:25:04] as they've got these mounted PCB boards under the play field that you just rotate to take out the

[01:25:11] light bulbs. A lot of people know these from the Valley Williams games, but the cabling is pretty

[01:25:18] minimalist. I remember when I saw my got-leab system 80s and I opened that up. The amount of

[01:25:23] cabling under there was just terrifying. You can see now that this is different.

[01:25:27] They're flipper bats at the time. They had pulverizer written on them. Yeah. That was the

[01:25:33] that was the critique of the system 80s, right? From Godleab was that they were like these weak

[01:25:37] sauce flippers. They just couldn't make it up the cool ramps and stuff. Yeah, kind of like,

[01:25:43] you know, what was the one? Miami, not Miami Heat. That's a basketball team.

[01:25:49] Hollywood-Eat. Hollywood-Eat. Yeah, they have like these steep ramps in the back that you can't

[01:25:54] make them up the ramp ever. No problems making ramps on these Daddy East. I'll tell you that.

[01:25:59] You're going to break stuff with these slippers. Now, this was Claude Fernandez's only

[01:26:03] Daddy East game and he only really made six games anyway. Why do you think that is? Do you think it

[01:26:08] was because it was just a bad seller or do you think it was his personality? Yeah. Well, he was

[01:26:14] he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Yeah. I mean, I don't know much about Clive Fernandez. I think

[01:26:18] you got into other industries. I think you're probably right. You know, a lot of people want stability

[01:26:24] and we'll get into some of the other pinball designers. You know, there were guys like Ward

[01:26:28] Pemberton who was actually a firefighter, right? So a lot of these people realized that they can't

[01:26:35] make it all of them in pinball. So they pop up now and then but they have other jobs or

[01:26:40] they're going to other industries. A lot of people like Torpedo Alley, you're one of them, right? Yep.

[01:26:45] Corey Hughes would say over on her Facebook page that a favorite memory of Torpedo Alley was playing

[01:26:58] the final round of pinburg and the convention center roof was leaking onto the game that we were

[01:27:04] playing. That is great theme immersion. Oh, yes. I wonder if that was in the convention center or

[01:27:13] was that in the warehouse because the warehouse used to have leaking. I remember that there'd be

[01:27:17] like water on some of the games poor pinburg. Now one of my favorites. Yeah, this is this we're

[01:27:25] getting ready to peak here when it comes to original themes. Regional themes, of course, are

[01:27:30] cheaper. You don't have to pay a man. You don't have to pay a licensor. You don't have to deal with

[01:27:35] licensing. You just build what you want to build. And when it comes to personal favorite unlicensed

[01:27:42] themes, it's got to be a time travel theme in the game time machine. It's December of 1988,

[01:27:49] data east version two sells 2,896 units, so almost 2,900 units. So we're seeing

[01:27:57] after after that sort of really low end Torpedo Alley, we're way back up again in sales.

[01:28:04] This is designed by Joe Camon Cowell, Margaret Hudson, Kevin O'Connor on the art,

[01:28:09] music and sound by David Theal Kyle Johnson, software by Lonnie Rob in Jerry Korraganis.

[01:28:18] Yeah, so this is another five month production run, but in this five months, they're doing almost

[01:28:24] 3,000 units. The back glass on this one is a lot of fun because what it's done is it's jammed

[01:28:32] together a bunch of different eras because you're traveling through time. You've got kind of

[01:28:38] the 1980s disco driver. You've got the 1980s sort of mom next to him behind her in the

[01:28:49] passengers in the in the rear side passenger seat is a hippie from the 1970s and then behind the

[01:28:55] driver almost falling out of this cosmic time traveling car is a 1950s sort of leather jacket

[01:29:05] jock guy. Yeah, I would think the hippie would be 60s piece man. Yeah, oh yeah, you're right,

[01:29:10] probably the driver is like a disco dude. So he's got the 70s. Yeah, yeah, turn to the 1980s.

[01:29:16] Yeah, of course. So there's there's some pretty cool like thing here. They're they're like in space

[01:29:21] around earth. There's like TVs floating around and like it looks like bongos and space floating

[01:29:29] around. It's really kind of weird. It's very cool. This is designed by Kevin O'Connor. The

[01:29:35] hippie in the back is actually Margaret Hudson. She's the one who modeled for that. Go back to the 1950s

[01:29:45] with data east pinball. They are hanging out in a 1950s diner playing time machine and it has

[01:29:52] ding written all over the flyer here. Why is that? Because the game has chimes. Game has chimes.

[01:30:01] We haven't had chimes in a pinball machine for years. Long time, yeah. So cool. The back of the

[01:30:08] flyer has a picture is worth a thousand words. What picture are they showing here? Showing the

[01:30:16] play field. Yeah, the underside the top side and the underside of the play field and they've

[01:30:21] gone all out with these PCB boards underneath here. We're not talking like one or two. We're talking

[01:30:27] a couple of really massive PCB boards. Yeah, massive light boards. Be me up Scotty. The ball stops

[01:30:33] here and ring any bells. Star warp to a new dimension as your ball enters the center ramp

[01:30:41] transporter. Beams to another location on the play field for a million points when lit.

[01:30:46] New ball lock mechanism fed by the left and right ramp engages time machines powerful engines

[01:30:54] as you travel through the 80s 70s 60s to your destination in the 50s. And it has a chiming. It shows

[01:31:01] a picture of a chiming unit. Remember when pinball is where fun. Relive the golden age of pinball again

[01:31:06] with chimes and a special clicker noise unit that's sure to keep you going back in time.

[01:31:12] That's nice. That's something unusual and neat. Like this is a cool game because they're

[01:31:18] they're thinking how can we be different and they've done just that. It also has a really cool

[01:31:22] subway mechanism which is basically a wire form ramp under the play field. And basically you

[01:31:29] keep hitting those ramps you go back in time and when you get to the 50s you start hearing the

[01:31:34] chimes. What do you think of the the the play field layout? It's got two ramps on the left side

[01:31:41] one on the right. One of the ramps on the left side is actually a dead end that ends up kind

[01:31:46] of just dropping back onto the play field right. Yeah there's no dead ends here man it's flow city.

[01:31:50] It's a fun game. And imagine all these plastic ramps with the flippers that can destroy wallnuts

[01:31:56] i.e. They will destroy the plastic ramps. Yeah. A lot of these I've seen the ramps are just trashed.

[01:32:03] Yeah. It's black. It's very like space. So if you've seen like a Rick and Morty where the

[01:32:09] play field is black and the art is on top of it. I don't know if I like it. It's cool. It's kind of

[01:32:14] really good. It's kind of Rick and Morty. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's just I don't know there's certain

[01:32:20] things when it comes to play field art that you can do and you can't do. One of them I feel is

[01:32:24] like a lot of black. The other one is like a lot of green. This is all in your opinion of course.

[01:32:29] And of course well I mean there is no other opinion than matters. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I look forward to playing

[01:32:35] one of these. I don't see a lot of these early data ease. I see a lot of the the bigger seller

[01:32:40] numbers. We'll get to those in another data ease podcast. Ryan Kiper over TurboGraphic 7,

[01:32:45] one of the streamers that you'll often see says the data ease time machine is greater than

[01:32:52] Zacharias time machine. Would you agree? Yes. Although the Zacharias time machine has in

[01:33:00] insane like the entire upper part of the play field raises and lowers. Hmm. Cool.

[01:33:06] Would you buy one of these data ease time machines? If the price was right. Sure. I would. Yeah.

[01:33:13] There you go. Look at this flyer here Ron. What do you see down here on the bottom? I see an

[01:33:18] Easter egg for the upcoming game. Yes. It is a Playboy bunny with a question mark. Should we jump

[01:33:25] into the next one? Playboys 35th anniversary was the next game from May of 1989. This sells 2338

[01:33:36] units. So a little bit down in production numbers. This is the adult and lifestyle entertainment

[01:33:42] theme if you will. Joe Kamenkout with another play field. And it should be noted that Ed

[01:33:48] Subula actually had a lot to do with a lot of these play field designs as well. Art by Kevin O'Connor

[01:33:55] music and sound by Kyle Johnson and software Lonnie Robb and Jerry Corriganis close enough.

[01:34:02] This is a four month production run. And we have to start thinking about building building out a

[01:34:10] bench of designers, but it doesn't look like they actually have done that. We're back again

[01:34:17] to another Joe Kamenkout design. It's also notable because this is the first license by

[01:34:24] Data East. It is the Playboy theme. Playboy was an American lifestyle and entertainment magazine

[01:34:31] founded by Hugh Hefner first in Chicago in 1953. The brand was first financed by a thousand dollar

[01:34:39] loan from Hugh Hefner's mother. Playboy was known for nude and semi nude centerfolds or

[01:34:46] playmate models. Bunnies and published many short stories by novelists such as Ian Fleming of

[01:34:52] James Bond, Margaret Atwood, Handmaid's Tale, and Roll Doll who actually did Charlie and the

[01:34:57] Chocolate Factory. We spoke a lot about Balley's Playboy from December of 1979 which sold almost

[01:35:03] 20,000 units. By 1989, Playboy was a lot less cool than it was in the early 80s and late 70s.

[01:35:14] Hef was getting old. Adult entertainment if you want to call it that had changed considerably

[01:35:20] in the late 80s. There wasn't the same sort of sense of sexual revolution of the 1970s. It became

[01:35:27] a lot more like Smuddy if you will in the late 80s and 90s. It really was changing and it's an

[01:35:35] odd choice of theme, especially for their first theme. Had they do it again? They would. And at that

[01:35:42] time it was even worse. This is the 35th anniversary of Playboy which I guess would make some sense.

[01:35:50] The Flyer pretty straightforward actually. It just shows the game. Talks about the underplay

[01:35:57] field mounted PCB boards which are an industry leader in technology. Our cabling technology is so

[01:36:06] clean that it eliminates 70% of the wires of a standard game. Yet all the years later, Gary's

[01:36:13] turned would say how many miles of wire were in every game. Yeah. Interesting thing is this one

[01:36:20] this one line here. Let's see. Super smart software has what no one else can give you. Even our toll-free

[01:36:27] number 1-800 kickers. I believe that still turns number to this day. That's still turns number to

[01:36:33] today. Yeah, still on their documentation. Yeah. The game itself, so if we go away from the

[01:36:39] license for a moment and just talk about the game itself, is it a good game? I've got a decent player.

[01:36:43] Probably only played it a couple times ever. And there's nothing about it I remember off the top of my

[01:36:49] head. It's got divers. Right? Daddy's was a big fan of divers. It has two ramps which are fairly

[01:36:55] similar to one another that feed into a diverter. Feed to the left side. Daddy's did a lot of these

[01:37:03] things in the 90s where you shoot into a dead end into a vertical up kicker onto a ramp.

[01:37:10] They were like really, really known for that. An example of that now would be Russia's premium

[01:37:15] LE model where you shoot into the dead end. It goes into a scoop and then that goes up into a

[01:37:19] vertical up kicker. So it hits the ball from underneath and shoots it up a wire form or a ramp

[01:37:24] made of wire and goes back to a flipper. They do a lot of that. That was like a bit of a crutch

[01:37:30] that they had. The art on it I think is actually pretty cool. It's not as iconic I think is the

[01:37:36] original Valley art that they had on the play field of the Valley game which I thought was

[01:37:41] sexy but classy. If you will where this one is obviously a little more trying to

[01:37:49] really emphasize a lot of ladies it's less classy and more. Because in the original one if you look

[01:37:56] if you remove the pop bumpers if you just look at the play field art there's a picture of you

[01:38:00] like looking out the window and there's a woman there and she is in a certain position.

[01:38:05] Yeah she's dropped a contact lens. Yes. Yes. Yeah the pop bumper area on this game is designed to

[01:38:12] look like an arcade inside the mansion. It's got a game abandoned. It's got the original. It's

[01:38:18] got a Playboy game there as well. Some of the bunnies are playing it. Hugh Hefner is standing

[01:38:23] out front. It's sort of like you're in the mansion. I guess it's kind of the the quote unquote

[01:38:29] world under glass theme that they've built here. I mean I don't know. I couldn't have this in

[01:38:35] my house and not because it's it's Playboy but because I just I don't know it just isn't cool.

[01:38:42] It's the ramps are a little bit fun because those ramps are part of the pool I guess of the

[01:38:49] Playboy mansion. That's kind of neat. The data sheet is interesting. This is over here on

[01:38:55] IPDB. It is the features of the game but in a Playboy magazine it used to have like the playmates

[01:39:02] birthplace their ambitions their turn-ons their turn-offs. What they've done is they've taken that

[01:39:08] and and flipped it to be what is the pinball machines turn-ons and turn-offs and favorite movies

[01:39:13] and things. Pretty cool. It's favorite movies apparently are Tommy, Tilt, Tron and Joysticks which

[01:39:19] are all arcade you know movies. I like games I would like to meet. It's got laser war and robo

[01:39:25] yeah yeah so there is another Easter egg for something that's coming. Favorite food and drinks

[01:39:34] quarters because it's a pinball machine that likes to eat corners. Playfield cleaner

[01:39:40] but it's kind of fun it's it's a fun way to do it the marketing is very good of it. It's just I

[01:39:45] don't know the I don't know. It also came with a centerfold of Kimberly Conrad in the in the

[01:39:54] flyer for this pinball machine. She's standing in front of the machine very 1980s late 80s early 90s

[01:40:03] model thing again the the weird 1980s pump high heels which were the thing. This is the same

[01:40:10] Playboy playmate who is seen on the back glass. So I guess we'll talk about the back glass because

[01:40:14] it's probably the most interesting part of this pinball machine. We have Hugh Hefner in the front

[01:40:21] again he's getting old right it's it's not the half of the 70s. He is with Kimberly Conrad who

[01:40:28] was playmate of the month in 1988 and Playboy of the year in 1988. This is Hef's second wife and

[01:40:36] the mother of his two children. Their marriage drew worldwide attention and is often referred to as

[01:40:44] the belated end to the 1970s. So Hef's thing before was that he had all these girlfriends and he

[01:40:50] dated and he was a quote unquote Playboy. Now he's more or less settled down and having kids

[01:40:54] because he's old and that's what this pinball machine sort of embodies is Playboy was kind of

[01:40:59] like no longer cool. After nine years of marriage Kimberly Conrad and Hugh Hefner would separate

[01:41:07] for 11 years when they remained married because of their children. They were officially divorced

[01:41:15] in 2009 when their children turned 18. The youngest of the children turned 18. If you look at this

[01:41:22] it's the back glass. It's got a lot of Easter eggs in it which is again the only reason why this

[01:41:26] is a fun back glass. One of them is Joe Kamenkao is in the pool with some of the ladies. Kevin O'Connor

[01:41:34] is sitting at the table on the left and I think Gary Stern is in the back talking to one of the

[01:41:40] playmates not entirely sure. I have to get confirmation on that one. There's also some original cartoons

[01:41:48] amongst the actual photo realistic people in the background. Those are cartoons from the Playboy

[01:41:56] comic strips. Have you seen these characters before Ron? The granny. I remember her from the

[01:42:01] the original Playboy. The old lady the old granny we spoke about her in our old ballet moving units

[01:42:09] part one from a way back in our archives. She's in the pool in front of behind Joe Kamenkao kind of

[01:42:16] getting all handsy. She is naughty granny. She relentlessly attempts to seduce men. She is a take on

[01:42:24] the dirty old man but they flip that to a dirty old lady stereotype and it's often used to sort of

[01:42:31] satirize the dirty old man. This was created by Robert Buck Brown who was one of the original

[01:42:37] cartoonists from that 1970s era who was African American real trailblazer. She is going after Joe

[01:42:46] Kamenkao down there. The other one who I didn't know is under Kevin O'Connor's arm on his right side.

[01:42:55] That is Little Annie Fanny and I had to look this up because I didn't know who it was and now my

[01:43:00] internet search history just looks horrible. So from 1962 to 1988 Little Annie Fanny was a humorous

[01:43:09] satire of contemporary American society and its sexual norms. Annie Fanny the title character was a

[01:43:16] statue-esque blonde woman who would often find herself nude in various social situations. Why is

[01:43:25] it important? Well Harvey Kruzman, a cartoonist created this series. Kruzman is best known for

[01:43:32] launching Mad Magazine. Also on the little table is a playboy little character lady over by the

[01:43:40] pineapple here. I don't know who that is. She must be a symbol for playboy because she pops up

[01:43:45] from time to time but through my googling I couldn't find who that is. I thought that was

[01:43:49] what's his name? Was it Lee Roy Neiman? Yeah, okay ladies and gentlemen Ron has seen playboy.

[01:43:55] I thought we did that on our previous episode. Yeah that's it. See ladies and gentlemen Ron has

[01:44:04] listened to our previous episodes. I was there for it so I just remembered it. Playboy is cool

[01:44:09] I guess at a certain point but it became less about rebellion and more about boobs. You know what I mean?

[01:44:17] Yeah. Monday night football or actually ABC's Monday night football.

[01:44:24] Okay we're getting into it here in a second here Ron. This is a NFL sports theme September of 1989

[01:44:31] Daddy East version two it sells 1,492 units. I could probably see why there's a grown just

[01:44:37] in the sales numbers alone. Designed by Joe Kamenkau, art by Kevin O'Connor,

[01:44:42] music and sound by David Thiel, software by Lonnie Rob. Now this was a license. It's the ABC Monday night

[01:44:51] football which was a this is this is going to show my lack of NFL knowledge because that's not my thing

[01:44:59] surprise but ABC's Monday night football was a huge brand itself right? Correct. Is it still a thing?

[01:45:07] It's not on ABC anymore but it's still Monday night football. There's still Monday night football

[01:45:11] but it's not ABC's Monday night football. I can't remember who what network it's on now. Yeah it has

[01:45:17] Dan Dirtoff. Deer Dorf. Deer Dorf. Frank Gillford and Al Michaels on the game so those are

[01:45:26] three separate individuals that were the Frank Gifford. Right Gifford. So so he's oh god I sound like

[01:45:35] I have no idea what I'm talking about which in fact I don't you do don'ts I have no clue but I'm not a

[01:45:40] football person. I don't know any of these people from the nice. Those were like the announcer

[01:45:45] talking heads on ABC Monday night football. Okay. Yeah and you can hear them in the game in stereo

[01:45:49] in stereo sound and the game has a it has a topper which is just a ref giving the touchdown

[01:45:56] sign. Yeah the hands in the air. Yeah terrible backlash. Guy throwing a football guy catching a

[01:46:02] football they're too close together. That doesn't make any sense. It's the 20th anniversary special

[01:46:08] edition of ABC's Monday night football. Yeah. One of the things that I said was very bad for pinball

[01:46:14] art was black playfields and now we've got green playfields. This is this is made to look like a

[01:46:20] world under glass and it is a football field right. Mm-hmm. Why did you groan when I said that this

[01:46:27] was the next game we were talking about. I'm not a fan. Not a fan. Is there a specific reason?

[01:46:34] I just don't like the way it plays but do you know it actually has an actual disappearing goal post

[01:46:40] and ramp for extra points and field goals just like the one seen on TV. Yeah we're talking

[01:46:45] play field immersion here right. So in the front part of the play field pops up to a ramp

[01:46:51] and you shoot up that ramp into a field goal which ends up kind of like a jump ramp if you

[01:46:56] will. It doesn't look like it is fun. It's it's not. Yeah it looks like it was supposed to be fun.

[01:47:06] It's not. But I don't think it is. Again this is just my opinion. Your experience may vary. You

[01:47:10] may think this is the greatest game of all time. Like it's designed to be in a bar where people are

[01:47:15] watching the football game. Look at this skillshot though. Yeah so the skillshot on the right side.

[01:47:22] You shoot up this little ramp thing into like a kickoff and it goes in the 10 million 20 million 30

[01:47:29] million 30 thousand 30 thousand 40 thousand so it's like the one that call those the baskets the

[01:47:35] in tails of the Arabian nights but it's longer and bigger. Yeah where you shoot it into the

[01:47:40] little baskets it's sort of the same thing. Well it is the same thing. Do you think Dad East got

[01:47:44] royalties from John Papaduke but he basically ripped that off. A spinner into a vertical upkicker

[01:47:51] onto the ramp again sort of a dead end shot. Does it have does it have an orbit spinner so can't

[01:47:56] be too bad. Do you know recently over 10,000 operators and 43 million players have switched to

[01:48:02] Daddy East pinball? It seems like a lot. They're really plugging themselves not necessarily the game

[01:48:08] on this flyer. Yeah that that that that Daddy East is growing right where you know you can trust us.

[01:48:14] We're not going to disappear right because when something new starts up which we've seen a million

[01:48:19] times in pinball and we'll see another million. You can't really trust them because oh you can't

[01:48:23] you can't trust them because you won't be able to get coils. Fact. Dad East pinball is the only true

[01:48:28] digital stereo sound system and is the most advanced system ever in a pinball. Daddy East is also

[01:48:34] the first to have highly choreographed light sound and display effects. Fact not fiction. Daddy East

[01:48:41] has the most extensive celebrity licing program in process with games like Playboy's 35th

[01:48:49] anniversary ABC's Monday Night Football and others to be revealed at a later date they offer instant

[01:48:55] name recognition to the player higher earnings and resale which is 100% true. They have noticed

[01:49:04] that if they slap a license on a game it sells more and earns more. They weren't the first to figure

[01:49:11] that out for goodness sakes right. Bali did it in the 1980s like 70s but they've been able to

[01:49:17] sort of reinvigorate that again. I like they plug their superior lightboard technology. I mean

[01:49:24] Bali use lightboards in the mid 80s. I mean before Daddy's even existed it's just kind of funny.

[01:49:30] Go give one a flip. I'm sure if you're a big football fan this is a cool thing to have in your

[01:49:33] basement. Now this is the one for me. Uh oh this is Robocop. Oh yes Robocop.

[01:49:40] November 1989 sells 1500 units. It is a licensed movie cops and robbers theme.

[01:49:49] Daddy East version two. Joe Kamenka on design Kevin O'Connor on art. Sounded music by Scott

[01:49:55] Stevenson and Mark Cross and software by Rob Quinn. So we can see some staples of Daddy East that

[01:50:02] have been around forever. Joe and Kevin. But we've got some other individuals. Scott Stevenson

[01:50:08] Mark Cross Rob Quinn. We're kind of bringing in some people to help it because they're starting

[01:50:12] to ramp up production aren't they Ron and they need people to help out to keep up that schedule.

[01:50:17] There's only so much Ed Sabula and Joe Kamenka can do. You are a fan of Robocop.

[01:50:24] The theme the license. I am a fan of the first movie. I am also a fan of the first movie. Robocop

[01:50:32] was the 1987 ultraviolence science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven. Yeah he also

[01:50:41] did basic instinct and total recall and starship troopers. He has a very weird movie style. All of

[01:50:48] those movies are all very weird. This stars Peter Weller. A lot of people will remember him as the

[01:50:54] bad guy in uh Star Trek into darkness. Uh pretty much on the Star Trek game every time I see him I'm

[01:51:01] like oh it's Robocop. Exactly. Other than that I don't think Peter Weller has really done much right?

[01:51:07] Oh he was in Buckaroo Bonsai I thought. I don't even know what that is. He is. He is?

[01:51:11] Don't know what that is. No. It stars Nancy Allen who I thought was great and Kirkwood Smith who

[01:51:19] most people will recognize as the father read from that 70s show. Yep I love this movie Ron. I

[01:51:27] honestly when I first saw the 70s show I'm there like it's it's Clare. It's from

[01:51:32] it's the trouble. It's the trailer guy. Yeah. Uh yes I love this movie. See I most of the people

[01:51:38] in this movie basically did they couldn't it's like they couldn't get anything after this except for

[01:51:43] except for Kirkwood Smith. I uh Ronnie Cox was in total recall.

[01:51:49] And Beverly Hills cop too and he was in other stuff. Yeah you love this movie. I saw this I mean I

[01:51:54] saw it when it came out. Yeah so I was much younger this was not a movie for young folk. I saw

[01:51:59] this when I was 12 probably totally shouldn't have seen it at that age. I was 13. Yeah it would have

[01:52:05] been 13. See but I saw the VHS recorded version from like Sunday's movie marathon where they would

[01:52:14] where TV especially American TV would cut out a lot of the violent stuff. So that was it was a

[01:52:19] highly edited version of it and since then I've seen it as an adult quite recently in fact

[01:52:24] and it is it is an awesome movie. So set in the future of a crime-ridden Detroit city

[01:52:31] police officer Alex Murphy is brutally murdered and brought back to life as a cybernetic police

[01:52:37] officer called Robocop. Unaware of his former life Robocop executes a brutal campaign against a

[01:52:44] crime city while coming to terms with lingering fragments of his memory and his humanity. This movie

[01:52:52] is an awesome movie not because of that part but because of the world that it is held within

[01:52:59] which is a critique on the power of mega corporations which has become quite topical nowadays.

[01:53:05] TV media propaganda death and resurrection. Mast uncontrolled consumerism and Reagan era drug

[01:53:14] politics. Netflix did a movies that made us episode about Robocop and it talks about like the

[01:53:21] production and all of the craziness that happened on the set of Robocop it is totally worth a watch.

[01:53:28] Have you ever seen that? I have not seen that. It's it's well worth it if you if you're looking

[01:53:31] for some of the content. I will say if you're going to watch it watch the director's cut. It's a great

[01:53:35] movie. Yeah. As mentioned data East also did a Robocop video game for arcades and consoles which was

[01:53:44] really really good. Mike Castleman from the pinballers. He says Robocop back to the future in

[01:53:50] the Simpsons were better than most system 11s. Data East had the best licenses in the late 80s and

[01:53:55] early 90s. I don't know about back to the future but well but it was better than most system 11s.

[01:54:03] Of that era? Would you rather play mouse and around or the Simpsons? I know which one I'd rather play.

[01:54:10] But that's not most. The swords of fury would you rather play Robocop or swords of fury?

[01:54:15] Robocop. Yeah. So you're treading on some thin ice there Mike Castleman although I appreciate it.

[01:54:25] I agree but I also disagree we're really close together we're close together on that. But

[01:54:30] you know Robocop is a big deal. Has a new feature. Something that Daddy's actually beat Williams to.

[01:54:38] Okay. It came there is an extra little it's on the flyer. It's got Gary Stern on the flyer. It says

[01:54:45] a revolutionary development in flipper design a new solid state electronic flipper. So revolutionary

[01:54:53] that I will guarantee this is Gary Stern I will guarantee no flipper coil burn out for one year

[01:55:00] where I will replace it free. Why did they redesign their flippers? I thought their flippers

[01:55:05] were fine they could crack walnuts. They went from parallel wound to a single wound coil and

[01:55:11] basically solid state meaning the game can actually control it. So you hit the flipper button

[01:55:16] there's actually an extra board in the game which of course they mounted in the cabinet along the

[01:55:20] side. So if you're putting the play field down and it falls in the cabinet it will just just destroy

[01:55:26] the board whoops and they did away with the end of stroke switch because who needs that? It's

[01:55:32] controlled it's computer control now we don't need that except they ended up needing that later but

[01:55:37] they put it back in. They put it back in but but it didn't burn out. Yeah yeah I mean if it did

[01:55:43] Gary Stern would replace it for free. And in this image is Gary Stern wearing his white shirt and

[01:55:49] suspenders and tie which is like basically Gary Stern's uniform. And he's holding a flipper back

[01:55:55] which they probably gave him right before they took the picture. He's probably like what's this?

[01:55:59] Did you know that RoboCop is a new must-have for every location aggressive thrilling pinball chase

[01:56:07] with digital stereo sound and authentic digitized voice track and everything that

[01:56:11] the tracks continued play designed for fast action and built to take it with color coded easy to

[01:56:19] understand rules. So cool. So cool it has a jump ramp a daring high speed high flying ramp so good.

[01:56:26] Jump to capture fugitives and one million points so you shoot up the right ramp and then there's

[01:56:31] a gap in the ramp and then and then it literally jumps over and if it doesn't make it it falls down

[01:56:36] into the top lanes and then into the pop-upers. You start ball-de-ball the guys and rucky cruise

[01:56:41] here the rucky cruise here the rucky cruise here. I've seen this played on stream I haven't played

[01:56:45] it personally like I said when there's low sales numbers pins for some reason like cool ones like

[01:56:52] this I've never played but really crappy low number ones I have. It is a really neat design it's got

[01:56:59] lots of interesting bits and features it's very different than most Kamenkao games right like it's

[01:57:04] it's very unusual. The flippers are ridiculously strong it does the annoying thing though that

[01:57:10] sorts of fury does too whenever you hit the flipper button it makes a sound I hate that.

[01:57:15] Although that's the only negative I have against it. Oh in the back glass is just poor. Yeah it's

[01:57:20] not that great. No. It's basically Robocop shooting the gun. It's just the lady behind you. When you see

[01:57:25] it up close it looks even worse. Yeah it's it's interesting but it's not it's not to the standard

[01:57:32] you'd expect but it is hand drawn it's not a photo one all of a sudden. Yep come with me or there

[01:57:37] will be trouble. This had to sell a lot it's a huge license it's kind of a fun game. Yeah they

[01:57:42] were a little late with the license though it's like two years after the movie. Yeah it sells 1500

[01:57:47] units which is pretty disappointing consider they were almost up to 3000 units on their previous

[01:57:52] games. Well the team has expanded I said before Scott Stevenson, Mark Cross but they only did this

[01:57:57] one game. And Joe Kamikaw said it didn't sell but they they like the play field layout so he used

[01:58:02] it again on checkpoint. Yeah I just I will just use the same thing with mix it up a little bit

[01:58:08] but there's only Joe Kamikaw that's doing the designing really right like there's only one person

[01:58:12] making play fields with Ed Sibula. Rob Quinn he only did Galaxy and Nineball he was the programmer like

[01:58:20] so again we're bringing it in teams to basically instead of expanding the team permanently and

[01:58:25] building a bigger company it's like we need people to parachute in to drop in and help us out.

[01:58:30] The next one was Total Recall. It's a licensed movie theme from 1990 it was an unproduced prototype

[01:58:36] it was designed by Tim Sechel, Art by Paul Ferris who you will know from the Bally 81 class of 81

[01:58:45] and software by Raymond Merchant. It was a head to head or like a side to side pinball machine

[01:58:50] they only ever actually made one. There's a picture of it. I have also included in the show notes

[01:58:56] a link to a YouTube walkthrough of an old you know 19-early 90s pinball show where somebody has

[01:59:05] uploaded it and you can see the game that's there and sort of being played. They only ever really

[01:59:09] made the one though but these fast designs they're just banging them out banging them out banging

[01:59:16] Joe Kamenka would say Ed and I worked hand in hand on many of the games I would do the drawing

[01:59:21] with the curves and the game idea and Ed would clean up my mess and redraw the game and build

[01:59:27] a fast sample. We could crank out a drawing and have a working white wood if we needed it in a

[01:59:33] few days often less than a week. He could do anything build anything wire or draw anything they

[01:59:42] don't have many men like Ed in the business. They don't need to expand the team they've got

[01:59:46] they've got Ed Sibula just killing it with everything but this guy was like close to retirement

[01:59:52] anyway. What about uh what about Phantom of the Opera? It looks great. Licensed uh licensed

[02:00:00] stage musical theme from January of 1990. Daddy's version 2 sells 2007 50 designed by Joe Kamenka

[02:00:07] Art by Paul Ferris this is his first sort of pinball machine back since you know I don't know

[02:00:13] Vector did he do Vector? I know that they definitely plug that. Did you know that he's back?

[02:00:20] The guy who's worked he've loved. The guy who's fascinated the entire industry for years with

[02:00:24] a super art and dynamic style. Recognizes the greatest artist who ever put Soko come on and play

[02:00:30] with me on any piece he touched a brush to I have no idea what that means. That's what literally

[02:00:36] it says. Recognizes the greatest artist who ever put Soko come on and play me. I must be from a

[02:00:43] game. Armura Song. He's done our latest and greatest Phantom Pin game. Back glass playfield

[02:00:50] and all and it's killer. Paul Ferris the man with the golden touch. There you go his last game

[02:00:56] was Grand Lizard in 1986 at Williams and that was just that that didn't get the back glass his

[02:01:02] version didn't get released. Right his full actual like actual game that he did all of the

[02:01:08] everything was Centaur back in 1981 and Gary's on the flyer again saying how great they're

[02:01:15] it's gonna split the flip or Mac. He hasn't changed he's still wearing the same suspenders and

[02:01:20] shirts. You know future games will have this feature as well as Kryptonite playfield hardcode.

[02:01:27] The world's hardest surface harder than a diamond tough strong scratch proof and easy to clean.

[02:01:34] You'll never need mylar ever you can rely on us for the latest in quality and innovations.

[02:01:40] I've never heard that. So it's basically their version of diamond coast. I guess but I like the name

[02:01:48] Kryptonite they trademarked it. They did I don't know how they managed it. Now Phantom of the Opera was

[02:01:53] the French novel by Gaston L'Heroire. First published in 1910. Many film and stage productions have

[02:02:01] been adapted from that over the years including the 1986 musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber. It had won a

[02:02:10] Tony award and is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It's still tours today. The latest

[02:02:18] showing was in 2021 in London's West End which is basically Europe's Broadway. This is a heck

[02:02:27] of a theme for pinball isn't it Ron? Sure. We're not exactly talking about that iron maiden or

[02:02:34] high speed here are we we're talking about Phantom of the Opera see the Phantom enmasked and true

[02:02:39] face revealed. Yeah. Ball vanishes into magic mirror and advances bonus multiplier activate orcan

[02:02:47] door work in door to uncover Phantom's hiding place for multiple action. The game itself looks

[02:02:56] phenomenal and this is a testament to Paul Ferris. It looks brilliant. It looks it looks creepy and

[02:03:06] sexy and scary and unusually interesting. It is really really a piece of art and we wouldn't

[02:03:15] expect anything from Paul Ferris that is not like that right. It is it is great. You got the

[02:03:20] Phantom in the middle of the playfield you've got the female character in front. You've got

[02:03:26] like archways around it. You've got other characters. Just the intricate designs around the flippers.

[02:03:34] This very baroque style of flavors of different colors and stuff but it's very red and

[02:03:43] irion white and dark. It's cool. Very very cool. This isn't this is a statement piece

[02:03:50] more than it is a great pinball machine though isn't it? It's not the best. Not the best. Yeah.

[02:03:55] The woman is actually Paul Ferris's daughter she modeled for the image so to be able to get the

[02:04:00] proportions and the directions right in the backlash in the playfield you have somebody model for

[02:04:05] you and you design around it. That's Paul Ferris's daughter. Paul Ferris says Joe was over my

[02:04:10] shoulder non-stop when the backlash painting was unveiled at the data east office. Joe and Gary

[02:04:15] applauded. They loved it. Phantom of the opera both Gary and Ed's pictures are in the game. I

[02:04:21] don't know which one they are. I haven't gotten close enough to it and the images on IPDB are not

[02:04:25] clear enough but at the time Phantom of Opera was actually public domain though it was popular

[02:04:32] on Broadway. They were able to use the license. His son actually modeled for the Phantom.

[02:04:39] So there's a whole it's a whole family affair there. Most of Paul Ferris's designs like if you go

[02:04:44] back or all of his art years ago you know they're like his brother or his uncle or his cousin or a

[02:04:49] lady he used to know about school when he was a teacher. That's right. His wife. Right so there's

[02:04:55] like a lot of stuff there. It's kind of fun when you work with the Paul Ferris because there's always

[02:05:00] little Easter eggs in there. When it comes to playing this game you've played it. What do you what do

[02:05:06] your critiques? Not the best. Not the best is it because it's not flowy or it's just the code or

[02:05:14] it just doesn't shoot that great. It just doesn't shoot that great. It looks. Looks great.

[02:05:18] Done again. These are all opinions. The pennies expressed are ones of my own and no one else's.

[02:05:24] That's right and your opinion is never wrong. Correct. Unless it's contrary to my opinion.

[02:05:30] They also did a King Kong machine. This is the classic fictional character of King Kong. They did

[02:05:35] 90 units. This is designed by Jerry Armstrong, Art by Kevin O'Connor. Brian Schmidt did the sound

[02:05:43] and music and I don't know who did the software. I assume it's Lonnie. Interesting of Brian Schmidt.

[02:05:50] He is defected from Williams and is now at Daddy East. Big time sound engineer. He was very,

[02:05:59] integral I would say to this time at Daddy East. He really brought them to another level.

[02:06:07] King Kong is one of these. They're all prototypes. High level, grail, super high expensive pins.

[02:06:16] I don't see much about King Kong now. They're all prototypes. When I first joined the hobby it was

[02:06:21] like this. It was like oh my god it's a King Kong. Did you see it? Did you play it? Did you deserve

[02:06:26] that? Or is it just that there was only nine? I've never got to play it. It's very wide open.

[02:06:34] It is fan-ish, which means that all the shots are ranged left to right but there is an upper play

[02:06:41] field on the top left side where you spell ape that goes into a wire form down to your right side.

[02:06:50] Left side or right side? Left and right issues. Yeah. That's right.

[02:06:55] And Canada. It's different. In Canada we do it the other way. The ramp on the left side

[02:07:00] you shoot up the ramp and it goes almost vertical and then to the left and down to the bottom left

[02:07:07] flipper. That is very reminiscent of Keith L. Wins captain Marvel ramp in Avengers Infinity Quest.

[02:07:16] There's also versions of King Kong with like a huge flipper. Neat. The art is really cool. It's

[02:07:21] got King Kong at the bottom. Art is excellent for the lady. Very neat, unique design.

[02:07:29] They just didn't release it. It was too expensive for they didn't have enough time or

[02:07:34] whatever the thing was. But it's one of those grail pins that people freak out about. Similar to

[02:07:39] like what Mafia by Capcom. Mafia. What? Kingpin. Kingpin. Mafia was actually another game by

[02:07:47] another company. Back to the future was the next big knockout licensed movie theme. That was

[02:07:53] June of 1990. We're into the data east version three. Do you know the difference between the versions?

[02:07:58] It's probably just the board sets. They're just adding like a little bits or more flasher or

[02:08:04] something. It's just the boards change over time. There's like different MPU versions or different

[02:08:08] power board versions. There's different probably soundboard iterations. Go to pinwiki.com to find

[02:08:14] out more information. Exactly. There's 3,000 units of this sold. So we finally broke the 3,000

[02:08:19] unit threshold designed by Joe Kamenkau, art by Paul Ferris, music by Brian Schmidt, software by

[02:08:26] Raymond Merchant. Now the theme is based on Back to the Future, which was the 1985 pop culture

[02:08:35] phenomenon film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Bob Gale. Stars Michael J. Fox,

[02:08:42] Christopher Lloyd, Leah Thompson, and a time traveling delorean. Marty McFly accidentally travels

[02:08:49] back in time to 1955 where he meets his parents and works to correct the timeline before he disappears

[02:08:59] or something. That's not really how time travel works. But I guess they didn't know that in the 80s.

[02:09:06] Oh, you're expert on time travel. Yeah. So you go back in time and you accidentally kiss your

[02:09:10] mother and then your photo fades away in the future because you don't exist. Was that right?

[02:09:16] Well, it's your parents didn't get together. So you can't exist now. Yeah. No, when you go back

[02:09:20] in time, you create an alternate timeline. Your timeline still remains. But now you've gone back.

[02:09:26] You can't go back to where you originally were because you're in a totally different line.

[02:09:30] If you go back ahead, you're going back ahead of the new line that you've created, not the existing

[02:09:35] line that was there before. If you would like to describe how time travel works, please send us an

[02:09:40] email at silverballcrotacles.org. This movie had a 19 million dollar budget. That is 31 million

[02:09:49] dollars adjusted for inflation, which is a decent budget, not outrageous, but a decent budget. It

[02:09:54] grossed $388 million, which is almost a billion dollars adjusted for inflation, $929 million. A huge

[02:10:04] hit and it is a 96% rotten tomatoes. Ron, this is one of your favorite movies. It's a good movie.

[02:10:11] It's a great movie. The second one, the third one, pretty bad. I've never seen the other two.

[02:10:19] Yeah, the second one's kind of fun because they go into the future, which was 2018, I think.

[02:10:25] And there's flying cars and all of that stuff. And then the movie kind of intersects with the

[02:10:30] other movie, the old movie. So he sees events from the first movie from a different perspective,

[02:10:36] which I think is really cool. Also, not how time travel works. But I kind of like the second one.

[02:10:43] The third one is not great. So don't waste your time or waste your time and feel bad about

[02:10:50] you know, kind of half-rooting one of your favorite movies. According to Paul Ferris, Bob Gale,

[02:10:56] who is the writer of Back to the Future, well, him and Joe Kamenkau would meet about the license

[02:11:03] and the two of them hit it right off. In fact, Bob Gale and Joe Kamenkau are still friends today.

[02:11:12] Bob Gale wrote a lot of popular 1980s movies. Building strong relationships is always key.

[02:11:19] This is one thing I think that Joe has always been very good at and

[02:11:24] excel that and why he is where he is today. So for many years, he continued to build that

[02:11:30] relationship with Bob Gale. In fact, Joe introduced Back to the Future as a theme for slot machines

[02:11:37] when he worked at IGT. Today, Joe Kamenkau is working as an executive producer for Back to the

[02:11:45] Future the Musical, along with Bob Gale. This musical, Back to the Future, has won a Lawrence

[02:11:52] Olivier Award and a What-On-Stage Award for Best Musical. It was nominated for several other

[02:12:00] awards and won for Best Set Design and Sound Design. There are also unconfirmed rumblings that Joe holds

[02:12:10] the rights to develop a pinball machine based on Back to the Future today with Kapau Pinball,

[02:12:17] who you'll know from The Beatles as well as Batman 66. Some say Stern might be developing one,

[02:12:23] but that's again, unconvermed. Would you buy a original Daddy East Back to the Future?

[02:12:30] That's not a good game. It's not a good game. Like not at all. Not a fan. Not code bad.

[02:12:35] Did you know that game introduced that Daddy's new quick lock back box locking system?

[02:12:40] No. Probably one of the best innovations they ever came up with. They had this over Williams,

[02:12:45] definitely. Of course, then they abandoned it when they changed their cabinet design when they

[02:12:49] went to Spike System 20 years later. But it's the thing where you just stick this huge Alan

[02:12:55] Alan key in there and you just turn it. Boom! Oh, yes! Beautiful. Beautiful system.

[02:13:00] Huge Alan key. Yep. I think somebody is using that now. That kind of took their system.

[02:13:06] Probably American. Something like that. Somebody took that, that tech knot. But I was

[02:13:11] disappointed when they did away with it. It's like, it's like the coolest thing you ever came

[02:13:14] up with and you just abandoned it. The game itself was built in like weeks. So they were able to

[02:13:22] get the license, but I guess part of the thing was they had to get it done quick. So they just

[02:13:27] slapped together a game in like less than a month and you can really tell because it is a bit

[02:13:34] clunky and it's not really that fun, right? Like it looks kind of nice sitting on a, you know,

[02:13:40] with its lights on, but other than that, it's kind of crap, right? Not a huge fan. Not a huge fan.

[02:13:45] That's very political of you. The back glass. This is the most controversial part of this pinball

[02:13:53] machine and it's because Michael J. Fox did not allow his likeness to appear on the gun. He's not

[02:13:59] on it. The Marty McFly on the back glass is actually an image of Paul Ferris' son wearing the glasses

[02:14:09] if you look. Paul Ferris says, when you get down to the end of the project, you learn the new wants

[02:14:14] of the contacts for the talents. They couldn't use Michael J. Fox. Michael didn't want to be typecast

[02:14:20] forever. Yeah. So I mean, at that time, Michael J. Fox has really busted out. He's really a kind of

[02:14:25] becoming a well-known sort of household name. And the worst thing that you can do at that time,

[02:14:29] I guess, is get typecast being, you know, Marty McFly and hey, look, it's Marty McFly, right? That

[02:14:34] would just, that would not be cool. Bob Gale, actually, the writer of the movie was very bummed out

[02:14:39] that there was no Michael J. Fox in the pinball machine. Some say that Gary and Joe were drawn in as

[02:14:48] Marty and Doc. But Paul Ferris says that Marty McFly on the back glass is his son. So where does

[02:14:57] that controversy or misconception come from? Well, if you look at the flyer on IPDB, the two people

[02:15:04] in the flyer playing Doc Brown and Marty McFly are Joe Kamenkau and Gary Stern. So that is where

[02:15:15] that confusion comes from. Yeah, I'd say that back glass, it definitely looks like Christopher Lloyd,

[02:15:20] though. It definitely looks like Christopher Lloyd. But yeah, that name Michael J. Fox. It's got all

[02:15:25] the other characters. Yeah, it does. Biff. It's got even has DMC Delorean on the back there. This has

[02:15:31] the Delorean with the tilted futuristic wheels as well. Doc Brown is wearing his futuristic clothing.

[02:15:39] You got old Biff. So this is like not the original back to the future. This is like the next,

[02:15:44] this is like the trilogy. Yeah, it's a combination. The train got the clock. The train clock from

[02:15:50] that. Yeah, it features the hit music double pack of back in time and power of love by Uelus in

[02:15:57] the news. Uelus in the news, man, he milked. He melted that song. It's the power of the dead.

[02:16:05] Two hits from that. Oh, yeah. And he got to be in the movie. Terrible game. Tons of fun

[02:16:11] when it comes to looking at it, sitting in the corner of a house. It's got a Delorean. That's

[02:16:16] kind of cool. So if we tie it up here, I would say the pinnacle of early data east, the peak of

[02:16:22] early data east has to be the Simpsons, which is the licensed cartoon theme from September of 1990.

[02:16:30] The version three data east sells 5,500 and two units. Massive seller. We went from everything

[02:16:41] being sub three thousand to almost six thousand units. Wow, big, big deal. Designed by Kamen Kau,

[02:16:51] art by Margaret Hudson and Kevin Conner, Brian Schmidt on software on music and sound,

[02:16:57] software by Raymond Merchant. Why did they sell so many of these games? It's the Simpsons, man.

[02:17:04] It's the Simpsons. I'm an underachiever and proud of it. Yeah. Play pinball, man. That's what the

[02:17:10] topper said. They're, they've made, this is the third game they've made in 1990. So they've only

[02:17:14] ever made two games a year. This is the third game. And Simpsons is relevant at this point. It's new.

[02:17:19] And huge. Huge. It beat, it beat Cosby. The Simpsons is the American animated sitcom created by

[02:17:26] Matt graining, which airs on Fox. The series is a satirical look at common American life in

[02:17:34] body in the Simpsons family. The shorts would appear on the Tracy Almond show in 1987.

[02:17:41] The first TV season began airing in December of 1989. It quickly became the first show Fox had

[02:17:49] ever had in the top 30 TV ratings and dominated Sunday night television ratings for almost a decade.

[02:17:58] It has 728 episodes as of this recording and over 33 seasons. It is the longest running American

[02:18:08] sitcom, the longest running American animated series. And I have no idea why because it has been

[02:18:16] crap since season 8. Wow. How big was the Simpsons in its first five seasons run?

[02:18:24] I would say through the 90s it was big. Massive. I remember 1991, you know, watching the Simpsons and

[02:18:33] it was like it was it was a bit risque. Bart was really rude and mean. It was like this is before

[02:18:39] Rick and Morty and before South Park and what like this was really my turn. Like that was a big

[02:18:46] deal. Don't have a count man. Every kid on the playground every Monday morning was talking about

[02:18:53] the Simpsons the day before. You want to talk about the water cooler talk around like Seinfeld or

[02:18:58] whatever kids on Monday morning were all about the Simpsons. Don't forget about Kresti.

[02:19:06] It was a gangbuster license and you can see that they sold 2000 extra units just because it was

[02:19:14] the Simpsons. Pat Lawler would famously say that if a fun house had bid the Simpsons they would

[02:19:20] have sold 20,000 units. Yeah, if it was like Bart was the talking head. Six months of production

[02:19:29] and 5,000 units. I also remember this pin from my childhood because they sold so many. I used to

[02:19:36] take the boat, the ferry from New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island in Eastern Canada. If you've

[02:19:42] ever have a chance to come to Canada you got to go to Prince Edward Island because it is it is an

[02:19:46] awesome vacation world over there. On the boat was always this arcade and the Simpsons was one of

[02:19:53] those pins. I don't remember how it played. I don't remember this. I just remember seeing it and

[02:19:58] the pop bumpers were the power plant nuclear power plant pop bumpers compared to the future stern

[02:20:06] the Simpsons which I owned. This game is garbage. No, I'd rather play this one than you really?

[02:20:14] I'd rather play this one than the stern one. Yep. Controversial. This is about the time that

[02:20:21] the DMD would become a thing almost. Joe Kamenka would tell IPDB that the Simpsons was supposed to be

[02:20:27] the first game to have a dot matrix display. However, the president and CEO Joe Keenan of the company

[02:20:35] that supplied the DMDs was worried that the development of the DMD wasn't ready for gaming because

[02:20:42] problems would occur if they rushed it into production. And then if that happened the company

[02:20:47] would likely be out of business because it would fail. So they decided to wait. We'll get into the DMD

[02:20:52] stuff in another episode. That's cool. Things are changing. Daddy East is looking to innovate again.

[02:20:58] Simpsons Mania has rocked the country. Now, Daddy East brings you the hottest license around in the

[02:21:04] wildest pinball game you've ever seen. The Simpsons pinball is charting record breaking collections

[02:21:09] everywhere it goes. And like Bard himself, it's one of a kind. The art, it looks a bit off

[02:21:17] on what the Simpsons look like. The first season and really maybe season and a half.

[02:21:24] The Simpsons animation style was a little more unrefined than it would be sort of in later

[02:21:31] seasons. And now that we're into this digital area, they're totally different. But the art style

[02:21:36] on the Simpsons pinball game was reminiscent of the art style of the Simpsons of the time.

[02:21:41] Is it a good player? I've had people tell me it's terrible at all. Really is phenomenal record

[02:21:49] breaking collections at all test locations. And it's double the speech capability with mega sound

[02:21:55] technology trademark delivers actual digitized speech from the Simpsons. Come on. It's got the wide

[02:22:02] open ramp on the left side that goes in behind the back box. Does this exact thing?

[02:22:06] Free parts and maintenance kit inside every machine to extend the life of your investment. I

[02:22:10] either go to the bag. Yes, stuff will probably break. There's stuff to fix it in there.

[02:22:15] It has not won but two of those really annoying vertical upkickers into a wire form onto a ramp.

[02:22:22] Why create a nice fun ramp to shoot when you can shoot it into a hole that pops it up?

[02:22:26] Don't have a cow, man. Come on. Oh, geez. Come on. That's bad. It had a topper. I said that.

[02:22:35] I did just play pinball, man. If I remember. Yeah. Play pinball, man. I have in my possession

[02:22:41] promotional shirts from Data East from the original run in Simpsons. That's so cool. I got them from

[02:22:48] Tim Arnold of the pinball Hall of Fame was selling them like 15 years ago. I don't know if I've

[02:22:52] ever actually worn it to a show. When this game was made, Bart was the star. When the

[02:22:57] certain game was made, Homer is the star at that point. So he's more prominently featured.

[02:23:02] Yeah, it became more of a show than a Bart show. More of a Homer show than a Bart show.

[02:23:07] At this time, the social satire and critique of the poor American family growing out of a

[02:23:16] sort of a big recession in the late 80s. Playing on the way a family dynamic is making jokes about

[02:23:25] all of the other sitcoms like family ties and how all the families were all happy and leave it

[02:23:30] to be ver. Then you got Homer literally choking his children. Well, remember Fox before this show

[02:23:37] had married with children, which did all that. Yeah, exactly. Why couldn't it be Matt Krusty?

[02:23:42] Totally. Krusty. Krusty's, uh, Krusty would be a great game. I don't know why they don't do

[02:23:47] another Simpsons game like little, little, um, horror shop, little, what does that mean?

[02:23:53] Three house of terror. Oh, can you get that wrong? You've lost your Simpsons card. I have.

[02:24:01] Yeah, here it is. You're gonna have it here. Joe Kamenkow, right? He's doing another design.

[02:24:07] He's like designed basically every game, right? And, and, and, and, and, and, so Bula. So Kamenkow

[02:24:12] would say when Ed came to work with us, he was near or at retirement age and he never wanted a

[02:24:19] long term commitment. I would think he stayed a year or two longer than he wanted to. Ed would

[02:24:26] actually stick around until 1994, but the design and engineering bench had started to begin to

[02:24:33] expand at that time. More on that in a later data east episode. So what do you think, Ron, about

[02:24:41] final, final thoughts on the Simpsons? I like it better than the newer one. Like it there. I do.

[02:24:47] That's a hot tank. It's got all the voices in there. It's, yeah. Gary Stern was smart enough

[02:24:55] in the early days of data east to identify great people like Joe Kamenkow and Shelley Sacks

[02:25:02] and eventually Ed Sabula who were all around to add a great deal to data east.

[02:25:12] In their own way, they were the reason pinball is still here today. Even though data east may have

[02:25:19] had shallow rules and kind of some questionable art and maybe the flippers were weird.

[02:25:27] Maybe they're not as cool as the bali Williams of the time. Pinball is still here because of

[02:25:35] those four people. They all loved what they did and when it came to pinball, they changed a lot of

[02:25:42] things. Did Joe Kamenkow write that script for you? He didn't. By the way, we, yeah, we won. By the way,

[02:25:50] we won. We're still around. You can't deny that he did. They're still around. Sure,

[02:25:57] they went through ownership changes and whatever, but till what like four years ago, they were

[02:26:01] literally in the same factory they had bins and staties. Now that the factory they were in before,

[02:26:07] they were in when they were Sega. Like they're in two different factories during the data you say

[02:26:12] get yours. I think they've been in three total factories since 86. Someone can correct me on that,

[02:26:16] but I think they're on factory number three. I think the most important person

[02:26:21] beyond Joe Kamenkow and saving pinball multiple times and basically my best friend is Ed

[02:26:30] Sibula. Without him, data east wouldn't have survived. They wouldn't have been able to get the

[02:26:35] engineering ramped up. They wouldn't have been able to get the production line going. They wouldn't

[02:26:39] have had walnut cracking flippers. They wouldn't have had really cool lightboards. He was the biggest deal.

[02:26:46] Sure, Roger says there are many unsung heroes in the annos of pinball with Ed and others of

[02:26:52] that generation. No one looked for the limelight. It was a career and there was pure talent,

[02:26:57] but it was also a team mentality far different from the celebrity atmosphere which pervades pinball

[02:27:02] today. Shelley Sachs is another great example of that, right? She's not there for the limelight.

[02:27:06] She's just there because she enjoys and loves what she does. Yes, that celebrity from Roger Sharp,

[02:27:12] who will literally be in a movie coming out about him. I'm sorry. Now one of the quoted comments

[02:27:19] that Mike Wynn provided me, I've left the name off of this person. It says the modern pinball

[02:27:28] enthusiasts doesn't care about the history or notable folks who helped shape our pinball hobby.

[02:27:35] They are only interested in the next new game. If you're listening to this podcast, you likely

[02:27:42] disagree with that quote. So please share silver ball chronicles of pinball history podcast with

[02:27:49] your hobbyist friends. So we can show this person that we actually do care about the Ed

[02:27:54] Sabulas and Shelley Sachs of pinball. We do care. It's just been years since somebody has been

[02:28:03] able to tell their stories in a medium in which people can actually absorb. What do you think,

[02:28:10] Ron, anything else to add? Play the early Daddy East games. They're fun. They're great. They're

[02:28:15] loud. They're obnoxious. They're fun. They're fun. And they're in stereo. Take that Williams.

[02:28:21] They're no stern electronics. They're different levels. There's different eras. But Williams just

[02:28:27] didn't have stereo. So Daddy East got him right there. And that is why they're still around today.

[02:28:32] Yes they are. Good job, Joe Kamikaw. Good job, Gary Stern.

[02:28:38] Good job, Ed Sabula.

[02:28:48] Do you want to read this? Let's do it. Let's do it. Do you want to read this again?

[02:28:53] Okay. He doesn't want to read it. He wants me to pay him this time.

[02:28:57] Pay him in like what? I don't know. That baby formula? Is that enough? That's enough. Okay.

[02:29:03] You guys don't have any baby formula. Oh, what'd we get here? As there is, you can send

[02:30:22] Are there plenty of games here you can beat me on?

[02:30:25] What's on the top? I can't make this thing bigger. Why can't I make that bigger?

[02:30:30] Oh, here we go. I gotta grab it and extend it. Okay, yeah, there we go. Oh my.

[02:30:37] And pellet chit. Pelligreeny. How do you not know that one? That's Italian.

[02:30:42] I'm sorry. There you go. One, but yeah, even-

[02:30:47] Go ahead. Go ahead. You go. You. It plays exactly like flight 2000, except there's no speech.

[02:30:55] Kevin Costner's Waterworld. Oh, what a great game and movie.

[02:31:00] And the NFL to name a few. Wait a minute. Waterworld was got laid. Was this? Yes.

[02:31:05] No. Why do I have that there? I don't know. Not Waterworld. What's the one?

[02:31:10] You know what? I'll speak. They did- No, that was got laid too.

[02:31:14] That was got laid too. They did straight fighters. Was the one after hook that was so bad.

[02:31:20] No, I am thinking of- I am thinking of Waterworld. Oh, Batman. You don't have Batman. Oh, Batman!

[02:31:30] Or lone from Q-haffner's mother. You want to go get that? Yeah, what the hell is that, my door?

[02:31:36] I hope it's girl, girl guides. Oh, God, I want those girl guide cookies. Miss those.

[02:31:47] Would you get delivered? It's Amazon guy? No, I just ignored it. I don't, I don't answer my door.
