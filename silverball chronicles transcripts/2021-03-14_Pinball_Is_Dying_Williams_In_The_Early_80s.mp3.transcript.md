[00:00] The pinball network is online. Launching silver ball chronicles.

[00:14] Your temperature's weighing back yet? It was warm yesterday and by warm it's like 40.

[00:18] I think that's like like minus 6 in normal temperatures. The correct format.

[00:23] Oh, the wrong format I got you. Yes. The one the rest of the world uses correctly.

[00:27] Yeah, but we're America. We don't do that shit. Do what we want.

[00:57] Hello everyone. I'm David Dennis and this is silver ball chronicles with me this month.

[01:02] Like every month is my co-hostess with the most is Ron Ham sandwich. How you doing, Ron?

[01:09] Howdy. What's up, fellow? How are you enduring the cold?

[01:13] It's really not that it's pretty normal here. You know, 20s, tens. We use the Fahrenheit thing.

[01:21] So you're not used to that, but yeah, we are Celsius up here. So we are, you know, where zero is freezing.

[01:28] It was 40 degrees yesterday. It was quite warm. Yeah, if it was 40 degrees here, I would not have pants on and it would be amazing. Wow.

[01:35] Yeah. Yeah. You picked up a new game. Yes, I did. And it's been playing well, I hope.

[01:40] It's been playing tremendous. You've been streaming it on the slam tilt podcast streaming channel. Yes, I have.

[01:47] I've been thoroughly impressed with how much better you are at pinball than I am. I am ashamed to say that I'm a machine like that, which is all flow.

[01:56] Attack from Mars. I I brick like crazy. I don't get it. You can brick a lot. The ramps are not exactly wide on that game, especially the right ramp.

[02:05] Very, very good. I had a small freak out the other night when I was playing the Simpsons.

[02:11] By freak out, you mean you realize what a clumpfest it is and you didn't want to play it anymore.

[02:16] The the character comic book guy. I just I picture that character as being Keith Johnson, the coder of the game when I play.

[02:24] And he's like mocking me the whole time. And it just starts to infuriate me after a while. So I had I had like a big freak out.

[02:32] I was super close to to pretzel multi ball. And of course I drain I freaked out and I'm like screw this and I switched it over to five ball, which is basically a sin amongst pinball players.

[02:46] I was just freaking and then I played worse for about five games. I played worse than I had been on three balls. So then I just I just got just infuriated and I just I went and I don't know.

[02:57] I was just like I was just like a bunch like Parks and Recreation or something. Okay, so that's what I've been doing for the most part.

[03:02] I'm I would love to buy a pinball machine, but things are a bit too crazy for me out there. When it comes to pricing as well as the wait time for anything new in box.

[03:11] And of course, as people know I have two daughters, both the munder six and they are f***ing expensive these kids.

[03:19] What store did you pick them up in? You have to. It's they eat like so much.

[03:25] Thank God I don't have boys. Oh, they must be horrible feeding those those things. Yeah, grocery shop like every two weeks.

[03:32] So our social media update. Of course, we launched silver ball chronicles dot com. So you can swing over there.

[03:38] We've got our catalog that we've worked out so you can go and you can listen to all of our back episodes as well as Ron.

[03:45] I'm working on a super secret project on transcripts. So Ryan C formerly of head to head pinball podcast and currently of Jesse J's pinball.

[03:54] Adventures on the pinball network gave me a suggestion that I use some software and do a few transcripts for the show.

[04:05] So if you're looking for sort of the history or you wanted to reference this podcast in the future will be able to have some of our transcripts on there.

[04:14] Of course, I have a real life and a real job. So I'm not like putting in a lot of focus in on those transcripts, but they are underway and we're working on them.

[04:23] So that's going to be up on silver ball chronicles dot com. As always, Ron, you can engage with us at Facebook dot com slash silver ball chronicles.

[04:31] That's where we do a lot of our chit chatting. And as you know, we have sold out to this week in pinball dot com.

[04:38] It's one of the sponsors swing on over to patreon dot com slash T w i p.

[04:43] They kick back a little bit of their revenue from their patreon to those pinball hobbyists that are listed on the pinball promoters database.

[04:53] So if you jump over there, give us a five star review. Doesn't mean we get paid anymore or any less from the patreon.

[04:58] It's just so others can find us when they're looking around. So one of the one of the things we love to do, Ron, is recognize everybody who has some comments about the show.

[05:10] So we're going to read a few out here. The first one is from Facebook. It's from Chris K.

[05:16] I'm home locked down and I don't get to play pinball very much recently since I sold my only pinball machine.

[05:24] And I rarely play on location now. But when I'm feeling down, I turn on silver ball chronicles to cheer me up.

[05:30] You guys truly are the second best pinball podcast. Well, thank you so much Chris K for that that feedback on Facebook.

[05:38] Chad H says gentlemen, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your podcast. It just gets better with every episode.

[05:46] Your chemistry is fantastic. And you are by far the podcast that I most look forward to seeing pop up in my feed.

[05:52] The work and research that you guys are putting into this podcast is remarkable and very much appreciated.

[05:58] As a relative newcomer to the hobby less than five years, I am learning so much about the people who help create the pinball machines that I love and the people who helped to mold the hobby.

[06:08] Thanks a bunch Chad. That was sent into silver ball chronicles at gmail.com. And as always, we try to respond when we can to all those emails.

[06:18] You know, I got to tell you Ron, the last episode on Dwight Sullivan, which I didn't think was that good at all, has got the most engagement from the community into the the inbox and on Facebook.

[06:30] So you have poor taste. I must. I mean, I like Dwight Sullivan, like his code. I thought it was one of our weaker episodes. I mean, it wasn't as good as that stern electronics episode. I mean, come on.

[06:40] But was far too short to be at our highest level. I mean, of course, we got to record for at least three hours. So, you know, thank you so much for all the feedback on that episode, everybody.

[06:49] And just putting it out there, David Dennis is the one doing all the research. Not not the lazy slack around here.

[06:55] Yeah, yeah. You just you just you just make me sound professional and well polished.

[07:01] Oh, Pat M says just want to say, love your podcast. I'm very interested about the past of Williams pinball. Keep up the good work.

[07:09] So this was a funny one because our topic today is actually the past in Williams pinball. So that was a very well sent into our email there. Pat M.

[07:20] Silver ball chronicles a Gmail.com. So we're going to talk about Harry Williams when he started his own company. No, no, I don't know. I don't know who that is. You don't know Harry Williams is. No, hold on. We need to take this offline while I smack.

[07:33] It's back him around a bit. Isn't he the guy that that stole all the ideas from from David Gottlieb? No, no.

[07:43] So guys, T shirts, right? So if you want to help support the show and your chest is very cold during these winter months, you may want to swing over to silver ball swag.

[07:55] We've got a couple of new designs. Some of them in a little more sort of traditional kind of shirts as opposed to colorful and blingy. So please swing on over there and support the show.

[08:06] We have mugs and we have mugs. Do you drink coffee? No, you're not a cop. No, but I do like mugs. Yeah, the person with the best mugs. I think on the internet when it comes to the pinball internet is definitely Christopher Franchi.

[08:18] He poses his mugs up from time to time on Facebook and they always crack me. That's not fair. He's a professional artist. Yeah, that's true. He knows that he's got the taste, the artistic flair.

[08:31] So we didn't get any corrections. Yes. But you know, if you want to send us some corrections for this episode, you can send them to silverballcronicles at gmail.com. But hopefully there won't be any.

[08:43] I don't know. This one's a risky topic. And I think there's going to be a lot of opinions on this episode. Oh, actually, there'll probably be a lot of corrections because of the era. There's lots of people who are around. So they will probably be correcting us left and right.

[08:58] Yes. And the other thing, I think about 1980s Williams is that there are so many resources about this time because it was such an interesting time in pinball.

[09:10] A lot of those sources conflict. So Steve Richie might say something that conflicts with something Barry Osler would say and Barry Osler might say something that conflicts with somebody like a George Gomez. So there's a lot of really cool little bits and pieces here.

[09:26] I can vouch for that. I had banana flipper questions and I talked to Barry Osler himself and he said something opposite of what I'd heard in another place.

[09:38] So there's where we're going to get into that in a few minutes. But let's just jump into the topic this month in the early 1980s pinball was dying sales and pinballs fell from its peak to nine or 10,000 units to 900 units in the span of two years.

[09:56] Video games were on an upward trend and this is where the coin up industry began to focus its dollars Larry DeMar and Eugene Jarvis had moved from pinball programming to create defender at Williams.

[10:11] Then creating their own company vid kids to create classics like Robotron and stargate even Steve Richie the king of flow in the pinball master had moved on to create his own video game company king video design.

[10:25] Larry DeMar and Eugene Jarvis were smart cookies because they did defender and then they realized no one else in the company could do video games so they left created their own company and then came back to Williams and said hey you should hire us to make your video games we know your board set because we did it.

[10:42] Paul Dessault rose in the programming ranks to become the go to programming lead on almost all of the pinball machines in the early 1980s at Williams.

[10:52] Other programmers would only last one title and then move on somewhere else only one full time designer really remained at Williams by 1982 and that was Barry Osler to help fill in the production line some of the designers from the late 70s reappeared like stern electronics Mike Kuban who popped in for one design Edward Thomas Osski only lasted three titles Williams Tony Kramer gave it another kick at the can and even newcomer Mark Richie would only start to play with the game.

[11:21] She would only start designing by late 1983 our topic today Ron pinball is dying part one Williams in the early 80s.

[11:32] The early days Williams games are quite interesting.

[11:36] As far as like rules especially when they start cutting back on costs because get pounded by video games and everything else they start to put some interesting things in some of these games rules wise yeah they're looking for some sort of differentiating factor and if you go back into the archives check out our got leaves system one stepping on rakes podcast this is sort of happening in parallel where there's this shift into solid state and now the industry is more or less into the solid state era.

[12:01] They're kind of trying to figure out what to do then by the time they sort of figure out what they can do with this type of stuff they start tumbling down a hill at like rock cross cutting.

[12:11] Yeah from games with speech and multi ball and all these cool features and now we got to take the speech away because speech is expensive one of the more expensive things.

[12:22] It's why a lot of these early 80s Williams games do not talk anymore you know go from three ball multi ball maybe to two ball where you can you know cut cut costs why you can where you can yeah so let's let's kind of let's dive in and I mentioned Barry out slur and he is really the one of the primary focuses of today's podcast of course he was one of the designers who kept Williams alive and he worked through a lot of these tough times Barry designed 35 games for Williams which is really interesting.

[12:51] He's a game for Williams between 1978 and 1996 and he sold almost 140,000 collective units working with one employer for over 20 years is quite an accomplishment.

[13:05] I mean nowadays that just doesn't happen you're mostly at one employer for five years and move on so that's quite that's quite the feat.

[13:13] Barry would ride the ups and downs of the entire pinball industry from the beginning of the solid state era to the early 80s to climb to the late 80s resurgence to the 1990s heyday so he's seen a lot and that's even more impressive that he's lasted all that time so right from high school he graduated and he started working at Williams.

[13:37] Barry didn't even leave that building until 1996 which is amazing in fact Barry dodged many of the bullets when it came to staff cuts and because of his long tenure Barry became one of the staples of Williams pinball design so much like Steve Richie Pat Lawler if you look at all of the all of the Williams pinball games there is a clear fingerprint for Barry Osler across a lot of those errors.

[14:06] So what do you think of Barry Osler kind of as a whole right his whole career what are your thoughts on him longevity.

[14:22] He said he was the only one that was there the whole time everyone else laughed or came then came back or didn't come back he was the only one there throughout the entire run from solid state to kind of the midnight.

[14:35] It's like he it's like he just loved what he did so much that it didn't matter what was going on he just sort of kept on trucking things are going down or videos rolling up and some people are like I got to get any here I got to get on video and Barry's like you know I'm building pinball I'm having a great time.

[14:54] I also think of holes and insane toys I know that sounds weird but he liked his holes.

[15:00] He's got a lot of dirty hairy it's got got the hole there wrong podcast but he has those in a lot of his games and in the cool toys like something like Doctor Who that thing that huge mechanical

[15:15] monstrosity triple level device in the back of that game you must make sure you have the coin door open before a service or whatever just as it shocks you.

[15:26] It was so good at mixing sort of having fun exciting shots but also crazy amazing toys it was sort of like a very good mixture of a of a pat ball or a Steve Richie fit like right in the middle right like his his

[15:44] vision for the quote unquote world under glass always ended up working out in a positive way Mike McCoo was say Barry Osler equals brutal out lanes I'd agree with that it was never down the middle with Barry was always out the left side except

[16:03] dirty hairy actually I hardly ever drain on that well I'll say the other games yes I mean you are in the top 1000 yes yes of course you're so good Ron you can get further in one ball on star wars then I can with the glass off

[16:20] fortunately no one else wants to play the star wars but me that's the problem yeah so let's roll back way before the 80s so you know let's get into Barry's beginning

[16:31] of course like all people in the pinball industry Barry used to play pinball all the time but of course it was illegal in Chicago so he would play on vacation which is a common theme we've heard across almost all of these

[16:46] designers and if you're on vacation in Ohio the one thing that you do seek out pinball Barry's father worked quality control at Williams at the same time he worked in the prototype room

[16:58] right out of high school into Williams two days after graduating high school in 1970 Barry started out testing back boxes with EM mechanicals so the so what would you test in an EM back box Ron like what what was the what was the thing

[17:14] uh... reels right so the little things that click right the little things that click all man some e-m people are really upset right now yes exactly yes you can you can send your pitchforks and fires to silver ball chronicles a gmail dot com step or units

[17:30] like that and we probably should mention that uh Barry is a Chicago native so he was local they have all of those physical big moving pieces inside the head right now nowadays it's like

[17:43] aboard an LCD screener you know in the 90s it was a board in a couple of you know ribbon cables to a DMD or you know back then there like there was actually like big friggin mechanics in there so he basically spent all of that time testing right when he first joined Williams testing the back box

[18:01] mechanicals to make sure that when they went out on uh... into the the world that they were working well so on evenings and weekends Barry would moonlight as a repair person for pinball machines for local operators

[18:15] I assume Ron you don't make a bunch of money on the floor and helping the engineers so you can make a little bit of that side hustle the kids call it nowadays out and about working on the very machines that you're building

[18:29] idea is you know it's very possible I have a Spanish eyes from 1972 who knows Barry might have worked on the Spanish eyes in my house

[18:37] well he might have did some QC on that who knows that's right they call that the Ossler stank okay so Barry worked two and a half years on the factory floor there doing quality control and working up that's when he moved into engineering

[18:52] and he worked with the fellow named norm Clark and somebody we've heard quite a bit Steve court it they were doing designs and of course he helped them out on sort of managing those designs and building up the white woods and working with those senior designers now that's that's pretty awesome right to be working like could you imagine going to stern today and working with Steve Richie on building his white woods that would be just awesome

[19:18] Steve Corteck was Barry Alsler's mentor I believe Steve Corteck he had three or four games at his house and they were all Barry Alsler games

[19:26] so this is where you learn to read schematics right which is it is a it's own adventure I'll tell you as a person who's not mechanically inclined and when I sort of learn to read some schematics that it was like oh my god

[19:40] I this is like a whole another world and I've unlocked like a special power the end schematics are fun yeah see I haven't even looked at those and I have no no no

[19:51] took me long enough to friggin figure out you know the start button on a you know an old godly so I don't need even look at a stepper unit

[20:00] so this is this is pre solid state he's working there during the e m era and it must have been difficult when they started transitioning from that

[20:12] e m to solid state era specifically for these older designers e m was a totally different animal we had mentioned in our Steve Richie episode

[20:22] that this is when they started to sort of look for these new designers these younger sort of fellows that maybe didn't have the bad habits or had a different vision or could use their mind in a different way

[20:36] and this is where they started to look for for new designers to come into Williams and you can really see that time that change when it comes to design can't you Ron

[20:46] so Barry out there says the transition wasn't really is the transition wasn't really hard as far as game design it was trying to do repairs on it I know basically electronics but I can't really fix a circuit board or try to find out what the problem was

[21:00] I know how to change your part but I wouldn't know how to troubleshoot it mechanical games I could go through blindfolded

[21:06] he's the the person at the factory working with the senior designers and even Barry the young gun is struggling with how to actually troubleshoot issues

[21:16] and imagine spending like your whole like 30 year career in an e m world where not only could you troubleshoot and fix things blindfolded

[21:28] like Steve Corkick for example but you could also build a machine blindfolded well Barry can't do either of those in this era and he has only been in the industry for a few years

[21:40] so Barry did his own design and Corkick said go ahead and do a whitewood the design went on to become Phoenix yes Phoenix what he bizarre back last

[21:50] yes so this is a fantasy bird team August of 1978 6198 units which is a pretty good seller by today's standards that's a very good seller design of course by Barry outslur

[22:06] art by Constantino and Janine Mitchell recently heard what's it Janine or Genie so they didn't call him Constantino they call them Connie

[22:17] oh yeah it was called Connie yeah so I just I heard them talking about this on a matter of podcasts and I'm like who is that and then I realized who it was

[22:27] and Paul Dessult with sound and software so in 2009 Barry was asked by pinball blog in 2009 what his defining moment in pinball was and Barry would say that it was seeing his first game roll off the assembly line

[22:43] that was certainly one of the highlights of his career and that has to be an amazing feeling I would agree have you you've played some Phoenix I have not played a lot of Phoenix you played a lot of Phoenix so it has a center drop bank which is a big deal this is what has come up couple times on a couple of different interviews podcasts old written documents that for some reason Barry and the like were super proud of the center drop target rule

[23:12] Barry would say they courtic and Clark really like the drop bank rule we worked on making scoring once you knock the targets down you couldn't get them back up until you went over the roll over lanes they liked the tunnel shot it was different here's the new person coming in with some newer ideas and the courtics and clerks of the world are like yeah that's pretty cool that's kind of unique you know that's Phoenix intensifies competition and fun for sizzling profits I love these flyers sizzling profits

[23:42] yeah that backlash with the weird bird man thing it's like he's like x-rayed got continental did some weird backlaces there's some really weird and we're not talking like ballet 1981 weird but you know if you stop and like what the heck is that hey you've won I have to play this game now it's so weird looking about light the fuse with Phoenix 25 cents is the profit way so this is the time when

[24:11] you're moving sort of from EM 10 cent games into quarter games and you need something cool and fancy to get that extra 15 cents and I'll tell you what Phoenix was the one I love the lady on the on the flyer here she's got these like puffy 70s pants oh yeah and heels like brown leathery heels pants are like super high on the waist great hair great hair though super super cool I think by looking

[24:41] at Phoenix I would put a quarter in Phoenix you know what I mean like I would at least give it a go it would it's it's drawn me in by its look because it's got this super cool like bonus countdown thing and of course it's got orbit spinner yeah and fire that's fire fire

[25:01] Barry Barry's got a lot of fire in a lot of his career and this is where it started so the tunnel that they're speaking to is on the left side so there's drop bank on the left and on the right for target drop bank on the left side that's where that tunnel is and it there's the plastic kind of covers it over and you kind of get in that tunnel and go all the way up and hit the target in the back that looks like a fun shot

[25:27] fun shot so the bird man you want to talk a little bit about the bird man back last he's a dude who's like ripped but he has like the claw legs you know like a bird and he's got a bird's head but he has hair it's very bizarre and kind of like hands kind of like hands and muscle muscles and the two ladies in the front of course are like oh bird man

[25:53] there's a third one off to the side doing a bizarre split thing huh looks like she's on a pommel horse or something pommel horse that's what it looks like and there's other birds and yeah

[26:03] there's a whole lot going on he's he's bird man alright yeah the ladies love the bird man it's I know it's weird it's very cool I you know I again it's it's drawn me in I think it's done what it's needed to do and I think I think it was probably a pretty

[26:20] pretty successful pin considering it sold 6,000 almost 7,000 units that's a good seller you know what I mean like that's a good seller especially at that time right Williams was was kind of doing that hot tip they were they were late to

[26:32] implementing the technology in comparison to somebody like Valley who really just right at the gate were like oh yeah this is what we do and and you can see that it took

[26:43] a little bit of time for Williams to figure out what to actually do I don't know that that's more of an opinion I would say the first couple of the Williams games that were solid state they put the the

[26:53] chimes in and even like a ticker thing so it sound like the reels just to try not to alienate their their audience they want to do it

[27:02] carefully right you don't want to go all in what they dropped all that within a year or two and there are full all out awesome sound packages etc.

[27:10] Now the game right after Phoenix was from the new guy at Williams one of the other new designers they're bringing into sort of refresh the design team and that's of course Steve Richie's flash and that would just destroy with 19,000 units so I mean when we go

[27:28] to the last six thousand pretty good you know six is not 19 no that's a big deal it's a big deal so then they crack out Barry again they're like Barry do your magic we've got a bunch of leftover banana

[27:41] flippers we need you to use them so that's when they do time war so what are banana flippers oh god banana flipper there's no explanation they literally are they they are curved they're curved flippers they literally look like a banana

[27:58] so they named them banana flippers and they were used on disco fever they must have had a lot of stock left over and I don't know why disco fever sold quite well so they must have they must have bought a lot of those

[28:08] thought that was going to be the the next thing was going to be banana flippers it was it was 78 where disco fever came out this is September of 79 time warpsels 8,879 units

[28:23] uh constantino and jenine do the the art again software Paul Dassault so same team I'll tell you what if Stern came out with a game with banana flippers and it sold like almost 10,000 units nowadays frigging every game would have banana flippers

[28:42] Barry Alsler says they Williams and the operators said that women really like to banana flippers because they could cradle the ball you could take back shots and other stuff with them

[28:51] management wanted them on there I didn't I could confirm he didn't want them on there because he told me he didn't want them on there

[28:57] the funny thing is if you put regular flippers on it shoots really good yeah the um programmer for Stern Tim Sexton

[29:05] owned a time war for a few years this is funny right it's like it's like these 1950s guys that are like

[29:12] how do we get the ladies to like the pinball and even the quote itself which I think is probably very accurate

[29:19] right as a quote which is basically saying like the ladies who aren't very good at pinball uh like this kind of flipper because they can

[29:29] um play better like come like that is so demeaning right like oh it's 1979 man yeah right it's like oh

[29:37] there's so there's so dainty they can't they can't flip like a man it's like oh it makes me so mad when I hear that stuff

[29:44] so it's it's got some decent shots this game but it's difficult to sort of aim the shots because we're

[29:53] also used to like a regular style flipper there these shots are nowhere yeah where they usually are

[30:01] like not even remotely if you it was designed for regular flippers so if you have this game just put

[30:06] regular flippers on it it'll play good and just remember Williams time warp the profit time bomb

[30:12] oh my goodness you can do a whole podcast on just these awesome flyer things where the future and

[30:19] the past collide the action is unreal it's love it it's like nothing like a over promise and

[30:29] under deliver you know what I mean oh they sold so many of these you see these all the time for sale

[30:36] which is just a travesty oh I disagree put regular I don't every go there's a picture of it with

[30:42] regular flippers it's got five pop bumpers take that that we got multiple banks drop targets nice

[30:51] orbit shot up top very close though those drop targets there's a set of three on the left there's

[30:56] a set of five kind of in the center very close to you super close to the flipper so that's you

[31:02] know that's got some some serious action and man it's got some hungry out lanes especially the one

[31:08] on the right because there's like an orbit with a with a gate on it and that that just wants to go

[31:15] right into the top of that slanging out the right out lane very cool game it's very EM inspired I

[31:23] would say what do you think about when you think about the colors in the back glass here what's

[31:29] what's going on here what's the story the back glass or you I'm thinking more about the nudity on

[31:36] the back glass oh my time warp I think might well excluding European games because they God knows

[31:43] what they did they they put anything on the game when it comes to nudity but I they have the

[31:49] Da Vinci's dude what was it called oh you got right here vit vitroovy and man is that what is

[31:56] called that probably said that wrong maybe the only depiction of male nudity from a penval machine

[32:02] manufacturer yes he is nude like the one where the naked guys do in the jumping jacks full frontal

[32:08] it is right on the back glass but it's art it's classical art so it's one of those deals you never

[32:14] notice until someone brings it up and then you can't on see it it's like right there in your face

[32:18] and and I'll tell you what you thought you know some of Dave Christians' ballet art where it was

[32:24] very cold where where people were when that was drawn well I'll tell you what Da Vinci made that one

[32:30] who it was a chilly day I was in the pool that's time warp so it's got like different eras of time

[32:41] and then some weird guy in the middle who looks like he's for Monty Python he'd look he's sleepy

[32:48] it's very sleepy he looks like a stone yeah he looks like he's in holy grail and he's stone he's

[32:54] like where's the where's the real dude where's man where's the Doritos man it's got dinosaurs I mean it's

[33:02] a time warp you're going through time and this is like that pre-jurassic park dinosaurs so they all

[33:08] look weirdly cartoony and they're always green always green yeah because that because everybody knew

[33:14] the dinosaurs were green right I they did and the dude from the back glass is also in the center

[33:20] of the play field yep less stone looking but more grope looking he's got his big hands coming at you

[33:26] oh god I didn't even notice the hands yeah and he's there he's just like hey there let me

[33:30] let me give you a hug I wonder if he's like the time lord or something I don't know wait a minute

[33:35] time lord this is this is this is a pre-doctor who right here you I'll tell you what man you you

[33:42] you could have worked at Williams let's go let's go back to banana flippers here for a second oh no

[33:46] let's not say we did so who thought of banana flippers right whose idea was banana flippers well I

[33:52] couldn't through all my research I looked in the pinball compendium I looked on various blogs and

[33:57] interviews and nobody would say that it was their idea nor would anybody remember whose idea was

[34:03] so my assumption is that it was just such a bad idea nobody wanted ownership and everybody

[34:08] was just wanted to forget about it and then people brought it up in the 1990s at like conventions or

[34:13] shows or expose and they're like you know what I haven't thought about those crappy things in 30 years

[34:17] I can't remember make stroll the president of Williams at the time he he may have pressed for the

[34:24] curved flippers but of course that was not like him to force a feature especially if it was controversial

[34:31] he gave the designers maximum freedom when it came to designing the games so it was maybe the designer

[34:37] who came up with banana flippers now Steve Richie would make comments saying things like Mike

[34:43] could play very very well and he was always deeply involved in the engineering aspect at Williams

[34:51] so it might have been his idea but we can't really figure out whose idea it was but I'll tell you

[34:58] I'll ask you now Ron do you think banana flippers were worth it um think they were like yeah those

[35:03] are revolution I don't think they were worth it but I don't think they I mean you have disco fever

[35:08] soul a ton and time warps sold like eight thousand so they didn't really hurt the sales did they

[35:14] crazy good old Steve Richie says I adopted a philosophy about flipper placement after first

[35:18] observing pinball play in the early 70s at Atari games that had odd flipper placements generally did

[35:23] not make as much money as games that had more normal arrangements there are exceptions including

[35:28] captive fantastic but even there the basic two lowest flippers are in a very normal position and if

[35:33] anyone knows about weird flipper positioning it's those Atari games they were a mess now we're

[35:38] going to get into I would say probably want to the Barry outslers best known games and that's gorgar

[35:46] December of 1979 this is like a fantasy dungeons and dragons Satan theme yeah I always

[35:54] took it as just Satan the devil it's it's a William system six so it's a system six like say well

[36:02] firepower would be it's 14,000 units which is huge that's huge that is a massive massive selling

[36:11] unit and this must have been just gear he must have been over the moon Barry like art by the

[36:16] the by the michels again sound Eugene Jarvis this time did sound who's a newcomer to Williams and

[36:24] the other bits of the software by Paul the salt so we can see here that Barry has his go to team

[36:30] which is pretty interesting when it comes to this stuff Dan Barlow from Facebook says Gorgar was

[36:34] kind of scary when I played it as a kid in the 1970s the heartbeat sound effect added to the overall

[36:39] feel of the game it ended up becoming my first pin Gorgar was one of the first pinball machines

[36:44] I remember as a little kid it was one of the games that was in the tavern my father would go to

[36:50] they usually only have one pinball machine there and they'd have it there for a while and switch

[36:53] it out Gorgar was one of the ones that was their the longest and you had the same reaction as Dan

[36:58] I love the backlash I think that's Connie Mitchell's best backlash wow it's for good Satan

[37:05] fire and stuff I mean how can you not like Satan yes and the heartbeat thing that the sound on

[37:11] that thing is incredible flash was the first game with that dynamic background sound and that

[37:18] was why it sold so many units right to hit this drone and as you drop the target sound and got more

[37:24] points sort of the tension built and that drone got more high pitched and more exciting a lot of

[37:30] people have played meteor meteors got that dynamic background sound well Gorgar went a step

[37:37] further and really killed it when it came to its its dynamic background sound so rather than a tone

[37:44] or a noise or this just droning on and on and on and on the where the pitch got higher it was like

[37:51] a heartbeat yep and that heartbeat got faster and faster and faster and it it was it was as close to a

[37:59] heartbeat as you could get I would say in that era when it came to sound and man oh man it was it

[38:05] was Eugene Jarvis that that just killed it with this machine this was of course as you had mentioned

[38:11] the first game with speech and I'm sure many people are very disappointed to hear the disco fever

[38:18] in 1978 was the first Williams game engineered with speech and in fact a talking prototype was

[38:26] presented at the AMOA show in Chicago that year yeah they did that stuff a lot I ballie had a lost

[38:34] world that they put like a tape deck or something in so it would have speech so it so it looked like

[38:41] it was the first because a new Gorgar was coming they may have factures to do all kinds of stuff

[38:46] like that so Eugene Jarvis did this did the effects here but he didn't do the the rules programming

[38:53] of the game and this was mostly because he was still working with Steve Richie to finish fire

[38:58] power because there was no other programmers that would work with Steve Richie Eugene straddle

[39:04] both projects we've heard that before Gorgar was the first production game with speech and was first

[39:10] shown at the AMOA Expo held November 8th through the 11th 1979 Barry Alcler says at the AMOA show it

[39:18] was so loud that Sam Stern came over to tell us to turn it down because no one could hear his games

[39:24] that's an awesome awesome quote that is awesome you can't doubt you young whip a snappa

[39:29] young young impeding our sales over here we're trying to sell mammary lane very assume that

[39:35] these sales were mostly due to the sound system in the speech they decide yeah I mean that's

[39:39] that's got to draw you in right like if everything else there is just sort of make it like

[39:47] at Gottlieb and then you hear this thing not only did it have an amazing background sound but it

[39:52] it talked it said words in English that you could understand and it's seven words and the way

[40:00] Williams would do it they would just record the individual words and then just slice them together

[40:04] so it would never sound completely smooth yeah I did they did he didn't say sentences no he just said

[40:10] it was a like valley with full sentences but they had the seven words were beat you Gorgar speaks hurt

[40:19] me and got see here things like me hurt you know Gorgar speaks me got you it's antiquated but at

[40:29] the same time you're like man that's kind of cool I was wondering who did the voice I could never

[40:33] find who did the voice I asked Steve Richie and he couldn't remember he thought they might have

[40:37] hired someone like a voice actor yeah now the amusement review a magazine back in the day in its

[40:44] January and February number 198 the talking feature they said was actually optional and cost $70

[40:52] more to the operator but the majority of the units was ordered with the sound package so they

[41:01] just decided to make everyone with the sound back yeah I never seen because the speech is a second

[41:07] board that's connected to the sound board I think with a ribbon cable I'm trying to remember off the

[41:11] time I had or just a connector but it's like a little separate mini board so they'd have to

[41:15] literally not have the mini board in there they were gonna not give them the speech because of

[41:19] course this is a new technology there was a little bit of a bug in the first ROM code so a ROM is

[41:23] like a chip that plugs into the board that sort of tells one part of the machine or the other what

[41:29] to do if you inserted coins after the speech it would work but if you were like putting coins in

[41:36] kind of like during the speech it would get all confused yeah I remember seeing the sticker on some

[41:41] of the games picture of Satan and he says wait until I stop talking before inserting coins

[41:48] with so polite Satan there was a record for those who don't remember those they would come

[41:55] with like a little like a 45 of just him talking weird it was like the original deadpool oh yeah

[42:02] yeah it was basically the same thing they did for deadpool they did for Gorgar but with the album

[42:07] so how would you describe that backlash Ron one of the great backlasses I mean I'm still confused

[42:13] though if so you got the Satan guy basically have an altar with a woman on it wearing next to

[42:19] nothing of course because 70s and all you know so then we have the Gorgar and then we have these

[42:24] other dudes one is like picking up the girl I can't figure out if she's if he's saving her or if

[42:30] he's one of the Gorgar's minions he must be saving her because there's the other guy in the background

[42:35] who's like fighting he's running with a sword it's just like the Paragon backlash I was always

[42:40] confused about is the dude like attacking the woman or saving her I never could figure that or

[42:47] is he is the lion is he riding the lion or is he attacking the lion this is similar I'm

[42:53] was trying to figure out exactly what's going on in this backlash the the detail in the backlasses

[42:59] quite impressive because this is before they're doing that sort of bali for layer sort of screen

[43:06] printing backlasses this is all like lines right like this is this is some pretty impressive you think

[43:12] the backlasses good look at the play field yeah so let's let's talk about the play field a little

[43:17] bit here so the lower play field that traditional kind of Italian bottom play field it's got the

[43:25] the guy who looks like he's fighting Gorgar and the lady is like no please save me because I'm a

[43:33] stereotype of a woman and then there's another guy in the background who's fighting now this is an

[43:38] awesome awesome you know lower play field design like there's a lot of detail going on in this

[43:44] on a detail it's in it's super impressive lots of fire so you know it's good yeah so then kind

[43:51] of halfway up the play field you've got your stand up targets and then you've got a capture hole

[43:55] on the left which is really cool and then a set of offset drop targets a set of three and then you

[44:02] got an orbit spinner yeah but you this orbit spinner isn't really the best of orbit spinners right

[44:09] it's kind of a clunky that's good it's good when I play it well because you you know you're

[44:14] here at the top 1000 player here no I'm talking about playing other people's games but yeah it has a

[44:19] weird spinner rule where the the bonus has to be at a certain level between so and so and so and so

[44:24] and so and then it's lit so once you go above that bonus level it turns off yeah the upper play field

[44:31] this is where it gets exciting okay so there's Gorg set a three bank drop targets on the left

[44:38] and gar is an offset target kind of in the middle lower middle of the play field but in the back

[44:43] there's a sneak pit so what's so cool about this sneak it has a magnet and it stops the ball dead

[44:49] and then flashes it well they didn't have I don't think it's a flash or or just they blink the light bulb

[44:54] and it's like me hurt me got you great effect I would say the worst part and the the most

[45:02] disappointing thing about Gorgar is well the fact that it's Satan and I mean that's not going to

[45:09] fly in my house sadly but but this is before firepower and firepower head two amazing things about it

[45:18] one of them was multiple but the really amazing thing was lane change at the top so when you shoot

[45:24] that orbit spinner you get up into the pops in Gorgar and you roll over the lane in the top

[45:30] you can't switch the ABC lanes you're one of those whiny type players huh I am indeed so you get it

[45:37] up there and you're like you got up you know you got to nudge it nudge it not tilt and you got to

[45:41] get it up there again and it's like oh god isn't it great how that's the way it was and then they

[45:47] added late change and now in 2021 we have a game like Avengers where you have the in lane lights

[45:55] that you can't move they're not controlled and you have to hit things to move them yeah I love it

[46:00] or you have games with skillshots with the light you can't move so you have to actually try to

[46:04] get it in the right lane using nudging and skill what is what a surprise what do you think about

[46:10] the promotional poster now if you go on to the internet pinball database at ipdb.org you can look

[46:16] at all this stuff those links are in the show notes I'm thinking they hired a model for this one

[46:21] she's wearing a fur top but the top is missing the middle part yes it is as well as the sides where

[46:31] the legs are I'm not entirely sure how how that it stays on I'm sure there's tape or something but

[46:40] what does that have to do with pinball she's the woman from the back less that's what I was assuming

[46:44] and we keep calling him Satan I mean his name is Gorgar it's said then that's his name

[46:49] enter the layer of Gorgar only if you dare because that rhymes make Gorgar cry out

[46:56] challenge the snake hole oh that's that's weird escape from the monster's clutches

[47:02] do you know when it when it comes to pinball profit Gorgar speaks of monster earnings oh god

[47:09] Williams Williams I love it so cheesy it's like watching a television newscast here

[47:16] I mean if if if any of the manufacturers listen to this podcast which I'm sure of course they do

[47:22] they want to learn about history we need cool flyers again with just really cheesy quotes on them

[47:29] please yeah bring it back please so where do you think the design concept came for making a you know a

[47:38] monster fire satiny thing well Barry would say the design was the artist decision

[47:43] said the team wanted something different it wasn't supposed to be demonic but at the time

[47:47] dungeons and dragons were coming out we wanted to cash in on that with the hero saving the woman

[47:51] from the beast I guess that answers my question so he is supposed to be saving her Gorgar in his

[47:57] stance were inspired by an illustration called the underworld by Boris Valého yeah there you go

[48:05] oh okay link in the show notes yes check that out that's it's very cool because if you see

[48:12] this picture oh it is clearly a ripoff because we always joke about stern rip it off or are

[48:17] looking for quote unquote inspiration from other designers well this did very similar and and

[48:23] very close but it's you know it's a lot of people talk about Gorgar as it would have done even

[48:32] better if it wasn't sort of the way it was what Satan yeah George Gomez would say that right George

[48:38] Gomez worked on a game called state in the in the south it would have been I probably didn't

[48:43] sell well so imagine how many more units it would have been if you were blue instead of red red

[48:48] well did you know German metal band helloween's 1985 album walls of Jericho included a track titled

[48:54] Gorgar that symbolized the machine as a form of gambling addiction Barry after this massive hit

[49:02] he figured how do I humble myself and he said let's do laser ball well they had to do wide

[49:08] bodies this is this is one Williams was on their whole wide body kick and by wide bodies really wide

[49:14] bodies this was this it and I've seen I've seen a lot of these laser balls around and I don't know why

[49:21] I see so many of these because they made a lot of and people just want to get rid of them I guess

[49:26] I don't know it's outer space fantasy theme sells 4,500 units this is a William system six this is

[49:34] as you said wide body again the Mitchell's on art sound and software by Eugene Jarvis now

[49:42] this is people are like you know we don't have enough bowling themes anymore in pinball well I'll

[49:47] tell you what back then bowling theme pinball machines were all the rage and this was originally

[49:53] called Williams lanes and it was in fact a bowling theme and originally the people featured in the

[50:01] game so the art in the game were people who worked at Williams and you can actually see some of the

[50:09] prototype in the IPDB website so you can see the pre-production backlash there's like a

[50:15] Bert Reynoldsy looking fella that's why I thought it was Mike Stroll oh my god Mike Strolly looks

[50:21] like he looks like Bert Reynolds Mike Stroll the company president look like Bert Reynolds with two

[50:26] models Nancy Rudd and Nancy Tritt the the dark haired man on the left of the back glass is

[50:34] Connie Mitchell the green shirt person the green shirt man on the right is the engineering manager

[50:42] Chuck Belich the red shirt man on the right is Tony Ramuni who looks creepy so it was Williams

[50:54] it was it had like a pre-production everything was ready to go and it was bowling theme it's called

[50:59] Williams lanes let's go for something different so Connie pushed for laser ball which is lasers in

[51:08] the future thing what well if you look at the playfield so if you look at this game in the middle

[51:19] bowling pins yes they're still there so you can see that it was in fact bowling theme this also has

[51:27] this odd ladies makeup that was very reminiscent of this time it was like this futuristic

[51:38] makeup thing around the eyes and it was like colors and wings and things I don't know this this game

[51:48] it looks like it was changed at the last minute and it really does come across it does come across

[51:55] in its design as well as its art where it's just like hey quick get something out

[51:59] fill the line well especially since the same woman is on the game 10 times they just use the same

[52:07] just print it over and over and over again do you know that laser ball turns cosmic energy into

[52:14] cash oh oh no that's a bad one extra flipper for extra scoring front and programming ease that's

[52:23] interesting that basically just means you open a coin door and you can change the settings

[52:28] streak through the stars activate the force field it's actually in quote so it's like

[52:34] activate the force field trademark laser beams radiate high scoring power super good super good

[52:43] it's I don't know it's kind of neat doesn't do it for me you know I don't think I'd put a quarter

[52:48] in this oh should put quarter in everything give it a try and then play stellar wars instead if you

[52:55] need to play the ultra wide body yeah orbit spinners yeah so it's got me there if you can make it

[53:01] up there so far got a lot of drop targets that's cool I really love drop targets except for Stern

[53:06] but those pop-upers look familiar those pop-up recaps very cool it's it's a neat little you know it's

[53:11] okay I guess I mean if it's it I think the coolest feature because you got to fill in

[53:18] sort of the bottom of the play field again Barry was I guess pretty good at trying to keep that

[53:23] sort of traditional bottom of the play field but on the left and on the right it's got these

[53:27] like capture holes on the outside of the out lanes which is kind of neat and it kind of kicks it

[53:34] back up the sort of into the middle into the into the play field which is kind of cool it's kind of

[53:39] different but it's kind of it's a bit of a mess if you ask me such an opinion for a game he's never

[53:45] played exactly you Jean Jarvis of course this was his his first game where he did everything besides

[53:52] just the sound this is where he did all the rules and all that stuff and he fit a lot of stuff

[53:58] into such a small sound chip when it came to that system six chip set so he had made synthetic

[54:05] chimes actually Eugene said this was a management decision it was like management would say oh my god

[54:11] those sounds are strange people want their chimes yeah Eugene was all about those sort of strange sounds

[54:16] right like sometimes they're like let's just now that we've done something really cool let's kind of

[54:20] go back to basics chill it out a little bit I know flash has the same thing they're just I think

[54:25] they're talking about on on the system six sound boards they have like actually I think it's

[54:31] system four hasn't to there's like a little toggle switch you can toggle between the regular sound

[54:36] package and like the much simpler sound package it kind of gets more sort of basic and less I didn't

[54:41] even know this existed because I'd never heard a game on the simpler sound package yeah so this is

[54:46] we've had a dip in sales now right we've had that crazy peak of kind of gorgar flash like 45

[54:54] hundred units stellar were selling 5500 so you can see there's a bit of a dip in sales here

[54:59] over this peak that's when we get into July of 1980 with scorpion which is another super wide

[55:07] body fantasy theme sells 2000 units the michels it's only constantino conny this time with Tony

[55:15] Ramuni and software and sound by Larry de Marr who's a new team member here swinging in so scorpion

[55:24] uh you know this is the second wide body that Larry uh that Barry this is the second wide

[55:29] body that Barry has done and we've mentioned this a few times in the past that Atari had started

[55:35] making wide body machines that's all they made all the other manufacturers were super concerned that

[55:41] maybe they were on to the next big thing that they didn't want to miss out so they started making

[55:46] wide bodies but then they quickly realized they weren't fun it depends it depends such a blanket

[55:54] statement Barry out there says I was just trying to make another follow up to the last wide body I made

[55:59] I was just trying to do some other unusual stuff Atari was doing things like middle earth or something

[56:04] at the time we were just trying to come up with a similar theme the only reason I came up with this

[56:09] is that someone else was doing it and we didn't want to be left in the dust if they take off

[56:13] Atari was doing nothing but wide bodies if you don't do one and they take off you'll be the last one

[56:18] so there you go it's just they they had to do something so they're like let's try let's give her a go

[56:23] scorpion is is a fun game I was like scorpion scorpion is actually the name there's a big lizard

[56:28] lockness monster looking thing in it so you figure oh that's scorpion but it's not it's actually

[56:33] the name of the ship that's going after the lizard thing it's like a two headed creature but the name

[56:39] of the ship is actually scorpion yeah it's it's almost like a cigar boat right you'd see in like

[56:45] Miami it's kind of cool but the colors are all weird right it's got the purple sky then the green

[56:54] character and the blue at the bottom what the fire say for this one two headed earnings or something

[56:59] like that is it gonna say let's see here time time always precious seconds seconds that call for

[57:10] supreme strategy seconds that can mean the ultimate victory or devastating defeat come aboard

[57:20] the scorpion there's no time to lose and the reason that's all worded that way this game had a unique

[57:27] feature this is all Larry Demar when you start multi-ball a timer will start that counts how long

[57:35] you were in multi-ball and the longer you can be a multi-ball the more points you get at the end

[57:39] of the ball and you can't you so you're thinking like okay I'll just trap then when you trap the

[57:46] timer stops that's why it's really it's really neat programming for 19 very tomorrow he was able

[57:52] to put something in there so if you don't see switch hits happening and you're just trying to hold

[57:56] the ball the timer will stop because the first time I ever played this game and saw that's like oh

[58:01] I'll just hold the ball right no just keep going up like nope Barry again makes that more or less

[58:07] traditional bottom of the play field now the slings are much wider apart but he does have that

[58:13] in-lane out-lane traditional kind of flowing into the flippers from the outside but man

[58:20] that is one heck of a trip from that out-lane all the way down in there that is like you better stop

[58:26] and have a beer when that when that balls and the upper left I think is this first go around with

[58:31] a design element he'd use again and again he looks a little familiar you to play solar fire which

[58:38] will get to later grand lizard it's like a little part in the upper part of the play field so it's

[58:44] in this case it's not even like an upper play field it's just the upper part of the play field

[58:48] and you got two flippers and you just shoot at drop targets and there's a really cool spinner on

[58:52] the left which probably has to be the worst orbit spinner of all time except for those system one

[58:57] god leaves I guess but this little design element he will reuse I think I you know if you think of

[59:05] the Steve Richie sort of upper you know loop shot you know the the Barry out slur upper part

[59:14] play field is kind of his thing for a little while I mean of course it it wasn't like that the 90s

[59:18] but his earlier career he's used that quite a few times yeah it's kind of it's a neat little game

[01:00:45] now the next game you know this is this is where we're getting into some strange things this is

[01:00:51] this is Algar oh man was this Barry was this a Barry game this was this was a game by Tony Kramer

[01:01:01] and it's a fantasy monster theme it's September of 1980 it's a Williams 6a it's a thing

[01:01:08] 3349 units and it is a wide body well deserved the Mitchell's doing the art sound by Christina

[01:01:18] Denofrio Paul de Salt on software this was originally started by Claude Fernandez who you will

[01:01:26] remember from from a blackout as well as switching teams over to balli to make flash Gordon and

[01:01:34] stealing Steve Richie's ideas for first Steve Richie we're not saying if he did yes right and of

[01:01:40] course then this was passed off to Tony Kramer who is a another sort of Williams guy who pops up

[01:01:45] from time to time in the late in the early solace state era who just kind of swings in and does

[01:01:50] it design and swings out out why do I bring Algar well I mean it was the next one in production the

[01:01:55] other thing is it's got very low production numbers which makes it kind of neat it's one of only

[01:02:00] two system six a games yes so it has seven digit displays even though it's a system six game and

[01:02:08] it has one of the and I probably should say alien poker is the other one case people are shouting

[01:02:13] right now what's the other one it has a backlash that is um the original lion man I guess you could

[01:02:21] say this was this was the original lion man and and actually he's part of the gar family

[01:02:26] and the joke around Williams was that this was Al who was Gore's brother of course he had Algar

[01:02:33] and Gore Gar were brothers Al because Al was such a failure the entire Gar family just died

[01:02:41] that was the joke around with the Williams factory at the time this is one of the few games that I

[01:02:48] just hate oh my goodness that's a hot take but it's got two spinners it's got two spinners my

[01:02:56] podcast mate Bruce from our a slam to a podcast there I did my my plug he likes this game for some

[01:03:02] reason I don't know why it has the little space on the right in lane just like um future spot does

[01:03:12] right into the drain right into the drain but future spot is much better game yeah it's got no

[01:03:16] Italian bottom it's got the it's got the flipper that's right on the sling and then next to that is

[01:03:22] like literally like a switch and a hole that just is right down the end lane and it's got this

[01:03:28] I don't even know how you I think there's just a term for it but you hit like a captive ball and

[01:03:32] it knocks another ball back and it's like a grid I think they use the same thing on um what was it

[01:03:38] big bang bar has like the same thing it's got a couple of neat design elements one of them is that

[01:03:42] there's a three bank drop target three three drop target bank to the right of that there's like a

[01:03:48] like a 90 degree sort of turn and then that kind of goes across the play field and down the left side

[01:03:54] and then that acts as sort of the left in lane which is really weird you got to look at the pictures

[01:04:01] to actually to do this and I know we're an auditory medium and we spend a lot of time talking about

[01:04:06] how stuff is but I'm trying to paint your word picture here folks calm down what what does the

[01:04:10] flyer for this say don't buy it I don't have a flyer for this exactly they didn't it was so bad

[01:04:16] that he'd even print flyers so who was Tony Kramer so we've brought him up a couple of times and

[01:04:22] I think this is a great opportunity to bring up somebody else who swung in and out of Williams

[01:04:27] while it was dying in the early 80s who's Tony Kramer Tony Kramer was nicknamed Colonel Nutsy

[01:04:34] after his wristwatch had stopped working intermittently for the last time he screamed some

[01:04:39] profanity and through the watch as hard as he could at a plaster wall in Williams engineering

[01:04:44] so he was he was a bit of a character I guess was the best way to say it

[01:04:48] Steve Richie says the watch flew apart in a hundred pieces and we all last so hard

[01:04:52] Tony included he was Nutsy could create pinball designs faster than anyone else at Williams

[01:04:58] Tony was a great guy who made the best of a life through a tough childhood and a love for Steve

[01:05:02] Cordack who mentored him as a game designer and treated him like a son so he was he was well you

[01:05:07] could tell by this quote he was well liked he was he was a good dude despite a tough childhood which

[01:05:14] I couldn't find any information on but we'll take his word on it a lot of people said that that

[01:05:19] Algar failed because of black night black night was about to come out it was the big smash that

[01:05:26] would be another richie title well do you think that that was the reason that Algar failed uh

[01:05:32] no I have to agree with Steve Richie he says I think Al was just a dud of a game

[01:05:36] there you go so it's just a bit of a dud you know it's kind of a crappy game so because it didn't

[01:05:41] sell at all it was kind of crappy they just killed it and moved on to the next thing so Tony would

[01:05:46] actually pass away in 1992 after he was struck by a car in front of a Chicago bar the bar where he

[01:05:52] along with Steve Richie and many of the other folks in pinball at the time would often hang out

[01:05:58] his death was a tragic one and one where those in the industry who knew him took it quite hard

[01:06:04] Steve Richie would say that he actually very much misses Tony Kramer so you know that would

[01:06:10] I would say speak volumes and how uh good a person Tony was all right so this is where we get into

[01:06:17] the battle of the by-levels I'd like to call it so you've got black night that comes out and

[01:06:22] completely changes the game then you've got ballies flash Gordon and now everything's gotta be a

[01:06:27] by-level and then however is like it's like oh my god wide bodies everything's gonna be a wide

[01:06:31] body and it's like oh my god everything's gonna be a by-level so it's like it's it's funny how

[01:06:35] the industry is that way if you want to learn more about black night and by-levels and things

[01:06:39] like that and sort of the development you can check out our Steve Richie episode which was the pilot

[01:06:45] episode or you could check out our ballet 1981 episode if you want to talk about flash Gordon

[01:06:50] we've talked about those before so now we're gonna dive into jungle lord which is Barry Auslurs

[01:06:56] by-level game it is a fantasy theme from February of 81 it is a Williams system seven it sells

[01:07:03] 6,000 units so sales have picked back up again it is a by-level sort of narrow standard body game

[01:07:10] the Mitchell's on art and sound and software by Larry Demar this is a is a cool game now it has

[01:07:18] Magna saves on the outside right which is an innovation that Steve Richie had in his black night

[01:07:24] but it's done better it's done so much better basically it doesn't just stay on like you tap the

[01:07:30] thing and it just you just get it out of the outlane it pulses it so you can kind of flick it back

[01:07:36] into play or you can kind of hold it to really kind of grab it from going out of the the outline

[01:07:41] this is a unique art package for a few reasons there was that movie at the time like blue lagoon

[01:07:49] wasn't that a movie that was a movie with Brook Shields and whoever the guy was

[01:07:55] Brook Shields it was also in the pinball movie so there's a pinball connection

[01:08:00] yes exactly exactly Brook Shields and Christopher Atkins this movie it was from 1980 it has an

[01:08:08] eight on rotten tomatoes which is probably one of the worst scores I've ever seen

[01:08:14] oh so you're not eight out of ten just like eight out of what a hundred of a hundred wow okay

[01:08:19] yeah anyway it was like these these young kids that get stuck on an island right yeah yeah it's

[01:08:24] it's rolled down he's on Wikipedia right now here's the important thing budget 4.5 million box

[01:08:31] office 58.8 million sorry rotten tomatoes oh yeah it made money don't matter these two these two

[01:08:39] you know young people that get stuck on an island they fall in love it's like a love story it's

[01:08:43] I remember it was it was widely panned in a lot of movies like airplane and a bunch it was really

[01:08:49] like a big deal and this is very much the same kind of thing right there there's a man and a woman

[01:08:55] on the back glass and she's not wearing any clothes and he's not wearing any clothes and they're

[01:08:59] like hugging and it's romantic and then there's like two tigers on the left and on the right because

[01:09:06] tigers are in the jungle I guess I took it more to be just tarzan really I you know this is no I got

[01:09:11] I got a blue lagoon vibe from okay yeah the worst part though both these poor tigers is it looks

[01:09:19] like I drew them like they look horrible it's it's like you drew something and then you left it

[01:09:26] in the sun and it sort of melted a little bit it was I feel really bad for for the Mitchell's because

[01:09:32] this one just did not pan out the way it should have this was of course jungle lord crowns you

[01:09:41] king of the pinball jungle yep I will say this right now this is the best by-level game wow black

[01:09:49] black nights the best playing oh of course but this is the best overall over the Christmas holidays

[01:09:54] I board a black night from my buddy and I'll tell you what man it is a great shooter it it is so

[01:10:01] much fun going in around but the rules are kind of lacking I think the rules are not lacking with

[01:10:07] jungle lord okay so so can you give us kind of an overview I know you're not the rules guy but can

[01:10:12] you give us like a little overview open up that fire page three again it tells you all you need to

[01:10:17] know as exciting five bank double trouble who double scoring can you say multipliers you know

[01:10:27] everyone wants to know the play field multiplier there it is multi ball trademarked of course by

[01:10:31] Williams first single ball double scoring wow multiplier that bonus multiplier it goes up to 10

[01:10:38] x a drain shield basically a ball saver that's the first drain shield by the way the first well yes

[01:10:46] the first range shield I love with it because we made up the term Magna saver turns been a more

[01:10:51] correct implementation or we just pulse and you you have to earn your pulses it's it's it's pretty

[01:10:58] cool I have played jungle lord I really I kind of like jungle lord a friend of mine was asking me

[01:11:03] like hey you know there's a jungle lord for sale what do you think I'm like that's all right I guess

[01:11:08] if you can get by the fact that it's like blue lagoon and the tigers look like they're melted but

[01:11:14] you spoke a couple of moments ago about the sort of the berry out slur drop targets with flippers

[01:11:21] at the bottom and this I think perfect when it comes to where it should be and how it should be

[01:11:27] it shouldn't be kind of up in the corner of the play field it should be like an upper play field

[01:11:33] awesome has a little bag of tail bag of tail thing on the side with a buzzer the game has a buzzer

[01:11:40] so if you go through the lane you don't want to it buzzers at you I love it thank you failed

[01:11:46] brutal so nothing nothing like harassing you when you do I love it I love it more harassment the

[01:11:51] better we need more harassing games it's the the the the art on the play field is much better

[01:12:01] than the art on the back glass in my opinion it's it's much more like they're fighting off snakes

[01:12:06] at the bottom and there's this cool kind of sword kind of black knight-esque sword in the middle

[01:12:11] super neat that way it seems like quite the effort to work on one of these by-level games right

[01:12:18] if you get if you got to get up under there is it a lot of work it seems difficult uh it be more

[01:12:23] difficult in a valley because Williams actually would cut them from two different sheets of plywood

[01:12:30] as opposed to valley you just used what basically took a regular play field and just would chop it

[01:12:34] and then put the one part on top and the other part in the bottom like you can go under the

[01:12:38] upper play field on these so you have to that I think my original black knight has some kind of

[01:12:44] connector though so you can it's still a pain of loosening everything and get the upper play field up

[01:12:50] but you can remove it yeah there's so the the bag of tail on the left side is kind of an

[01:12:54] interesting feature it's basically a lock a ball in the in the kicker on the right side right and

[01:12:59] then it yep sort of the idea is the ball is shrunk it does a cool light show and it fires the

[01:13:04] little the ball it's a small ball and then a bag of tail and you're trying to get all four lanes

[01:13:10] if you go through a lane you already went through you get the buzzer sound and it now it's got a

[01:13:15] there's a lot of plastic on here there's a lot of plastics on this entire machine which is

[01:13:20] really impressive because nowadays it's like they they try to minimize the amount of plastic

[01:13:24] all these game black knight has a ton of plastics on it because you got the two play fields so

[01:13:28] it's like you can put more plastics it's it's it's a it's a cool little game would you buy one what

[01:13:33] would you pay for one of these you say it's the best by-level game oh oh 1500 okay maybe I go

[01:13:41] up to 2000 was really nice it was a nice one okay really nice one I mean it's and they made a

[01:13:46] ton they made a ton of them and they usually they're usually not that expensive of course I should say

[01:13:50] that because now they will be but they're usually reasonably priced I know and and that's mostly

[01:13:55] reasonably priced because the fact that it looks like it's creepy tarzan like my wife when she

[01:13:59] first played this she saw this and she's like oh that's a really fun game she's like but I'd have

[01:14:03] to like knit little sweaters and stick it on the back glass to cover up the nipples and it had

[01:14:09] so it's one with a two different color cabinet also okay yes so because usually they were all black

[01:14:13] right and they just sort of stencil something on them well no they were well they originally whatever

[01:14:17] color they were this actually has two different versions there's an earlier version and a later

[01:14:22] I'm trying to remember which one it was red and blue I don't remember which one was the

[01:14:26] whatever the one you see the most of that's the one that was the second one yeah I think it's

[01:14:31] the blue one the one that I've seen the most is the blue one so that brings us to sort of the next

[01:14:36] by-level game and that was Pharaoh by Tony Kramer by Tony Kramer again this is May of 1981 it is an

[01:14:44] Egyptian theme sells 2500 units into the William system seven this does the art by Shamest

[01:14:50] McGlockland and sound by Tony Collerck Kotlerick Kotlerick oh my god we're sorry software by Chris

[01:15:01] Omar Zoo Omar Zoo who the heck are these people like this this seems like a fill the line game if

[01:15:09] I've ever seen one right it was like the it was like an eclectic random group of people like and

[01:15:15] and once we don't normally see it has the largest upper play field of the Williams by-levels I

[01:15:23] don't really like the bag of tell thing in jungle lord like the rules might be better or whatever

[01:15:28] but I think this is the kind of the most fun one because it's got these like looping capture areas

[01:15:34] which are really cool it's why I love pinball because of the opinions you see to me this is the

[01:15:39] least fun really oh yeah well it's got three drop targets it's got kind of a looping capture it's

[01:15:46] got two up kicker two uh crank up the sound on this one and tell me you're not going to want to kill

[01:15:50] someone soon that okay so that's raw raw and it's it's background noise I went to a pinball show

[01:15:58] once actually no it was multiple times Pacific pinball expo would always have a Pharaoh there and

[01:16:03] they would crank it up for some reason and that's all you would hear in the one section of the floor

[01:16:07] what's the other thing it says cobras yeah that's it cobras yeah that's it uh you hear that on stream

[01:16:14] from time to time and you're like what is going on over there it okay well I think it has some

[01:16:20] pretty cool art it's got like the Pharaoh in the lower play field it's kind of neat and the back

[01:16:25] glasses really cool so it's got like the Pharaoh he's riding the horse and he's got like a lady

[01:16:32] next to him uh the the the horse they have weird hair they have like afros or something it's weird

[01:16:41] the horses are very oddly designed it's very strange looking hair um if you look carefully you

[01:16:50] could probably see something in there like lady duff but I mean it's just top and then here's

[01:16:58] like the bottom oh yeah okay uh yes wow you know I never saw that all these years it's it's pretty

[01:17:06] wild little backlash and it's really good with the theme I mean it has the music is is you know

[01:17:13] like you would expect it to be yep everything matches the theme would you say it's a

[01:17:19] world underglass no I wouldn't but you you can say that

[01:17:24] okay most overused terms cliche yeah so I mean that's kind it's kind of a cool game it's cool it's kind

[01:17:32] of cool but you see we're when we get to the next you have black knight three ball multi-ball speech

[01:17:41] then you have jungle lord jungle lord you have you know multi-ball you have speech you have bagatell

[01:17:48] you have all this stuff going on pharaoh you got the multi-ball and speech but when we get to the next one

[01:17:55] no more speech do expensive then we get into berry I think berries best layout that's

[01:18:01] controversy comment solar fire and it's wrong but yes solar fire it's a sci-fi theme June of 81

[01:18:08] system seven Williams it's seven hundred and eighty two units oh hard one to come by it is a

[01:18:14] by-level standard body the michels on art again they're just machines sound and software by Ed

[01:18:22] Sochi of course video is really really taking off at the moment when we're talking June of 81

[01:18:30] like really take a defender is out now it is selling like gangbusters you got defender we got

[01:18:38] Pac-Man is out docky Kong is out selling 4,000 units I would say between 1981 and 1984 was pretty

[01:18:46] pretty hard stuff to do and you can see here that this just this fell right off like right off you go

[01:18:54] from 13,000 units like 12 months before to like less than a thousand which is pretty crazy and I think

[01:19:01] solar fire is super cool personally I think this is a great game I've never played one

[01:19:08] it could probably be the worst game ever but when I look at this I'm like man this is this looks

[01:19:13] cool it looks like they've refined by-level why should I buy this what does the flyer say

[01:19:18] do I have do I have um profits out of this world oh here you go here you go sizzling play hot

[01:19:26] profits suddenly a terrifying explosion rips through the sun and reaching fires burned out of

[01:19:32] control the red hot solar fire spawned a demonic breed of alien a breed never before known to man

[01:19:40] your mission to fight off the alien menace and extinguish the fires that feed their powers wow

[01:19:47] I didn't know that was the whole I knew idea that was the uh I am look line and sink wow I'm totally

[01:19:53] changed my mind now yeah you have the flash bank the black hole the alien eject the solar target

[01:20:01] the solar gun the solar gun the solar gun the solar gun is funny the solar gun is actually a

[01:20:10] doodle which Williams had um I don't think they patented but they were no further they'd had several

[01:20:16] doodle bug games where they had a doodle bug love bug um dipsy doodle and they use what they call

[01:20:23] the the doodle it was just a ball with a magnet and with the magnet would pulse and the ball would go

[01:20:29] up and down in a little space a lot of people will know that from um fireball to fireball to has it

[01:20:35] which that's why I don't think Williams patented because it's in a ballet game but this I think

[01:20:39] was the last time that Williams used it now this is again a by-level game on the top it has that

[01:20:44] you know drop targets in front of the flippers I think the reason that this game draws me in is

[01:20:53] the theme is pretty cool but I think it's the fact that there's only two exits to the upper

[01:21:00] playfield so I feel like I'll spend more time up there and get my money's worth in comparison

[01:21:04] to something like black night where you're kind of unmatched on the edge all the time now if you

[01:21:08] look at the upper playfield and solar fire and say you know I think I've seen that before you did

[01:21:13] this grand lizard it's almost the exact same upper the upper part of the playfilling grand lizard

[01:21:20] is literally a copy of this it was too good not to use it it's too good not to use again

[01:21:25] I mean it's only sold like it's sold less than a thousand units nobody saw it anyway right it's the

[01:21:29] same same loop targets same same spot and there's so many so many drop targets there's three um offsets

[01:21:35] on the bottom and three on the on the left side then up at the top of the upper playfield there's

[01:21:41] there's like another three targets on the left and there's five five four in the front

[01:21:45] drop targets as far as the eye can see it's got cool sound no no speech though we had to cut that

[01:21:51] so it doesn't talk you can't hear the aliens that you're battling yes you just have to imagine them

[01:21:58] now when you look at the backlash something really strikes me there it's red well it's red but when

[01:22:05] you look at those machines when you look at the ships it's totally a ripoff of Battlestar Galactica

[01:22:12] and the Silons their Silon ships from the original Battlestar Galactica back 70s totally a ripoff

[01:22:19] of that the other interesting thing is it actually has a flasher actually might have more than one

[01:22:23] behind the back glass well the first games I can remember that actually had that so when it

[01:22:28] doesn't explode you need a flasher going off in the in the back box looks cool this is what the

[01:22:32] power of theme does to me and this is why I think there's stern is so successful if you put a

[01:22:39] jungle lord and solar fire next to each other I am all in on solar fire right I I would be like

[01:22:45] man this is right up my it could be a crappy game so if we swap them so solar fire became jungle

[01:22:51] lord so now the bag of tell is like the solar gun that is in my living room boo okay wow you go

[01:22:56] super important with the theme I'm telling you it's it's exactly how it goes and I and it you

[01:23:02] know I'm sure it's probably still like this era of pinball is very different than today's era of

[01:23:07] pinball like even sort of crappy pinball back then is still pretty fun all of the games of the

[01:23:11] era are mostly like do the thing and if you ever play this in a tournament just go to the top

[01:23:16] and shoot those drop targets over and over and over so we're moving this is where pinball is

[01:23:23] dying now oh it's it's hurting we're getting pounded by the video game so yeah this is

[01:23:30] barra kora we're talking September of 81 we're moving into the fall here it's a sci-fi theme it's a

[01:23:37] William system seven sells 2,350 units we're back to the standard bodies the design here Roger sharp

[01:23:45] Steve Epstein and Barry Austler art by Doug Watson sound is off we're by Ed Sochi we spoke about a

[01:23:52] fellow named hr geiger back when we spoke about uh space invaders from balean are in our class of

[01:24:01] 81 podcast he was a Swiss artist very popular in the mid 70s and he was really the inspiration for

[01:24:10] the design style of the movie alien the back glass of this game is clearly his painting called

[01:24:19] Lee one if you look at that if you look at that painting it is the barra kora back glass

[01:24:26] so that's where that inspiration comes from could say inspiration I could say completely ripped off

[01:24:32] uh tomato tomato well this this dog Watson the artist remember he's the one who did quick silver

[01:24:38] which is almost a direct copy of a heavy metal magazine cover pretty popular in the pinball world

[01:24:45] to sort of take a look at what's cool and what's different and what's out there and this is a

[01:24:50] prime example of that and this hr hr geiger was quite the nut if you look at him just go he's worth

[01:24:56] a googlin folks he's totally worth a googlin don't do it late at night when you've when you've had

[01:25:02] you know an antipesto because you'll probably have weird nightmares uh there's a couple of really

[01:25:08] interesting bits and pieces here about barra kora so I mean of course uh Doug drew the predatory

[01:25:15] fish morphing model um with sort of like landscape of teeth and he called this female character

[01:25:22] barra kuda and he presented this drawing to Mike straw who was of course the president of

[01:25:28] Williams who liked the art but felt that barra kuda kind of had a negative connotation why is it

[01:25:35] because of the heart song I get that you mean the best song ever written whoa okay take that imagine

[01:25:42] by john leiden okay like he would he and a few other people sort of kind of started kicking around

[01:25:49] alternate names during a meeting that's when dug Watson suggested barra kora as the woman's name

[01:25:55] and Mike thought that that was great he loved it so dug decided to then discreetly put a bunch of

[01:26:03] naked barra koras on the playfield so if you look at the play field in a couple of different spots

[01:26:09] that's when now the character of course is less sort of human and more alien so he pushed that bar

[01:26:17] and and and made sort of a naked alien fish lady yeah remember if it's not skin it's fine

[01:26:24] exactly I think we went through that on the um the stern episode with viper you can do the

[01:26:30] nudity as long as it's metal exactly so there's a couple of different names in here uh a couple of

[01:26:38] names I don't think anybody has ever heard in the pinball uh you know hobby I don't think anybody

[01:26:44] who's ever listened to this pinball podcast today has ever heard of a man named Roger sharp so who

[01:26:49] do you who is Roger sharp for those who have been under a rock since the 1970s is a man save pinball

[01:26:56] yeah thank you for that is a magazine writer for gq you also wrote a book about pinball called I

[01:27:01] believe pinball it's got the probably the the greatest mustache in pinball could we all agree on

[01:27:07] that yeah I'd say so I mean you got you got you got uh you got David Vicks he's probably got the

[01:27:12] second best mustache in pinball and uh Roger was the basically the main licensing guy for Williams

[01:27:18] in the uh I think starting in around the mid mid 80s through the 90s yeah when licensing

[01:27:23] store to started to become the thing and he's still doing licensing for pinballs to this day

[01:27:29] Roger's Roger's pretty great guy he was recently on the last a couple of episodes of the super

[01:27:34] awesome pinball show with Christopher Fanchi and uh Christian line who of course were nominated for

[01:27:41] a pinball industry award this year part of that is because of some of their really great interviews

[01:27:46] you can catch that on on episode 23 and episode 25 super great conversation list now there's also

[01:27:54] another name here this is one that people may not know quite as well as Roger sharp and that Steve

[01:28:00] Epstein and who was he well if you're in the northeast you know who's David Epstein is and he ran

[01:28:05] the Broadway arcade New York City for years and years and years he's a co-founder of Papa and he

[01:28:10] recently passed away unfortunately during this whole covid thing you are a survivor of cancer or

[01:28:18] somebody who has had cancer has affected your life swing on over to silver ball swag uh and you

[01:28:25] can get a flippin off cancer shirt which goes towards cancer research and that of course how Steve

[01:28:31] had passed away very quickly originally and this is according to Roger sharp from an episode of pinball

[01:28:38] profile hosted by Jeff Tiollis uh that is in the episode link is in our show notes originally this

[01:28:46] game was designed by Roger sharp Steve Epstein and it was Las Vegas it had a roulette wheel under the

[01:28:53] play field and uh Roger and Steve worked on the ideas and the rules and then they passed it off

[01:29:00] to Williams now there's a great little write up about barra cora in the pinball compendium book

[01:29:06] which you can find on amazon where Roger as he normally does writes a very long blurb when asked

[01:29:14] a very simple question god bless him and he basically talks about how at this time uh Williams was

[01:29:21] sort of looking for for people to kind of do some designs and they had approached Roger a few times

[01:29:26] because he was very much part of the pinball uh the the founder of the pinball media if you will

[01:29:32] and of course he approached Steve and they said okay well let's let's kind of have some fun and make

[01:29:36] a design and Roger would pop up quite a few times for companies like game plan even doing designs

[01:29:42] is not right that's correct the layout wasn't as good as Roger and Steve kind of wanted they needed

[01:29:47] some tweaks so it was Barry who helped them out on that design a few months later they would return

[01:29:53] to Williams and see their basic play field layout but a completely different game it was no longer

[01:29:58] Las Vegas it had become barra cora Barry would say that the layout wasn't really that good

[01:30:03] according to Barry there were a lot of changes from the early design that Roger and Steve put together

[01:30:09] but they're still given design credit because a lot of the rules and a lot of it is still their

[01:30:13] machine now it is a favorite especially in the tournament scene everyone loves some barra cora now

[01:30:18] why is it a why is it a tournament scene favorite the rules it has like the one feature that Roger

[01:30:25] really wanted to put in there that is in there is the is the double lanes like it has a set of lanes

[01:30:30] on top so and it has the inserts above them but then it has another set of inserts and you can move

[01:30:36] the lights one one row is moved by the right flipper the other move rows moved by the left flipper

[01:30:41] okay which I really can't they give any other games that do that so one increases one increases one

[01:30:46] thing any other increases another thing it's also got a really cool orbit that goes up where you

[01:30:50] spell barra cora and it has their control drop targets too so like the memory drop targets yeah very

[01:30:57] stern ask influence there which is always cool it's got a really cool art package it's got a it's

[01:31:02] got a wonderful orbit spinner yeah and you love orbit spinners it's great so good it's a very

[01:31:10] kind of cool theme and game it's unique I've never played one I have a friend of mine he loves

[01:31:15] this game like he just if he could find one of these he is it is in his collection and it's never

[01:31:20] going away which I find quite interesting the you could tell that pinball is hurting so the lane

[01:31:28] change thing I was talking about they actually trademarked it's called multi lane change wow wow

[01:31:34] I wonder if that's still copyrighted if you try to use that you get sued Williams they were

[01:31:41] they were all about their trademarks they were like the deep root of their time if they came

[01:31:46] up with a term they trademarked that so fast yeah multi ball forever that's why none of the other

[01:31:51] companies had multi ball you just you just got multiple balls but it wasn't called multi ball

[01:31:56] we're seeing a significant change in the language of their marketing this one is is sad

[01:32:04] in the way that it is marketed it's affordable reliable and fully loaded the 1982 Williams

[01:32:12] so it doesn't say like there's no like go fishing for profits because it's a fish or anything it's

[01:32:18] it's yeah it's like it's like hey this won't break uh and it's cheap and it's got lots of stuff in it

[01:32:25] single simple single level plea field design reliable it's a bit of a bummer but that's that that

[01:32:31] is the world in which we're living pinball is dying no speech too expensive all right should we

[01:32:37] get into this this is a pretty sad time here in 1982 pinball is struggling everybody is all the money

[01:32:43] is going into video all these new cool themes like your robatrons and you know stargate and

[01:32:50] tari is dominating with really fun things like missile command and there's so much cheaper to operate

[01:32:57] you just plug a man in the go that's basically it that's when Steve Richie's hyper ball kind of

[01:33:03] comes out it's like a video game pinball machine so immediately all of the other manufacturers

[01:33:12] just freak out and of course like wide bodies by levels and now shooty pinbally games every

[01:33:22] manufacturer's got to do one yeah they have the belly of the pack man game that was part pinball

[01:33:28] part video even got leave had caveman oh I played that that is the worst thing I've oh my god

[01:33:34] that is so bad don't even remind me wow violent reaction there oh my god it's so bad if you see

[01:33:40] that machine even if it's in like a bar just like burn it run wow trust me the opinions expressed

[01:33:47] by david danis or not necessarily those so that's when spell binder came out now this and it was

[01:33:53] never released this is a machine that Barry worked on and it was basically Barry's version of hyper

[01:33:58] ball so I'll mention it I don't have anything on it but it was in there then there's cosmic gun

[01:34:04] fight this is now we're into the summer of 1982 it's a sci-fi theme it's a system seven sells a

[01:34:11] thousand units dog Watson and Larry day who I think is a fantastic pinball artist uh sound and

[01:34:17] software by a new fellow bill footsyng reader not in one is new to Williams but not new because we

[01:34:23] we talked about him on the stern episode he was at stern originally cosmic gunfight the 25 cent

[01:34:29] solution oh come on there's got to be better flyer material than that cosmic gunfight has everything

[01:34:34] you want in a pinball and less I assume they're talking about the price I guess so hold on hold on

[01:34:40] here so it's got on the flyer it goes the everything so cosmic gunfight is not only has all the features

[01:34:47] proven to be the strongest with multi lane change multi ball bonus multiplier extra ball it also

[01:34:54] introduces a brand new attraction cosmic ball making all the ABC lights awards cosmic ball for 30 to

[01:35:02] 99 seconds of unlimited balls after the last regular ball time is added by completing the

[01:35:09] three bank or by extending multi ball play and during cosmic ball making each three bank in sequence

[01:35:17] scores a special and then it goes dot dot dot and less cosmic gunfight is the 25 cent solution for

[01:35:25] the pinball playing purist and for those locations that require a variety of games less complicated

[01:35:31] easier to understand its simplicity makes it a sure fire winner affordable to buy and to play

[01:35:36] cosmic gunfight is priced for profit woo they are panicking yeah they use the multi lane change

[01:35:43] again but they did a different than in barricora they actually have two sets of lanes on the right

[01:35:48] and left and you control the lanes on the right with the right flipper and left with the left flipper

[01:35:53] which is cool it's kind of neat it's got two sets of lanes it's got a grid it's got the upper

[01:35:58] lanes on the left side and it's got upper lanes on the right side but they they don't sort of connect

[01:36:02] oh and a two ball multi ball it's got a cool little art package it's like space men riding horses

[01:36:08] it's yeah cowboys in space right riding mechanical space horses now originally this was called dragon

[01:36:15] fly which was a spacey dragon fly man theme the art didn't test well and and if you look at it yeah

[01:36:23] yeah it no it's a whole thing you can see that on ipdb it's like a it's like a man who's also a dragon

[01:36:31] fly for arms like the see through insect arms he's purple yeah it's got like a huge bush no comment

[01:36:39] um so you can see why they changed it and I think they changed it really I think the theme they

[01:36:44] went with is actually very cool I love it it's got four pop bumpers which is kind of neat the only

[01:36:48] issue is uh in tournament play I hate to keep saying that it's right orbit that's all you you

[01:36:52] don't shoot anything else you just shoot the right orbit yeah it suffers from a lot of the games

[01:36:57] at this time where it's like not only is it do the thing it's like there's literally only one thing

[01:37:01] I'm not a tournament player but I I play in small tournaments locally and that's mostly because I

[01:37:06] want to meet people and I want to play pinball on machines that I don't normally get to play on

[01:37:11] and that usually comes goes with the tournament tournament crowd but I'll tell you once you sort of

[01:37:16] learn some of the things about these games that you love it completely ruins them it can

[01:37:21] because you get on there and you're like oh I'm flipping the ball and I'm getting the extra ball

[01:37:25] and I'm doing this you're like I can never really get anywhere with the bonus multiplier and then

[01:37:29] somebody goes oh yeah just shoot the right orbit all day and you'll get like five billion and you're

[01:37:33] like oh man you ruined it for me come on Ron but I love the art in this game cowboys in space yeah

[01:37:42] it's the if you can get like a backlash and just put it on your wall you know that's where it's at

[01:37:46] Barry says the art department submitted the cosmic gunfight artwork I had to make a few revisions to

[01:37:51] the title into the theme with the play field in the end it worked out pretty well I guess we were

[01:37:55] the first cowboys and aliens so then they moved on October of 82 so even now you can see that there's

[01:38:02] a huge space in between their releases too right like they're not releasing on a monthly or

[01:38:07] bi-monthly schedule there's more space in here they went with a game called warlock love warlock

[01:38:14] the reason I bring this one up again sci-fi theme I'm all in right uh 369 units by Mike

[01:38:22] Cuban, Shamist McLaughlin on art, Sound and Software by Carrie Colker it has some of the worst art

[01:38:30] I have ever seen which is why I wanted to make sure I included it as well as this machine is

[01:38:36] pretty much a direct ripoff of blackout oh it's like the direct copy of blackout yep slight

[01:38:41] modifications but uh it's blackout with a better rule set you can't you can't rip off clawed for

[01:38:47] Nandes oh clawed that's clawed for Nandes's gimmick is ripping people off so you can't rip him off

[01:38:53] the basic rules are you have the three spinners and then you have three drop target banks each is

[01:38:58] associated with the spinner that's by it so if you hit the bank down it increases the value of

[01:39:03] that's better and the whole game is just hitting spinners it's awesome it's got the cool William

[01:39:08] Sound and everything else I am a fan so uh Mike a Shamist McLaughlin would say in the back glass

[01:39:15] there are two faces that are it's really kind of creepy down on the bottom right in the clouds

[01:39:21] those faces are the face of himself and the designer Mike Cuban uh Mike Cuban Cuban Cuban

[01:39:29] so this is again that's that's uh similar uh rules to meteor right where you're kind of building

[01:39:38] uh you're hitting drop targets and you're building up those spinners so you can certainly see that

[01:39:42] uh the the the influence that Mike would bring from stern into Williams uh speaking of stern

[01:39:49] where was stern in 1982 stern electronics not in a good place basically dead right yeah it's

[01:39:55] probably orbiter one action going on and yeah so that's why we're seeing this sort of the stern

[01:40:01] designers you know jump and ship that's why Mike is here video is just on a tear so what do you

[01:40:07] got to do you got to you got to do video game tie-ins right of course you do got a cash in on the on

[01:40:13] the branding and defender just killed it for Williams so in December of 1982 the sci-fi theme Williams

[01:40:22] system seven came out selling 369 units designed by Joe Kamenkao the Mitchels on art and carry

[01:40:30] culker on sound and software and of course it's not a good game no I disagree disagree completely

[01:40:39] if you can find one that actually works that's the one problem that's that's the first problem

[01:40:45] I it took me playing a couple several of them before I found one it was a fantastic that actually

[01:40:50] everything worked on it and as all the defender sounds in it so it just sounds great immediately so

[01:40:57] you got that taken care of it has a cool lock shot which you can only hit from the upper flipper it

[01:41:02] has I think I don't know at least five single drop targets that pop up all around the playfield

[01:41:09] think like cactus canyon and it's just it's super cool and it's it's like complicate here's a smart

[01:41:16] bomb I think on it I think it has an extra button on the side and you hit like just like on the game

[01:41:21] you hit you know smart bomb Joe Kamenkao would say that the smart bomb Ian Jurassic Park the

[01:41:26] daddy East was directly inspired by the smart bomb from defender the other thing about this game

[01:41:30] I know it's it's got some extra complexity in it because I remember when they were coming out with

[01:41:38] new boards to replace like your old Williams boards like aftermarket stuff you'd always had

[01:41:44] hyperball and defender listed as like special configuration so there's there's special stuff going

[01:41:49] on with that game yeah so what has landers pod smart bombs mutants swimmers and player after player

[01:41:58] after player lining up to take the challenge defender of course so what's what's interesting about

[01:42:05] defender is that it has this very familiar back box that everybody had back then yeah it's

[01:42:12] it's the hyperball back box oh the hyperball back box they had a ton of those so because of the

[01:42:18] hyperball game which was Steve Richie's gun shooting game had this weird thing they thought they

[01:42:25] were going to sell 40,000 of these you had like so many extras so because you've got all of these

[01:42:31] things you've got to put them in a pin right it's almost like a it's like a DMD back box but the DMD

[01:42:38] is like this weird cover where a DMD would be it's very oddly shaped it's yeah it's like but it

[01:42:44] has like a panel like a speaker panel yep there was a game called rat race which was there was a big

[01:42:48] novelty craze at the time that Barry Osor worked on it was a chronic concept there was the head-to-head

[01:42:54] Joost game that sold 400 units in April great game that's another great game if you could find one

[01:43:01] working again I've seen them at shows and they usually will not last till the end of the show before

[01:43:07] they break yeah but I'd say out of all of the head-to-head because there's been a lot of head-to-head

[01:43:12] pinball concepts through the years that the Joost one was the best it it right yep and it has a

[01:43:18] completely different rules set for single ball play for single player play it's another cool thing

[01:43:24] it does but if you want to talk cost-cutting let's get to time fantasy there was the three pack

[01:43:30] right so the three pack of games that were marketed together were warlock defender and time

[01:43:37] fantasy and time fantasy was good old-fashioned pinball at a good old-fashioned price which just

[01:43:47] sounds horrible surrealistic fantasy theme and a kaleidoscope of colors it looks like someone

[01:43:53] who was stoned when they made it it looks like it's like a little frog man it's it's a snail it's

[01:43:59] a snail get it right it's a snail we call it snail but it's the snail's got legs and arm yep it's

[01:44:05] a snail though simplicity of play attracts players of all skill levels simplicity of playfield

[01:44:11] assures reliable operation yeah that's basically saying there's nothing in this game there is

[01:44:18] nothing in that game if you if you want a laugh won't bore you with it here but download the

[01:44:24] manual for this and look at the solenoid table where it has the I don't know 22 possible solenoids

[01:44:30] you could have on their system and the total amount of solenoids on this game you have three pop

[01:44:36] bumpers I'm not going to include the flippers because there are always three pop bumpers the two

[01:44:41] slings and the out hole kicker that's it oh my god that's it there nothing else in here this is

[01:44:48] like a system one got leave it so bad but it has a quirky little fun to it because it has something

[01:44:54] that I don't think any other game had the whole object when you play this well at least in

[01:44:59] the tournament so there's a little tunnel if you remember Phoenix the little little

[01:45:04] Alcere tunnel there this is it's on the left and it has a strobing it has four inserts that's a

[01:45:11] time t i m e and it strobes and you want to hit the target when one of them is lit and you get it

[01:45:17] and if you can spell time it will start a I think is like a 30 second ball saver okay and the whole

[01:45:23] the whole game is you want to do that started and then drain and then plunge up to the top lanes

[01:45:28] there's five lanes and you want to get those lanes inter controllable so you want to complete the

[01:45:33] the lanes as many times as you can during the 30 seconds and continually drain over and over and over

[01:45:39] and that's the game at least when you play in the tournament that's the game and we affectionately

[01:45:43] call it snail snail time that's when you get the ball saver it's called snail time it's like it's

[01:45:49] got all these like mushrooms yep and like rainbows yeah it is this cross cut as you could possibly

[01:45:57] me it's like it is it is something else yeah the snail dude is on the plastic and he's like

[01:46:04] standing with these crazy eyes yeah because he's stone oh man even this psychedelic right in the

[01:46:11] thing man no wonder parents thought that like these were the corruptors of youth what but this

[01:46:19] game was very popular among parents that's the funny thing because it's like a cartoon or something

[01:46:25] now because it was in your notes and I read that great quote by Ed Sochi the programmer testing was

[01:46:32] interesting and showed us something we didn't expect the game was played by an older audience

[01:46:37] we were told their parents were playing the game while their children were playing all the ticket

[01:46:40] vending machines wow even then it tested well in the family centers but it didn't do so well in

[01:46:45] locations for hardcore gamers I do remember that there was an earnings report showing the game made

[01:46:49] over five hundred dollars for a week on one location however it just wasn't mainstream and didn't

[01:46:54] perform well in all locations so then there was a bunch of canceled projects between eighty three and

[01:46:59] eighty four pinball's dead Williams is dead you've guardian starfight starlight which they actually

[01:47:06] made a hundred of and of course because I mean I have played it it's it's it's okay it also it

[01:47:13] forced me to make a correction oh my I have to make a correction so I asked this question all the

[01:47:17] time is one of the trivia questions I always asked to name the three Williams system nine games which

[01:47:23] that's just the the board said it used say I system one two three four but you know as we've been

[01:47:29] going over your system set we're on system seven right now and the answer is always it's always

[01:47:34] space shuttle sorcerer and comment however starlight even though they only made a hundred of them

[01:47:42] there are system nine starlights huh so I guess I have to amend that question because it was a

[01:47:48] production game and they did make them it wasn't like there were only prototypes they did make some

[01:47:53] that were system nine it's like a wizard theme thing if I remember it has a ton of rollovers in

[01:47:58] the middle of the play field if I remember it has the laser balls rollovers in the same spot yeah

[01:48:03] for the bowling pins but it has an orbit spinner so you would like yes it's all I need it's really

[01:48:08] it's super they started going the stern route to where the play field I mean the cabinet doesn't even

[01:48:13] have game related artwork it literally just has the Williams W on it that's when you know it starts

[01:48:19] to get bad when we're not even going to bother with custom yeah we're using all those leftover

[01:48:24] cabinets now we're not even putting a decal or a piece of metal on the on the bottom is just a blank

[01:48:30] this time 19 for the video game market is collapsing everything everything is collapsing this could

[01:48:36] be the end whatever will happen pinball's dead Williams is dead and every company was struggling

[01:48:43] to survive in the industry sales fell off the cliff for years after a massive expansion as we

[01:48:50] mentioned before you're selling things like black night with 13,000 units and now you're

[01:48:55] cancelling projects because you can't even sell a thousand units pinball is laying off everyone

[01:49:00] is becoming all too common that the pinball industry just starts spiraling pinball machines began

[01:49:09] having less and less innovation as well as less and less of the innovations of past years investment

[01:49:17] in people and technologies all but stopped in pinball Ron can anything save pinball well very

[01:49:25] else I'll have something to say about that he's going to make a game that's going to keep the lights

[01:49:29] on that's going to set the stage for the next resurgence of pinball starting in the mid 80s

[01:49:36] but that's story is for another time that's right that's the end of our podcast of pinball is dying

[01:49:44] part one Williams in the early 80s there's a lot of cool games in there even even those stripped

[01:49:51] down ones a lot of them are still fun to play I I think they they were doing better than a lot of

[01:49:57] manufacturers as far as some of the stuff they were doing let's put it that way diamonds in the rough

[01:50:02] there but even the rough itself it's very shiny and pretty barricara I mean there's some good games
